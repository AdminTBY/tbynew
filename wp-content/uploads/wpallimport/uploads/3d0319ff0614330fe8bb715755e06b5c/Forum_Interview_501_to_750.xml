		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The curriculum in Colombia is not typically designed for real-life skills. To be successful, skills such as speaking, listening, and teamwork are needed—things we encourage from pre-school and lower elementary onward. Here, we emphasize teamwork. In general, though, students are not exposed to real cooperative learning in the design of their classes or lesson plans. After 20 years of education, many have still not learned how to successfully and effectively work in teams with the skills needed to be successful in any company, or even neighborhood or larger country, for that matter. The huge curriculum challenges in Colombia's educational system cannot be assessed through a standardized test. Companies will not hire a manager or a CEO through a multiple-choice test, so we do not do that for teachers either. We also expose students to adversarial relationships so they learn how to communicate with other people from a young age rather than perpetuate conflicts that have been around for so many years.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>CNG was an educational pioneer when the school started back in 1938. We were the first school in Colombia to provide bilingual and bicultural education. The major bottleneck to advancing more and better bilingual education programs in Colombia lies in producing enough high-quality bilingual teachers. We are one of the few educational institutions with a bilingual teacher education/training program. We train approximately 40-80 bilingual teachers in conjunction with íšNICA University every semester; however, the need in this country far outpaces the availability of bilingual educators. That is the major challenge. For those of us who are highly involved in bilingual teacher education, we are able to have highly fluent teachers making an impact on kids every day, but we are the exception to the rule. Although the Colombian government is focused on this bilingual education initiative, there is a great need for bilingual teachers, while supply falls short of what is necessary. We have to put together a systematic approach to teacher education in order to produce quality bilingual teachers to fill that need.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>For the past 50 years, Colombia has worked hard to make education more accessible, which has been one of our main challenges. Today, education is geographically much more widely available, particularly in the main urban centers, but the question is now about the quality or level of education. Colombia needs to focus on training high-level teachers and educators. We need to increase our competitiveness on an international level. Gimnasio Moderno has shown that this is possible, as we have produced a number of notable alumni in many different sectors. There is also another more general issue about preparing excellent citizens for the country. Corruption has been a plague on Colombia for a long time, and this is a long-term issue about educating people, starting from when they are children, on how to be positive players in society. Our educational institutions also need to address our growing problem with polarization.<br></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>2017 is important for the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. This is a public university, and we have a presence throughout Colombia. Universidad Nacional de Colombia is the only university with a nationwide presence. To celebrate our 150th anniversary we have arranged a seminar with a specially invited group of important professors and academics who will speak about various topics relevant to the university. The main goal of this event is to celebrate and explain the story of the university and the influence it has had in the development of Colombia. Education will play a major role in the post-conflict era because the reason for the conflict was inequality, which is related to a lack of access to education and opportunities. Furthermore, Universidad Nacional de Colombia is included in the actual peace accord itself; the university will have an active role in reintegrating former FARC fighters and afflicted communities into the education system. We are also tasked with undertaking a census to assess the level of engagement such communities and groups currently have with the education system and their needs moving forward.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>After 40 years of working with the academic community of this university to bring the Colombian economy excellent professionals, especially in the healthcare sector, which is our main field, we decided in 2010 to obtain the highest quality accreditation in Colombia, a move that is optional for universities here and which many quality ones still do not have. After six years of work, last June we obtained recognition from the government as a high-quality university, which started off a new phase for us. We will have to work more, be more meaningful for the community, and produce more knowledge. We need to focus on health and the quality of life. We also want to show that although medicine is important, we have 120 programs. We seek to expand the university outside of this campus and hope to build a new building. We also want to develop our culture, which is why we have an art school, a design school, and what we call a creation school. This is another important area of focus. Right now, we are only in Bogotá but have another campus in Chí­a. We want to get our accreditation before we go into other cities.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Education is the basis of any philosophy of peace; it is a concept and idea that is transmitted and guaranteed through education. The Universidad Externado has many projects to this effect, mostly in collaboration with the Ministry of Post-Conflict, and with other universities and educational institutions, especially in areas that were most heavily affected by the conflict. The objective is to educate the general population on the importance and value of peace by supporting and creating new diplomas and programs in line with these goals. To do so, we are creating 100-hour degrees and organizing many academic events. There are 10 in 2017 alone that will talk about the post-conflict process and achieving permanent peace. This is not just of importance to Colombia; the Colombian peace process is an example for the rest of the world and a model and inspiration for similar conflicts in other countries and regions around the world. We can show them what is changing, how, and most importantly, that change for the better is possible.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>There are some issues that we as a country are very much aware of; however, going out to the rural areas outside the main cities and having a much more thorough, meaningful, and important relationship with the different regions in the country will be paramount. Today, important things are happening, programs that are making private and expensive universities more accessible to lower-income sectors. Accessibility is one of the biggest higher educational challenges here. Another is financing, which for higher education is difficult; quality higher education is expensive. The peace process will require a great deal of resources, and we will need wise decisions to see where we allocate those resources, among which of course will be higher education. We are talking about more resources for higher education and more resources for financing the lower-income class that cannot afford the cost of universities. One thing that characterizes Latin America is that we have some excellent universities scattered among many lesser ones in every country in the region.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>La Sabana has developed a curricular management model that seeks to develop the relevant competencies in students for them to go beyond the technical abilities and be able to transform specific situations, problems, or needs into positive solutions, with a sense of respect and service-oriented attitude, thus adding to the development of their country. We are also preparing our students to develop international competencies. We have 10,000 undergraduate students and around 3,500 graduate students and are committed to developing an international profile in each of them. We focus on the development of international competencies in our students and have a strong bilingual education where they have to achieve a certain English proficiency assessed by international examinations before they can graduate in order to be competent and have the skills to apply for international universities and jobs. We also have around 130 agreements with different international higher education partners to provide international experiences for our students, both in our campus and abroad.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have three ways to oversee our company and its growth: the first is the annual budget, the second one is a three-year strategic plan, and the third is our guide, which we call the Mega Plan, a 10-year plan the first year of which we have just begun. Our main target in this mega plan is to be in 12 countries, have around 30 million users, 80,000 employees, and 720 medical centers; not just hospitals, but what we call a one-stop clinic. 2016 is the first year of our grand plan, and in terms of countries to be developed we are now at seven out of 12. We are in Colombia, where we have our headquarters, and in Brazil, Peru, and Venezuela; these are our historical base. We are moving into Mexico, where we also now have a presence, and the US, where we have presence in Florida and Connecticut. We are also in the Philippines and have an expansion area in Indonesia, Vietnam, and probably some countries in Eastern Europe.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our most important business is insurance, but our group operates in many different areas, including insurance, surgical supply, and laboratory operations. Two years ago, we started a joint venture with a Portuguese laboratory and developed a new brand, ALTADIS. Our most important project for 2017 is our new hospital, a huge facility we plan on opening in August 2017. This is important because we are the only group that has such a diverse portfolio of operations in such a wide variety of areas. Unlike many of our major competitors who operate in one area, we have businesses in many different parts of the industry. In 2015, we had a clinic and insurance company in Panama; however, now we are refocusing more specifically on the Colombian market and want to spend much of our energy expanding our medical insurance and medical services businesses in Colombia.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are always thinking about expansion. Considering that we started with 65 beds and one facility in Bogotá and now have several buildings that complete the complex, we have a history of growth. We are always growing to provide the people in Bogotá excellent care because demand has been growing. We have developed a reputation for good quality, so people asked for us. We also started a new facility in the northwest part of the city, which is Clí­nica La Colina, one of our latest expansion attempts. We opened this new facility in 2013, since we were not allowed to grow as we wished in Clinica del Country's area due to regulations, we hope that in the near future we will be able to provide additional beds in the city to meet the increasing demand. We are always focused on private medicine, but that does not mean we do not get public patients.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We started our operation nine years ago with the same HR, staff, and people that were working for the main insurance company that was dissolved by the government at the time. One of our main goals was to keep the same team and the same people together, but at the same time to change the culture and recover the humanization through activities focused on the patients and their families. We seek for society to recognize our work as a new model of attention and heath management. We have three plans for the future in terms of investments. The first one points to additional investments of USD40 million infrastructure and new medical equipment by 2020. The second is related to gaining the High Quality accreditation both as a hospital and a teaching hospital. The third point is to develop a research program in order to design clinical trials and studies.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>For national producers of pharmaceutical products, especially in the institutional sectors, the effects of the peace process are great. Three major ones have been identified. First, we will have more consumers since more people will demobilize from the guerrillas and become part of society. Second, we will have more opportunities to reach areas once controlled by the guerrillas. The third is that we can finally focus on solving other problems afflicting our country such as corruption. We are planning for growth of 30% in units of production in Mexico in 2017 and 2018. That will lead to physical plant growth as well as human capital. In Colombia, we are also planning to grow by more than 25% new units. What is more, Grupo Ave produces 25% of the units that go into the institutional sector. Every year, we export half of the 150 million units we produce to the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean, excluding Argentina and Brazil.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Official healthcare coverage in Colombia is around 94%, which is a sizable number compared to developed countries. In addition, it is an evolving market where the rules are changing in order to provide more access to more Colombians. Even though the number of people covered is high, the government wants to raise the breadth and depth of coverage further. These are positive signs, although still a rocky path in the future to achieve the goals. We have complete faith in this market, and we plan to be the fastest-growing affiliate for three years. We have various strategies to bring this about. We want to make our products available for those 94% of Colombians, improve access, and work with the Colombian government to achieve that. We want more quality healthcare for more Colombians, and so does the government; therefore, we need to work together to achieve this common goal and see how we can keep expanding coverage to yet more Colombians.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Cipla has been present here in Colombia for over 20 years through a network of distributors. We were well known in the healthcare community, and were often asked why we were not in Colombia directly and operating with distributors instead. Colombia is a growing USD4-5 billion pharma market. The other factor that led to our direct entry into this market was the therapies we focus on. We are large globally on respiratory, HIV, and oncology therapies, and these fit very well with what was most in demand by patients here in the country. The country's location is central and relatively close to our US office in Miami. In addition, there is high quality of human capital and talent for pharma here. Thirdly, there is ease of doing business here. To incorporate a company here was quite simple and a smooth process. We set up our business here quickly and got great support from local entities.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The office market in Bogotá is the center of operations. While Medellí­n is perhaps increasing the participation of offices, the average transaction in Bogotá is between 1,000 and 2,000sqm, while in Medellí­n it is closer to 200. The reality is that the office market is in Bogotá. It is possible to find some 50-60sqm office projects in Bucaramanga or Pereira for local lawyers or architects; however, that is it. From an industrial or logistics point of view, the strangest cities will turn out to be logistics hubs. For example, the town where the road from Medellí­n connects with that of Bucaramanga will turn into a logistic center because of its specific location. The 4G plan will have a special impact on roads that will completely change the logistics market. This will generate huge development opportunities in the next few years, causing the logistics of the country to change massively. This is what we are targeting: we need to understand where these roads are being planned and how they will go through. Nor should we forget the new hubs that will be created once the Magdalena River is traversed. Altogether, there will be huge opportunities for developers and investors who understand these new logistics.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Opportunities for the future will mostly come about in the cities. There will not be much going on in offices and office buildings as it is saturated, with a great deal of supply and low demand. Housing, on the other hand, will depend on the socioeconomic and demographic segment in question. There will be low demand at the highest level, but demand at the lower end will be considerable. Colombia has a housing deficit that needs to be met, and the government subsidizes the lower income segments. The same goes for hotels. Hotels had tax incentives until 2017; however, without the tax advantage, that industry will also slow down in 2018. We expect market conditions to remain the same in the malls and retail segment as well, with the concern that rental prices are not growing at the same rate as the value some of commercial real estate assets. In the last few years, foreign investment increased in Colombia. There were private individuals seeking to purchase in tourism destinations like Cartagena as well as investors who came here for business purposes. We also have certain foreign capital funds, both private and mixed, that come to purchase or rent land to develop in the country.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 2015 and 2016, we focused on planting the seeds of the company, to put together the ideas and strategies we want to harvest in the long term. Last year was an important year because most of the projects we handled broke even. In 2017, we need to harvest all the effort and hard work we've been doing so far. We started construction on three of the projects where we broke even, and this year we will focus on making an excellent final product for those who believed in us. It is a year to focus and grow intelligently because one of the important things that young companies face is the internal growth of the company. They have to grow intelligently and in strategic areas so this is the year to focus on materializing the projects we have been working on. We also want to make a strategic plan for the next years, from 2018-2022. We are already covered through 2018 but want to look beyond that. It will be a busy year, and we have a great deal of work to do. We have many partners and colleagues to work for and materialize everything we have been working on.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The real estate market in Colombia is a dynamic one. In 2017, we expected it to be a little slower than it is now. The sector has been growing in housing, retail, industry and offices. Colombia is a country of cities. We have the major cities of Bogotá, Medellí­n, Barranquilla, Cali, and Bucaramanga. Every city behaves differently in the market. In Bogotá, there are so many people that housing is one of the most important sectors of real estate, especially for lower income housing. I am on the board of directors for a construction company and all we do is low-income housing because it sells well and there is a great demand. Prices in Bogotá are high compared to other cities in Colombia. In Medellí­n, there is a problem as there is not enough land to build housing spaces for low-income segment. So, they have built in towns around Medellí­n instead of inside the cities limits. For the high-income segment, they are building in El Poblado. Some of investors coming from abroad would rather be in Medellí­n than Bogotá. It is the only city in Colombia with a metro and the transportation system overall is good. Even though traffic is getting heavy, it is not as heavy as Bogotá.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The PPP infrastructure projects are long term. Yet, at the same time, previously made errors need to be corrected. This is the fourth generation of projects. We had three generations before with different financial structures and responsibilities for constructors. All these projects need to have a clear structure, especially when determining who is in charge of what and who bears the risk. The financing is the most important element in the success of these projects; if the contract is clear on how risk is assigned, then the projects will be easily financed. Then, the challenge is to successfully raise financing for the projects. The main obstacle the sector is facing is the fact that sponsors face bottlenecks when it comes to getting bank guarantees for equity contributions. The bank guarantees the sponsor equity contributions, but the sponsors have to provide to bank with liquid collateral in order to receive that guarantee. Therefore, the main obstacle is the collateral for equity guarantees. Our pipeline is full for another five years, but then we have to start getting things moving on other fronts. We have to finance and prepare other projects. We have construction between today and the next four years in all of the projects, and we are already thinking about what our pipeline will be after 2019 and 2020.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The 4G concessions took so long because they had to qualify for many conditions. First, it took a great deal of time to gather the financial resources. The first concession consisted of 10 projects that should have started in April 2015 but, due to a lack of funds, actually started in June 2016. There is also the fact that the big concessions had to buy the land to build on and get the environmental licenses. These two processes take a long time. The industry itself cannot do anything to facilitate and speed up the process. Many companies need a great deal of resources; the first 4G projects have finally started but still need new financing partners. To get off the ground, 70% of the financing is on credit and 30% has to be equity in cash. We want all projects to start operating in the first half of 2017 so that we are ready to move aggressively into 2018, which should be our best year yet. In these specific 4G projects, it is both difficult and different, as the risks are now on the company whereas before they were mainly on the public. For this reason, it was hard to get insurance because everyone was worried about how the projects were developing.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>About 70% of the productive centers in Colombia are divided between its two coasts. 4G infrastructure projects such as Alto Magdalena are making these productive centers available and connected internally and to the world. We have an outstanding reputation because we always finalize and reach the financial closing of our products. We do this in accordance with our commitment to society and the development of Colombia. We have a macro commitment to the 4G projects that will connect Colombia to the world. We also have a micro commitment to our communities to bring progress as well. The social responsibility we follow is not only internal as a company but is focused on the local communities as well as the rest of the country. It is difficult to finance all these large-scale 4G projects, but Colombia is committed and has smart people working to find the best way to finance them. Pavimentos has a history of social responsibility and being a committed company so this will definitely help. We are not the largest, but we have one of the best reputations in the country. The participation of foreign companies is important in this process, especially in terms of financing. We are looking for foreign companies that are transparent, that will create a win-win situation for us and the country.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We decided to come to Colombia because it was developing strong infrastructure and had a bright future. In these four years, we have changed perceptions about purchasing equipment. This new perception allowed us to sell 50 rigs in a market that traditionally purchased two or three rigs per year, 80% of which were used. The market continues to appreciate our work, despite the fact that this year was a difficult one, and we continue to provide excellent products. Economically speaking, I have many expectations because the government has been trying to bring investment through the peace deal. In the last three years, investment in the country has diminished. The only thing that can change the situation dramatically is a large influx of money and investment into the country. We have many projects that have been approved but that lack financing, and we need to find some way to correct this. FDI is the way to do this, but if other states and multinationals do not have a guarantee that the process will be transparent and business operations will be safe and smooth, they will not come. The impact of the deal will mostly come in terms of the perception and reputation of the country, and this is a vital aspect of attracting business and activity to Colombia.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>In each of the 13 countries where VINCI Highways operates, we are strongly committed to supporting regional development and attractiveness. This is also our ambition in Colombia. With the 4G plan, Colombian authorities intend to close the country's infrastructure gap, and we are proud to support this national objective with the VÍA 40 EXPRESS project. On VIA 40 Express, our number one challenge is technical. To take on the challenges, we draw on all of the VINCI Group's expertise and have also entered into a strategic partnership with Constructora Conconcreto, a company the VINCI Group has been working with for many years. Together, under the leadership of the National Infrastructure Agency, we will play on our experience and expertise to meet the schedule and successfully deliver. Beyond those technical aspects, we are committed to ensure maximum satisfaction of our clients. And we also pay particular attention to local integration, ensuring VIA 40 Express will be a significant growth driver for local communities and the region. VIA 40 Express is already the fourth generation of PPP projects in Colombia. The National Infrastructure Agency has been achieving strong progress in terms of structuring contracts, adapting legislation, awarding, and following the implementation of PPP projects in Colombia. The peace agreement this year should reinforce even further this positive trend, enhancing the stability of the country.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our biggest opportunity is our location in the Caribbean and Cartagena's extremely focal point at the geographical heart of the country's commercial life with the rest of the world. In this century of commerce, an activity that dominates 50% of our national economy, Cartagena will be key to Colombia's prosperity. With technology, everything has changed quickly over the past two years—not just the last 20 years. The older locks of the Panama Canal used to support ships up to 4,500 TEUs. With the new expansion that limit is now up to 18,000 TEU. In fact, only about 10 days after the new locks were opened did we see the first big vessel in these waters, which we accommodated with ease.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In the colonial days, Cartagena was one of the three most important cities in the Caribbean, and when the new airport is opened it will be an important player in the region once again. In addition to its industry, port, logistics, and tourism, the airport's connectivity will help it become one of the most important hubs in the Caribbean. The capacity of the current Cartagena Airport infrastructure is below what the city needs to fulfill current traffic demands. There is a bottleneck at the airport since it is behind the rate of growth of the rest of the city. Cartagena is a tourist hub that needs connectivity with the rest of the world; the total land of the airport expansion is about 100ha, and since it is so close to both the city and the sea, there is no room to grow the capacity of the actual airport. The actual infrastructure does not have a parallel runway for aircraft to taxi, and this is a big limitation on the number of operations per hour the airport can handle.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Transport in Colombia is a matter of national competitiveness. The country has at the moment more than 40 international trade agreements and our borders are open to the world markets; however, it is said that moving a container from Asia to any of the Colombian ports costs less than moving the same container from our ports to the major centers of production and consumption located inland. Holdtrade Atlantico fits into this vision by offering a bimodal more cost efficient alternative for linking the Port of Santa Marta, located on the Caribbean, and the interior of the country, where more than 70% of the GNP is generated. Our studies show that savings in the cost of transport for freight—depending on the volumes, products, and routes—could be as high as 20%.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>From a geographical and logistics perspective, Barrancabermeja is the heart of the Colombian economy—today and the future. All of our roads and train infrastructure used to run parallel to the river because it is the natural way to develop and transform fluvial transportation. We are thus in the right location to move the largest amount of products that come in and out of the country and the right location for the future development of the country. Here we provide direct access to the Caribbean, Cartagena, and the port of Barranquilla. Barrancabermeja is equidistant from the Cundinamarca region, where Bogotá is the capital, and from the Antioquia region, where Medellí­n is the capital, and both regions, along with Santander, represent over 60% of the Colombian GDP. As a result, we are the best logistics solution for 60% of the current Colombian GDP. On the other side, we have developed our port to serve all of Colombia's transport needs. We have an infrastructure that can move bulks, liquids, solids, containers, and general cargo; we provide solutions to every range of products that exists on the Colombian market.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Hyundai is a strong brand. We will have a network of dealers for the public service segment where Hyundai has been a leader for many years, having 62% of the total market in 2010-2011. Our intention is to return to being leaders in that segment of the market. We have a separate network for passenger cars and are improving all our facilities, including our showrooms and technical support. Our strategy is also to participate in more segments. For example, we now have a small SUV and will bring in two hybrid vehicles. We are also bringing in a new model to participate in the crossover segment. Covering more segments will help us reach our targets. We seek to have 6.7% of the total market in 2017. We are also bringing in commercial vehicles from small buses all the way through to trucks. Hyundai has a new design in the commercial vehicles area, which is a huge segment in the market. Currently, we are not considering high-end, although Hyundai does have high-end models. The mid-term plan is to bring some of our high-end vehicles into Colombia to reinforce the perception of the brand here. In the past Hyundai was attached to public service functions, such as taxis. We want to show that there is a great deal more to Hyundai than taxis.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The Colombian market is the second-largest market in South America behind Brazil. We have showrooms in Bogotá and Medellí­n, and in September we have plans to open another showroom in Cali to cover the three main cities of Colombia. We have 28 showrooms of dealers throughout the country and 21 workshops for maintenance and the warranty. JMC is a unique brand and has gone up 50% compared to last year. Although the market is 20% smaller than last year, this year our target is to double our sales in trucks, pick ups, and SUV; last year we sold just 328 units, and this year our target is 600 units. And we look forward to selling up to 2,000 units within three years. Over the last three years, more and more Chinese brands have come to Colombia because of the new visa policy. Previously, it was hard to get a visa from China; now that it is easier, many Chinese brands have built factories or offices here and have brought their knowledge, technology, and employees to the country. We are the first Chinese brand to build a headquarter office, direct showroom, spare parts storage, and workshop in Colombia. Chinese brands have huge opportunity in Colombia; however, we need help from the government and banks to offer more support for long-term relationship development, especially credit facility for final clients.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 2010, SKBergé took over the Chrysler, Jeep Dodge operations in Colombia. The last brand that joined our Colombian operations was Fiat. We were able to take over Fiat in November of 2016 and began sales in May 2017. We are new to Colombia but familiar with its operations from our headquarters in Chile, where SKBergé also distributes both Chrysler brands and Fiat. The plan was to follow the same model of leveraging the Fiat brand within the Chrysler-Jeep-Dodge network, which we already have here. Until May 2017, our entry price vehicle was the Dodge Journey, at COP69 million, and now we are adding a wide portfolio to the same dealer network, with a number of Fiat models. It is a way to leverage our operations with the right investment; the infrastructure is already in place for this to succeed. In our dealer network, we have the infrastructure to sell 5,000-6,000 units a year, but we are only selling 2,000 units. With Fiat, we should be able to increase the volumes from 2,000 to 5,000 in the coming years. It is a way to take advantage of our current infrastructure with a low investment. For the short term, we are focused on strength. We are reinforcing our team here in Colombia and bringing our successful practices to Colombia.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Copa Airlines Colombia has successfully served primary and secondary markets in Colombia through what have been three challenging years. We have a quality product that is well regarded by the market to withstand a difficult economic environment. Our quality product awards are perhaps one of the highlights for Copa because of the product delivery consistency we have maintained for decades throughout our network. We received Skytrax recognition as the Best Airline of Central America and the Caribbean, Best Airline Personnel in Central America, and Best Regional Airline of Central America. As for punctuality, Copa Airlines was recognized as the most punctual airline in Latin America by Flightstats and the second-most punctual airline in the world by OAG. On top of this we have grown significantly. Over the last seven years Copa has increased its available seat miles in 50%, nearly doubling the number of aircraft in our fleet. Our corporate focus in serving primary and secondary markets in Latin America with a well-thought-out network with the best schedule choices and shortest connecting times has enabled us to do all this in an orderly fashion while maintaining the quality of our product. Copa Airlines serves key regions in each country we fly to, which differentiates us from other airlines. In Colombia, we connect eight cities in the country: Bogotá, Cali, Medellí­n, Cartagena, Barranquilla, Pereira, Bucaramanga, and San Andrés.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We started in 1967 with the first flight to Bogotá, a multi-sector flight with several legs that included New York. Today, we operate a daily flight to Frankfurt with Airbus A340-300 in which we offer business, premium economy, and economy class. It connects not only Colombia to Germany, but also Colombia with the rest of the world through our main hub of Frankfurt. Through our operations in Bogotá, we offer our customers the entire Andean region. Our customers from Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia can reach the rest of the world through Bogotá. There will definitely be a positive impact on the aviation sector in the context of the post-conflict era. Significantly, Colombia has reached a visa-waiver agreement with the EU, allowing Colombians to travel to Europe for up to 90 days on tourist visas. Many Colombians also have family ties to Europe. This certainly brings Germany and Colombia closer together and has already shown itself in passenger numbers, which have posted positive growth. When bridges are built across countries rather than walls, the numbers grow. For Lufthansa Group, we have different kinds of customers. We transport Colombian businessmen and families traveling abroad on our flights, but we also have tourists and investors coming from the other side. We also have people coming to Colombia to start a business.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Satena is a different, alternative airline; we are the only airline flying to the most remote parts of the country to bring development to these areas regardless of whether it is profitable. Satena was created in 1962 with the help of the government to reach remote areas, though the focus has now shifted to bringing these places as much development as possible. Satena started a new initiative with El Dorado Airport to increase plane parking spaces to reduce waiting time on runways by 25 minutes. This is one of the main initiatives we have to make Satena and the entire system more efficient. At present, 90% of Satena's destinations have huge potential to become eco-tourism hubs. However, it is not just about transporting people to these places; we are also in partnership with local institutions to develop their whole infrastructure and craft a larger, richer experience. Remote areas are important for the post-conflict era, especially for tourism, because few people have had the chance to visit them. The challenge that Satena has in bringing in more people to these remote areas and following their development will contribute to their economic growth. We already plan to expand our number of flights and destinations. The key word is security, and this was brought by the post-conflict peace deal, which helps to shore up confidence in Colombia as a safe place to visit.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Copa felt there was an opportunity in Colombia to create a new airline, Wingo, firstly because Colombia is ranked third in Latin America, behind Mexico and Brazil, in terms of passenger traffic. Passenger numbers are also expected to grow further with Colombia's economic reforms and the peace treaty. Secondly, there has been an important shift in the low-, middle-, and high-income classes here. Around 50% of the Colombian population is predicted to be in the middle-income bracket by 2020. Again, this gives opportunities for more air travel. Third, we felt there was an important opportunity in the fact that Copa already had a subsidiary here with a permit to operate, which was a real asset. Colombia is a strategically located country with a large degree of internal and external air traffic. There are many important cities within Colombia compared to other Latin America countries that only have one major city. A low-cost carrier here is the perfect fit for a burgeoning middle class that desires to travel more as well as for a country that still has land transportation infrastructure problems due to its geography. Two out of every 10 Colombians travel abroad, which is a low rate. Copa's product mission was to encourage Colombians to travel more internationally, but it was not affordable. With Wingo, we want to make overseas travel affordable for Colombians and Latin Americans in general.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Colombia is the second-largest market in South America and LATAM Airlines has a share of around 22% of this market. Colombia has strong growth potential. The impact of the peace process will definitely be positive, though it will not be felt right away. Colombia needs to accompany the peace process with continued investments in infrastructure, not only in airports, but also in related services and hospitality infrastructure. Some regions are a long way behind with this. International tourism will increase, but only at the rate of investment in the sector. We are pleased with the tourism corridors that are being developed by the government; these are the types of initiatives the government needs to put in place. Today, we see certain positive signs in terms of the tourism offering, though not yet the demand. It will happen, though. The right environment has to be set up to receive those new tourists before they start coming in. We believe local tourism will increase as well. The airline industry has to drive this by providing more efficient and economic air travel options. In other markets, the number of airline passengers increases exponentially compared to the rate of growth in the economy when prices are lower. Over the next three or four years, one challenge will be allowing the industry to provide lower prices to stimulate an increase in consumer demand.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Informese has been in the analytics market for 25 years. This is an ever-changing environment and market. Getting analytics to be part of the decision-making process is an area where we have had many challenges and continue our hard work. It is constantly evolving as new technologies appear, new data sources arrive, and new ways of processing information enter the market. Our challenge is how to make use of the best technologies available and bring them to market in such a way that it is comprehensible for people not used to statistics and analytics. Getting people and organizations to realize how these help them to make better decisions is our key goal. We have the challenge of growing and adopting technologies at a much faster pace than developed countries.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There are two aspects of being here; one is the talent that we need to develop a product for a global audience. Colombia has smart people, and the vast majority of our development team is here in Bogotá—something we are proud of. Our product is developed here in Colombia. The other aspect in terms of opportunities is that, in any given year, there is always a large country in Latin America in a difficult situation but another in good shape. Right now, Peru is growing aggressively and the countries of Central America together with the Dominican Republic are showing healthy economic growth. That is something we are leveraging. We see healthy investments from specific industries. The same thing is going to happen everywhere, in every single industry. We help in the transformation toward becoming a digital company, and there are many ways to do that.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The Colombian government is working hard to facilitate the transformation of the country's industries, enterprises, and corporations; hence, there are huge opportunities. Colombia is currently the third market in the region after Brazil and Mexico. In most industries in Colombia, our clients are thinking about how to transform their businesses to remain competitive. We can help our clients not only with their strategy to embrace digital transformation, but also with implementing it in the field, which is something some players in our sector cannot do. One obstacle is the lack of implementation capability with some of the service providers. There is plenty of innovation and lots of new products, but rolling these out to scale is the challenge. That said, we are ready to start an aggressive growth period. Our goal is to grow our Colombian business threefold. We are investing a large amount in the country, and we are planning to build a digital hub in Colombia.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The government has nearly connected the entire country. On the downside, we really need to invest more in digital education, especially educating the ecosystem. This is why 100% of our marketing budget goes to the education of the ecosystem. We go to our partners, clients, and agencies, but we also have an open door for people such as Google entrepreneurs, Google developers, and many other initiatives to help people to take advantage of the digital world and all of Google's tools. Technology gives opportunities, and we will soon have 8,000 more people looking to make a new life, and technology is there to help them. Google also supports “A Window to Dream,“ a program for people affected by the conflicts embarking on a new life. We teach them how to use digital assets to create new enterprises and develop their abilities. This is a good example on how technology can be used to help in the peace process.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>In the forthcoming era of peace in Colombia, society as a whole cannot successfully be reintegrated if the entire IT industry is not leveraged. This is a huge strength that we can leverage through technology, or lose the opportunity. Microsoft is working with the government to figure out how to draw the digital bridge for every community and citizen, but the government has to have a clear vision of how technology is going to drive the next generation of Colombians. One of the best opportunities for this is the emerging market for products that are built on top of the Microsoft cloud. This is where I believe we have a huge opportunity and where I would invite the industry and government to invest more and capitalize on these opportunities and the eagerness of many entrepreneurs, independent developers, and students in order to start new businesses around intellectual property and digital services.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The advantages of Arturo Calle versus international companies is that it already has a presence; we no longer have 100-150sqm premises, but 1,500-2,000sqm, or larger. This makes our products more varied and widely offered. Another important factor is being up to date on the latest sector trends, not to mention the fact that our products often cost half or less than half of their international equivalent. In addition, it is important to have a nationwide presence, which international companies don't have the capacity to do. One only sees international brands with a strong presence in larger cities such as Bogotá, Medellí­n, Cali, and Barranquilla. Beyond physical factors, it is also important to have good customer service so people associate the brand with good people. A few international brands like Falabella and Zara have been successful due to their size and variety, but venturing into Colombia isn't easy. What these populations need is quality and design at extremely low prices, something that international companies cannot offer.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Textiles and fashion should bring more exports to the country and play a bigger role in diversifying its economy and exports. If we go back to 2008-2009, we used to export USD2 billion to the world. Half of this went to Venezuela, while an important percentage went to the US and the rest of the world. When Venezuela went down, it was difficult to export because we were expensive in Venezuela, our peso was strong due to oil, and our internal market was growing. Hence, what happened is that most merchandise that used to go to Venezuela moved and stayed within Colombia. The internal market has been growing 8-10% every year in the last five years but exports have not. In 2016, our exports, excluding to Venezuela, came to around USD750,000, below our figures in 2008 and 2009. First, we need to focus on customers in the US. Second, we need to explore more aggressively in Canada, Europe, and Mexico.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>As the country becomes more open and more international products come in, the company needs to compete with the other brands that enter the country. That is why we are producing and trying to bring a new level of quality, as well as the manufacturing and know-how that we have, for leather and the artisans that are working with us. Having all of our manufacturing locally allows us to have greater control over the quality. We are also creating many jobs within the country. Before we start growing outside of the country we have to be very strong here in this growing market. We have been increasing the number of stores we have here in Colombia. We are increasing our options here in Colombia and settling in more to promote our brand.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are sure that the implementation of the peace process will generate many growth opportunities, especially in the two areas with the biggest limitations in Colombia today, infrastructure and agriculture. Of course, Dow is active in both sectors through agrochemicals and seeds in agriculture and additives, cement, and other solutions for infrastructure. Our merger with Dupont in 2017 is another opportunity to increase growth. Both Dow and DuPont have a presence in the region, but DuPont does not have assets on the ground whereas we do. Thus, we are not competitors in any of the lines we have in Colombia or anywhere in the Andean region; however, we are complementary. For example, in infrastructure it has some solutions that will be a great addition to what we already have. We are expecting to grow in Colombia between 8% and 10% this year.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>One of our company's key focuses is on creating long-term relationships. Mitsubishi Electric de Colombia sold its first elevator in the Colombian market in 1964 and ever since we have focused on nurturing and developing a long-term relationship with the market. Though the country has faced difficult times over the last 50 years, we never left because we believed the market was an excellent long-term source of growth. We have a long history in Colombia and have contributed to the sustainability of its economy and society in important ways. The impact of business operations on society as a whole is one of Mitsubishi's core considerations, and we have transferred that type of thinking and strategizing to the Colombian market. Our 50-year presence in Colombia has shown the people that we are dedicated to the country in many different ways.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The Colombian market is important because our participation here is not as high as in other countries. On average, we have a market share of 30% in countries in which we operate, while in Colombia it is around 17-18%. The idea is to achieve similar levels of market participation by introducing new technology in the Colombian market. For example, we have industrial heaters that use 30% less energy than the rest of the market. But the problem is the price, which is important in the Colombian market. The biggest opportunity I see is in the hydraulic line because here we only have 4% of market share and the potential is high in mining and oil, among others. The oil industry is not so high-tech, and we can offer this technology here. It is high-tech in Europe, and we have a chance to introduce this technology here and upgrade the existing machinery accordingly.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Colombia has been one of the most strategic countries in Latin America for L'Oréal. Therefore, in 2013 the group decided to heavily invest in Colombia by buying a local company for the first time. We acquired Vogue, which is the number-one make-up company in Colombia, as part of our strategy to become the number-one beauty company in Colombia, as we already are in the world. Growing in market share in countries like Colombia is how we will meet our goal of finding 1 billion new consumers. We are launching international brands such as Urban Decay and NYX here and bringing the Garnier Fructis range into the Colombian market. There is a large currently unsatisfied appetite for these products in Colombia that we are looking to fill. We also made a USD30 million investment in a new factory to increase production in Colombia and exports throughout the region.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Colombia represents the second-largest country in South America and the second-largest market in the region for Michelin. In the last two years, we experienced a devaluation of the currency and deceleration of the major motor of growth of the economy that helped the previous growth from 2012-2014. In terms of business, this meant we had to reorganize our operation by looking for efficiencies, cost reduction, and focusing on customers' needs to really be consistent in our delivered value. Despite the last two years being difficult, we performed well and outperformed the market by growing in market share in every segment. We did this because we are focused on innovation and renewed approximately 80% of our portfolio. In every segment, we consistently innovate to be able to deliver great added value to customers for bikes, trucks, passenger cars, light trucks, and the mining sector.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>When we started, we identified a large number of illegal mines. Our challenge was to have a model for our business that would formalize these mines by incorporating them in our operations. Our operating model incorporates formalized contract miners, which we call the Small Productive Production Chain Initiative. In this model, the company seeks to involve communities and artisanal miners within our operations, with the goal to improve the living and working conditions of the miners and contribute to the economic and social development of the region and the country. Much of our production today comes from this contract miner model. It is a win-win situation. This is also good because it helps protect the environment. This model includes the small contract miners in our environmental license, helping them improve their safety and reduce injuries, ensuring they pay royalties and taxes because they are in our operations and they are one of our operators. If the sector and government work together, we could obtain good results in the ongoing peace process.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The most direct benefit we bring to communities is employment. Furthermore, there is a tremendous amount of training that goes into this; hence, there is also a strong aspect of personal development. And it is not all about mining; it is also about investing in people. While I am investing USD3 million into a machine, the resources needed to train and develop an employee for two decades, not to mention payroll and taxes, is probably fairly equivalent. And the employee gets an indirect benefit through the significant amount of money from returns generated by the mine that is then re-invested in the business and its people. The second most important concept for the communities is to establish a community locally and regionally that can provide supplier-based networks and a number of goods and services to the mining enterprise. We estimate that some 40% of our purchases could probably be done on a local and regional basis.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Mineria Texas Colombia is the first foreign company to run a Colombian emerald line in recent decades. We are not the only foreign company here now, but in terms of running a major project in the last several decades, we certainly are the largest. We have a few companies; there is MTC, which operates the Muzo mine in Colombia, and most of the most valuable emeralds in the world have come from Muzo mine. MTC was a new company created to operate the mine. The emerald industry in Colombia unfortunately has a turbulent and violent history. It was difficult to gain the confidence of local financial institutions and other businesses. Eventually, we convinced the industry that we were a legitimate American company and we were able to carry on with the legal procedures to establish the company correctly. We began an intensive effort to modernize the mines and expand operations and have been a successful mine-to-market program.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Equion operates an important asset in Colombia, the Piedmonte license. It is a large, but technologically challenging, prospective area in oil and gas, as it is in a mountainous and environmentally sensitive area. We are working with other companies that bring in leading technologies from around the world precisely for projects like this. Each new successful well can provide anywhere between 2,000 and 8,000 bpd. Those wells can take six to eight months to drill and cost around USD60-80 million. The Piedemonte license with Ecopetrol expiries in 2020, though we have plans to continue being productive in Colombia and working with and for our shareholders. We are still competitive in the region but need to progress and develop increasingly our exploration efforts. We need to be covered by a clear framework that will enable us to develop Colombia's industry. The peace process will be a large advantage in achieving this aim.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In an effort to focus our development, we have been going through a strict portfolio management process, which Colombia survived. We are one of the world leaders in the offshore industry, especially deepwater, which fits in well with our portfolio in Colombia. Petrobras will also be able to balance its portfolio with a little more gas on long term. In general, the offshore business has been positive in keeping the country competitive. Although the deep water offshore sub-phase of Colombia does not have the same potential as neighbors such as Mexico or Venezuela, Colombia has been making a large effort to motivate and incentivize initial investments through free trade zones that have been assigned to some companies. We will be drilling one deepwater offshore well in Colombia in 2017 and one onshore asset to help mitigate risk for exploration of what to drill in 2018.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We still have the two Technical Evaluation Agreement (TEA) blocks that we need to decide in 3Q2017 whether to convert to E&amp;P contracts. We will also need to decide whether to go from Phase I to Phase II on the E&amp;P contract for SIN OFF 7. Though challenging, the prospects look good from what we know so far. We decided we did not need to shoot 3D seismic for SIN OFF 7; therefore, we are transferring these commitments to COL-3 block, which is another benefit from the government that allows this kind of flexibility. We are transferring the commitments to COL-3 block where we need more geological information. Like any other major oil company, Shell has an active portfolio that we are constantly reviewing. Currently, we have three businesses here—upstream, lubricants, and some trading activities. I do not see us moving away from these current businesses in 2017.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>As a leading company in the downstream sector in Colombia, we challenged the status quo in 2012 and decided to make a shift in our competitive strategy. We decided that Terpel should focus on the people that came to our service stations rather than only on their vehicles. Under the certainty that we were delivering the best quality in our products, we focused every decision related to innovation for the individual person that visits Terpel. We changed our logo and made substantial improvements in aspects related to service levels, infrastructure, and pricing to become the best choice for our final customers. We have a long way to go in Colombia. Many people thought we had expanded outside Colombia because the Colombian market was already mature, but we do not think so. Aside from service stations, where we are still developing a market, we also have industrial, aviation, and lubricants businesses; hence, we have a great deal still to do in Colombia.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Overall, 2016 was an active year for us. The investment climate in Colombia continues to be positive, despite everything. We managed to close several large transactions: one was the sale of a 58% equity stake in one of the largest energy generation companies, Isagen, which we had been working on for nearly six years. It ended up being sold to Brookfield from Canada, which now has a solid platform to continue growing in the Colombian energy market. We also did another large transaction by Colombian standards, the acquisition of CIFIN SA, a USD200 million transaction that we advised the US-based TransUnion on. While these two deals are the most visible, we have a few other transactions in our portfolio that grab less headlines but still prove there is a healthy appetite for investments in Colombia. As the third-largest market in Latin America, Colombia has a great structural relevance when investors approach it. And the political situation relative to the region continues to be positive. We have a growing middle class with greater purchasing power that has been the main driver behind growth. Despite the slowdown, this continues to hold true. Granted, the last two or three years have seen a transition from 5% or 6% annual growth to something closer to 2%. However, given what is happening around the world, this is still quite healthy.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are showing the market that the private equity industry is becoming an engine of development not only with an economic but also a social impact. Now with a decade of experience, we are both a young, strong, and structured industry. And private equity funds are really showing results in the market. We now have 90 funds operating across Colombia managed by 55 fund managers, 55% of which are local and 45% international. This means we have a very interesting mix of international and local players, the former of which are important to the market since they generate more information, best practices, and are a key player in the sector. We have raised about USD12 billion in capital commitments in 10 years and invested USD 6.7 billion, significantly impacting the GDP of the country. However, 40% of these capital commitments come from pension funds, of which there are only four; having so few players causes a structural problem with the capital markets in general. Granted, the industry is trying to build an independent regulatory body for the private equity market based on our decade of experience in the industry. This is one of the issues we have to deal with in the coming months. We also need to identify more new investors for those vehicles, both local and international.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have had an excellent year, not only in prices but also a recovery in volume, particularly in fixed income. In the equities market we still have very low volumes and the market has shifted. Initially it was an individual based market, where more than half of the investors were individuals. However, during the past four years these investors have exited the market and their volume has been replaced by international agents that represent today approximately 40% of the volume traded. This has had a special effect on the market because international institutional investors, the ones that participate the most in the local equity markets, are focused on operations on the closing of the market. We have also had a few issuers that have exited the market through private transactions. For example, the Isagen deal involved a private equity fund and the company is no longer public. This market has had difficult times and even though we are expecting an IPO boom soon, today we are not in the best moment for the market. We have had a liquidity drop. This year has been better but brokerage is still a business that has its challenges with low volumes and tight fees. As long as we do not see new agents and new issuers, Colombia's capital markets will not recover.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The Bogotá office is one of our oldest offices in the world outside our London headquarters; it was established and has been fully functional since 1985. Therefore, we have an extensive history with the country. A large portion of our work for the first 20 years was related to security issues and helping companies get out of some complicated situations. The difference over the last 10 years or so has been that with the influx of FDI as a result of the administrations of President Uribe and Santos, our business has become more of a management consultancy, and has far more to do with assisting new investment from multinational companies in the country and increasing the amount of work we do for large Colombian companies. For example, the oil, gas, and mining companies employ our services to become more reputable corporate citizens in this environment, better understand the communities in which they are working, the impacts of their actions, local politics, and understanding local business partners in order to not violate any compliance norms.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have been in Colombia for 50 years and offer services not available anywhere else in the region. The secure transfer of valuables, physical protection, and a wide line of consulting are but three. Our portfolio is much wider than that of other countries. Naturally, we are proud of these achievements. We also have a great deal of potential to export talent from this office. The perception of security in the country has changed dramatically in the past years for the better. Therefore, I am proud and optimistic for the future. Of course, we are still far away from an ideal world in which there are no security issues. This gives us a great deal of space to grow, however. And at least we have seen great improvement over the past few years, which obviously improves international perceptions of Colombia. Another problem is that security issues have risen with fast rates of urbanization, which certainly slows this process. However, perceptions are improving. It also gives us many opportunities in this sector.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The drop in the price of crude led to some changes for ConocoPhillips, particularly with redesigning our exploration strategy. We are now focusing our explorations efforts on four business units and some key international new ventures in which we see potential. Colombia is one of the countries where we are implementing these strategies. The budget we currently have for global exploration is much smaller than what we had a few years ago, but we have made the conscious decision to take a piece of that exploration budget and invest it here in Colombia. Our focus in Colombia will be on unconventionals. The Ministry of Energy and other institutions are working on that because Colombia has only about five years of oil reserves left; therefore, the country urgently needs to make new discoveries. Our long-term strategy in the country also includes implementing a sustainable development model sustained by three pillars: one is economic, one is social, and one is environmental.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Even though it has had turmoil throughout its history, Colombia is now a country with proven high quality institutions, reliable financial policy, and a good draw for foreign investment. In general, it has had the best performance in these areas within Latin America. We have been in Colombia for 90 years, providing cutting-edge technologies for the development of a sustainable infrastructure for health, energy, water, ground transportation, and aviation. Transportation and energy are two sectors the country needs to improve to be a more competitive economy. For both Colombia and GE, the oil and gas industry is one of the pillars for development. We believe in the strategy that the industry in Colombia is performing at this point to go offshore. This is the opportunity for the sector to make a good turnaround in our reserves, in both oil and gas. A decade from now, we could be able to double the country's production with a good combination of gas and oil.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>For Virgin Mobile within Latin America, Colombia was the second-easiest market to enter. When we were exploring the entire region, Chile was a safe bet, but the other economies in the region were not as attractive. Argentina was not in a good political environment, and Brazil and Mexico were too large to tackle from scratch. Therefore, Colombia made perfect sense. It was large enough economically to be relevant and stable enough, both politically and economically, to remain a safe bet. It was also like a laboratory for testing our value proposition in a bigger way that Virgin Latin America had done before. That is why Colombia came after Chile and preceded Mexico—because of the experience we gained. We thought we were better prepared to tackle a market as big as Mexico after accomplishing what we have accomplished in Colombia. There are some things we learned commercially and others we learned politically.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Innovation initially lies in strategy. Colombia is confronting the largest PPP road program in Latin America, which at USD18.2 billion is a sizable amount for a country that had traditionally done little of that type of financing. Colombia has done more corporate than infrastructure finance, so it was a challenge to shift the focus of the system to approach infrastructure, especially because of each project's complexity, size, and time schedule. The latter is tight, as we are doing nearly 33 projects worth around the aforementioned USD18.2 billion in two years, which is ambitious for such a short period. At the beginning, it seemed completely unrealistic to many people, who were skeptical that we could finance a program of this size. One of the reasons was the capacity of the private sector to efficiently finance these capital investments. This is where we played a key role in the strategy; we are the institution responsible for designing the strategy and then helping to implement it. The strategy was to find out how to diversify sources of financing to guarantee that the program would have enough resources available. The first thing was to identify the main sources of local banks, international banks, multilateral entities, and local and international capital markets and see what were the main constraints for their participation.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In these last five months of management, we have focused on three goals: acquiring new businesses in what Fonade considers its four business lines; designing an austerity policy mostly on operational expenditure and bureaucracy; and optimizing internal processes such that our clients understand there is a new management focused on being more efficient and effective. In addition, Fonade has two international clients based on mutual cooperation. On the one hand, our Spanish client receives resources in relation to sewage and rural aqueducts in municipalities that have had violent actors, or departments such as La Guajira that have great difficulty with the supply of potable water. On the other hand, our French client receives resources in relation to health-related issues all across the country. Furthermore, Fonade has had new businesses with entities such as the School of Public Administration (ESAP), the Unit of Penitentiary and Prison Services (USPEC), the Ministry of Housing, and the National Road Agency, which have allowed Fonade to increase its income. We have done project management in more than 900 Colombian municipalities, including the Municipal Stadium of Sahagún in Córdoba and the Santa Bárbara houses behind the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit. In addition to these works, Fonade is present in several other departments in health, education, and sports and recreation, among others.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The role the National Savings Fund plays is important for the entire economy of Colombia. Together with the Ministry of Housing, we are closing the quality and quantity deficit in housing. Many Colombians are now economically independent and have escaped informal situations, but they still need some sort of savings. The best way to do this is to buy a house, which is where we want to help. Our goal is to reach these people and bring them prosperity through home ownership. This is important for our country, which is fighting really hard against poverty and is the role the FNA plays in this fight. In the future our goal is to modernize and have a larger focus on people. Colombia is focusing on its less-developed regions and growing a lot as a result. Therefore, we need to include every region; each is an important national asset. Colombia has many large and important cities, but there are also many municipalities that are much less developed. The idea is that the municipalities will follow the housing patterns of larger cities to give Colombia the future it deserves. We have to be proactive in identifying the difficulties people have in securing adequate housing and teach people about the importance of savings and not merely give them a house. This is so important to the future of the family and its education, health, and prosperity.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Retail comprises the majority of our business because the nature of our products does not lend itself to larger fleet deals. In 2016, we saw a decline in volume in the motor vehicles market, but were still able to launch some new products in segments that we had not been competitive in before. One of our key drivers of growth is our ability to provide vehicles to relevant segments of the market while supporting that from a retail perspective. We engineer and design products that allow us to compete in segments where we could not before. Middle Eastern consumers are sophisticated and educated; they travel the world and understand design, technology, and brands. The Range Rover Sport appeals across the age spectrum because of its performance ability. Also, it is an extremely well-designed vehicle. With the Range Rover Sport, a driver can be in the desert on Saturday and then at the office on Monday. This car is perfectly equipped to do both. Range Rover all over the world, and particularly in the Middle East, is a hugely aspirational vehicle for a number of reasons. It has been around this region for many years, and it is both an extremely capable and comfortable vehicle.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>AGMC is the BMW Group importer for Dubai, Sharjah, and the Northern Emirates. We have over 700 employees at AGMC and the widest network in terms of infrastructure for an automotive company, with 26 sales and service facilities. We have 187 display vehicles across our network as well as 229 work bays across our service facilities. It is of paramount importance to us to be where the customer is, and this drives our expansion decisions. Our latest investment was in a new facility in Fujairah in 2012. At the time, it was a state-of-the-art project with the latest BMW Group design for facilities. In the post-economic crisis period from 2010 to 2016, we have been pleased with our growth. On the BMW side, we have had 85% growth and over 600% growth on the MINI side. Over the last five years, AGMC has invested over USD27.2 million, not just in new facilities, but also in upgrading, updating, and continuously developing our existing facilities from a technology, BMW Group design, and customer experience perspective. To celebrate AGMC's 40th anniversary, we have upgraded our service facilities in Dubai by launching the all-new workshop for BMW and MINI with 20 work bays as well as a multistory car park accommodating 250 cars.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Mercedes-Benz is in a position of great strength around the world. The brand is among the top-10 most valuable brands globally and is the number-one premium automotive brand in the world, according to Interbrand 2016. On a regional level, as automotive brands in this part of the world do not disclose their sales data, it is difficult to provide precise figures. However, given our brand recognition, visibility on the roads, and the special connection the brand shares with people across the region, we are the top premium car brand in the region. We are extremely lucky that our portfolio has expanded at the right time with impressive sporty, sleek designs—this has supported our performance in the region and will help us maintain our position as the region's top premium car brand. We are introducing no less than eight new models this year. We launched the new E-Class Coupé, GLA FL, and E 63 models and by the end of the year we will have the E-Class Cabriolet. Other models to be launched this year include our ultimate sports cars, the Mercedes-AMG GT R, Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster, and the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Mercedes-Maybach S-Class. A strong core business begins with first-class products.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>BMW has enjoyed fantastic growth since 2009, and for most of the years, we had double-digit growth. We are aware it is difficult to maintain such a rate. If we look into the UAE, the growth in 2015 was 25%, and in 2016 we had a further increase of 2%, which was a fantastic result considering that the market had declined in terms of the premium segment. The growth driver is that we are building upon two strong brands, BMW and MINI, and many customers in this region appreciate strong brands especially during a challenging time. They look for brands they can trust. Secondly, we have the right products for the region. We have the brand-new 7 Series, a strong range of X models, and several niche models that are highly appreciated in the region. The third factor that makes us strong is that we have built up a network of successful importers throughout the region. Here in the UAE, for example, we have worked with AGMC for over 40 years in Dubai and the northern Emirates, and these factors, brands, products, and partnerships on a retail level make us strong and contributed to our growth in 2016 in the UAE.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Internationally, Porsche continues to enjoy incredible success with records, year after year. In 2016, we enjoyed 6% growth worldwide. We tend to focus and concentrate on what our clients want; through that focus, we deliver our end goals, and the volumes naturally come as a side effect of those accomplishments. The core of our brand is still the same, and the 911 is still at the center of that brand. We enjoy greater penetration in the sports car segment, especially in the two-door sports car market. The Macan was the volume seller, with strong support from the Cayenne, and we have also just launched the Panamera. Of the 60 million new cars sold annually worldwide, 240,000 of those are Porsches. We measure and monitor our customer base diligently worldwide. In the UAE, the population is significantly younger than in the US and Europe, and they have strong purchasing power, 10 years younger than it would be for a person in Germany, for example. The demographics for senior management in this country are also younger than other places in the world. Here the average age is 36 whereas in the rest of the world it is 46; this again influences our target market.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are seeing a bit of pressure in the restructuring market because the fundamental issue is that oil price was at USD100 just over a year ago and now it is between USD43 and USD45. A lot of expenditure here is driven by the government, which has meant that government has had to rethink balancing its budget. This pressure has been felt first by the infrastructure and contracting businesses since they have typically operated on narrow margins of 2-3%. They work on long-term contracts; therefore, it can be difficult to estimate the end cost, particularly if there are variations or delays in the projects. Furthermore, there is a structural problem that needs to be addressed in terms of keeping SMEs in the country during difficult times. The new bankruptcy law that comes into effect from the end of the year should help to encourage more of a rescue culture. In all parts of the world, SME lending is a challenge, as it requires due diligence and more information about how they are performing in real time. SMEs are really important to the Dubai economy. The free zones have attracted many entrepreneurs, which has been positive and progressive for the economy. More needs to be done to support and develop this important sector.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The issue with the banking sector is that it is still highly regulated, and it is still quite a challenging investment environment for international investors. The predominance and importance of local ownership is still a key part of investment in the banking market. International banks see it as locally dominated and potentially overbanked, so it is still quite challenging for foreign investors to come and try to take a stake. There are foreign ownership restrictions and while that may change over time, at this stage it is a market that is likely to be less open to foreign investment. The fact that governments have significant stakes in a number of the banks here gives a different element to the operation of banks. The UAE's success in M&amp;A will continue, since people here are open to good opportunities. Because of the relatively liberal environment in Dubai, people who are looking to invest in the region generally come here as their first point of call. Investors feel most comfortable about the investment risk when they come to Dubai. There is a strong legal framework for such interest, which means foreign companies are more likely to invest and buy a stake in Dubai. There may also more acquisition opportunities in Dubai because there are more entrepreneurial businesses and more people looking for capital to grow their business.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>During the 1980s, the government was primarily trying to develop the free zones and the warehousing industrial exports, and we were also active with IPOs. Since the IT boom there has been a lot more work in software and the production of brands, which drew a lot of companies here and energized the intellectual property space. Real estate work boomed from 2003 onwards, as did mergers and acquisitions and capital markets work. All of that has brought the UAE markets, and to some extent the GCC markets, maturity. As well as operating on a larger scale, with larger mergers and acquisitions, the style has also changed from individual to corporations, groups, funds, investments, and so on. Now, the move is largely toward the emergence of new sectors such as renewables and data. With those changes we had to change our style and focus closely on new hires, ensuring we were recruiting individuals specialized in intellectual property rights, something we previously did not have any experience with. Underpinning all of this is the drive to create a highly transparent and regulated society, a reality that has developed the UAE into an attractive place to do business. That is one advantage of VAT and one advantage for taxes, and a solid tax system means that every business must have well-kept accounts, which is an added benefit.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In this part of the world, Brexit is not of great interest. Generally, we expect the volume of trade between the UAE and the UK will increase as a result, and statements made by the British Prime Minister on how Britain is looking to the Gulf as a strategic trade partner for British companies fortify that expectation. The drop in the pound's value has also encouraged Gulf investors to invest more in the UK. ADNOC, for example, has just purchased 2% of BP, which was awarded a concession for an oil field in Abu Dhabi that will increase its share of Abu Dhabi oil from 95,000bpd to 295,000bpd. Brexit will encourage more British firms to secure deals in Gulf countries and the UAE. For a long time, in discussions on hydrocarbons and aluminum, the EU refused to deal with the GCC as a bloc, preferring to deal with them as individual countries for obvious commercial reasons. This does not mean that the Gulf does not wish to act as a bloc, and it has acted successfully as a bloc in areas like pharmaceuticals. That being said, with the new US administration, the relevancy of commercial blocs is under increased scrutiny, and we are waiting to see how that will affect global trade and treaties.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>A company's articles of association or the contractual documentation set a prescribed profit share. Standard practice here is that the foreign party, if it is not a real joint venture, enters into a commercial arrangement that negates that 80-20 profit share. This entails an agreement on terms such as a fixed fee for an annual period. The local partner has to add value to the foreign company. We get involved in every aspect of their licensing legality compliance on the ground. When companies first enter the market, the first piece of advice they are given is to choose a local partner that can advance your business interests, if you have to have one. Companies should engage with the local Emirati community on a commercial basis, but should not confuse that with business ownership. We suggest that your local partner is not necessarily an individual or a company that will help you. Instead, it should be one that ensures you to be always in the best position from a legal perspective. Many private equity firms and venture capitalists are advocating more M&amp;As, but the businesses involved are in need of consolidation of ownership beforehand. Our company was one of the pioneers of this as the first to bring a corporate nominee product to the market and was the only independent company in the country offering this service.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have over 100 nationalities represented on our Manchester Business School part-time MBA program, with around 45% of our 2,000 MBA students residing in the UAE. As part of the program, we encourage and facilitate student visits to at least one of our five other international centers during their studies. We cover the cost of accommodation in two locations in order to give them a more global perspective and network. We consistently have students coming from a core of industry sectors—consultancy, engineering, construction management, software management, oil and gas, as well as ICT backgrounds. There has been an increase in the number of entrepreneurs becoming successful business owners following an MBA. The MBA has been a real catalyst for entrepreneurs developing their own SMEs. Female participation has also increased significantly over the last few semesters, reaching 20% of the latest student intake.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) has its own courts and our master's degree in law (LLM) serves that sector, mainly in arbitration, money laundering, and financial crimes. This serves the needs specific to Dubai. In 2016, we signed an agreement with DIFC courts where our LLM graduates have a greater opportunity to work at DIFC. We also serve the police department with our telecommunications and IT program, which focuses on IT security. Moreover, we have an agreement with Dubai Customs to prepare and teach their qualified employees to graduate from UD with a customs and supply chain management degree. We hope that this degree will expand to other entities in the Emirates of Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah. This is something we are going to work on with the World Customs Organization to ensure that the qualifications we provide meet international standards. Beyond that, we have plans to cater to the hospitality sector as well as the emerging digital media industry.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our business school is the largest of our university with 38% of total enrolment. About 25% of the faculty comes to us as part-time instructors from the business world. AUD has placed a lot of emphasis on developing its full-time faculty of career academics.  Many have professional experience, and the university has made an effort to ensure that they can continue their professional work whilst teaching. We are working to complete a five-year plan for the university. We will add liberal arts programs, such as a major in psychology or a literary program in-line with the UAE's year of reading. We will certainly see additional majors in business administration, like Islamic finance, and possibly small business management or human resource management. An institution like ours must create and maintain its relevance. I am lucky enough to be on the advisory council for a number of primary and secondary schools and therefore aware of how teaching is changing and what the student expectations are when they get to university.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>As the campus was set up with a focus on media, we have students going into public relations, journalism, and television production. We also have a business school, and within business, we make a distinction between training for general management, marketing, and finance. Our marketing students are all over the UAE working for various companies. There are a number of opportunities, especially with media increasingly moving online. With this development, it does not really matter where in the world you are. We have a number of students who are already writing blogs that are well visited. Others are doing freelance writing for publications around the world. Dubai is located perfectly, being right in the heart of the GCC and with over 60% of the world's population within an eight-hour flight.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The university started as a small vocational training college owned by the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA). It was dedicated to aerospace engineering training and air traffic control but has since grown to a university where we have introduced many academic programs, both undergraduate and postgraduate. We have now broadened our scope of courses and offer aeronautical engineering, aviation management, travel, and tourism, as well as an MBA in aviation management. We have expanded our programs into different areas, such as logistics and supply chain management, business studies, software engineering, and mechanical engineering. Emirates Airlines is now the owner of the university; therefore, we work together closely, and although the university does not guarantee employment for our graduates within the Emirates group, many of our graduates are working for the group. Our plan has grown in terms of expansion outside the UAE and the GCC, we are looking into Europe as well, especially in terms of partnerships with universities.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Canadian Specialist Hospital is a multi-specialty hospital covering all the major specialties in medicine. Its sub-specialties include cardiology, neurology, rheumatology, endocrinology, and so on. We perform general laparoscopic orthopedic surgery; otolaryngology for ear, nose, and throat; and obstetrics and gynecology. We also carry out an extensive range of dental services. All these areas of practice require supporting services such as laboratories, radiology, ICU, NICU, and emergency services. Each area of practice at a hospital like ours needs to have some extra investment to complete the range of services we can offer and to keep up-to-date with new medical technologies. For example, now we are investing in minimally invasive microscopic spine surgery. In January 2016, we launched a new rehabilitation center. There had been none in the private healthcare sector here, and patients were forced to seek rehabilitation services in European and Asian countries. We conducted thorough studies and decided to set up a rehabilitation center at the Canadian Specialist Hospital.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our structure for getting into this market was to look at how this healthcare market is driven by insurance. There are a number of hospitals and clinics; however, there are not many day surgical centers or ambulatory surgical centers, as in the US or the UK. We are one of the largest day surgeries in Dubai at the moment, at 20,000sqft. We are also the only hospital with level-two operation theaters. The difference between hospitals and clinics is that we have been given permission by the Dubai Healthcare Authority (DHA) to do over 200 types of surgeries. We offer high-quality, cost-effective surgeries, procedures, and consultations and see ourselves as a bridge between the clinics and hospitals. Insurance companies seek to reduce their costs on healthcare provision, and we see the insurance sector maturing. As a company we are engaging with this situation in several ways. We have 18 insurance companies on board and are in discussion with another 10 to design packages that provide cost-effective solutions for their clients.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our agenda and focus in terms of the care we offer revolves around the demands of our customers. The focus thus far has been on a variety of practices that can be seen in our specialized facilities and centers of excellence including: a bariatric center, a cardiac center, a gynecology center, and oncology services, which include both surgical oncology and medical oncology apart from all other disciplines. We are doubling the capacity of several of our facilities and expanding into new fields such as radiation therapy. Dialysis is another popular tertiary care. While there is a great deal of talk about offering preventative care and exciting new initiatives, a lot more needs to be done  on what currently exists. Preventative healthcare is more complicated and the implementation of truly effective preventative care in the UAE must coincide with an overhaul of social norms and lifestyles. The UAE has a troubling prevalence of diabetes, cardiac, and cancer cases caused by lifestyle choices such as poor diet and lack of exercise. The only way forward is to continue with the consistent and strong reinforcement of these policies through educative wellness campaigns.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Aster DM started as a single-doctor clinic and over the last 30 years we have transformed ourselves into a multi-faceted healthcare service provider with our own hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. Our care ranges from general to specialty hospitals and from 20 beds all the way to 250 beds in the GCC, and one hospital with over 700 beds in India. Another distinguishing factor of Aster DM is the variety of care we offer across our three lines: Medcare, Aster, and Access. Medcare is a premium brand where everything from the doctors to the facilities is high end. Aster is our main segment catering to a wider population. Access is a newly introduced brand, which is the most affordable care we offer. We have managed to grow both organically and inorganically, building our own facilities or acquiring hospitals. Many of our patients come to Dubai as a tourist destination, whether for medical reasons or leisure, thereby we place an importance on making the Aster brand highly visible in the GCC market and globally. The most rewarding aspect of this business comes from doing good work and providing the best quality of care.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We are a very young player, but with strong roots from being in the healthcare sector for the past 35 years. We have a very strong rate of YoY growth, and last year we grew 65% compared to 2015, which is a great result for us. These growth levels will enable us to meet our capacity. We are a 200-bed hospital, out of which almost 100 beds are running. So by 2017, we should reach almost 100% capacity, having 200 beds. In the short term, our aim is overall growth of 35% in 2017. We are currently developing an integrated oncology program. We have been trying to understand cancer from the patient's point of view, trying to find a way that they can get everything done under the same roof, because a cancer patient should not have to worry about navigating multiple different centers and doctors. We want to offer one place where they can get medical, surgical, and radiation oncology treatment. Along with counseling and psychological and medical and surgical oncology services, we will have the radiation oncology capabilities providing chemotherapy and advanced surgeries for different types of cancer.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Population growth is robust because Dubai is at the epicenter of 3.5 billion people, by which I mean the Indian subcontinent, the whole of Africa, the Middle East, and CIS countries. Dubai is renowned for its development, high-quality living, high-quality entertainment, plus great vision by one of the greatest leaders that the world has seen. It is an international city where more than 200 countries are represented and that provides a safe environment and quality infrastructure for its residents. The number of houses and the growth of the population dictate Dubai's real estate sector. The existing number of homes is about 500,000, and population growth will be roughly 4% for the next 20 years. I am optimistic about our work; beyond that, I am an Omani national with Indian origin, and I have never felt at any point in time that this is not a good place for me to live. The potential of real estate is defined by the happiness and comfort a country provides for those that live and work in it.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have been transparent when it comes to doing business with our clients as well as with authorities, and this regulatory environment has decreased risk in the market. The creation and enforcement of escrow accounts has streamlined the process and provided an equal playing field for developers. Ethical developers are supported, and dishonest developers are pushed out of the market because the escrow account (or lack thereof) provides numerous obstacles for them. It will be a natural process of purging the marketplace. That is why we have had strong growth in 2015 and 2016, and why 2017 is projected to be a banner year. If developers focus on construction, remain transparent, and develop a product that has demand, then there is no reason why companies cannot be successful in this competitive market. These principles apply across a variety of sectors, not just in real estate. Today, people see transparency as a modern and progressive way to do business.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>As a 150-year-old group that has built a formidable reputation in the contracting space, we are now pursuing our passion to emerge as real estate developers of choice in the international arena. We have been constructing prestigious and iconic projects in the Middle East for the last 45 years now—a journey that began by us building the Palace of the Sultan of Oman in 1971. In fact, currently, approximately 50% of our group turnover comes from international operations. Currently in over 45 different countries across the globe, the expansion to this region was part of our concerted internationalization growth plan. With our first real estate project outside India currently under construction in Downtown Dubai, Imperial Avenue is set to be completed in the last quarter of 2019. In addition, we have another project at Dubai Healthcare City, which will be launched soon. We are also exploring other opportunities, both within the UAE and across the GCC, as well as in Africa and Sri Lanka.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>There will always be winners and losers in a volatile market. Speaking specifically about our business, it is about exhaustive planning, not overstretching, and not doing too much. In terms of longevity, when you hit a difficult period, you can be the benefactor of being able to negotiate better commercial terms if you buy land. On the supply chain, in relation to contractors, designers, and consultants you can set up a better supply chain with favorable commercial terms, or even better materials and finishes. It depends on how your business is set up and how nimble it is in terms of reacting to market change. We are quite fortunate that we keep a close eye on what is happening in the global economy to make sure we do not get caught out. We came out of the economic crisis, and we delivered everything we had to, even though it was tough. That enabled us to put this diversification strategy in place, and we have been successful at it.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Dubai is a city with booming retail, hospitality, and tourism; these areas need to be supported by developments with medium-range pricing and luxury finish that are affordable for investors. The challenge with developing for the middle-class range is that the know-how is connected to contractors, subcontractors, and materials. You need to work with your consultants and project team to find ways to fix your construction costs to suit the development and selling price. 2016 was our year to restructure our entire development strategy. When we were doing market research, we found that buyers in the age range of 20-45 prioritize lifestyle and prefer medium-range real estate rather than luxury. The world's population is increasing, and new generations have new technologies and new priorities, so we need to keep up to date with their needs. We are developing studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom homes, and townhouses with three and four bedrooms. In Meydan, 40% of the developments are studios, 30% are one-bedroom, 20% two-bedrooms, and 10% are townhouses.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>For more than 150 years, ABS has been committed to setting standards for safety, quality, and excellence as one of the world's leading classification organizations. ABS maintains a regional workforce of more than 70 surveyors and engineers, the largest of any classification society. This network operates from eight offices within the UAE and GCC region. ABS also operates a full-service engineering office in Dubai to support regional growth, strengthen service delivery, and provide communication in the same time zone. The engineering department offers a full range of analysis and plan review services. Historically, the focus has been to assess the integrity and efficiency of hull structures, mechanical and electrical engineering, and hydrodynamics. Today, the range of technical support on offer has to be wider and deeper to support the sophisticated machinery and complex systems used in modern marine and offshore assets. While remaining firmly class-centric, the focus of ABS's technical services has transitioned to offer more predictive and preventative applications.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Chevron Shipping and its affiliates provide functional support across the Chevron enterprise. Our job is to deliver marine operational, commercial, and technical expertise that enhances the corporation's business results. The decrease in crude oil prices has created a challenging environment for the energy industry. If there is a silver lining, it is that the downturn caused Chevron to increase its focus on costs. We scrutinized our operations, increased efficiency, and reduced costs. We are well positioned to provide safe, reliable, and cost-competitive marine transportation to support Chevron's global operations. The business environment has never been so competitive. What makes us stand out as a shipping company is our steadfast commitment to operational excellence. The entire industry is going through a challenging period; however, we are not willing to compromise on our commitment to safe, reliable, and environmentally responsible operations. We have high expectations and we hold ourselves accountable for achieving the right results. When selecting vendors and contractors, we seek companies that are like-minded.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to continue to grow in the Middle East. We see many opportunities that suit our fleet profile, in particular for fast offshore passenger transport vessels, which prove to be cost effective in comparison to helicopter transfers. Additionally, our liftboats (Jack-Up barges) will play a major role in offshore field production enhancement and platform maintenance. Overall, we intend to be a part of the continued growth across the entire GCC region. 2016-2017 will prove to be tough, and I doubt there will be a serious upturn in activity before 2019, and possibly beyond. Offshore activity appears to be picking up, benefiting from reduced cost for working offshore and the higher price for oil. Some of our client spending is now finding its way back to offshore assets, and barring a collapse in the oil price for an extended duration, the outlook for our fleet is positive. There is still a tremendous oversupply of offshore support vessels in the market, which will be a drag on activity recovery.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Traditionally, Hitachi has been a manufacturer of all sorts of equipment. However, the changes that we are undergoing all revolve around digitalization. This means that our focus will not merely be supplying equipment or taking part in infrastructure projects but also providing end-to-end solutions to our customers by utilizing the IoT. Hitachi has established a group of very advanced experts based in Silicon Valley, and they are leading this process. We have also acquired a lot of companies with expertise in the field of big data analytics. Combining this with our experience in the infrastructure business and in providing equipment, we are aiming to provide customers with solutions that are relevant to the 21st Century. For example, in healthcare we are offering complete solutions to patients and operators of hospitals and medical institutions instead of just medical or diagnostics equipment. We are including the clinical analytics, informatics and IT services together to provide more encompassing solutions.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The ICT industry has become diversified, and communications have become a basic human right, like electricity and water.This evolution has had a dramatic impact on industries and economies. It has created enormous opportunities for business growth. In the UAE, Huawei has realigned its business to support the country's efforts in creating a knowledge-based economy; digital transformation is a main component of the UAE's national strategy. Huawei is committed to helping bridge the digital divide in UAE through four key areas:  providing communications for all, broadband for all, nurturing ICT talent, and the application of ICT technologies to help different industries boost efficiency. Huawei believes in open, collaborative relationships with local companies and SMEs who have the right ideas and a potential market, which can provide value to the end users. We work closely with our customers and partners, in the public and private sectors, to build a better-connected world, connecting people, people and things, and things and things.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Governments and companies cannot handle digital transformation on their own, and vendors like us need to build the right ecosystem that will allow entrepreneurs to come up with the necessary applications that will disrupt the digital economy. We are moving towards a service-based, technology-oriented economy, and technology is changing the core business of companies. The new environment requires joint collaboration with pre-existing systems. That is why we launched the Co-Innovation Lab in Dubai, where ten lab people from SAP will work together with partners and customers to work on these co-innovation projects. Also, SAP is partnering with leading UAE organizations in the public sector to drive positive outcomes across key priority areas. We have identified seven key areas where this value can be created. One is engaging citizens, residents, and visitors. Another is improving government efficiency through a unified cloud government platform where it can make significant savings.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>How many devices need to be connected to the Internet? Between phones, tablets, and laptops, one family may have 10 devices connected. In the future, smart homes will have TV, speakers, and so many other things that will need connectivity. The demand is increasing, and no matter how the economy looks or what the political solution is, people still need good quality Wi-Fi solutions. We try to make our products very cost effective so that as many users as possible can make a connection. Meanwhile, we are planning to have all TP-Link routers become cloud based so that they can be used to access their networks from anywhere. The UAE is the best place for the company to expand the business in this region. Dubai is a very international open market where people are willing to test new technology. Thanks to a smart government, the investment environment here is number one in the region.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>When the UAE came into being in the early 1970s, the insurance sector was primarily driven by trade imports. People insured their shipments, which were financed by banks; motor insurance was mandatory in Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah from 1960s. The insurance market has grown over the decades.  However, compared to other developed markets the penetration and per capita spend is much lower. But much of that is because people are so transient here. They do not have any permanent residence status and this uncertainty affects the insurance industry as well. Only six years ago the government of Dubai started letting foreign individuals own property; until then, the only thing people really owned was the contents of their home and their cars. If you look at Europe or other markets, most insurance, apart from corporate, comes from personal lines such as homes, cars, and belongings. Similarly, life insurance is much lower here. There is still opportunity for further growth, but the nature of the demographics of GCC countries makes this difficult.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Over the years, the UAE and Dubai have witnessed rapid economic growth, which has meant a continued influx of people from around the world. Even today, with the relatively slower growth due to a fall in oil prices, the diversified economy has successfully allowed a fair degree of stable growth across different sectors, and that has continued to attract people to work, trade, start new businesses, and live in this country. As Dubai and the UAE continue to grow, the demand for personal and corporate insurance will rise. In fact, the Dubai and Abu Dhabi governments' mandatory health insurance policies have boosted demand for health insurance. At the moment, insurance and takaful companies provide corporations and traders with a comprehensive range of options for risk coverage. However, when individuals, typically expatriates, compare insurance and takaful coverage offered by their employers here with their home countries offers, the product range is limited.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Many new products are coming online in 1Q2017. We are targeting millennials by digitalizing points of sale, an initiative we kick-started at the beginning of 2016 with the launch of our online health insurance portal. We are now moving to the next phase of our development by creating a fully digital platform for the company. This is part of a wider drive to be more customer-centric, which will be a big factor differentiating us from other providers, whether domestic or regional.  Overall, medical insurance has been a major driver behind the growth of our top line, which we grew from USD21.8-24.5 million to more than USD81.7 million. That jump is attributed in a large part to medical insurance and the rollout of mandatory health insurance by the DHA in 2016.  We are the first domestic company to offer online services that allow people to purchase insurance from the comfort of their own homes.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The UAE insurance sector is not saturated. Insurance penetration in the Arabian Gulf in general and in the UAE in specific remains low and roughly around one-sixth of the global average. This rate indicates the level of development of the sector and is why Chedid Re strongly believes there is a substantial growth opportunity. So we need to differentiate between a challenging market and a saturated one. The region in general, and the UAE in particular, are challenging markets that make it attractive for serious players. The culture at Chedid Re completely fits these requirements. Our team is trained to handle pressure, respond to challenges, deliver solutions, and run the extra mile to make sure our services exceed our clients' expectations. When we encounter our competition in the market and at social events, they usually ask us what our secret recipe is. But there is no secret recipe! There is only a committed and devoted team that is ambitious and enthusiastic with a lot of fighting spirit.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We launched in April 2013 as a platform for financial services and in February 2014 launched our health insurance category. Within a month of launching that, the new Dubai Health Insurance Law was passed. What excites us is solving problems for our customers and giving them a better way to do things, and health insurance provided a good opportunity to do so. We pooled our resources to become a medical benefits platform that provides insurance and HR solutions through technology. BECO first invested in us in 2015 because they liked the fact that we were getting a lot of traction in a big sector with a lot of potential. We continued to execute the business plan through which they were willing to put in more capital. We will be diversifying the portfolio as well as expanding geographically. We have not announced anything about which countries we will be going into, but in terms of portfolio it is a very natural progression.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Last November we hosted the South Africa and Ethiopia Investment Summit in Dubai, at which we had over 80 investors. Every year we select a theme or a country and host an investment forum to showcase opportunities in the region. This year we chose the country in which the bank has the oldest presence, South Africa, where we are celebrating 154 years of activity, and our newest footprint, Ethiopia. We recently opened an office in the latter, an economically very promising country with significant growth and just under 100 million people, not to mention the second largest after Nigeria on the African continent. We are very excited about the prospects of facilitating trade, business, and banking in the country. The bank operates within the guidelines and parameters of what the authorities have allowed under our license, facilitating foreign investments and interaction. It was a successful event with great attendance and interest shown.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have been working in the Middle East since 1945 and since then have had fantastic relationships with every country in the region. Our relationship with the UAE goes back to 1977. On the commercial side, in the UAE we earned the largest order in commercial aviation history back at the 2013 Dubai Air Show, when the three main Gulf airlines,Emirates, Qatar, and Etihad, awarded us a contract to build the 777X, which came from the fact that they loved the 777. All three airlines use it very successfully and want more out of it, so they asked us to redesign the 777 to fly further with more people. To do this in such a hot climate certainly affects the aerodynamics of an airplane, but we are starting on the construction of that airplane very soon. It will start to be delivered in the region in 2020.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The first business we did here, aside from investing in various projects, was selling properties in Europe for Emaar. We focused on German-speaking areas and sold more than 5% of the units for some of their projects. We then started working as a developer in Dubai in 2007 and built the European Business Center, a 400,000sqft office building next to Green Community, and the Austria Business Center, a global network of state-of-the-art, professional business facilities covering every corporate requirement in some of the world's top locations, including Dubai. We have also developed various projects and sold the plans, rather than building them ourselves. One of our developments at the moment is the Heart of Europe project, for which we developed the first master plan in 2008. The project was ready for construction when the economic crisis hit, so we had to work hard in the following years to make the project much more attractive to investors that had lost their appetite.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In terms of performance, 2016 was the strongest year we have had in a while, although it was probably one of the toughest for many companies. Our success was driven by the expansion of our footprint in Saudi Arabia over the course of 2015, which gave us significant access to the market in 2016. So we were able to gain a lot of business that had not been there in the past, and this despite a downward trend in the public sector. In the GCC we have a 50-50 split between public and private business. As a result, the tender segment over the course of the last year went through a downward cycle driven by cost containment in the public sector. The price of oil is driving a large proportion of the budgetary constraints. We were able to grow in the private sector, which provided us with a decent overall growth level of 11-12% for 2016.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Historically, Arabs, Middle Easterners, and Mediterranean people have always been content creators. This region was home to the most famous storytellers. That has not been the case for the past century, which does not mean that the talent does not exist, just that we have stopped documenting the stories using the available technology. We have taken on that responsibility of telling stories, and creating the 360-degree value chain, much like Disney did, developing a story based on how they can advertise it through merchandise, social media, exposure, downstream sales, licensing, and more.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The business was started in 1943, and we have always endeavored to be pioneers in serving the country. Our diversification has been driven by the needs of the various sectors of the economy. Once in those industries, you build expertise and networks, and continually invest in those industries to maintain your businesses footprint. We started in Dubai with the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) before expanding into telecoms with Etisalat and the banking sector with NBD, for example. We have always looked for opportunities that would first help further serve the community. Currently, we are shareholders and board members primarily of majority state-owned enterprises such as Etisalat, DEWA, and PepsiCo, amongst others in the private sector. We have more than 40 different lines of businesses and are well diversified. Dubai is the driver of our business and development, and we have grown in parallel to Dubai and the UAE as a whole.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In our business model our food production and our F&amp;B outlets are disconnected. We have a F&amp;B outlet called Smoothie King, and that is separate from the manufacturing side. We are the largest private manufacturer of flour in the UAE, and produce roughly 30% of the flour consumed in the UAE and export some as well. 2016 was a challenging year but we are well diversified and have had a mixed performance across those segments. Overall the group's result was strong and we did better than 2015. From the outset 2017 looks somewhat similar to 2016 and in some businesses slightly more challenging but overall we are relatively optimistic about the second half of 2017.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We will still develop and expand within the region; we will not look further afield per se. If an opportunity pops up then we will look at it but our main concentration is in the region, where we already have expertise. Despite general anxiety about these economic headwinds, there is still a great deal of opportunity within the market. We live and die in this region, and in terms of fiscal spending the Emirates would like to argue that they are decreasing focus on oil and gas, but that is not true. It remains a significant majority of our income in the region. The reason the government has decided not to spend cannot be because of the price of oil, but the biggest question is whether it is a real pinch or an artificial pinch. The Far East is picking up; Japan is in a good place, and Africa has also picked up; if all these countries are picking up economically, why does it still feel like 2010? For that reason, when people say they see a slowdown, I think it is just in their heads.</p>]]></sections31>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes the start-up ecosystem in Dubai unique and what are the competitive advantages?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SAFDER NAZIR </strong>When I first came to Dubai from the UK 14 years ago, it was very difficult to understand the opportunities available here, but today it is far easier to access information. Thanks to technology, today people are enabled to come here, set up their lives, and start adding value to the economy. That is part of attracting people to come here; and it is a talent war to get people to come here in the first place and bring their skills with them. In December 2015, Huawei announced the opening of a regional innovations center with Dubai FDI. That center is letting us work with companies of all different sizes. SAP is one of our global partners and there are many small local enterprises that we are working with that are providing software and components for us. That is how we have started to access that ecosystem of people, and the ecosystem comes together as one thing builds on top of another.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>HE ABDULLA BIN TOUQ </strong>One important part of Dubai's uniqueness and its competitiveness is its thought leadership, which has played an important part in building Dubai since the late 1980s. Dubai's development history is one of taking risks and designing the future. The first dredging of Jebel Ali Port was the first risk, i.e. designing a port for which the ships did not really exist. This ambition to push forward runs in the blood of our leadership, and today we are doing the same thing in the creation of an ecosystem for startups. One important part of that is Dubai Future Accelerators, whereby the  government poses challenges and brings in startups from around the world to design solutions for them. The most important thing is our newly launched Dubai 10X, which is an initiative aimed at keeping Dubai 10 years ahead. HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum does not want to be number one in the region or world; he wants to be number one with a 10-year lead. This is important as these 10X units are going to create a disruptive innovation strategy and help take a lot of companies and organizations out of their comfort zone. Finally, there is the Dubai Future Academy, which focuses entirely on how to build the skillsets for candidates that come in from the private and public sector. All of this falls into one very important goal; to develop Dubai into a lab and test bed for new ideas, new technologies, and new ways of seeing the world.</p><p><span></span><strong>AMMAR AL MALIK </strong>His Highness launched Dubai Internet City in 1999, and over the last 18 years we have attracted over 1,600 technology companies ranging from multinationals such as Huawei, Accenture, Visa, Snapchat, Uber &amp; Amazon, and regional home-grown success stories such as souq.com and Careem, Propertyfinder, and many more. in5, which was launched in 2013, is our enabling platform for entrepreneurs and start-ups that are to be incubated and nurtured to their next phase of growth. Combined with Dubai's drive for innovation and disruptive technologies, Dubai Internet City is a conducive environment for ideation and exchange of knowledge.</p><h4>How are SAP's investments in Dubai contributing to these goals?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HICHEM MAYA </strong>When we started here in 2008, we had 10 people. Now we have around 600 people covering the entire MENA region from our headquarters here in Dubai. We opened our headquarters here because we have the talent in the region and the vision of the leadership of Dubai, which is in line with SAP's vision of innovation. If you look at how SAP has evolved over 40 years, innovation has always been the driver. We always think 10 years ahead in terms of where the world will be and what we can do in order to prepare ourselves and our customers. One focus area is cloud technology, and we announced the opening of our new data center facilities here in the UAE, which will help government and local organizations in Dubai use the potential of cloud in a way that ensures privacy and data security. In terms of contributing to the start-up ecosystem, SAP has Startup Focus, which currently facilitates around 4,500 start-ups globally. We started a few years ago here in the UAE and already have around 450 start-ups registered. They are developing on our platform, but everything is oriented to meeting the needs of the country. This means developing solutions for Smart Dubai and of course Expo 2020. We are proud to be a premium partner for Expo 2020 and this helps us focus our innovation on solutions for the event, which will also fuel multiple legacy initiatives.</p><h4>What areas of innovation will Dubai excel in to create globally competitive new technologies?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AT</strong> What is important is the type of innovation we are looking at. There are two different kinds of enterprises: SMEs and innovation-driven enterprises (IDE). Dubai has understood how to differentiate between the two and draw a line between what is an SME and what is an IDE. For IDEs, the important part is to look at enterprises that have technology, R&amp;D budgets, and IP. They are the focus of Dubai Future Accelerator (DFA). By attracting and enabling these IDEs, we aim to make Dubai a laboratory for new technology, especially technologies important to the future of Dubai's economy. This includes technologies related to blockchain applications, energy efficiency, autonomous driving, consumer retail, and transport and logistics.</p><h4>Where does the Internet of Things (IoT) fit into Dubai's future economy?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SN</strong> Part of the outcome of digital transformation is smarter cities and digitalized industries. IoT is an enabling technology and is born out of a vision of convergence between the real and digital worlds. It was in 1999 when the term IoT was first coined, when a gentleman working for Proctor &amp; Gamble who was responsible for a line of lipstick that was selling out on the shelves faster than they could replace it came up with the idea of using microprocessors to signal when stocks needed to be added. The idea of being able to know what is happening in real time has become increasingly advantageous. Huawei is leading in new ways of being able to connect at lower price points to make this technology more accessible to people. 5G and other new technologies will be available by 2020, and we are working with the operators at the high end in terms of bandwidth capability and at the lower end of the spectrum we see things like Narrow Band IoT, which is bringing in a new form of technology to allow connectivity to more things at a lower price point. Once we do that it will allow us to connect the billions of devices. To make that a reality requires a new form of technology, and we have been working diligently for the last couple of years with the regulators, operators, and other industry partners to work on a standards-based approach for doing this. The IoT will give us the ability to connect to more things and what we do with that capability depends on how creative we can be. All the innovation and younger brains we manage to foster will envisage new use cases for this technology.</p><h4>How is the procurement landscape changing with the technology here in Dubai?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HM </strong>The most interesting part of this technology paradigm is that it is possible to combine the public sector on one side and the private on the other in order to address joint business opportunities. There is a shift in the government's role in business, moving onward from the role of administering a country like we have seen in Europe over the centuries. We see, specifically in new markets like the UAE, that the government is stepping ahead and getting closer to a business rational, and this is very motivating for us. We are now able to combine both elements on one platform, with government on one side and private companies on the other using a common dataset in order to analyze data and make predictions. For example, data about the consumption of electricity can allow government to take appropriate actions, while other data analysis can help us to provide better living standards for citizens, and innovative projects like Expo 2020 can engage participants across the spectrum.</p><h4>Dubai Internet City is somewhere between the public-private divide. What is your role in this paradigm?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AM </strong>Our efforts are closely aligned to the National Innovation Strategy and we work closely with our partners to enable innovation at all levels. In fact, some of our partners, namely Huawei, Samsung, Visa, Accenture, and SAP recently announced the new premises of their respective innovation centers. As we look forward to the next phase of growth and creating an ecosystem in which Smart Dubai will grow drastically, we are excited for the launch of the “Innovation Hub." Located in the heart of Dubai Internet City and cutting across industries and disciplines focused on bringing innovative solutions and ideas to market, the Innovation Hub will support 15,000 professionals. It will offer companies of all sizes, including multinational corporations, start-ups, and SMEs world-class facilities and services, robust and adaptable state-of-the-art infrastructure, and a vibrant working environment to support and encourage creative processes.</p><h4>As the number of start-ups grows, will funding for them be able to keep pace?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AM</strong> in5 offers entrepreneurs and start-ups five key benefits: a robust start-up business framework, training and mentorship, opportunities to network, access to investors, and cutting-edge creative spaces that include offices, smart labs, and studios. Since the launch of in5, our members have raised approximately USD38.1 million in funding. With over 1,400 applications, in5 to date has supported more than 160 entrepreneurs and startups through more than 100 mentors and three dedicated Innovation Centres in Tech, Media, and Design, located in Dubai Internet City, Dubai Media City, and Dubai Design District (d3), which house smart labs, recording studios, and design workspaces among other facilities. We look forward to continue providing emerging entrepreneurs and start-ups with platforms to not only succeed in their own businesses but also yield transformational benefits for entire societies.</p><h4>One goal is to see Dubai produce a “unicorn," a start-up valued more than USD1 billion. Where do you think your unicorn is going to come from?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AT</strong> The government's perspective is that we cannot create a unicorn; what we are good at doing is creating the kind of place where people can try things out, fail, succeed, and move forward. An important part is that government can help with fundraising and to set targets and strategies. For example, we want blockchain implemented in government 100% by 2020, we want 20 to 25% of driving to be autonomous by 2030, and we have similar targets for 3D printing in the construction of buildings in Dubai. His Highness wants these technologies to be put in place gradually, rather than shocking the industry. For example, we are slowly incorporating 3D printing technology into  the construction industry, making projects faster and cheaper, and we expect Dubai to benefit accordingly. </p><h4>Which dimensions of the Dubai Smart initiative are you most excited about?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SN</strong> Dubai has some of the best companies in the world located here all applying their best people to solve pressing problems, whether it's from the application, communications, or data perspectives. At Huawei, we have over 3,000 high-end scientists whose job is purely to do blue-sky thinking, and we invest somewhere between 10 and 15% of our revenue every year in R&amp;D. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>FNB Zambia has signed a tier-two facility with the FMO, a Dutch development bank, for USD15 million. We had such a facility in place prior to this, but we were coming to the end and sought to replace it with a similar-sized one to safeguard our capital structure. Tier two caters to the two main currencies we use in the country: the dollar and the kwacha. It is important to have a certain portion of capital in foreign exchange to offset any possible local currency depreciation, as was seen in 2016, and we were happy to have FMO invest in us. In December 2016, we did a further restructuring of our balance sheet, with a credit link note back to South Africa, which created profit for us. Aside from this, we have been concentrating on focused marketing strategies, with specific client niches and a drive to innovate and digitalize. It took us a year or two to have substantial liquidity to lend and gain the necessary market understanding.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>One of the markers of economic growth is a booming construction industry. Indeed, in Zambia we see more and more large constructions springing up, especially in large cities. Stanbic has financed some of the largest infrastructure projects here, such as shopping malls, as we believe this is necessary for long-term economic development. Roads and shopping malls provide the platform for trade, communication, transport, and logistics. For example, we have partnered with the government in holding a number of events, such as the Infrastructure Symposium, to be held at the end of March 2017, which will look at the growth prospects of infrastructure, what needs to be done to build infrastructure, and what should be the priorities to boost the sector in the future. That is part of our corporate vision to provide thought leadership for Zambia's infrastructure industry. Moreover, Zambia only uses 20% of its arable land, meaning there is huge potential in the agriculture sector.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>For any business, clocking in a quarter of a century is a commendable achievement, especially considering the cyclical volatility, challenging operating environment, and rigorous regulatory pressures that frontier economies can present. These past 24 months have certainly been tough, primarily due to cash-flow constraints brought on by government arrears and resulting in a deterioration in business portfolios in terms of asset quality, increasing costs of funds, and high interest rates. A decade ago, the Namibian Capricorn Group made a strategic decision to invest in Cavmont Bank, and our recent achievements are a manifestation of its capital and commitment to this entity, which is now beginning to present a more attractive prospect for our shareholders, with two consecutive years of profitability, which is highly commendable given the challenging economic landscape, and are on course to deliver our third. Cavmont Bank also received Zambia's first unsolicited credit rating with an investment A-grade. Coupled with profitability, this enables us to pursue capital markets activities and consider long-term DFI funding.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Ecobank commenced operation in Zambia in August 2009 during the period of the group's geographical expansion across Sub-Saharan Africa. The parent company, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI), was incorporated in 1985 as a Pan-African movement. ETI, which was initially set up by the members of the West African Chambers of Commerce and Industry, has now transformed into a truly Pan-African Banking Institution. Our largest shareholder currently is Nedbank of South Africa, followed by Qatar National Bank, the Public Investment Corporation of South Africa, International Finance Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank, and SSNIT. These entities own between them almost 70% of the bank. The bank has grown its network and now has the largest footprint in Africa. Ecobank Zambia was set up during the period of geographical expansion for the group. Today, we have grown to eight branches, including several in Lusaka and three branches in the Copperbelt. At YE2016, our assets stood at over ZMK1.5 billion, putting the bank in 11th place in terms of size.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Since 2010, we have diversified our educational offerings, and now courses such as law, medicine, business, and IT are available to all our prospective students. We have diversified to match demand, specifically in medicine. Once we receive certification, LIUTEBM will proceed with the development of a medical school, which will have branches dealing in surgery, physiotherapy, and pharmacy. Public medical universities in Lusaka have not managed to keep up with increased admissions applications, which enabled us to edge into the market and target this growing sector of interest. We have seen an impressive increase in admissions since our establishment, growing from just four students in 2010 to more than 350 in 2015. This growth is something we attribute to the high performance of our graduates, who subsequently attract others to join the same system. Because of our rapid expansion, we need to develop facilities that can cope with this and have applied for approval from regulators, as well as extra financing from investors.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our programs have been accredited not just in Zambia but also internationally, and are attracting more and more students from overseas. In 2014, our student numbers totaled 4,300, and now we have 6,500. Second, we have opened our Leopards Hill campus, which houses the law school and an examination hall. Third, we are branching out into the medical field and will offer medicine, pharmacy, and nursing programs. Fourth, we have been broadening our portfolio of post-graduate courses, with a new executive MBA program in leadership and wealth creation. The first group will graduate in March 2017.  This year we also intend to commence construction of our student accommodation at our main campus, due to begin in April 2017. The project, which should take about a year to complete, will be done in phases. We also prioritize internships and work experience and training. We want to engage with industry a lot more as a university because this is where our products end up.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Everything we do at ZCAS is business related and our programs are related to accountancy, finance, business administration, entrepreneurship, ICT, and economics. At the end of 2016, we registered our private university, ZCAS University, which became active in 1Q2017. All our programs with UNZA are undergraduate but in our new ZCAS University we are starting off with 17 programs, of which 12 are undergraduate and five are post-graduate. We have cemented our partnership with the University of Greenwich in the UK, and it has worked well. However, with our partnership with the University of London, our students struggled with the program largely because of the differences in criteria for application. ZCAS also started a partnership with Lancaster University, offering a global MBA program, but we terminated the program because it was unaffordable for Zambian students. We are in the process of building new partnerships for ZCAS University that will be looking more toward research and exchange types of collaboration.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>When Cavendish University was founded in 2004, it was the first private university in the country. It began with a School of Business, and later added the Institute of Education and Research Development, School of Law, and Medical School. In 2014, Cavendish University Zambia majority shareholding was acquired by Maarifa Education, which is based in Mauritius. The School of Medicine has been operating from a small campus with outsourced laboratory facilities but, in late 2016, Maarifa signed a long-term lease agreement to use modern purpose built-facilities that were initially meant to house University of Southern and East Africa (UNESA). The Medical School moved to UNESA facilities in January 2017 and the campus has been renamed Cavendish University Zambia Long Acres Campus. Construction of laboratories for Foundation and Pre-Clinical courses has commenced and occupation of the new labs is scheduled for August 2017.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Seeff started as a small family business, acting as an agency for Zambian entrepreneurs to be more competitive in the face of big players and property competitors. Eventually it outgrew itself and expanded to what it is today, an international company with branches in Mauritius, Swaziland, Botswana, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, with ongoing expansion in other countries as well. Our latest addition is property management and valuation, which is rapidly growing. Our client mix includes NGOs, companies, and ordinary individuals, and we want to expand even more to be as competitive as the large companies that have been in the market for 15 years or more. Since we diversified into the agriculture sector, adding land for farming to our property offering, we have received more and more inquiries and offers for sales. We started off with offers for 10ha here and there to properties of 100 or 200ha, and even up to 3,000ha. We see a great deal of interest in Kitwe, in the Copperbelt, and in other parts of Zambia, and are now considering adding offices in Solwezi and Livingston as well. There is a notable lack of attractive houses in Lusaka: Many old houses are being demolished to make way for apartments, which means there is great potential for those seeking to construct or refurbish large houses, and demand for it, too.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>A large portion of industrial property demand is still driven by foreign companies. Our manufacturing sector has taken a hit in the last few years, owing to the power deficit and high cost of production. Demand for industrial space, therefore, has lagged behind. In fact, we have seen a high vacancy of industrial space in the last 18 months. For example, Pam Golding currently sits on over 25,000sqm of empty warehousing available for lease; a large amount by our standards. One of the biggest occupants of warehousing space on the local market was the Food Reserve Agency, which rented out large spaces to store grain, and since it has been enforcing cost-cutting measures, it has not been renting this year. Industrial demand now is largely being driven by international and regional players that are not taking up spaces. However, even here we have not seen much interest, with many foreign companies not entering new leasing contracts on warehouses in 2016/2017. On the whole, people are confident about the long-term outlook of the sector due to a renewed confidence in Zambia and the overall economic growth outlook; however, trade volumes are still too low for many firms to warrant opening up an industrial space here. We need to see a substantial increase in regional and international trade in order for this to happen.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In terms of real estate markets, we have noticed increased interest from the education and health sectors, with many universities and colleges looking to expand their campuses. One of the factors that could have played a part in this is the rapid population growth in Zambia, with the largest demographic now being under 21 years old. Zambia is almost 50% urbanized, and we see growth in Lusaka and other cities across the country. However, there is a fair amount of agricultural land as well, which is where we should focus our attentions for development. Land in the immediate suburbs of the city has become more valuable for development rather than for agricultural use. Our clients have found that their land is now closer to the center, and that has led to active inquiries about how to best subdivide and service that land. There has been more subdivision of farm holdings in city suburbs, and overall there is greater use and development of farmland around the country. Only 40% of the arable land in Zambia is being farmed, so there is massive potential. However, only 10% of the land is under title, meaning there remains a great amount of work to be done by the authorities in terms of administering and processing land.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>There have been many new entrants coming into the market as infrastructure becomes more developed and roads improve as a result of government initiatives such as Project Link 8,000. This has made it easier to gain access to used car imports: in Zambia the used market remains dominant, comprising about 90% of the total market. Also, asset finance was more affordable in 2014-15, whereas in 2016 the currency was subject to instability and borrowing decreased as a result. The car market suffered because of this, declining 25% compared to 2015. We expect decreases of a further 10-15% in 2017. However, the vehicle market in Africa in general is developing and holds great future potential as one of the strong areas for Toyota in terms of future sales. The Zambian market is still hugely dominated by dual purpose and commercial vehicles. Many parts of the country do not have sealed roads, which means demand for single cabs, double cabs, land cruisers, and pick-up trucks still tops the list.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have a new double cab model launching in June 2017, which should grant us a little bit more market share. Nissan Zambia has been reasonably successful, with about 15-20% of market share. We started trading in August 2014 and it has seen quite good growth in a short time. After-sales is basically the bread and butter of our business. If we did not have a good after-sales service, we would not sell another new car. It is commonly said in the new car business that the salesperson sells the first vehicle and the after-sales will sell the rest. If we can show the motoring public we are there to look after them and can provide a trustworthy service, then they will trust in the brand. We are market leaders in Zambia, and it is a profitable market. Zambia is a good place for the brand to be and we have plans to build a new facility.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our aim is to spread our wings throughout Africa, and our sights are set on opening a dealership in Mauritius and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) once things calm down there. Mauritius has a large vehicle market, with strict controls on second-hand imports, meaning the whole economy revolves around brand-new vehicle sales. Moreover, the government has made purchasing a new vehicle feasible and attractive by offering tax benefits for consumers purchasing new vehicles. Our local footprint is also growing with the planned expansion plans for our Kitwe office, which will also be a base to serve the existing Isuzu Customer base in the DRC. We are also developing mobile vehicle servicing that will reach rural areas of Zambia, in towns like Livingstone and Solwezi. As our customer base in Zambia keeps expanding, we see the need to cater to our customers based in rural areas who cannot travel all the time to us when the vehicle is due for service.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>CFAO Automotive entered the Zambian market in 2001. The group's expansion initiatives originally focused on West Africa, but then we decided to move into other regions, beginning with Tanzania and Kenya, followed by Zambia. CFAO Automotive bought out the company that was operating the Nissan franchise here, and then later, in 2011, it purchased the company dealing with Ford motor vehicles. When Toyota Tsusho bought out CFAO, Nissan disassociated itself from the company, since it did not want to be grouped with other brands, and now functions as a separate business. After losing Nissan, CFAO changed its corporate strategy for the whole of East Africa, acquiring the VW franchise. Here in Zambia, therefore, CFAO runs both the VW and the Ford franchises, in addition to selling generators and Maxxis and Pirelli brands of tires. In March 2017 as part of our synergistic approach, we launched sales of Motul products, a French brand of lubricants and oils.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Achelis is a German-based company with headquarters in Bremen and subsidiaries all over Eastern Africa. Our regional hubs include Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, where we have workshops and distributorships for equipment and generators in stock. In Zambia, we are quite small, with our main focus in public procurement. We participate in government tenders and tenders by state-entities such as Zambia Railways and ZESCO. Since establishing here in 1996, although we are slightly on the small scale, we have done great business and experienced good turnover in the country. We benefited from the Zambian government's project to issue euro bonds, which is partly what led us to invest in the country and remain open to business here. Some of our biggest projects include working with ZESCO on XPLEcables and line material, working with the Ministry of Health, as well as on a EUR4 million deal with Zambia Railways for a rescue crane for rail accidents. In terms of latest developments, on the whole we are purely focused on working with governmental agencies. We seek to establish a business model financing medium-scale companies in Zambia.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>When the company was initially founded in 1958 with an original branch in Ndola and one opening in Lusaka shortly after, we undertook a broad band of contracting services, including Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning &amp; Refrigeration (HVAC-R), plumbing, and electrical. In the early 1990s, we decided to specialize and focus on heating ventilation air conditioning and refrigeration only. With our focus on HVAC-R we have now become the largest contractor and distributor in this sector in Zambia, offering services of the highest standard and quality. Drake &amp; Gorham has always been an innovator and trendsetter. We were the first company in Zambia to manufacture display fridges in the early 1980s. We were the first company in Zambia to partner with the air conditioner manufacturer Samsung, roughly 20 years ago. Drake &amp; Gorham is also the sole distributor for Daikin, the largest air conditioning manufacturer in the world, and also have our own in-house brand, Dragor, popular in the Zambian market. We are thus able to offer the most innovative air conditioning and refrigeration equipment globally available.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In Zambia, our main business segments are water supply, sanitation, and transportation. Elsewhere in the region, we are engaged in different projects for harbors, airports, and railways. In Zambia, however, these facilities, in particular railways, have not received much attention to date. It is our belief that rail could be the future solution to relieve the congestion of Zambia's roads, and Gauff could be a potential partner in revolutionizing Zambia's transportation make-up. In the consulting engineering industry, we see more and more companies coming into Zambia looking for business. Those firms come from nearby countries like South Africa, where perhaps the market situation has become more challenging. Zambia provides a wealth of opportunities for infrastructure-related projects. Indeed, in Lusaka and the Copperbelt Province, we are seeing a multitude of large-scale investments being made in the water sector: USD200 million provided by EIB for Mulonga Water and Sewerage Company, MCC's investment of USD355 million in Lusaka's water, sanitation, and drainage infrastructure, and over USD250 million for Lusaka Sanitation Program, financed by the World Bank, EIB, KfW, and the African Development Bank.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Good Time Steel is one of the largest steel producers in Zambia. In terms of range of products, we are the number one company in Zambia. We produce everything from tubes, deformed bars, and round bars, to angles, window frames, steel plates, and roof plates. Our sales grow every year as we see infrastructure building picking up incrementally YoY in Zambia. There is still a long way to go in terms of rolling out development here, with a lack of hospitals, roads, houses, and the like; however, we see an increased drive to improve this, which boosts demand for steel in the country. Every year we see 20-30% growth. In 2017, we are in the process of completely upgrading our furnace and equipment, with a new 6ha facility, a project cost about USD50 million. This will mean a new production process, new technology, and a new team. We imported our equipment—a steel furnace, ruling machines, and structures—from China. This is more environmentally friendly, of higher quality, and more efficient, reducing labor costs. When operational, our capacity will increase to 50,000 tons per year. When we started our business in 2008 we only produced rebar but now we cover everything including angle irons, roof sheets, and steel tubes, which are produced and manufactured here in the Zambian facility.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>BSI Steel is widely known and well supported in Zambia, despite some turbulence in the market and shifts in management in the last few years. We have made progress and made some purchases in a few sectors where we had pulled back our investments in the past. For example, our business in the Copperbelt has grown significantly, with some interesting projects cropping up in the latter half of 2016. We are also involved in exciting projects within Lusaka, such as assistance with the construction of a waterway to help with flooding up near Roma. We have also expanded business northwards into the DRC, serviced by our operation in Lubumbashi and supported by extra resources from our Copperbelt operation. We have taken on many more “cut and bend“ projects lately, which are growing in parallel to the advancing construction industry in Zambia. Our customers are varied. We have walk-in customers who are building or renovating their homes, as well as large construction companies working on large-scale projects, such as shopping malls, airports and warehouses. The cash flow for BSI is generally healthy, probably around a 40-60 split, with 40% corresponding to credit and 60% cash. We would like to see even more growth in cash sales with more purchases from the man in the street.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are the manufacturers of steel and plastic products. We then sell these to the Zambian market, with a focus on wholesale trade. We fabricate products for the local market only, and do not export to neighboring countries such as other steel producers. We manufacture building materials, for example, wire, nails, and roofing sheets and also trade steel products, such as beams, for which there is still no capacity manufacture domestically. We import these products mainly from South Africa and also have a supplier in Belgium. Our imported goods to in-house production ratio stands at 2:3—on average we import approximately 100 tons and produce 150 tons of material a month. We mainly focus on quality, since this is vital for any company to survive though we also have to consider the extra cost. Right now, we are only based in Lusaka but are building a branch of Oriental Steel in the Chambishi area, in the Copperbelt. We are involved indirectly with certain large projects all over the country, as we work with most of the large contracting companies. Generally, we do not undertake any construction projects directly but focus on manufacturing to supply our partners. We supply most of the construction companies, such as China Civil, as well as large hardware stores.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Overall, 2016 was extremely successful. We do not have the official industry figures yet but can confirm that we remain the market leader, with our gross written premium increasing from ZMK313 million to 353 million. I attribute this success to the confidence that the market continues to place in PICZ, the number-one insurer in Zambia now for at least the last five years. We are number one in terms of the top line and bottom line, and in both the corporates and retail line. We also have the largest liquidity reserves in the market, and are the only primary insurance company in Zambia to receive a credit rating, which stands at A+. Insurance penetration levels in Zambia are low, and we want to help in the drive to raise awareness. As a company, PICZ works with the IAZ to aid in this transition. In 2015 we sponsored the publication of a book, Insurance Basics: The Zambian Experience, authored by one of our own staff members, and we continue to sponsor an insurance column in the Times of Zambia. Beyond that, in 2017 PICZ has set a goal to engage with the media on this agenda to raise insurance awareness levels.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Considering that many business areas have been impacted negatively by adverse economic conditions, 2016 was an unexpectedly great year for Hollard. We grew by about 30%, our staff numbers increased, and we started planning an expansion into two other geographical areas, either in the east, south, or northwest of the country. This is all something of an achievement, given the difficult market this year, and our success is a result of our well-distributed network of insurance brokers and the support we have received from them throughout. Our business is broken down into corporate, commercial, and individual sub-fields. We have witnessed a shift in the overall success of these markets, with the corporate space being our traditional biggest source of business. An increased number of SMEs as well as a more influential middle-income sector have filtered into that commercial space, and because of this we plan to focus our attentions there in the near future. That said, we also look to penetrate the life insurance market. Our sister company, Hollard Life Insurance, has plans to expand in Zambia. Microinsurance is also worth mentioning, though it needs an improved legislative landscape in order to become a viable option for many Zambian citizens.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Zambia is an attractive insurance market, with a combination of low insurance penetration levels, a young and growing population, and a rapidly expanding middle class. Life insurance penetration here is less than 1%, so there is plenty of scope for the market to develop rapidly. The size of the potential target market for mainstream insurance is roughly 600,000-700,000 people, but this does not include the informal sector, where the majority of Zambians are employed. We plan to reach out to the informal sector through several channels. One of these is microinsurance; Prudential was the first company in Zambia to introduce a microinsurance product in 2011. A key challenge for the industry remains education—we need to continue to work on educating young people on the benefits of insurance. Also, the take-up of technology in the insurance sector here is at a nascent stage. While it is a vital part of the insurance back-office, as a tool for interacting with potential customers, it tends to favor more standardised products over life insurance. We are supportive of technology that makes insurance more comprehensible and will continue to assess the Zambian market, evaluating the ways in which technology can be harnessed to improve customer relations.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Since 2002, we have grown to become market leaders in Zambia, with 35% market share by revenue in 2015. Sanlam remains the unrivalled market leader in Zambia and we have 16 branches in Zambia, with 106 full-time employees and more than 500 direct sales agents. Our provision of insurance solutions to the informal sector is not an endeavor to bring our insurance clients from the informal sector to the formal sector; rather, we seek to provide insurance solutions to them in their existing circumstances and geographical locations. Our distribution philosophy is anchored on the need to not only reach the customer to sell insurance but to also be able to service the customer cost-effectively during the subsistence of the insurance policy. Each channel we deploy must therefore provide solutions to the whole value chain from sales, premium collection, policy servicing, and claims management. In this regard, we view the informal sector as a customer segment that can be reached by way of aggregation. In this model, we bundle our insurance solutions to the primary economic activity of each aggregated group. Our premium collection frequency is aligned to the seasonality and income cycles of the affinity memberships.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We saw early on that we would need a targeted strategy in order to stay afloat. Over time, if a company pushes to underrate to retain market share, it starts absorbing bad risks, too. So we established a disciplined approach; instead of writing for top-line insurance only, we started writing for bottom line, driving for more profitable, quality premium paying business. In addition, unlike our competitors, which remained focused on large towns, we developed a larger distribution strategy, especially for our agricultural insurance and motor insurance products. By spreading ourselves across all districts, we have established business in areas that our competitors are not able to reach. We have also invested considerably in raising personnel capacity, so that no insurance solution is too complicated for our staff, and we are able to advise our clients on the best possible strategy, whatever their specific needs. We also implemented a credit management policy, whereby we oblige our clients to pay premiums that are underrating or else the policy is cancelled. We hope to improve our market share by working with government agencies under the IDC. We also look at branch and district profitability, perhaps with a view to franchise off those branches that are not performing as well as we would hope.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our client base is extremely diverse, including small and large businesses, public entities, associations, professional services organizations, and private individuals. In terms of reaching out to new clients, we are mainly developing our other services on the back of our risk services clients. Furthermore, we are a global, well-known, and respected brand and are able to leverage on that. Most clients in Zambia, however, talk about reductions in spend. This has been the function of economic performance. The demand for insurance services will increase as the economy rebounds. The risk landscape has been flat. On the one hand, we have seen certain slight increments in risk. However, on the other, there have been no catastrophic losses or anything of that sort; therefore, the overall trend has been flat.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Aflife remains the largest private sector investment management firm. Our market share fluctuates between 56% and 62% at any time of the year depending on how the assets we manage perform. In the last three years, we have launched collective investment schemes to take advantage of new laws promulgated by the Pensions and Insurance Authority in 2011. We initially launched products for our institutional clients; however, in the last two years we have rolled out a plan to try and reach out to individual retail investors using the same platform. We acquired the requisite approvals to deal with individuals and have launched six products. Now, we are creating the infrastructural backbone to roll these products out as efficiently as possible. As the industry grows, we envisage business growth to come through products. Therefore, we initially focused on products for collective investment schemes to demonstrate our capacity, capability, and competence. These schemes are our flagship in terms of marketing and how we face our clients to showcase our offering and capabilities.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Aon Zambia is the leading insurance broking firm in Zambia. Currently, we operate two entities: Aon Zambia Risk Solutions and Aon Zambia Pension Fund administration. The former provides broking services to local entities as well as multinationals, and the latter offers a wide range of products in the pensions and administration space. The risk side focuses on both the short-term and long-term business, as well as risk management services. The market has not experienced much diversity in products and services and currently most of the services on the market are similar; rivalry among insurance providers is intense. Regarding long-term products, the most popular are life schemes, medical, and funeral products. Aon strives to break away from this set path by bringing in new services and products.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Madison Finance made a deliberate decision to shift operations toward a 50% MSME and 50% personal loans position because the MSME segment was seen as a major area for growth and development of the Zambian economy. Very few institutions focus on MSME lending primarily because of the risks associated with this segment. To counter this, one of the measures we have put in place for MSMEs is training in aspects such as bookkeeping, financial discipline, and general business management skills. We go beyond merely lending out money, but also building clients' capacity in terms of helping them understand the practicalities behind lending and borrowing. Additionally, we have in place guarantees to secure loan products under agriculture and sustainable energy products that provides further impetus for the company to pursue these sectors in business. The question of boosting MSMEs goes beyond the aspect of funding; it is about improving the status of customers in terms of their ability to produce more within the country and sustain their businesses.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In May 2014, FedEx Express acquired the business portfolio of its former service provider, Supaswift, in seven southern African countries: South Africa, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The acquisitions were a strategic move by the company to expand its network to the world's fastest-growing continent. We now offer a complete suite of export, import, and domestic solutions across southern Africa, connecting the region to more than 220 countries and territories worldwide, enhancing customers' business flexibility and speed to market. This region offers tremendous opportunities for local and international customers to access new markets, and Zambia in particular has a geographical advantage. Being landlocked, or rather, “land connected“ with eight neighboring countries, gives Zambia trade access to markets in central, eastern, and southern Africa. Zambia is also integrated within two free trade areas. Combined with the entrepreneurial boom underway in Africa, the country has the potential to become an attractive hub for manufacturing and export in the region.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our focus remains on underground and surface equipment, including drilling consumables, loading, and hauling equipment. We source the equipment from our manufacturing plants in Sweden and other parts of the world. We also work on developing our service support side of the business and other aspects of aftermarket sales. The majority of our growth comes from the mining segment, the drop in copper prices notwithstanding. That said, 2016 was difficult for us as well as many other players in the mining industry. To mitigate the adverse effects of the slowdown, our objectives shifted to internally reducing our cost structure, while still maintaining the same level of support for our customers. Our customers were also making similar changes, with everyone taking the same approach of aligning cost structures and growth rates. Atlas Copco weathered the storm well by targeting inefficiencies in the system: we are now in a better position for growth. The focus is on trying to make the organization as agile as possible.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The agriculture sector in Zambia has considerable potential. The soil quality in the country surpasses most other regions on the continent, as well as many other countries. For example, as a result of the properties and richness of the soil here, sugarcane cultivation is able to flourish more than in countries where it has traditionally been a staple crop, for example, Brazil. The rainfall pattern in Zambia is also, overall, remarkably good for growing crops. BASF is committed to seeing Zambia fulfill this potential. We have been working tirelessly and successfully with Zambian farmers to meet their specific needs regarding crop protection products. BASF believes that modern agriculture, including the responsible and appropriate use of crop protection products, is vital to meeting Africa's fast growing demand for food. In Zambia, BASF is one of the leading companies in crop protection. BASF continuously provides new and innovative agricultural solutions to help farmers improve their yields and the quality of their crops.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our guar business is the largest of all our projects. At the beginning of each planting season, we take our seeds to cooperatives and they grow them with the help of our technical specialists and economists. Later, we begin the collection process, with each cooperative nominating a collection point. Once collected, we store the seed in our warehouses before processing in the factory, using equipment imported from India. After processing, we are left with the guar split, which is exported, and the bi-product, which can be sold to livestock feed makers. Our project is in the southern province, though we are expanding. Guar has many uses, including as an adhesive agent, a gelling agent, and in confectionaries and cosmetics. In 2015, we harvested about 400 metric tons of guar seed. In 2016, capacity increased to 2,000 metric tons. At that time, we were working with 52 cooperatives. Expected outputs of guar are between 3,000 and 4,000 metric tons for the 2016-2017 season.</p>]]></sections31>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Morocco strengthening its relations with Zambia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Mohammed Boussaid </strong>The recent visit was the first official visit of His Majesty King Mohamed VI to Zambia. We are currently reinforcing our diplomatic relationship with Zambia, in line with our new approach of forging ties at both an economic and social level. The Zambian economy boasts huge potential for growth. The country's geography means investment in Zambia is also an investment in the eight countries that border it. Zambia is part of SADC and COMESA, which means it is well integrated into a network of cooperating states, all working together for a common goal. This is another asset for investors. What is more, there are many parallels that can be drawn between Morocco and Zambia, and, therefore, the relationship can also become an important one of knowledge sharing. The three priorities for Zambia's economy are also Morocco's priorities: agriculture, tourism, and energy. In these areas, Morocco has experience and expertise. As such, on this visit we have signed 19 agreements with the Zambian government, most of which are with the private sector, in all areas, from human development projects to renewable energy. </p><p><span></span><strong>Salaheddine Mezoua</strong>r There were six or seven agreements consolidating the legal relationship between the two countries, as well as agreements from private-to-private sectors and public-to-private. These were in a number of fields. For example, we know that the potential for agricultural development in Africa is tremendous. Morocco has a rich and successful history in agricultural development, and our neighbors acknowledge this and ask us to bring this experience to the table. We want to help structure the development of agriculture, contributing to the know-how, investment, and investment planning in agro-business. Regarding the issue of minerals, the African continent, and in particular Zambia, boasts significant resources. When we consider that currently 70% of the Zambian economy depends on such exports, it is obvious that structuring the industry effectively can be key to creating wealth and employment. However, at the moment, there is extraction and export but no transformation, and if there is no transformation, no value-addition to raw products, then there is a minimum cap on the amount of wealth and in-country employment that can be created. This was the motivation behind the signing of the memorandum of understanding between the Zambian Ministry of Mines and Morocco's office for hydrocarbons and mining (ONHYM). </p><h4>What are you doing to encourage further integration across the continent? </h4><p><span></span><strong>MB </strong>In Morocco, we believe strongly in South-South cooperation. We also believe that through regional integration, we can cooperate with each other to solve many problems ourselves. We can share public policies and experiences. That is why, in the last 15 years, His Majesty has made around 45 visits to 26 different countries. In this time, His Majesty has put Africa on the top of the list of priorities for foreign relations, because of this strong conviction that the continent, which has for many years had negative connotations, can represent hope for humanity and the world. It is a dynamic continent, with many social and economic transformations taking place over the last decade. The growth rate on average has been at about 5%, many countries have stable governments, and democracy is widespread. All of these developments shed a positive light on the continent, in turn unveiling new opportunities to invest and collaborate. This is leading to mass job creation and sustained development. </p><p><span></span><strong>SM</strong> Returning to the African Union after more than 30 years away is like a return to our institutional family. Morocco has always been involved in Africa. After South Africa, Morocco is the second-largest African investor on the continent. In 2020, we have ambitions to become the first not only in terms of economic development, but also in terms of human development and culture. Morocco also fully supports the process of spreading peace across the continent. Many parts of Africa face challenges of fighting extremism and to do so it is crucial to boost cooperation among nations. His Majesty Mohammed VI has a vision for Africa. Africa is a continent with great potential, a continent of the future, but one grappling with many obstacles. Thus, the continent has two alternatives: become a problematic continent for the rest of the world in terms of democracy and political stability, or become a driving force—as one of the landmasses with a rapidly growing population—behind ensuring global peace and security. Morocco entered the African Union with this vision in mind. We want to share with our neighbors all that we have acquired in terms of experience, know-how, and capacity, to add value to the continent. There is a new generation of Africans, with potential, ideas, and innovation. The problem is organization, cooperation, and learning to work together. The visit to Zambia was part of Morocco's commitment to strengthening our ties with all African countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Shopping malls became popular in Panama in the last 15 years or so; however, for many years there were only two or three to which people could go shopping and also enjoy free time. In the last two years, there has been a boom in shopping malls and the trend is to consolidate the size of malls and design something that is friendlier to the public. We are trying to attain the top and best brands in each retail segment. We also seek to create special family experiences through shopping, entertainment, and leisure time at the mall. In Panama, people visit shopping malls at least one day out of the weekend and they do not go to malls just to shop; they also want to enjoy other activities. Our main goal is to open 95% of the shops. Then, the goal is to create traffic for the mall. We are the new mall so we have to create this constant traffic that we do not have yet. Weekends are relatively busy; however, during the week people are not in the habit of coming here yet. We have to change their habits and encourage people. It is a process that takes time and the right approach. We have to offer what they want and then they will come.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Spirit Wine Group is a young company, having started in 2004. We started with just three brands, and now have more than 35 vendors with over 600 products. Our portfolio is extensive and covers the most important categories of spirits. For example, we have whiskey such as Chivas and vodkas such as Absolut. Our focus is to provide premium products in the spirits market such as Tequila Patron, which is recognized as one of the best tequila brands in the world. We are part of the Duty Free of Americas, which is a large group; however, we work independently. We also have a large portfolio of wines, comprising every region of the world, including France, Italy, and Spain as well as Australia, Argentina, and Chile. Chilean wines, in particular, are prominent in the Panamanian market. Wine consumers today are more demanding and want to taste new flavors. We also carry certain drinks that are inexpensive and in the “easy to drink“ category. Our strategy is to focus on providing high-quality customer services. In this market, companies often try to focus on one area; however, we aim to diversify our brands and always leave the door open to new opportunities.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>I could have opened a fine restaurant years ago, where I would cook and have my audience with reservations and high prices, but I did not identify with that. Globally there has been a movement for 10 years now of fast casual, which is a healthy, good, fast, and affordable meal in a pleasant atmosphere. Around 10 years ago, there were few options and several brands in the US started to develop that sector. It was great, people embraced that idea, and in Panama there was nothing like it so we entered the Athanasiou business. We have done well, and now even better with Suvlas. We have a number of projects scheduled for 2017 despite being such a new brand; we are opening approximately 10 branches, and the idea is to expand in the region and other countries in the next two or three years. Basically, the agenda focuses on four categories: price, taste, innovation, and speed, because people have less money and time, and health is more relevant. Before, there was not much focus on health issues because of a lack of information. Studying the fast casual market, it is estimated that by 2020, 75% of the consumer base will be millennial or will share their mentality and prefer fast casual.</p>]]></sections21>

In Panama, we need more research in universities and to build top quality research institutes.  Though a transformation is now underway at the University of Panama and UTP, our institution has already had one as leading research institute. In 2016, we had almost 60 publications; therefore, we think it fit to call Panama the science hub of Central America. We are mainly focusing on biomedicine and biodiversity and interdisciplinary sciences. We cross discipline with mathematics, physics, chemistry and even social sciences. One other important aspect is that it is not just a number, it is about the quality. They should be competing at the international level, with high-ranking scientific journals like Lancet and Nature Biotechnology. We are publishing in these kinds of places, which is difficult but gives confidence to our people when they are able to do so. We train under and postgraduates and school kids as interns. We have lot of foreign students visit our institute for internship. The institute does lot of innovations in Panama.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Since its inception, we have consolidated the presence of City of Knowledge as a place where important universities, research centers, high-tech companies as well as international organizations are part of an environment centered around innovation. We work on having a stronger presence in other parts of Panama besides Panama City. The leadership has always relied on the private business community and we have accompanied the creation of a competitiveness center for the western region. It is positive that the City of Knowledge can insert itself in a dynamic that is promising and includes research, application of knowledge, promoting entrepreneurship, and incorporating marginal groups. A similar movement is just beginning in Azuero. The City of Knowledge was the place where the entrepreneurship community started when we created the first business incubator 15 years ago. We then had a meeting with a group from Mexico that was linked to Silicon Valley. It came here to establish relationships and enhance entrepreneurship in the country. At the City of Knowledge, we want to create opportunities. In another field, we will activate a simulation health-training center here. It is an agreement signed by the Director of Social Security, the Minister of Health, and SENACYT with the technical support of the University of South Florida.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have a great deal of dialog with the private sector; for example, there is a plan to build a liquefied natural gas terminal near Colón and we have been in talks about the scientific information that is needed. There is also interest in hiring interns or students to collect data. We have worked with Minera Panama, which invested heavily in helping us preserve the Rana, a national symbol of Panama that is now extinct in the wild. Fortunately, with Minera's support scientists were able to go out into the field about 10 years ago and collect enough of them to preserve the species. We receive donations from international companies as well. Regarding our internal capacity-building, 42% of our interns and fellows are from Latin American, and half of these are from Panama. We have in total about 900 students with another 600 university-level professors who come to our facility every year on average to work in the areas of forest ecology, ecology, marine biology, and so on. They come from over 50 countries around the world. Our impact and reach is much bigger than just our small cohort in Panama. Our 1,500 scientific visitors per year and our core staff produce about 400 scientific publications annually. Every 19 hours there is a new publication released, and a significant number of them are in the top scientific journals of the world.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our university focuses on the medical and healthcare aspect of activities. We seek to provide a qualified workforce to serve the medical sector. Demand for nurses and experts in radiology is growing in Panama. A huge problem here is that all the managers and heads in hospitals in the public sector are usually not well qualified. That is why we seek to address this issue with a solid program that addresses the student community here that is willing to be part of the healthcare sector. Future professionals in this field must be able to manage a hospital. That is why we have activated a master's program in healthcare management and another in medical auditing. It is a sector with a great deal of potential. My target is to develop a new master's program in physiotherapy, nutrition, and dentistry. I would also like to start a master's program in project evaluation and one in environmental management. All these segments are extremely important for the national economy, and we are perfectly aligned to promote the development of the country. In 2014, when I started, we had 20 students. Now, our university has reached more than 300 students. This has been solid development and growth in a few years. We seek to diversify our offerings with specific programs; it is fundamental to have collaboration between the public and private sectors.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The country has recently begun to develop itself as educational hub, attracting more and more business schools in the last few years. It recently opened its doors to higher education organizations and schools, now positioning the country as a great regional platform in the sector. Panama offers the possibility of gaining valuable working experience in high-class multinationals and regional organizations. Additionally, the professional market is wide and varied. Overall, this has made the country much more competitive and attractive to foreign investment. Our main challenge is to educate and train the country's workforce according to the speed and quality of development the country and its companies require. There is a certain gap between the needs of the companies and the educational sector. Currently, Panama is an important business center in Central America. As such, we understand the importance of the country, and ADEN's development strategy goes in that direction. We see Panama as a regional hub for business and higher education in business studies. We have been here for more than 12 years, and our educational offerings target mainly executive directors and directors of companies. Thanks to our regional presence across Latin America, our students can complete a portion of their studies in other countries. This is one of our main competitive advantages: our regional presence across Latin America.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have to focus on manpower and are concentrating our efforts to prepare better people to work onboard vessels and within the maritime sector. There is a global lack of marine officers and technicians and we have a great opportunity to address that issue as we are a maritime country. The university is focused on preparing more professionals to work onboard vessels. For these professionals, this is the first career they will have and is a great opportunity to change their lives. There are great salaries in this industry; for example, a 22-year-old has the ability to earn USD3,500 a month, which is difficult to find not only here in Panama, but in the world. Their lives and the lives of others will change, and they will contribute to the national GDP. At the same time, those who choose this profession will become more confident. The focus is manpower; this is how we contribute to the country and the region. We have an academic curriculum that can truly enhance the quality of life here in Panama. Our goal is to be a first-class, first-world university; we need to reach that level. We need to ensure our students are well prepared in the academic area, as well as have the best ethics. Our men and women are ambassadors of our culture outside of Panamanian waters.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We want to continue consolidating our ground in Panama, where people know The Group and its strong reputation. We concentrate on developments for Panamanians and Panamanian residents with a focus on properties from USD60,000-150,000. We even look to enter the rentals market. We have focused on doing social and preferential housing in the USD60,000-120,000 bracket. For the other buildings we have been developing, we focus on prices from USD120,000 up to USD200,000. This is the reason for our success and is why we have an advantage. We have projects to put on the market and continue to sell to expatriates who come to Panama for work and will live in the country for one or two years. They get residency and with that they can apply for mortgages. Those developers building projects in the USD250,000-500,000 price bracket are the ones that have been affected. Developers with projects under construction have to react to changes in the market and reduce their costs, while those working in our price bracket have been the most successful in doing so. Certain developers, instead of continuing with their original project, modify part of their plan, for example by reducing the apartment sizes.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We want to generate value by creating social spaces, boosting the sense of community, improving human interaction and efficiency in the use of the urban spaces, and so on. Currently, the most eco-friendly places in the US are cities because the density of people sharing that space with fewer emissions makes it more efficient than having people live far apart and using a car for everyday life. We are currently focused on developing projects outside Panama City. There are two main reasons for this. The first is that when developing our first town center we did not have the resources, credibility, or track record to develop in a dense and expensive urban setting such as Panama City; therefore, it was easier to make an impact in suburbs, smaller cities, and towns rather than in Panama City. Also, the opportunities in these areas are as big or larger than the ones in Panama City; these communities have been historically underserved, have an identity that needs to be showcased, and no one has capitalized on the opportunity and the value to do so. For example, our project Market Plaza Las Tablas is a cultural platform to strengthen its identity, culture, and folklore, encouraging local and international tourism.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We now have five projects under construction and will start two to three projects within this year and the next. As a partner of Santa Maria we believe in the idea. It will be a unique project in Panama as it is the largest gated community, measuring 250ha; it is a huge project. There are many small projects that are gated, though not large communities like this. The idea of having green areas, a golf course, security, and a high quality of life in Santa Maria is something special that people will want to be a part of. When we design our projects, we take a great deal of time to sit down with our architects to determine the little details. That is how we differentiate ourselves from the competition; it is all in the details. We look for that unique factor that will set us apart. We work with architects like Eduardo, who is working on one of our projects, namely Santa Maria Park with VerdeAzul. It is a beautiful project with green roofs. We already have a silver LEED certification for Santa Maria Park. Eduardo is an architect who looks for innovative ideas and we make sure these are things that will set us apart from others.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The trend in the city center is for smaller apartments. The city has grown and people who currently live on the outskirts face transportation problems; they want to come back into the city center to live. That is our focus right now, and most of the competition is also starting to tackle this market. For example, we have the Bella Vista Residence project in the middle of the city. There are another eight projects being built around the same area in the same price range and size. That is where the market is moving toward currently. The unique aspect of the Bella Vista Residence is that it offers the amenities of a more exclusive building, within a smaller space of between 90sqm and 120sqm. This represents good value for the size and price. Residents get the amenities and features of a USD500,000-plus apartment for only USD200,000-230,000. The apartments are suitable for small families, couples, newcomers to Panama, young people who want to move into the city to be closer to work and save time, and local or foreign investors. It is an area that offers people nightlife, supermarkets, metro links, and is next to the financial district.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Grupo VerdeAzul today is a well-diversified group. We develop and manage real estate and hospitality assets and invest in other companies and industries via third-party managed funds, in addition to venturing more recently into logistics and agroindustry. We started out with the Bristol Hotel in Panama City and the beach development Buenaventura, as at the time the family's main business was banking. With the success of Buenaventura in the Panamanian market, real estate turned into our main business. With the growth of Buenaventura came the construction of our second hotel, the Bristol Buenaventura Resort—today the JW Marriott Panama Golf &amp; Beach Resort—which served as a window for more visitors to discover Buenaventura. The group continued to invest in other real estate projects apart from Buenaventura not only on the Pacific Coast but in the country's capital as well. The Bristol Hotel positioned us as the reference for luxury, high quality, attention to detail, and understated elegance, and when we launched the beach community Buenaventura, our brand was associated automatically with good taste and excellence.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Panama holds the most comprehensive maritime community in Latin America. This played an important role in our decision to establish ourselves here. Some of the other companies complain about the lack of a skilled workforce; however, Panama is one of the few places in Latin America where you can get people with a maritime background and education. The other is the geostrategic location, which is a common feature for all the companies here. Panama is a hub for both sea and air transport with ambitions to develop the logistic sector further. Höegh Autoliners has the same ambitions and this is also one of the reasons we are expanding our role in the supply chain here. Our presence in Panama and the region is a mix of serving and facilitating intra-regional trade and offering a global reach through our deep-sea network. Höegh Autoliners is today the only Ro-Ro shipping company that can offer 22 destinations in the Caribbean connecting to Mexico, Panama, South Florida and all the small Caribbean islands as well as the rest of the world. With an extensive global network, our customers experience a seamless high-quality product from load to final discharge port.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We came to Panama because we saw a great opportunity. We saw a country that was growing and needed more expertise, which we could provide, and a stable environment to invest in. We are in a niche market. Panama has been important for us because it has been easy to integrate in the region. 2017 is a year of change for us; we have the Canal expansion that the industry is trying to adapt to. Recently, the 1,000th vessel passed the Canal and the bunker sector has started to feel the effects since November and December. Certain bunker companies have purchased new equipment while others bring in new vessels just to better understand the needs of these vessels. We need larger ships with better pumping rates. The impact is real; the market is changing and volumes are growing. The number of ships is gradually slowing down and this forces companies to be much more professional in their work. This has a real and positive impact on the market. There are also certain opportunities for LNG carriers. We see ship-to-ship transfers taking place here and eventually Panama can become a hub for LNG just like we are for fuels.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>This office oversees all the American countries in which we operate. We decided to keep our US office as the regional one for sales and move all HQ functions to Panama; finance, compliance, credit, HR, operations, and everything else with the exception of sales was moved to Panama. The location of Panama was a major part of that decision. We are focused on three markets, Mexico, Panama, and Colombia, and it made great sense to be in Panama because it connects well with the other two countries. We will do whatever it takes to make sure that everything with our customer goes well. We have this Scandinavian mindset of paying attention to details to ensure the excellence of our operations. We want to have the same service in all ports and that is a challenge in this part of the world because there is always a strong bureaucracy. We are successful in Panama in building relationships and partnerships that we could not do unless we were based in here. Some of the most challenging and largest shipping companies in the world refuel here and we are pleased to service many of them on a regular basis.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Yobel SCM is supply chain management company with 50 years of experience in logistics and supply chain. We started our operations in Lima, Peru, and began expanding into Latin America by opening up operations in other countries like Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama. In Panama, we have two facilities: Parque Sur, which is one of the leading logistics parks in the country for its level of infrastructure and service, and Panama Pacifico, a free trade economic zone. We use this facility for international clients that need to export their products. One of the main challenges that we face is to be more efficient than our competitors by providing the best services for our clients. We started in 2010 and have significantly expanded our physical capacity. In 2016, we received an award for Best Corporative Operation, as we are the fastest-growing company in the segment in which we operate. We have double-digit growth here in Panama. This accelerated growth has not been easy; however, it is a remarkable achievement considering that the logistics sector in Panama is extremely saturated, with a great deal of competition. We are constantly fighting to get new clients, and succeeding.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our portfolio is about 30% airfreight and 70% ocean freight. The majority of our airfreight volume comes from Europe for Brazil. Because airfreight is expensive, it is only used for matters that must reach a place at a certain time. We manage a great deal of parts and other components for the offshore gas drilling rigs and they must have their parts as it costs them millions of dollars a day to be shut down and they, thus, ship it by air. We also started a document custody business in Venezuela about 25 years ago as no one else was doing it at that time. Many government offices started to reconsider the need to protect their documents after a large fire broke out in a tower in Caracas where the government infrastructure division lost a large amount of information. We worked with divisions of the government as well as other businesses such as oil companies like Schlumberger, Halliburton, and other companies that were our customers. Many banks, for example, must maintain certain sensitive documents such as deposits, checks, contracts, and account information for a certain amount of time and they need to be secure and regulated in terms of humidity and so on.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>DB Schenker has been in Panama since 1981; our headquarters are in Germany and we have around 2,000 offices in 130 countries around the world. Ocean freight, mostly from Asia, is our main business in Panama; we are the market leader in ocean imports from Asia while airfreight is our second-largest product followed by land transportation. Land transportation is mostly exports from the Colón Free Zone to Central America and even though we only started it in 2016, it is a growing market. We saw great opportunities in airfreight and the market is supportive of our airfreight services. We currently transport perishables, pharmaceuticals, and spare parts from Panama, and business is great. There is also sea freight; every company in Panama conducts sea freight from somewhere but not everyone does airfreight or exports and it thus requires a more qualified and professional service. In addition, a pharmaceutical company requires a company to take care of its cargo on the other side; they need someone who will not only do the billing but also receive the cargo on the other, work with temperature control devices, and so on. This is where we can truly differentiate ourselves from the other local or regional players.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>When GLESEC was established, I wanted to do something different and seize other opportunities. Panama was not in fact on my radar; however, after I contacted certain people they invited me to the country, where I discovered a great opportunity. The country is growing rapidly, it has connectivity and communications infrastructure, it is close to the US, and it is easy to travel to all Latin American countries from there. There are two potential markets, domestic and international. The domestic market is changing quickly and growing rapidly; the maturity of the market is growing. In 2011, the banking regulatory entity signed an agreement with the banking association, outlining the requirements for the financial sector regarding information security and compliance. This involves both governance and infrastructure in order to protect clients' information. This is just an example of how the market is changing; when we started these regulations did not exist and we were “preaching“ to the market, whereas now it is more mature.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Intelsis belongs to the Inbursa Group and has been in Panama for 12 years. It was established in 1986. We have partnered with important customers in Panama such as the Chamber of Commerce, Tocumen Airport, Tropigas, and Ralph Lauren and have market share in both Panama City and the FTZ. Over the last five years, we have seen an impressive increase of investment in the industry. There used to be a certain resistance from many sectors and investors. However, we have managed to change that cultural understanding and, with the arrival of more companies, Panama has indeed become a technological hub. Many companies have understood the need to enhance the commercial experience of their customers, and technology plays a key role here. Many companies chose Panama due to the stability of its local and regional economy over the last few years, as well as the increasing number of foreign companies operating there. In this context, this also contributed to increasing investment in technology in the country, including in the public sector, which has boosted e-services in all tax and fiscal activities over the last few years.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are the premier provider of leading-edge IT solutions throughout Central America and Ecuador. Born as a service company in the IT industry, we have developed into a robust business partner that offers hardware, software, and innovative, high-tech IT solutions—but service remains at our core. So it is not only about the hardware. We do not just provide a server; we provide an entire IT solution. We provide the hardware with the operating systems, the structured cabling, communications, security, and everything else that relates to the initial IT platform. On top of that, clients require particular applications that are specific to their industry. TECNASA is able to be a multi-industry service provider because we can offer every sector the IT platform. We are a B2B company and all of our clients are corporations. A small percentage comes from the government sector; however, the majority is large- to mid-sized corporations from the private sector. We also have certain smaller companies as clients. Our target market and clients are the corporations and businesses in all the countries we operate in.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Technology is an accelerating wheel, creating tools that themselves make the production of tools more productive as an enabler. That makes it hard for vertical sectors to keep up. The level of innovation in this sector is high. We position ourselves as the innovation arm of some of those sectors. We first select and recruit talent based on their performance and potential. Then we cultivate this talent to make it vertical in the market. We have been in operation since 2001 and have been through a few phases. We gained the trust of our clients by performing reliably and transparently. We cannot provide them with sophisticated solutions because we are not an R&amp;D company, even though we do R&amp;D. We do more development than R&amp;D. What sets us apart from our competitors is the ability to detect an opportunity to assemble and integrate technology that provides an impactful solution that is still low risk for the client even though it is not available in the market the way the client is.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We currently target a whole range of sectors because with Smartbytes' growth we have gained customers from various sectors and countries, including Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and other South American countries such as Peru. In terms of penetrating the healthcare market, we have a partnership with a hospital. The customers in this sector are changing; however, the mentality of doctors is difficult to change as their views are old fashioned. The market has changed in the retail industry where shops are closing and there is a shift to e-commerce. Other IT companies, for example in Peru, that do not have the same implementation expertise as Smartbytes, are also hiring us. They call on us to help them implement projects; for example, together with a competitor, we helped implement some big projects in Panama. Smartbytes specializes in IT talent and we have to invest in our employees' talent. We have 26 employees but are able to compete with companies that have 2,000 employees.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The strategic importance of this market can only increase. Along with our head office in Germany we want to create a hub for innovation in this region. The exact location has yet to be confirmed, but we are looking into having multiple country locations because we have different focuses in different locations. Costa Rica is a good finance hub, and Peru has good universities and vocational schools. The City of Knowledge would be an interesting platform to establish a competitive research center in Panama. Our idea is to cooperate with leading universities from different countries to improve our innovation in this region. We are contributing to innovation as well as knowledge transfers. The lack of qualified people is the main obstacle to the company's expansion in Panama. When we started, it was difficult to work together with vocational schools.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>One of the strengths of Unilever is that we are able to make decisions more quickly because of our location in Panama. We take care of the logistics volumes from Mexico to Ecuador, including Central America and the Caribbean. From here, we have a center of excellence from where we can make faster decisions regarding our customers, consumers, and these countries. As we are able to make decisions faster, we provide better service for our customers. For example, in 2016 we won excellence awards and we were recognized by the government with “Premio Nacional de Logistica 2016“ after successfully implementing projects with our key customers for our service and in Mexico. Having better communication helps us generate more knowledge for people, improve our service, and reduce costs. For the consumer goods business to grow in Panama, we need to take better care of our distribution and the country has to still work on simplifying and speeding up processes.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are one of the first multinationals that decided to set up operations in Panama. The main reason was because of the central location of the company and the country's banking system. It started to be a logistic hub for the region, particularly with the construction of the canal and the rail and air connections. It also uses dollars, which offers us stability and makes it easy for us to operate outside of Panama. As soon as we started to grow, we moved to other countries, keeping Panama as the hub. We have a front office that essentially takes care of all the countries that we do not manage directly. We also have a back office that helps us operate in an international and multicultural environment here. We have operations that run 24 hours and are our financial hubs. We also have customer service centers that manage all our spare part services for the Americas.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The largest market in the region that we support is undeniably food and beverages. For example, in terms of levels of operation in the industry, Guatemala is the second-largest producer of sugar cane mills in America after Brazil. We have a great deal of business with the food and beverage industry there. The second is oil and gas because our largest businesses in countries such as Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Trinidad are in this sector. However, when we talk about Central America, like Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, or Honduras, the levels of operation of the oil and gas industry are lower. In terms of mining, we consider countries such as the Dominican Republic, Peru, and Bolivia, where we have high mining activity. When we have cement, we consider most of the countries because we have a cement plant in each of them.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Banistmo had a positive performance aligned with the output of the financial sector of 2016. We managed to reconfirm ourselves as the second-largest bank in the country and have an aggressive consolidation strategy, both for commercial banking and the individual segment. It was a challenging year; however, we are a resilient bank and have the skills to continually reinvent ourselves with a tailor-made strategy. 2016 ended with a positive performance by the bank, in particular in two fundamental aspects. The first is the growth of deposits with Banistmo. The aim of every single financial institution is to grow its deposits, which are one of the main indicators of the performance of a bank, and we are no exception. Hypothecary credit grew as well, with a focus on single individuals. In Panama there are still many opportunities for companies to attract new clients. There is still a deficit as far as the availability of houses in the country. The bank's borrowing activity is currently quite active. Our solvency is close to USD1 billion, which is higher than the minimum requirement. Since 2016 we have been more market sensitive and are thus consolidating ourselves as the leading consumer bank in Panama. In terms of personal borrowing, lending, and credit cards, we started to better understand the behavior of our clients and how they buy and make repayments.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>2016 was a challenging year for Panama. First we had the Panama Papers, and later we had the Waked Group situation. There are two main things to remember. Panama just got off the FATF gray list, meaning we are in a great position to recover everything that had to do with our legislature in terms of money laundering and counter terrorism. We need to continue to work with our international partners to protect the integrity of the Panamanian system. Panama has taken many steps to promote transparency, fairness, and compliance with the standards set by GAFI and the OEC. That is where the country made the biggest improvement this year. Then, the Waked crisis came and had a negative impact on the country's image. When something like this happens, it threatens the stability of the system. Fortunately, we were able to come up with a solution in accordance with our partners in the US. The banking system in Panama is continuing to grow. Local banks had to establish stronger reserves in order to comply with current regulations from the Superintendence of Banks. That has forced financial institutions to be more responsible and prudent. We have no central bank here and do not have a discount window, which makes our banks very conservative in the way they conduct business.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our acquisition of Citigroup was a successful transaction. We have always been a conservative bank and that will not change; however, there is a global strategy to be bigger and better with credit cards. This transaction was mainly a bet on the country, its growth, and the credit card portfolio that Citi had built. We had 28,000 clients before and now have over 100,000; therefore, it was also a customer base acquisition. This was a success because the acquisition involved a bank that was well placed and well recognized for unsecured lending mortgages, while another bank was mainly recognized and successful in placing secured products like credit cards. The cross-selling potential of those two products is fantastic. We now have the product, and our customer base grew correspondingly. We are currently going through the integration process, which is a challenge with every acquisition, and everything is on schedule. After everything, our bank was established as a corporate commercial bank funded by Canada in 1974; however, its business started to change in 2007 and 2008. Currently, 65% of our assets continue to be corporate commercial, while 35% is retail. With our acquisition of the Citibank portfolio, the retail increases significantly in terms of customers and employees, though the assets were not that large relative to what we had.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>At this moment, the new trends in Panama are a move toward a more renewable energy matrix; the entry of gas with the next regasification plant will change the way energy is being generated. The third line from Chiriquí­ will also change the way energy is distributed and generated. Unlike other countries, Panama will not go for 100% renewable because gas is not completely renewable; however, it is cleaner than other fossil fuels. That is a change toward where the matrix is headed. This summer has been a barometer of what support for wind and solar energy will represent for Panama in the future. We have two clearly defined businesses that come from the company's new long-term strategy. We are in the traditional generation of power and in that traditional generation we also have renewable, particularly in Panama; we are in hydraulics. We also have Bahia de las Minas, which currently has coal and is in the process of transformation. The contracts are until 2018 and we are waiting for the start of new long-term bidding. That process of transformation includes the conversion toward gas.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>trong demand growth continues to impact the sector. On the generation side, the supply mix is constantly evolving. This market will have a new coal-fired plant shortly and at least one, potentially three, new gas-fired projects in the next five years. Panama currently has a maximum demand of approximately 1,700MW and these gas projects are large, averaging around 500MW each, so if we have two or three of those projects, it significantly changes the profile of the sector with the majority of current oil-fired capacity becoming obsolete. On the hydro side, there have not been any medium-to-large scale hydro projects being actively developed in the last 12 months. The only large project being considered is Changuinola II, but with all the issues surrounding Odebrecht, that project will need to be restructured before advancing. Additional small-scale hydro, wind, solar, and biomass projects continue to be evaluated and developed. The price signals that we as developers have received over the last 12 months are not as strong as they were in the past. There has been significant investment in renewables, particularly on the hydro side, in the last five years.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>GreenWood was motivated to move to Panama, as it could introduce new technologies in the market. What we are doing now in northern Central America is competing using advanced technologies. If we talk about solar, we know it needs net-measuring program for solar panels for homes and businesses. That is why we operate in Panama and the Dominican Republic: both countries have great regulations. For example, Panama has a maximum individual power-generating limit of 500kW and in 2016 this limit was lifted. This is a specific regulation for solar energy that may be part of the new framework that allows clients to install as much solar energy as they like. This is the most aggressive regulation in Central America. If a client consumes more than 10MW/hour/year we can design a solar farm over their roof or car park with the aim of covering their annual consumption. The government should help people with some task-specific regulations to make this investment more attractive for clients. In general, we see a great deal of potential from hospitals, industry and logistics, agriculture, and big chicken farms.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>If you have a look at the latest tenders you will see that the government is focusing on the development of the LNG market, and taking advantage of the Panama Canal expansion. Indeed, it has already changed the distribution channels of LNG, which will give rise to many new opportunities. Then again, Panama has to take a piece of the cake or a share of the opportunities not only in logistics but also in the energy sector to reduce the price of electricity. Once they focus on that area, you will see that with the projects like the one from Martano and AES and even LNG Power, which still has a few issues to resolve, these are the main trends where the gas sector will leave its footprint on our market. The other important one is solar energy for self-consumption, which is giving clients the opportunity to reduce the impact of energy costs in their operations. Finally, it is active in Panamanians' initiatives to support energy efficiency and the use of clean energy like wind, which with latest forecast technologies has the opportunity to deliver a deal of great support to Panama's energy mix.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Our client base includes blue-chip companies such as Tropigas gas stations and Delta Petroleum gas stations; we have done six installations for it and our solar plant is the largest on earth with micro inverters. We also have residential customers for projects as small as 10 panels to projects involving 8,000 cell panels. We do the whole range based on different customer needs. We also focus on what our customers truly require, taking the time to ensure we determine exactly what each customer needs and then designing a system that fits those needs. Once the system is installed and finalized, if it has a net meter, we provide customers with post-sales support and the technical know-how to ensure they have a great experience. We take care of any issues that may arise with the electrical distributor. We also offer customers the O&amp;M for each project's needs at cost, and this assures our customers that they will have a working system generating the energy that was projected at the start, that their financials will pan out and satisfy estimates, and that they will have a reliable system that will not break down or present technical problems.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>People not only have to perceive that the country is transparent; it also has to be transparent. There have been a lot of reforms in this regard, and the challenge now is to implement them and show the world they are working. Panama needs to reinforce its commitment to transparency regarding all the corporate scandals in the country by reviewing their operations, supervision, and regulations without compromising the privacy and confidentiality of people with a right to it—it is a fine balance and compromise that is needed. The FDI figures are still strong. Relative to GDP, FDI is still at about 10%. So there is a strong foreign investment presence in the country. When you look at FDI in terms of sources, most of it is reinvestment of profits: That shows that people are committed to the investments they are reaping here. Investors are also highly diversified, although still dominated by the US and Colombia. Panama has an open economy with no capital flow restrictions, and there are plenty of opportunities for investors in different sectors. The activities and sectors directly or indirectly related to the expanded canal are but one. Panama also offers all sorts of opportunities in other sectors like tourism, financial services, infrastructure, energy, education, and agriculture. I would encourage all sorts of investors to look into investing in the country.</p><p><br></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Certain sectors in Panama are economic engines. One is construction, though this is slowing down. Another is tourism; however, we need to increase and improve training in that sector to realize its high potential. Energy is also a key issue, especially clean energy. Furthermore, we need to offer new and different services in shipping and logistics beyond just the ships crossing the canal. Then, there is food production and agriculture. That sector contributes only 2.5% of GDP but employs 15-20% of the workforce. We need to focus on agro-industry and ways to produce more with less, as well as boost productivity and efficiency. We have to focus our engines of growth on education and training for jobs, as well as health. Quality education is a must for a level playing field and a just society. In politics, we need a clear and consistent roadmap for the next 25-30 years that is adhered to no matter what government comes into power. There are five Panamas in my view: the modern Panama, the urban marginal Panama, the middle-class Panama that pays taxes for subsidies for other Panamanians, the rural-agricultural Panama, and the indigenous Panama of the comarcas. Therefore, we need to consider all these Panamas.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>CIFI migrated to Panama for several reasons. First, since we operate in US dollars it was more consistent with our lending guidelines to be based in a dollarized country in the region; hence, Panama was chosen as the best option. Also, in addition to CIFI's own equity we borrow money from the market to accompany our growth. Panama is a regional financial center and offers CIFI a good opportunity  to become known in the capital markets, with regional banks so we can expand our access to funding. In 2016 we strengthened CIFI's regional presence, relocating the team to Panama,  which has proved to be a good strategy since we are much closer to our clients and are developing a strong pipeline of new projects, some of them in Panama. We are currently financing 45 projects and are structuring new projects for 2017. Since CIFI is a specialized niche player we have both simpler and more complex projects. This is part of the beauty of what CIFI can bring to the region. With our extensive experience, background, excellent relationships with international and institutional investors, and our shareholder mix, CIFI is a platform that can put together the different pieces of the puzzle for complex projects.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>As we like to say, from Panama our operations make the heart of Philips beat throughout Latin America. The Philips Center of Excellence in Panama represents an essential element for the performance of our company as we provide support to all our offices and plants in Latin America. Everything is done right here in Panama by a talented and diverse team in an environment structured for innovation in operational excellence. Once we decided to relocate our headquarters, which were originally based in Brazil, we considered several locations, and Panama had a clear benefit over other countries in terms of its location, flight connections, IT infrastructure, logistics knowledge, the Panama Canal, and the government's initiatives for fostering foreign investment. For these reasons, our focus is on building competencies and capabilities in Panama to support the company's transformation and deliver the highest performance for our customers. Innovation is everything for our Center of Excellence in Panama to become a model of reference within Philips and for all of Latin America. When we look back to 2016, in addition to improving the lives of 178 million people in Latin America, it was clearly a year marked by transformation. We experienced double-digit growth and sizable profit improvement in the region.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>In 2015, BDO Panama received approval from the global board to develop some territories in Central America that were not covered by our brand and this decision was based on the success of the BDO model in Panama. The development of our office in the last decade under the BDO brand gave the board the confidence it needed to allow us to develop in Nicaragua, Honduras, and Belize; Panama also invested in the existing firm in Costa Rica with the purpose of taking the lead in the development of this territory. Thus, this office, which has corporate development responsibilities, directs professional practice in Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Belize. Strategically, we must see Central America as a single territory and from an office like this lead the practice of several countries to generate economies of scale and efficiency, improve profitability, and manage the model that BDO seeks much more efficiently. This includes sharing products and specializations with small firms from other countries and exporting knowledge, technology, experience, and resources of all kinds. There are two axes on which BDO's strategy and vision focuses. One is our customers and the other is our people. Our people are our assets; for us people mean everything.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>IFC was established in 1956 and during those 60 years has participated in many of Panama's most important projects. These include the Panama Canal expansion, the Manzanillo International Terminal in Colón, the Panama Canal Railroad Company, and the Corredor Sur toll road. Major investments in infrastructure are also expected, such as the two new metro lines, bridges over the canal, and all the other roads and bridges planned in the last few years, not to mention the Minera Panama mining project. We think that those infrastructure, energy, logistics, and mining projects will support macroeconomic growth in the coming four to five years. But most importantly for IFC is that these investments and growth are also accompanied by social inclusion and environmental sustainability. The most important factor for Panama will be investments in education, both in terms of quality and access. Without a strong educational foundation the county will never reach the levels of social development and poverty reduction that remain its primary goal.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to gender relations, we are much more advanced than other countries in the region. Through LatamLex and our clients, we have the opportunity to work in other countries in Central America, and Panama stands out as a country that has the most opportunities for women. If an individual is talented, he or she will prosper regardless of their gender. Most businesses understand that having more women involved in their boards, executive teams, and advisor teams ensures they will be more successful. Different points of view, background, and experiences in the leadership of any company are a vital ingredient to thrive in the modern business world. The number of women in politics and serving on boards in Panama is still low, but we are quickly making strides. Progress is rapid, and it motivates me to continuing promoting the professional development of women. The objective in my view is not to get the numbers to exact parity or achieve equivalent representation, but rather to give women choice and equal opportunity to succeed in any area.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>There are several principle excuses for why women fail to excel at the top of the business world. Women are encouraged from kindergarten and early childhood to be ladies, thus well behaved and disciplined and to do several tasks at the same time, including homework, caring for siblings, cleaning, doing the dishes—all of which they are under pressure to perform well. Boys are encouraged to be active, mischievous, take risks, and go forward without much thought to what happened two minutes ago or whom they might have harmed. Guess who will be better prepared to perform well and stay in school, particularly when, as is often the case, you have a full-time job and have to attend university at night? Second is the question of family-controlled companies where men are the chosen successors. Third is the excuse that there are no women CEOs from which to choose board members—an obvious result of women having to deal with crooked ladders, putting their careers on the backburner, and the thick glass ceiling, among others. Fourth is the fear of change.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In Panama there is not enough public policy focused on the inclusion of women, though President Varela did make an important step in including women in his cabinet. For the first time ever, there is a female vice president. He has many female vice ministers and our ambassadors to France and Spain are women. In Meduca and in the Ministry of Economics and Finance, we have female vice ministers as well. There has been a visionary and concerted effort on the part of the president to include women in the government, especially the executive branch. Having said that, there is not a comprehensive public policy regarding the inclusion of women, nor are there any policies focused on children and young people. We also need to address violence against women because the rates are shocking. In order to curb this, we need to expedite punishment and ensure that offenders are not getting lenient treatment. The laws are there, but the law means nothing if it is not enforced. This a key issue in the country.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The GCC is globally competitive in three things: oil production, airlines, and obesity. What people do not understand is that when an individual is obese, they are extremely likely to get diabetes and subsequently are four times as likely to be hospitalized. The cost of treating diabetes can run up to USD1-2 million per patient a year. We train people about prevention through our platforms. Other than obesity and diabetes, which are closely related, the major challenge here in the healthcare system is that we do not really have a data-driven system; there is no single unified medical record today. This is something that we are working on together with the Ministry of Health. Eventually, we also hope to develop a unified payment system for the sector, whereby public and private healthcare providers can compete on quality and not access or price. The private sector remains an important stakeholder in the way healthcare is delivered, so it must be involved.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The idea for the Millennium Medical Project came from a desire to improve the standard of healthcare here and construct a comprehensive medical day surgery center that provides a fully integrated health service in the center of Kuwait. We will have the latest technology in the centers including a state-of-the-art rehabilitation center, physiotherapy, and all of the supporting units. We will also have bone marrow densities screening for osteoporosis, and screening imaging studies to detect instances of cancer early on. This will help to facilitate an early diagnosis of the medical problem and to treat it before it becomes a significant issue. We will have family doctors where patients first see general practitioners in order to be referred to a specialist. Having family doctors onboard to screen and refer patients to specialists helps to improve the outcome of the treatment. It will also reduce the waiting time to see a specialist and it will be a very competent referral. The complex will be a new center for excellence in Kuwait.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are a healthcare benefits management company and manage the medical portfolios of a large number of insurance companies. In Kuwait, we have outstanding growth, more than what was projected in our business plan. This is because we have won the confidence of insurance companies so many insurance companies have moved to work with us from other TPAs. This has placed greater burden on us because we have to continue to provide outstanding services as well as enhance our technology. The same applies in the region, where we currently manage in excess of 3.5 million people. We are the leaders in terms of market share in most territories where we are present and have great growth rates everywhere. There is a need for our services to control costs due to inflation in the healthcare sector. There is also abuse from certain medical providers, so we need a strong robust system and a great deal of automation as well as a strong medical team to be able to achieve the necessary controls.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The market is extremely saturated, and every telecommunications provider offers a similar range of services. However, we aim for innovative and customer-driven services, particularly in the cyber-security segment. We notably provide CCTV solutions and access-to-control security. We have diversified our income and try to think out of the box by selecting our projects in a unique way. In telecommunications, we have to differentiate in Kuwait. As a telecoms operator, our services and coverage can easily keep up with European or US standards. For fixed business, however, we relay our services based on the government's infrastructure; we cannot do our own. It is old and there is a rollout of fiber, which sees slow progress. This is what we are aiming for as Kuwait has been covered by fiber by only 12%. There is a great deal more to do to deliver the service in a better way. Technology-wise, we try hard to catch up. Companies and banks are now respecting and admitting this ascension and there is greater budget and spending. It will grow in the future and ICT infrastructure will play a big role in that process.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are especially focusing on Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. At the same time, we also operate in Oman, Bahrain, Jordan, and Egypt. We have built up a full sales team to work on a regional strategy, which is a game-changer for Tawasul Telecom. With this comes new product development that targets that sector of enterprises, as we have a steady plan to launch two or three products every six months. We do not want to introduce too much too fast and overwhelm those markets. The other side of the coin is our wholesale business. With this we are just getting closer and closer to our international partners and meeting them when they want us to meet. We also have some new partnerships coming up: We are working with security partners to provide security services to enterprises. This involves an outsourced security model with shared revenue with the partners, or one-off deals like consultancy services and security testing. In addition, Tawasul Telecom is spearheading the trend to use cloud storage in the region as we know what the region needs.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our focus has been on shifting our attention from our legacy services of turnkey information systems to cloud-based services, for both scalability and reach. However, we still primarily work with governments and enterprises. We have been concentrating on consumer services, governments, and on multinational companies. We have sought to introduce cloud-based services to the SME sector, and that will occupy us for a few years yet. The market here is still too young to adapt to cloud services, but it has already adapted in many fields and we believe it will pick up greatly in the coming five years. We are seeing a huge acceptance to move over to the cloud from our clients. We also have remote control applications, where users remotely control oil and gas pipelines and can connect globally through the cloud anywhere in the world. So the opportunities and benefits that cloud-based services offer is huge. We primarily provide these telecommunications services to the US government, NATO, and a number of EU member states. Gulf Telecom collaborates with many defense and intelligence agencies to identify real threats to provide early intervention and help prevent attacks.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Projects typically have a long lifecycle no matter if they are buildings or infrastructure; depending on the size of the project, the design phase can usually take two to four years while construction normally takes two to seven years. We are currently working on different type of projects, ranging from offices to colleges to master plans and infrastructure. However, I always feel proud of and close to projects that are vital to our country's infrastructure and economy. For example, we are involved in numerous road projects in Kuwait, such as Cairo Street, South Regional Road, and South Surra Road, which will upgrade the road network around and provide direct connection to Jaber Hospital. These streets and roads are all part of a road network that will eventually relieve pressure on Kuwait's congested roads. In this regard, one of our most important projects is the new Mubarak Al-Kabeer port, for which we partnered with a British firm and Pace Architects to design the landside buildings. The economic implications of this project are vast, as the majority of Kuwait ports run below capacity, which, in turn, affects Kuwait's trade volumes. We are also working on the Kuwait Cancer Center as well as on numerous hospitals, whether it is with the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Public Works.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In Kuwait, infrastructure projects have always been part of our work, and that area will continue to be important in 2017, as will the education and health sectors. We are currently working on the design of the largest children's hospital in the world in Kuwait. We are always on the lookout to be involved in the housing sector in Kuwait and the region for large-scale housing projects delivered by either the private sector or government. We already tapped into this sector in Bahrain and are working on a large social housing project for the Ministry of Housing and a new 200 key hotel that will be attached to one of the new shopping malls in Bahrain. We are also working on five residential towers at Diyar Al Muharaq as well as on a highway project in Bahrain. In Dubai, it is more about luxury buildings and commercial and tourism projects. The whole region lacks a lot of infrastructure so this sector will be important for the next 10-20 years. In terms of buildings, we go for residential multi-occupier or single, family-owned dwellings. In terms of our future strategy in housing, if the government comes up with better, well-defined housing schemes that involve financiers, contractors, and designers, then I am sure SSH will be involved.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Each and every project Pace undertakes follows five key principles of working—reflecting my own values and mission, so to speak.  These values underpin everything we do at Pace, and reflect also the way I wish us to work with our clients. Creativity, adaptability, efficiency, absolute professionalism, and integrity are what we at Pace believe in—and what we deliver. The design process and our philosophy are based on collaboration among ourselves internally, the architects and engineers, and other 'partner disciplines,' and with our clients in response to their and the country's needs and environmental considerations.  These are the precursors to how we start our design process. Our aim is simple: deliver outstanding results to our clients, whether a building, a road, or a masterplan for a whole new residential community. To achieve that outcome, it is crucial that our various specialist teams at Pace work extremely closely with our clients, from brief to concept to breaking ground, to completion and handover. In this way we can ensure our clients get the best return on what is a significant investment. Any design that has the name Pace associated with it must above all else be to our exacting Pace standards.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The Kuwaiti real estate sector is definitely high end. People in the GCC want something luxurious and spacious. We know what our customers want and we build them what they want. That is why they get sold quickly, because they buy what they want. If we sold European-style houses to them, they would likely still buy them but would spend more to change it into what they want. They like their comfort but want it at an affordable price. We started this company in 2004, but my partner and I particularly focused on the Turkish real estate market. Later, we branched out to Qatar and will hopefully open an SQM franchise in Saudi Arabia by the end of the year. Overall, property is cheaper in Turkey, Spain, and, particularly, the US—a market we are exploring at the moment. 2017 will be much better than 2016, which was a bad year for the global real estate market. The GCC real estate markets also did not perform as well as they did in 2015. Many customers and investors across the GCC have become very cautious about their spending.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Primarily, we are involved in the manufacturing sector and have built a great deal in recent years, for example garages and retail outlets. We do have residential projects for rental; however, the majority is in industrial real estate. Residential revenues from rental are around 8% whereas industrial gives around 12%, so that is where we focus on. Now the market has come down, and both the commercial and residential real estate markets have slowed a little. Dal Al Thuraya functions as the master developer, working with a variety of subcontractors. We fully own the company as well as our investments; we own the properties that we develop. The design is done by a third party, but we are involved. When it is difficult to sell, the best strategy is to use the land to build and then in the next two or three years the building, when it is constructed, faces a more balanced market. Prices of land are good now, and rental remains a great opportunity for monthly income. Our strategy is to look for great opportunities to buy land and to hold our developments until we have a better outlook.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our portfolio currently comprises commercial projects, as well as offices, residential towers, and food and beverage (F&amp;B) malls. Overall, we have a wealth of projects currently under design that are due to begin in 2017 and 2018, which include projects locally and regionally. As a long-term investor, we do not look at our designs and constructions as merely a short-term opportunity—we want them to have a lasting impact on the community. In fact, we concentrate on every aspect of real estate—retail, residential, and commercial—and continuously seek the best solutions and materials. Our main activities are in the GCC, and we have developed unique buildings outside Kuwait such as in Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE. Our partnerships across the GCC are pivotal to our international operations. We seek out architects and consultants for every design project and even set up a design competition whereby we invite architects to submit design proposals for every project. Depending on the scale of the project, we invite architects that are from an international background or from local architectural firms. Furthermore, we partner on a large scale with consultants and advisors for master planning and rigorous research.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We have opened 14 branches of Café Bazza in the last four years. We have been busy expanding our café business in Kuwait and, since the market is more or less saturated now, we will soon open branches in Saudi Arabia, Doha, and Dubai. In the last three years, there has been a tremendous expansion in the restaurant sector, and real estate companies consequently have sought to meet the demand for commercial property. In addition, Kuwaitis not only love to travel and enjoy good food, but are also exposed to many different cultures in the region, which is why Kuwaiti food has become much more international in recent years. There has been great demand to open restaurants, so real estate investors always find the opportunities and many buildings have been built specifically for restaurants. I am not sure if this trend will continue because the number of restaurants has drastically increased in the last three years. Our main focus is on the Gulf region and we will open a number of Café Bazza outlets in Saudi Arabia. We have a plan called 5020, as we are aiming to open 50 units by 2020.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The real estate sector has become one of the key economic barometers for growth in the GCC region and Kuwait. It is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the world and is likely to remain resilient and register growth at a slow pace until the end of 2017 and beyond, despite fluctuations in oil prices. The hospitality, residential, and office lease markets remain buoyant in Kuwait; the retail segment is expected to continue its aggressive expansion in the coming years. Arkan's strategy, focused on the continued pursuit of promising investment opportunities that will add value to shareholders' funds, has made it a leading real estate company and it will continue to focus on large projects with international standards that add value to the aesthetic of real estate in Kuwait. The Kuwaiti construction sector faced many burdens in 2016 due to fluctuations in the economic markets of the Gulf and international countries and a decline in government spending and oil revenues; however, despite the difficult conditions faced by the construction sector, billions are being invested in the infrastructure sector and data indicates the existence of many real estate projects under implementation.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We oversee a complementary portfolio of companies catering to the oil and gas industry. We rely on our highly experienced leadership and business ethics to enable our subsidiaries to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage, thereby maximizing value for our customers and shareholders. Al Dorra Holding offers a wide range of specialized services that cater to the demanding oil and gas industry (upstream, midstream, and downstream). Our subsidiaries have developed their capabilities from supply of construction tools and equipment to the execution of major projects, industrial services, manufacturing, and supply of specialized materials and chemicals for processing, storing, and refining in several areas, including the commercial, oil and gas, and power sectors. Their services include construction, engineering, fabrication, trading, industrial services, professional services, cathodic protection systems, internal corrosion, monitoring systems, and consultancy services. Our success comes from our commitment to innovation and quality of service.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>EnerTech was established in 2001 as a department of the National Technology Enterprises Company (NTEC). In 2010, NTEC developed a new strategy to spin off the department and, consequently, established EnerTech in 2012. We invest globally in the IP of these technologies and all the clean-tech space that includes energy efficiencies and renewables, oil and gas in niche markets, and water technologies. Then we would transfer technology to Kuwait or the region. By partnering with companies, we primarily provide manufacturing facilities and marketing offices. We are building vehicles to help technologies come to the region. This was our main focus at the time and we have been successful building several platforms. In early 2013, we developed a company that can develop, operate and commission renewable products in Dubai. In contrast to the UAE, Kuwait does not have an established legal framework for venture capital. For example, shareholders in Kuwait do not recognize venture capital terms like tag along and requisition preferences.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The environmental awareness of clients in Kuwait has improved drastically during the past year. Kuwait Oil Company has succeeded in cutting down the gas flaring in the past five years, reducing it from 7% to almost around 1%, which is remarkable. This is also a business case, but the environmental benefits are enormous. Kuwait Oil Company also stopped disposal of effluent water on the surface, and instead of waiting for it to evaporate, it is now recycled, disposed below ground, or used to maintain the pressure in certain reservoirs. All in all, we have seen a remarkable improvement in the way that companies here approach environmental issues. Of course, there are laws with respect to conducting any project in Kuwait; before a company drills a well or lays a pipeline, it should do the appropriate engineering and environmental impact assessments so that it lowers the impact of that project on the environment.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our strength is in providing the widest range of services in the upstream and midstream segment, which differentiates us from others within the market. We pride ourselves in being the market leaders in Well Testing Services and will strive in continuing to be the best. SPETCO's continuous commitment to offer its customers the highest quality of specialized solutions with focus on performing various upstream oilfield services and customized design, construction, and operations of fast-track oil and gas production facilities projects would be our key operational strategy for the coming years. Currently we are working on pilot projects in KOC for some new technologies, particularly on a solution for viscosity reduction in heavy oil production and introduction of micro turbines for power generation. Taking into consideration our focus on new technologies we have signed agreements with a couple of international companies for technical support on these services so the same can be provided to the clients in the region.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Arzan VC is working on identifying and building a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem in the MENA region. Entrepreneurs in this region are in need of major financial and technical support, hence Arzan VC built its strategy and team to suit the market requirement. In the future, Arzan VC is expected to support entrepreneurs throughout MENA who are looking for early-stage funding. Kuwait is behind neighbor countries in supporting the creation of an entrepreneurial ecosystem. The government has established a fund of USD6 billion to support new business; however, its vision and execution plan is still not clear. Arzan VC reviewed around 300 opportunities last year alone and managed to invest in 14 deals. We are continuously looking for new investments and our target is to have a great investment every month.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We focus mostly on finance, securing funding for projects, restructuring debts for our clients, finding the funding to establish new small- and medium-sized enterprises or even larger ones, as well as helping companies fund their working capital. It is all about helping to finance companies and our clients' needs in terms of funding. Al-Riyada was established in 2008, when the global financial crisis made itself felt here in the GCC. Eventually, people saw that Islamic finance and its instruments were the safest investment tools around. After all, Islamic finance and lending is based on real existing assets. This really appealed to investors after the global crash and all the trouble with exotic financial instruments, such as CDOs. Islamic finance has proven to be a safe and popular alternative over the last eight years.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our plan in 2017 is to reduce our investments in Europe and go back to the MENA region, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait in particular. This is mainly due to our expectations with the euro, as well as Brexit. That is directly affecting our European investment strategy and we are trying to slow down our euro investments as a result. Of course, nobody knows exactly what will happen as a result of Brexit, but the expectations are on the negative side. That being said, we are not panicking about the euro or European investments. It is just on a strategy level that we are making alterations and changes. The US investments still look strong, with the dollar expected to strengthen with expected interest rate hikes by the Fed. As for the Middle East, I have a positive view, despite oil prices and geopolitical problems.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The group started off as Al Madina Holding and encompassed two listed companies called Al Madina and Ekttitab. By now, we have eight companies listed, namely Ekttitab, Al Salam, Al Madina, Petrogulf, Hits Telecom, Investors, Zima Investments, and Mayadeen—the only licensed shooting range in Kuwait, which we took over four months ago. Moreover, we have a market capital of over USD1 billion and have companies listed on the stock exchanges in Kuwait and Dubai, and will soon be one of the first foreign companies listed on the Egyptian Exchange. The reason we managed to turn from a relatively small investment group into the biggest Kuwaiti investment group with the highest amount of listed companies is that we took advantage of the 2008 financial crisis. In times of crises, companies often tend to accept external assistance, whether that means a takeover or consultation, and we went against the tide.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>This is the 25th anniversary of Xerox's presence in Kuwait. This has been 25 years of success and sustainable revenue growth YoY, despite economic changes. Despite all the delays in business, we are capitalizing on the new technology made available to us. We attended Drupa 2016, which is the largest printing industry event in the world. We showed the latest technology to our clients, and they were impressed with how we are leading the way compared to other players in the market. The exhibition caters to everyone in the industry including other brands and our competitors. Our customers showed a great deal of interest in another game changing product Xerox is putting into the market, which is the latest high-end production digital press. Importantly, we also launched an Inkjet technology at Drupa for book publishers and printing presses, most notably the Al Khat Printing Press, to have a cost-effective way to run a print-job, particularly short-runs. This will be useful to the education sector and organizations that do a lot of variable printing. In return, this gives us a new area for growth with our clients in Kuwait.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In Kuwait, there are particular types of decorative coatings that are required for buildings and other structures. We have special water-born products that Kuwaitis like to use on the exterior of their villas. We can create whatever pattern you like in it. Then they are all coated with a high quality polyurethane paint that is a highly durable protective product. Typically, Kuwaiti customers have more money to spend on their houses and they are prepared to pay for very high-quality products. This villa business is a mega-business for us today. We have all the paint tinting facilities so we can create the color the customer has in their mind in no time. This further incited us to get in contact with a number of real estate companies. We keep track of new developments that are going to be released in the market, as well as the construction materials being used such as steel or concrete. This helps us with our production planning for the year ahead. Less people go for our high protection coatings in Saudi Arabia because generally people's disposable income is lower there compared to Kuwait.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Siemens actually has one regional hub in the UAE and, as a regional company, Siemens Kuwait works together with our lead country. This is the business setup but, on the other hand, Siemens' regional identity presupposes that we focus on our local needs as the requirements for each country are different; not 100% the same but similar because most of the economic environment in countries like Qatar and Kuwait are oil-rich, gas-rich, and GDP is heavily dependent on this exploration and the revenue received from this sector. Therefore, the solutions that we provide are not only envisaged for Kuwait but what we develop and receive from our headquarters or lead country is offered to all the other countries in the market as well. We have to customize the solutions to Kuwait as we have certain standards and requirements, especially with the KNPC in the oil and gas sector, and therefore we have to adapt to these standards.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Over the last decade, Kuwait has demonstrated considerable resolve and persistence in building a strong economic environment. Today, the country is one of the GCC's most democratic members with an exceptionally strong public sector and has plenty to offer in terms of business opportunities. Kuwait's economy is primarily driven by the country's robust oil and gas sector, which contributes around 60% to the annual gross domestic product, and approximately 95% of export revenues. However, the country's logistics sector is equally important to Kuwait's development and growth. The logistics market in Kuwait is strengthened by the country's location and size, as it is positioned closely to many major markets in a region with a population of more than 140 million and an output of USD1.3 trillion. The Kuwait Development Plan has identified ways to further strengthen the logistics market, including enhancements to sea and air links, in addition to airport upgrades in recent years. There is substantial potential for business growth in Kuwait's logistics sector.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><em>T</em>he acquisition of Piraeus Bank Egypt took place in November 2015 after about six months of negotiations, a record time for such a transaction given all the processes and regulatory approval requirements. We have traditionally been a local bank with only a marginal presence in the UAE, but due to our operational expansion to Egypt, we have technically doubled our branches and staff and become more of a regional bank. On the operating side, we are continuing the solid trend of the past couple of years. For the first half of 2016, we achieved top line revenue of KWD44 million, slightly ahead of last year. To be fair, this growth was a little below our expectations, but remains faster than the market. The low oil prices have reduced business activities and, consequently, led to a decreased demand for loans and investments. This obviously has impacted the banking sector, but we have been able to maintain some limited but reasonable growth.<em></em></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are traditionally viewed as a strongly corporate bank but have a growing retail banking presence comprising almost 40 branches across Kuwait. We are involved in some major projects in the oil sector for the production of clean fuel in addition to public projects for water desalination and purification. Ahli United Bank has been part of the major syndicated transactions and consortiums formed to finance large construction and contracting projects in Kuwait. Historically, over its 75-year history in Kuwait the bank has been involved in financing many significant building and infrastructure projects. The coming year is expected to continue under the pressure of low oil prices and regional geopolitical uncertainty. It is therefore prudent to remain conservative and cautious but we will continue to seek fresh opportunities and support bankable business ventures and projects. Kuwait offers a stable investment climate with significant sovereign reserves and internationally well regarded and admired institutions.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few years, we have seen our retail customers in Kuwait triple and a growth of assets of more than 200% by 2016. Aligned with this, we have assessed the market environment, reviewed the direction of the bank moving forward, and realized there is significant demand for a second branch. Adding to the above, the Central Bank of Kuwait allowed foreign banks to open multiple branches in the market in 2014. We saw this as an opportunity to revisit our strategy in the market and now we have plans to open our second branch by end-2017. Currently, the Kuwait branch is a fully fledged bank, with a focus on retail, corporate, and treasury. The second branch, due to open in Al-Jahra Area, will have a similar focus. We look forward to providing our growing customer base with enhanced access and convenience and continuing our commitment to the Kuwaiti market.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Since the establishment of the Kuwait branch in 2010, Bank Muscat has largely been focusing on corporate finance and wholesale transactions in particular. Our focus is on local and international medium-to-large companies that are involved in the country's development plan. We also offer advisory services on the best structure for financing transactions. In order to support clients involved in major projects such as the construction of power stations, roads, and hospitals, we partner with other local and international banks in syndications or club deal financings. As a foreign branch, Bank Muscat is required to maintain and finance businesses within Kuwait. The head office network supporting foreign companies involved in Kuwaiti projects complements us. We also serve as a link for local business entities interested in doing business in Oman. We introduce them to the head office in Oman and sometimes get referrals for Omanis interested in setting up business in Kuwait. This synergy with the head office and correspondent banks network facilitates growth.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The dairy market in Kazakhstan had been experiencing double-digit growth YoY up until 2015. The main difficulty we had in 2015 was parallel imports from Russia because of the different foreign exchange rates; it was much more competitive to buy Russian products in Kazakhstan. This is no longer the case and now we have the opportunity to be competitive in the Kazakhstani market. Last year was a successful one for Danone in the region. We had double-digit turnover growth and also improved our profits, which is crucial to ensuring our sustainability. We had to make some tough decisions in terms of cost cutting but the business is still performing better than in 2015. The country's new currency management model introduced in August 2015 came with some impact for consumers, such as inflation. However, now we are more competitive in the markets around us and we no longer have parallel imports and, as a result, the outlook in 2016 is better than in 2015.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Agriculture is now like other sectors of the economy, where companies must use new, progressive manufacturing technology, and our experience shows we are on the right track. Initially we had to invest a great deal of money, which was concerning. However, we can now see that was the right thing to do for our future because new technologies helped us to use new rootstocks and saves our water. The problem was clean water, because there are not many large resources of clean water in the world and now we can use a drop water system to control our water use. It is expensive but good for our products and the environment. Our motto is “Love, Care, Respect,“ namely love for our country, care toward nature, and respect for the coming generations. Agriculture has great potential and many businessmen are shifting their investments from oil and gas and banking to agriculture because people need food and agriculture is an important sector.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In Kazakhstan, we have small, medium, and large farmers. Eurasia Holding creates logistical process and distribution channels for the whole country. We want to cooperate with small and medium farmers and give them access to our logistics and processing channels. We will invest in a meat processing plant but that is not our main goal, so we will probably pass it on to the farmer cooperatives or farmer associations sector. We want to create big infrastructure where every small and medium farmer will feel comfortable doing their selling locally. They would not need to go to China and other markets to trade their goods; they would see the channel and logistics and pass it on to Eurasia Agro Holding. We are contributing directly and uniting small and medium farmers. Small and medium farmers unfortunately are not able to access the market themselves. By creating these meat-processing facilities and feedlots, we create a direct sales channel for farmers. We form direct purchase agreements with co-operators.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are a regional express delivery network with headquarters in Turkey but offices all around the CIS. We have been operating in Kazakhstan since 1995 and have seen our business grow and change from international to domestic express delivery services. Due to Kazakhstan's geography and import-based economy, we have concentrated on improving our domestic network over the years while achieving and maintaining a higher standard in our international deliveries. Our main competitors are worldwide integrators such as DHL, UPS, and DPD. When we started in 1995, we served many foreign companies, like TNT, for their deliveries in Kazakhstan, though later they established their own operations here. We see traffic between Russia and Kazakhstan growing every day; however, the amount of traffic between Turkey and Kazakhstan seems to be flat. We believe this stagnation is only temporary and in the near future traffic will be on the rise as we are looking to get more e-commerce related import traffic from Turkey.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>UPS entered Kazakhstan in 1995, as an Authorized Service Contractor. In 1998, UPS purchased the contractor and the operations became a fully owned UPS subsidiary, a categorization we call “brown.“ In 2009, Kazakhstan was included in the Turkey, Middle East, Central Asia (TMECA) region. In 2010, I was given responsibility for all of Central Asia. In 2013, the district management was restructured and TMECA was replaced with a new grouping called Indian Sub-continent, Middle East, and Africa (ISMEA). Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, is now located in ISMEA and includes six countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan. We seek to enhance our domestic services in Kazakhstan, which will include developing hubs here. We already provide services to 33 cities in the country and have 12 offices. We will continue to develop this network and will turn some of these 12 offices into central hubs. This means that all packages from neighboring cities will be collected in hubs and then distributed to their respective cities.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Agility is a Kuwait-based company with 550 offices, covering more than 100 countries. We can cover almost any country. Those 550 offices are not agent offices either; they are our offices and we handle all businesses and requests in our own company structure. It is also easier for imports and exports as we do not need to deal with any other parties and it is all handled internally. As a global company, we can bring new and high-quality standards to the logistics business in Kazakhstan. We have a well-structured procedural framework and processing capacity and can apply global standards here in Kazakhstan. For example, we serve many oil and gas companies in Kazakhstan and use our global network and teams to serve them here. We work a great deal with our China and US offices in particular for that sector and bring most of those resources to West Kazakhstan.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>EMEX LLP is an official representative of FedEx Express Corporation in Kazakhstan and offers top-quality services for express delivery of domestic and international cargo and correspondence in Kazakhstan and to more than 220 countries. The transportation and delivery of shipments are realized via air, railway, and road under the door-to-door principle. EMEX LLP has a wide network of 22 offices and agents in all regional centers of Kazakhstan. The head office of EMEX LLP is in Almaty. Our goals in 2017 are: further expansion of the service net in Kazakhstan, improvement of service, and promotion of electronic systems of registration of shipments. One of the main priorities is the attraction of customers by rendering a perfect service and short transit times. One of the new directions of development of the company in 2017 is the opening of services of a customs broker for registration of inbound and outbound cargo. The market of courier express delivery services always remains a quickly developing segment of the economy of Kazakhstan.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The company has developed with the country; we started from the construction of houses to then constructing large residential complexes. When the company started to develop, there were enthusiastic people who wanted to construct elite and high-quality buildings. We started with the new style because in the Soviet Union there was not an ability to change the style or integrate our own ideas to include something else in the design. Then, in 10 years, we built more than 2 million sqm of complexes and today we build economy- and social-class houses. Recently, one of our main projects has been the complex for the Universiade sporting event, which was held in Almaty in February 2017. Other major projects in our portfolio include the LUXOR wellness club in the city center. In Astana, we also have a residential complex called Nursaya. Now, it is a large city center with administrative houses; however, when we were building it, it was just small houses and gardens.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>After Kazakhstan's independence 25 years ago, the market experienced periods of lows and highs. For example, in Almaty realty prices reached a high of USD12,000 per sqm. This has served as a great lesson about pricing in the market. Currently, prices are at their lowest. Construction companies and developers are forced to sell properties cheap for around the same price as the cost of construction because they need to repay their bank loans. This cycle was a great learning experience for us. The local construction and real estate market is being impacted by external factors such as oil prices, devaluation, the economies of neighboring countries, and the general global economic downturn. Today, in Kazakhstan, only the best and strongest construction companies survive. These companies are thinking about the quality of their builds and are optimizing their processes. High prices are now history and margins in the sector are much lower than the 70% that companies were obtaining in the past.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We entered the Kazakhstani market, where we are now a legal entity, in 2004 and started to develop residential and commercial complexes, administrative offices, and other facilities. Because Kazakhstan is the heart of Central Asia and therefore a gateway between Asia and Europe, we feel it has absorbed both cultures. It has become one of the region's leading countries, successfully materializing its dreams of revival after the fall of the Soviet Union. Investment in the construction sector dramatically increased after Astana was named the capital. There is a rich list of benefits to operating in the city, including free economic zones and others. It has the potential to become an international city, not unlike Seoul. International projects like Expo 2017 show us how ambitious the capital is. This is why Highvill decided to become part of this rapidly developing city. We have combined Asian and European architecture styles and this reflects the country's goal of becoming a link between Europe and Asia.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In 2013 Kagazy founded the Association of Packagers of Kazakhstan, the first of its kind in the country. Its goal is to bring together businesses that use various types of packaging in their operations such as big bottlers, which need plastic and metal packaging. At that time, we determined that we all needed to speak up about our problems and go to the government to make ourselves heard. Later, we joined the Association of Recyclers of Kazakhstan. We try to promote the needs of recyclers because the oil business has plenty of support. The sector generates the tax budget but we wanted to make ourselves heard, which has finally happened. There are now many supportive tax regimes for producers; the government helps with land for recyclers and provides tax exemptions and we work to promote our policy with other businesses. We do not just collect waste and recycle it; we try to instill this philosophy within our clients.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Business is growing, and if we compare turnovers there is not much of a difference; however, in terms of market share there has been a large increase since 2014. We have gradually grown—we have between 50 and 100% of the market depending on the type of machines. We are the market leader, not only in Kazakhstan but worldwide. We represent a specific sector; we do not produce machines for companies like Caterpillar or Komatsu. These companies are much bigger than us. However, in our sector—asphalt and concrete—we are first. The clients purchasing machines from us are local—and make up the majority—as well as international. We serve Chinese, Italian, and Iranian companies operating in Kazakhstan, selling them new machines as well as spare parts. We provide a service. The first international companies came to Kazakhstan 20 years ago. Until five or seven years ago, they would buy machinery from their own companies. Now, however, they come to us, and Todini, for example, is one of our international clients.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The last two years have been a period of crisis; due to rapid devaluation there were a large amount of imports for electric equipment that caused a decrease in sales. In 2016 we expected a 10% fall; yet due to great support from the government, we actually grew. The money was invested into the stations. The government formulated new programs for investing. One of them is a national level project for innovative industrial development in six sectors: agricultural mechanics, mining, and electromechanical construction, to name but a few, where Alageum Electric is the national champion. The government developed a special finance investment program that comes from Baiterek Holding and includes export development. As Alageum already has 30-40% of exports it was timely to receive this further boost. To support exports, the Development Bank gave Alageum KZT1.5 million to purchase raw materials. Russian suppliers used to increase prices annually and now that we buy 100% of our materials we have saved money for the government as well.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We first established our foreign office in Kyrgyzstan in 1997 but later saw great potential in Kazakhstan. Our management subsequently decided to open an additional office in Almaty in 1998 and we have been doing business in Kazakhstan for almost 19 years, bringing our goods and doing marketing, sales, and providing after-sales service. In the oil and gas industry there are refineries around the country where it is hard to provide electricity as they are remote. This is one of our main targets, as every building needs power generators. Elsewhere, our focus is on hospitals, hotels, and factories. The government provides great opportunities for companies that want to open a production area in different areas of the country; yet sometimes these places have electricity problems. Kazakhstan has great potential, which is the reason there are many investments here. One of our main targets is construction. Kazakhstan is getting bigger and we also try to grow in line with its market.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Our approach at Linde Group has always been to support our customers with onsite operations and plants. We signed a contract with our global partner ArcelorMittal for an air separation unit (ASU) construction to supply the customer's steel production with industrial gases. As a supply schema we used a worldwide popular on-site supply mode that allows customers to release internal resources for their main production needs. This on-site supply mode has already proven its effectiveness through many worldwide projects. Thanks to ArcelorMittal's large volume of gas consumption, we have one of the biggest ASU in Kazakhstan among CIS and Central Asian countries. For example, the ASU capacity is comparable to a couple of Linde plants in Russia. Our goal is to provide the market with the required amount of industrial gases constructing more on-site facilities. We offer our customers turnkey plants: we invest, build, and operate the plant and a customer gets the necessary gas products.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Sunkar Resources was envisioned as an investment project to build a large-scale chemical processing plant to produce phosphate fertilizer, which is in high demand around the world. For us the main activity was the promotion and development of this investment project and speaking to potential parties. We run it as a world-class business, with first-class contractors. However, unfortunately the global economic situation did not allow for an easy way forward. Our project, being oriented for overseas shipment, is heavily dependent on cross-border and overseas phosphate trade. Disturbances in the phosphate business started in the middle of 2013 because of the issues with the Indian monetary system and since 2013 the market has hit historic lows two times. Therefore, the only type of potential partners we have been able to talk to are national companies and national wealth funds from a variety of countries.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The company goes back to the early 2000s but I joined about five years ago. Since then we have strengthened our position in mining and metallurgy in Kazakhstan and Russia. Our main activities are the extraction of ore. We take a concentrate of that ore to our factory to be refined. We produce ferrosilicomanganese at our plants in Taraz and Temirtau as well as electrode pasta, cabide calcium, limestone, and so on. We have two metallurgic plants in Kazakhstan and sell almost 50% of our product to Russia, where we have an established market. We also export our products to Ukraine, Romania, and Central Asia. Now we have also increased our sales within Kazakhstan. We started working with ArcelorMittalTemirtau for one product and now sell more than five products from our plant. Every year we work on two main tasks; one is to increase sales and the number of products while the second is to optimize the cost of production and implement new technologies.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our Kazakhstan operating company, TOO Firma Balausa, won the rights to develop the Balasausqandiq vanadium deposit in 1998 and Ferro-Alloy Resources Limited acquired it in 2000. The deposit is huge and although it had been discovered in 1941, the technology did not exist to process it. Our main job for the first few years was to develop the technology, which we achieved by around 2006, just as the vanadium price climbed to almost USD30 a pound, versus today's USD5.  At that price it made sense to test the process at a small scale using a simple heap-leaching operation.  Later, prices fell and this made heap-leaching unattractive so we spent around USD12 million on a pilot-plant using conventional crushing and milling with an autoclave leach step to raise the recovery.   This pilot plant was highly successful and, having done its job as a test plant, we converted it to treating vanadium concentrates, which is what we are doing now.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Kazatomprom SaUran was a merger between two mining companies. It was a transformation process to optimize the organizational structure and improve management of the subsidiaries of Samruk-Kazyna and Kazatomprom. In the operations aspect, there were not many changes because both mining companies were operational at the time of the merger. Most of the changes took place in the structure of the company and management. We had to follow legal procedures to establish the new company. Our aim was to mitigate any impact on production due to the reorganization and fortunately, and operations continued at 100%. There are digital mines in other locations. Experts were sent to Chile, Australia, and other countries to conduct benchmarking activities. They established the best practices around the world and then adapted them for our operations. The first stage took six months. When the digital mine is fully operational, we can remotely see what is happening anywhere in the mines.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The last two or three years have been difficult for our company, especially before and after the devaluation, since we are a financial company. We had a big position in shares and we experienced some losses. In the past two years, we did make some profits as well, so this should be a starting point for the business to grow. I do not expect 2017 to be positive, though everything depends on the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC). If it is established as declared, then this will be a good prospect for Asyl Invest. In 2016, we unfortunately closed down our corporate finance division. There were many factors, one of which was that the pension fund was held by one hand and there is no demand for corporate finance products such as shares, bonds, and financial consulting for corporations. The main problem with attracting international investors was the devaluation of the tenge. It was a large problem. At the moment, everything again depends on AIFC. Also, in November 2016 we opened ASYL Global Hedge Fund. We will start up an export company to export Kazakh money to the international market.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The market has gone through turbulent times over the past three years. This started in 2014 with the devaluation of the ruble and the sanctions on Russia that hit Kazakhstan's economy. Russia is a transport channel, and 2015 and 2016 were quite tough for Kazakhstan as well. Centras Capital cannot directly impact the economy; however, we seek to raise our voice and help the government to understand the market accurately. Unfortunately, it is not easy and we continue to argue that we need to be more technical. For Kazakhstan, the problem is identifying a competitive niche. We want a Customs Union and are dependent on our borders with Russia. China is next door and today China is the manufacturer for the world. Kazakhstan decided to compete in the sphere of manufacturing, which is difficult to do. There are no fundamentals for Kazakhstan to be aggressive about in this niche. It is better for Kazakhstan to understand its niches and focus and capitalize on them. Unfortunately, we are still somewhere in the woods in terms understanding where its competitiveness should lie.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>From the beginning, WhiteHill was set up to serve mid-sized businesses in emerging markets with a focus on CIS countries and Kazakhstan in particular. We saw this niche and made a choice based on the diverse background our directors have, which includes large investment funds and banks such as Macquarie, Goldman Sachs, and International Finance Corporation to public-sector entities including the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The M&amp;A market in the CIS is still in the development phase, transactions that happened in the past primarily involved large businesses and the savviest businessmen that owned mid-sized businesses. Most of them are now approaching retirement age and/or considering alternative business lines and we see great potential in market activity in the forthcoming years. 2016 was active for restructuring practice. Dealing with restructuring cases has always been a challenge in emerging markets and the WhiteHill team learned that the hard way through numerous assignments protecting minority shareholders and representing interests of foreign investors and manufacturers. We always try to bring restructuring cases to a peaceful resolution and design creative solutions to settle critical situations in a transparent and legal way.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>While Tsesnabank had previously been focused predominantly on corporate business, now we are seeking to expand more into SMEs while retaining our focus on the higher end of the retail business. One of Tsesnabank's strengths has undoubtedly been our high-quality assets. By the year-end, our NPL level was 4.2%, against the sector average of 6.7%. The other constraints for the banking sector, and consequently for corporate and SME borrowers, are the scarcity of long-term liquidity and relatively high interest rates. Tsesnabank has not experienced any serious liquidity issues in the last 18-24 months, despite market conditions challenging many banks even in terms of availability of short-term tenge liquidity. In addition to our diversified corporate funding base, the share of retail deposits in the bank's portfolio has risen to 44.3%—quite a high figure considering the bank is not actively pursuing the mass retail market. This figure reflects retail customers' confidence in Tsesnabank.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>At Nurbank, we strive to have consistency, which is important to us. Therefore, we develop a strategy for each three-year period and within that we have tactics for each 12 months. I expect to see, if not the end of the crisis, at least some improvement in 2017. Then, the economy will surge in 2018 and continue upwards from there. This crisis, including low oil prices, has been ongoing for three years now and it is not the first one. Eventually, we develop immunity to economic shocks and adapt, as we and other banks in the country have done. We have already started to move away from our oil dependency and to look at other avenues to create wealth. Today, we do not have many oil and gas companies in our portfolio; we have started funding SMEs, and my hope is that these SMEs and entrepreneurs drive the economy upwards from 2018 or 2019.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Kazakhstan's vast territory and abundant resources, common borders with China, Russia, and the Central Asian markets, and qualified work force indicate growth potential in agriculture, infrastructure development, manufacturing, retail, alternative energy, and other segments. The commodities sector too remains a growth story—the launch of production in the Kashagan field will help make Kazakhstan one of the world's larger oil exporters. Over the years, Kazakhstan has demonstrated prudence in monetary policies, built a new modern capital city Astana, and attracted significant FDI. The country maintains one of the lowest personal income tax regimes in the world. Going forward, a continued deregulation, fostering competition, and supporting urban development would help grow middle class and support consumer demand. As the largest global investor in the local banking industry, we are pleased that the government has maintained an open and frequent dialog with foreign investors.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>When an economy grows at an almost uninterrupted pace of 6-7% like Kazakhstan's did between 1999 and 2014 up until the downturn, companies can make a few mistakes along the way and be less rigorous in taking investment decisions. Kazakhstan is now adapting to a “new normal" as the economy is expected to grow at best by 2-3% in the years to come. Growth is likely be flat in 2016. This slowdown will affect everyone, from households to large corporates. There are still some good pockets of value in the economy, good and well-run companies that are getting stronger in this environment, though there are not many of them. Banks are trying to spot these champions and provide them with credit and cash management services. In 2015, we almost doubled our corporate banking book and this year it will grow by another 40-50% as we strive to find clients that not only fit our profile, but can be with us for the next three-five years and that we can help with their various financial needs.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We have great relationships with the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange to help our clients expedite the logistics of listing on the exchange, we work closely with the regulator and are at the forefront of all changes in our industry so we can advise our clients on possible potential problems, for example regulations that we need to address in advance. We manage more than KZT60 billion of our clients' portfolios, and this strong firepower helps us support our clients' security placements as well as their post-placement liquidity. To remain competitive in our market we must stay mentally alert at all times. We are currently preparing our plan for 2017 and plan to launch a number of products and services next year, the details of which will be released soon. Both institutional and retail investors can participate in our mutual fund and we plan to build on this product going forward. On our investment banking side, we are quite proactive in M&amp;A and in the forthcoming privatization of major national companies and their subsidiaries.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Transport companies like us reflect the situation of the economy. We realize that people feel more stable this year as they have started to order things to bring into Kazakhstan. We found that even though the economy was declining last year e-commerce was growing. This year it is also growing and we are interested in this segment. What is important with e-commerce is that it is sensitive to the price of transportation because if you were buying something inexpensive, you would never send it with DHL because the cost of transporting it would be high. This is why we work in the premium segment with jewelry, watches, IT equipment, and telephones, which is a segment that is growing. It is a new thing for Kazakhstan but we have seen the sector growing for the last four years, so in the next few years I expect it to be the main market. Many companies now focus only on e-commerce and we also consider it an interesting, growing segment. Our main purpose is to keep our customers happy so we will do everything that they require from us. We will open some new destinations as we continue to do every year, expanding our network. We plan to open a new facility in Astana and are negotiating with Astana International Airport as well.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The real estate market in Kazakhstan has seen dramatic peaks and troughs since the early 2000s. We observed the booming market of mid-2000s, when speculative deals backed by a growing economy drove triple-digit price growth in the real estate market. But in the late 2000s, the bubble burst. Prices plummeted and have yet to recover fully. Yet, despite all the challenges of the past 10 years, real estate property remains one of the key investment tools for Kazakhstanis that is considered safe and secure amid low level of awareness of other types of investments, such as financial instruments available in the stock market. The real estate market in Kazakhstan provides investors with numerous opportunities. There is room to grow in almost every real estate sector. For instance, in the office market, suburban business parks with high-quality office buildings and landscaped public areas, which appeal to both large corporations and small and medium-sized businesses, can be in demand. The property market in Kazakhstan in 2017 will continue to be tenant/buyer driven. Competition for tenants and buyers among developers, landlords, and owners will be fierce, which is great for the market.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>After serving clients in Kazakhstan for about a decade working from our offices in Moscow, Kiev, and London, we became the first top management consultancy to open an office in Astana in 2013 and later, in 2015, in Almaty. Given the rapid reforms and dynamic development of many companies we felt that we needed to be close to our clients in order to serve them best. We also recognized that an enormous pool of talented young professionals and graduates was seeking attractive career opportunities: we now have over 40 local consultants. By opening an office we wanted to express our commitment to Kazakhstan and our belief in its potential. Kazakhstan is an exciting place for all kinds of reasons. The country is in a strategic location at the crossroads between east and west. It has enormous natural and human resources and great ambitions. It has developed a robust long-term strategy to harness those resources to become one of the top 30 nations in the world. As such, Kazakhstan can be a role model for many other fast-growing countries. Kazakhstan's business, political, and cultural leaders are open and eager to apply best practices from other countries.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our ambition is to spread more of our products into what we call the 1520 area. This is the width of the rail track, which is different from that in Europe or in Japan. It goes from Finland down to Ukraine across the Baltic countries, Caucasia, Central Asia, and Mongolia. It is one of the biggest networks in the world so we believe there will be many opportunities in the years to come and we have to be present and close to our customers. The first one is an electric locomotive manufacturing plant—EKZ in Kazakhstan, with which we launched a joint venture as part of Kazakhstan's industrialization program. We are pleased to be here to develop this aspect economically in Kazakhstan and to export to neighboring countries. Our first product from EKZ will be delivered to Azerbaijan at the end of 2017. In this region the market is mainly about the renewal of old fleets. Today, in Kazakhstan and all the other former Soviet Union countries, about 70% of the locomotive fleet has to be replaced by 2023. The market is there; it is just a matter of time and investment. Azerbaijan is our first step, then Georgia as there is a corridor being opened between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>There are many opportunities here; Kazakhstan is an open market, but businesses have to know the local mentality in order to work in the Kazakhstani economy. The economy is in fact doing quite well in comparison to other countries. Many other countries are suffering in this current economic downfall environment. The economy will get over this bump and hopefully in the next year the whole country will be able to climb from there onwards. We would like to develop more residential units in the future. We will have to see how long the Orchard Residences Project takes, however. At the moment, we are doing well and we would love to do another project. We look for the land before thinking of the idea, as location is important. There is beautiful greenery here. We are open to different segments of real estate and are truly changing the landscape of residential real estate in Kazakhstan. We hope to set a new benchmark in Almaty and Kazakhstan. As more of such luxury developments appear, people will start to appreciate them more and demand will grow.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The commercial side is obviously small compared to the US and Europe but there is a commitment that quality medicines should be available around the world. At the same time, it is commercially significant because Sub-Saharan Africa is predicted to be the fastest growing region for the next five to ten years. On the corporate social responsibility side, we are relevant because everybody in the world needs medicines and Africa needs affordable medicines. We worked with the Lagos University teaching hospital (LUTH) to set up their e-pharmacy.  It involved the full computerization of the Pharmacy department in LUTH. With this project, the patient flow system can begin to generate timely, reliable and credible data useful for research purposes. Another example is our trachoma initiative, to help reduce bacterial infection of the eye through surgery. Pfizer has treated over 15 million cases. We also established the Pfizer scholar awards program in support of medical education in Nigeria, to help and encourage students that excel in the areas of the pharmacy and medicine.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Nigeria is a huge market of 180 million inhabitants with still many unmet healthcare needs. Some aspects of the pharmaceutical landscape need to be improved upon, especially enforcing regulations on counterfeit products. Sanofi is committed to promoting access to healthcare for the vast population and has been contributing to the growth of the Nigerian economy. Despite the potential there is limited purchasing power in Nigeria. Healthcare cost is majorly out-of-pocket as health insurance is still evolving. This means that affordability is a key consideration and therefore developing products with moderate prices is very important. Zentiva is a Sanofi company that is developing quality and affordable products to tackle the reality of this kind of market. Zentiva has a wide portfolio of products for various disease conditions and has about 50 products with plans to enhance this portfolio and further tailor it to the needs in the country. Sanofi manufactures some of its products locally in GMP pre-qualified facilities on a contractual basis.  This is one of the first steps in the vision and the strategy of Sanofi.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The market is vibrant. The population is here, and Nigeria is clearly the hub of pharmaceutical consumption and manufacturing in the ECOWAS region. Indeed, Nigeria is blessed with more than 120 pharmaceutical manufacturers. We expect some consolidation in the industry going forward to bring in efficiencies, but certainly this is where the market is in this part of Sub-Saharan Africa. In comparison to other parts of the world, we are making steady and slow progress. There is generally a positive trend towards moving the industry in the right direction, which is for better management of the entire value chain from manufacturing through to the retail end. We expect that implementation of the new National Drug Distribution Guidelines in the year 2017 will also improve the system. Progress is also being made by Manufacturers and Regulatory bodies NAFDAC, PCN &amp; WHO for Nigerian Pharmaceutical Sector to operate at levels of international best practices. We only hope for continuity.</p>]]></sections21>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is innovation urgent in the economy of Malaysia today?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DATUK PHANG AH TONG </strong>Our focus at MIDA is on bringing innovation into manufacturing and to a certain extent the services sector. Innovation takes two avenues, from multinationals and local companies. MNCs are most of the time ahead of the curve; whether Malaysian companies can catch up is a different story. It is a challenge to move into the high-end knowledge industry; in the manufacturing sector, in particular, local firms rely on support from MNCs. Local firms are part of the global supply chains of these international companies, and this business model is quickly becoming obsolete compared to countries in the region where SMEs perform at much more advanced levels. Malaysians have been too comfortable in depending on multinationals while being unable to innovate fast enough. Singapore, Taiwan, and Korea were behind us at one time, and pressure from countries such as Vietnam is already noticeable. Innovation is extremely important for us—perhaps not revolutionary R&amp;D, but incremental innovation is what we need today. It is the process and the product that will make us competitive. Human capital is the most important to make this happen, and we should move away from our reliability on resources and avoid the resource curse.</p><p><span></span><strong>AZLI MOHAMED </strong>GE has been around 130 years with a presence in over 180 countries. We play a role in almost every critical industry such as aviation, oil and gas, electricity, and healthcare. Staying competitive is a continuous journey, and innovation is the way forward. Innovation does not begin and end within a company; we need a strategy in place that goes wide and deep across all the stakeholders to innovate together. As a MNC, we cannot have a cookie-cutter approach in every country that we work in; every country has a unique way of doing things and we always partner with the the ecosystem such as supply chain and the public sector. Sharing this responsibility helps us fast track innovation. The geography of product development has changed over time; it is no longer the West that innovates and brings in new products. In the last two decades, we have been strong in reversing the innovation process, with emerging markets starting to play a larger role. In addition, co-creation is a powerful avenue, and we work to rejig the innovation process within GE, where product development used to be a secretive process within; however, we realized that it is no longer the case that engineers and scientists best know what the markets need. We take direct input from our customers; for example, for the new engine that will power the new AirAsia aircraft, the A320neo-LEAP 1A, we consulted heavily with AirAsia and other airlines. Also, we have embarked to morph ourselves into a digital industrial company, to bring the use of data analytics into the traditional industrial space such as aviation, the power sector, and oil and gas. Multinationals should not be ashamed to learn from start-ups and we try to adapt start-up processes into our corporate culture.</p><h4>What role does innovation play in the future for exports from Malaysia, particularly innovation within companies and moving into new fields and new technologies?</h4><p><span></span><strong>WAN LATIFF WAN MUSA </strong>Malaysia's largest export basket has always been E&amp;E, currently amounting to 35% of total exports—around 90% of these come from MNCs operating in Malaysia. A heavy dependency on E&amp;E places us at risk; a slowdown in China is noticeable right away because of our dependency on exports of home appliances to China. We need to diversify our exports, preferably into high-value adding manufacturing sector, such as medical, optical, and scientific equipment. We would like to see our local companies become less dependent on MNCs in the process of innovation and to come up with new products, shorten production processes, and move towards lean manufacturing. MNCs know the way; at MATRADE, we are tasked with supporting SMEs with available tools of innovation to prepare them to be export ready and guide them toward the international market. Currently, SMEs only contribute 17.6% to our total exports, and we would like to see that increased to 23% by 2020. We work with universities and research centers to change mindsets on innovation and with banks to organize funding.</p><h4>How have you gone about implementing greenfield innovation?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DATUK IR. KHAIRIL ANWAR AHMAD</strong> We are the master developer of a Medini Iskandar, a new township in the south of Malaysia. Innovation is at the very core of our development strategy, and we have drafted a smart city blueprint, and because we are building from scratch we have the unique opportunity to develop a smart and sustainable township. The blueprint outlines the key areas that we can promote; for example, we have a healthcare hub around the already-opened Gleneagles hospital, we have Legoland, we are building an integrated command center, and we have smart partnerships with digital enablers like TM. We also aim to become an academic center of innovation, for which we have teamed up with University Technology Malaysia, on a program called the Innovation Challenge. Another area is the creative industry, and we strive for innovative approaches even here, to come up with new ways of art, design, and music. We have good incentives for innovative MNCs to become resident in Medini, and Huawei has started its operations here. Because of our close proximity to Singapore, we offer an attractive and competitive alternative.</p><h4>What new developing technologies will be the most important for Malaysia in the coming 10 years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DATUK PHANG AH TONG</strong> The global economy knows roughly three basic economic models: a laissez-faire system where everything is left to the free market, for example in the US; the central command system, which tends to be more authoritarian like China and Vietnam; and countries with a mixed economy. Malaysia is certainly a mixed economy where a certain amount of economic planning is necessary and where the market should be allowed some freedom. In this respect, the Economic Transformation Program and the Eleventh Malaysia Plan were drafted. The same goes for innovation. It is not just about companies; the government should also understand the dynamics of change. It should act and formulate new regulations—or get rid of them—to compete with other countries. Malaysia today is good in producing technology—if you give us the specifications, we will build it for you. But when it comes to product technology, which involves true innovation, we lag far behind. As a technology producer, we are number four in the world, while on the global innovation index, we are 35 out of 120. So, which should we choose? Apple, for example, is the mother of the supply chain; it uses the non-equity model to get its products made. It does not invest in manufacturing but controls the software and ICT design and lets another company build it. A USD499 iPad costs USD38 in manufacturing and USD8 in assembling—USD46 in total. Innovation is where the money is made; not in the manufacturing supply chain. Developing countries to a certain extent benefit from being part of the supply chain; however, they will not move up to the next level if they rely heavily on the tasks that multinationals give them. We should be on top of this game; Vietnam, for example, is more aggressive in changing the way of doing business.</p><h4>How can the private sector contribute to the level of human resources in the country? </h4><p><span></span><strong>AZLI MOHAMED </strong>MNCs often complain about a mismatch between education and industry requirements, which is an easy call to make. Fortunately, many take responsibility to address this issue and partner with the education sector. GE prides itself on the high percentage of localized positions, all the way up to senior management, wherever we go. At our MRO facilities in Malaysia, we have a 100% Malaysian, highly skilled workforce, servicing aircraft engines from all over the world. Because we are a global firm, there is also global talent; however, that does not stop us from recruiting entry-level positions in each market we work. Having the right pipeline of talent is essential and we are keen to partner with the local industries, academia, and tertiary organizations. Curriculum building is something that should be done in consultation with industry players as well. An upfront approach in addressing the issue of graduate employability is a much better way to move forward.</p><p><span></span><strong>TAN SRI DATO' SERI AHMAD RAMLI MOHD NOOR</strong> This is something companies need to take control of as we face challenges in the labor market. We offer internships to students and young graduates for them to gain experience, and we have our own maritime academy where we emphasize the remanufacturing processes. We work closely with universities and now have the knowledge in-house to come up with our own ship designs. We want to innovate on fuel economy, speed, and weight distribution—practical matters—and small steps in the innovation process. Ships are delivered within a year, and we have committed ourselves to shortening the process to eight months. To do so, we need to review the supply chain and all the processes, for which we take an incremental avenue. Current vessels have reached high levels of automatization and can be manned by as little as four people; that says something about the demand for skilled engineers.</p><p><span></span><strong>DATUK IR. KHAIRIL ANWAR AHMAD </strong>Nurturing talent is the most important thing. Young graduates today see themselves as global citizens and their career choices are not limited to the place where they grow up. We are establishing our education hub in close proximity with Singapore and indeed expect a great deal of cross-border exploration of career opportunities, though not just limited to Singapore. Similarly, for our medical school, we expect to welcome graduates from all over the world. Nurturing talent is a global phenomenon and young graduates should take the chance to gain experience abroad. As property developers, we hope some of these graduates choose to work in Iskandar, in healthcare, academia, leisure, or another sector. We promote various amenities in Iskandar and believe we can retain some of that talent. There are Singaporeans who come to work in Iskandar because they feel there is more space, with a lifestyle more conducive and with great schools. It is a two-way street. We encourage companies in Iskandar to come up with internship programs; we incentivize staff development, and we send our own people abroad to conferences and seminars to develop themselves.</p><h4>What are the major barriers to innovation and what are the most important steps to be taken?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DATUK PHANG AH TONG </strong>It comes down to people; they must be able to have critical thinking. We go around to promote Malaysia as an investment destination and often hear that our graduates have purely academic experience and lack critical thinking skills. Engineers have to start in operating positions because of the lack of experience; our graduates need to be more job-ready—it now takes on average six to nine months to be trained. Today, it is all about Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Today's manufacturing industry is not about large workforces; instead, we need people who can develop robotics and automation processes. Adidas left Germany in 1994 to manufacture in Southeast Asia and recently decided to go back to Germany. This tells us how Germany has advanced its manufacturing processes and Adidas can ease its logistics and warehousing by going back to Germany. We need to keep up with this to remain competitive and it seems that countries without significant natural resources such as Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore are doing better than the ones with.</p><p><span></span><strong>AZLI MOHAMED </strong>All challenges present opportunities, and from perspectives we should take control of innovation in Malaysia. We see the strong efforts by InvestKL, and MIDA to attract foreign investment and, of course, multinationals take an opportunistic approach in their decisions on where to set up shop, for example. Four years ago, Malaysia competed with Indonesia and Vietnam for the set up of our center of excellence in engineering. On the basis of several criteria like competitiveness of the highly skilled workforce and the number of patents in the country, the decision was made for Vietnam. On the other hand, Malaysia is an MRO hub and we look to invest USD60-70 million to expand our facilities here. Our customers make us work harder and drive us to innovate. AirAsia and its business model put our engines to the limits and create a high standard for the industry as a whole. And although real estate is not the traditional sweet spot of GE, whilst moving toward the digital economy with smart cities, the IoT, and the notion of asset performance management, we believe we have something relevant to contribute to the innovation ecosystem.</p><p><span></span><strong>WAN LATIFF WAN MUSA </strong>Although we have a surplus in terms of trade for merchandise, we have a deficit in business trade. We use foreign services more than we export abroad. Other than tourism, most of our services sectors have a deficit in our payment balance. Thus, we need to increase export of goods and merchandise and narrow down deficit in the services trade. Our export composition should be restructured and we should move away from overreliance on multinationals. The mindset of our SMEs should be opened up. TalentCorp is a great initiative as it repatriates talented Malaysians from abroad; these people have a good notion about innovation and this could be a shortcut into bringing knowledge into our system. We try to address the challenges that SMEs face in bringing their competiveness on par. We match SMEs with larger companies, both multinationals and homegrown giants, to spur actual implementation of innovative ideas that come from our entrepreneurs. Secondly, we guide and help them in the process of valorization and selling their products on the international market. We would like the large corporations to impart some knowledge in terms of innovation to our SMEs. Human capital is something we need to take control of on a broader scale. Becoming part of TPPA and other FTAs means nothing if our products do not meet international standards. </p>]]></richbody1content>

Fintech has been around in different shapes and forms, and what has changed now is that it has exploded into this massive opportunity for new players and has become a real threat to the status quo in financial infrastructure. We have always considered technology as an enabler and adapting to digital ways of communication with our client base just became more acute, especially with changing demographics. A bank targeting a more affluent segment of the market will typically have clients in their 40s, 50s, and 60s because that is when wealth is created. This group is reasonably comfortable with having limited technology offerings and really would prefer the sort of face-to-face relationship through our branch network and relationship managers. However, future generations are unlikely to ever visit a branch; they would rather conduct all their business through digital means. There are few products and services that we cannot offer electronically. Our latest digital product is video banking, which caters in particular to those who still prefer to have direct interaction with our staff. It is not even new technology, just a new adaptation via which we try to fill those voids that we believe new fintech companies will not be able to fill. In addition, we envision more partnerships between banks and new service providers, rather than just direct competition.</p><p><span></span><strong>Mohamad Hanif bin Hashim</strong> Innovation is one of our six core values. It is our differentiator when benchmarking against other global energy companies; it is the backbone of our operations. Given the volatility in energy prices, this is the right time for companies in our industry to innovate and be nimble. We have brought creative solutions into Malaysia, and we were the first to introduce a mobile offshore production unit (MOPU) in the country, which was inexpensive and provided the right solution to our client. We have to change our thinking and mindset in finding ways to commercialize new fields at reduced costs. Together with PETRONAS, we are part of CORAL 2.0, which is a cost-reduction alliance made up of all PSCs in Malaysia looking to find innovative means to bring unit costs down. PETRONAS being our key client, the key element to consider when delivering our required production is providing innovative, low-cost solutions for drilling and completion activities.</p><p><span></span><strong>John Stocker</strong> Innovation is one of our key values. We spent billions on R&amp;D and developing our end products. We have been in Malaysia for more than 50 years and have always worked closely with a wide range of Malaysian partners to spur economic and industrial development. Companies like CTRM and SME Aerospace have been going from strength to strength since the 1990s, and we have long-standing relations with them. We have been able to transfer our technology—at the time mostly in civil aircraft programs—and that has allowed companies to become regional leaders in their fields today. Aerospace in Malaysia has developed tremendously, and the industry today supplies Airbus and Boeing. In addition to our aerospace activities, we have our global cyber security-engineering center in Kuala Lumpur that currently employs 350 people, which we anticipate to double in the next few years. It is one of our fastest-growing areas globally and activities here are innovative by default, by nature of the rapidly evolving digital economy. We are glad to host these activities in Malaysia, a tech-savvy market with a highly educated workforce. We collaborate closely with several Malaysian SME firms, one of which is Loka Wireless, which uses our technology called Navigational Signals of Opportunity (NAVSOP), which allows for navigation when GPS is not available. This collaboration is an excellent example of adding value to the local economy as a multinational firm.</p><h4>How does Malaysia fit into your global strategy?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MG</strong> Malaysia is a key contributor to the business in the ASEAN region besides complementing our global solutions, as our shared services center is located here. This center, where we employ 5,000 people, develops technology that is applied elsewhere in the group. On a national level, we are seeing a shift from lower-skilled work to higher graduate employment and a knowledge-based economy. In 2014, we invested MYR10 million in our Collective Intelligence and Command Centre (CnC). From here, we can monitor our global facilities, volume downtimes, technology breaks, and secure the safety of our operations worldwide. We currently employ 150 people at the CnC and we are growing rapidly. We approach technological innovation from two angles: either we develop our own expertise or we partner with new emerging fintech companies. Banking remains a people's business and thus we will not convert ourselves into a digital-only bank; however, we will respond to the demands of our customers and try to stay ahead of the curve of innovation. We provide multi-channel services and our presence in Malaysia is integral to developing our customer responses. From the government side, we have witnessed many incentives and encouragement for bringing in foreign talent and repatriating back Malaysians who live abroad. We have around 15% expatriates in our shared service center, comprising 30 different nationalities. Malaysia is an attractive destination for expats.</p><p><span></span><strong>JS </strong>Malaysia is our regional corporate headquarters, and our global cyber security center is located here. The center develops advanced cyber security products and provides customer support for our global customers. The back office functions here are involved in high value adding technical elements. We have created a unique global capability here, and the availability of talent was the primary drive for our multimillion-ringgit investments. In cyber security we develop solutions to meet specific customer requirements and develop technologies here for our global customers. BAE Systems is perhaps better known for developing and producing complex systems and electronic engineering, so we are well placed to be a part of the rapidly growing cyber sector. We can find great talent here, though we cannot recruit fast enough. We are increasing our ties with universities and have started a graduate intake program as well. Furthermore, we are working in partnership with the National Defence University to deliver an MSc in cyber security management. We also have a joint venture with Malaysian firm Boustead, called BHIC-Bofors, where we supply and service naval guns to the Malaysian Defense Ministry. This joint venture has become a regional hub, and has the global rights for MRO and retrofit services to our legacy Bofors guns.</p><h4>Is education improving the ecosystem of innovation? Is it something you need to get involved in with, for example, graduate programs?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MG T</strong>here are several levels. We have an international graduate program with students from all over the globe and many Malaysians who have studied abroad. They train with us for a period of 12-18 months, with secondments to other parts of our group. At the end of this journey, they can choose to either work in Malaysia or join our international network. We encourage our graduates to take advantage of this international exposure. We have more than 400 Malaysians working abroad in our group, many of whom return to Malaysia to strengthen our franchise here. We do see a crunch between the demands of the industry and the supply of talent. Fortunately, the Malaysian government and regulators have been supportive in allowing us to fill those gaps with expatriate talent. This arrangement works for all the parties involved. TalentCorp has an attractive value proposition and does great work in repatriating Malaysians back to the nation—and we tap into these resources a great deal. It is a good sign that there is commitment from both the public and private sectors to improve talent and consider global dynamics.</p><p><span></span><strong>MHBH</strong> Petrofac's mantra is that our greatest assets are our people. We continuously train and develop our staff and have localized many managerial positions. I myself am an example of this, starting with the company in 2004 and 10 years later leading the company here as its country general manager. We want to cement ourselves in Malaysia in the long term and are aware that we will need to groom our staff to grow with us. In the past two years, we implemented our Graduate Training Program (GTP), through which we have recruited 20 new engineers. Another program, on which we collaborate with PETRONAS, is called Prodigy and intends to combat the brain drain in the oil and gas sector. Due to lucrative positions in the Middle East, where there is a scarcity of talent in the fields of geoscience and petroleum engineering, many young Malaysian graduates have decided to emigrate. The Prodigy Program is intended to come up with a layer of new resource talent to replenish the industry in the future. We jointly identify with PETRONAS the spheres where we might have scarcity in the near future and retune our graduate programs accordingly. Training and development are key to the sustainability of our industry.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the next five years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JS </strong>Globally, around 90% of our business is in defense and 10% in commercial, which is reflected in Malaysia. On the cyber security side, we are pleased to see an increase in our commercial services; banks and other financial institutions increasingly look to protect their software and for tools to combat money laundering. Our largest prospects, however, are largely in the defense sector and are reflected by the opportunities we pursue here. As part of this we continue to strengthen existing partnerships and develop new relationships with Malaysian industry not only to localize our operations, but also to support the broader defense and security industrial development agenda. Our largest customer is the Malaysian Armed Forces and we are focused on maintaining strong relations with all the stakeholders involved here. Another key objective for us is to continue major campaigns, such as the Eurofighter Typhoon program that we are currently proposing to the Royal Malaysian Air Force, which if successful would create around 20,000 jobs in Malaysia and deliver MYR50 billion to the economy through our offset and industrial participation programs. Another major growth area is cyber security. Around the globe, commercial organizations, government departments, and other critical parts of the national infrastructure are waking up to cyber threats. Banks and other financial institutions have already been the targets of attack. With more of these organizations becoming aware of the potential threats, demand will increase. We have a great foothold in Malaysia to grow our business and serve our clients worldwide from here.</p><p><span></span><strong>MHBH </strong>The oil and gas industry is going through an interesting phase. We want to develop ourselves to serve our clients with cost-effective solutions and help them recalibrate their costs. To implement this strategy, we have to create economies of scale for our offering of services, trying to tap into the lowest cost environments possible. Then, when the price goes up again, we can normalize and see the full effect of these new services that we have developed. Like any other company, we continue to support our customers' interests and because we have end-to-end product offerings we are able to provide a wide spectrum, ranging from wells and sub-surface all the way to production. We are in a fortunate position; the near future will see more collaboration between industry players in the oil and gas sector, which we greatly welcome. Furthermore, we are fortunate enough to have worked for many years in the North Sea, one of the toughest offshore areas to operate in. This has provided us with the capabilities and skillsets to survive in other geographical areas. We can capitalize on this experience, replicate these techniques, and have a head start with low-cost solutions in the Malaysian context—a win-win situation for everyone involved.</p><p><span></span><strong>MG S</strong>tandard Chartered, at 141 years, is the oldest bank in the country, which in itself is a feat because not many companies survive that long, let alone in emerging markets. We are absolutely committed to Malaysia. The challenge for us is to evolve and adapt quickly in an uncertain external environment. The financial infrastructure is changing rapidly and staying relevant to our customers is our primary objective. Our brand is well known; however, the taste and preferences of our customers are constantly evolving and we have to be nimble. We are committed to remaining a universal bank in Malaysia, both in retail and commercial banking, and to serving our institutional and corporate clients. We need to remain a part of the fabric of the financial service offerings that we have committed ourselves to. Innovation and investments in our services center are part of the design to stay relevant. As a foreign bank, we have limitations; however, within the given parameters, we are clear about how we can service our clients.</p><h4>What do you envision to be the tasks and objectives for the British Malaysian Chamber of Commerce (BMCC)?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JS </strong>BMCC takes on a significant role in supporting business relationships and facilitating opportunities between Malaysian and UK businesses, and for us the number-one priority is to continue to support and grow this service. Promoting business is about promoting relationships and creating the environment in which commercial organizations can flourish, about creating and supporting the bedrock. Pursuing new trade deals, new agreements, and new relations are of pivotal interest for the UK today, and with the long-standing and strong Malaysia-UK relationship, the BMCC can play a valuable role in supporting this.</p><p><span></span><strong>MG</strong> The chamber could do more on the advocacy side. We could present the British industry with a broader understanding of where the blockages are, and use the influence of the chamber to achieve more than an individual company would. Multinational firms have been active in the international arena for a long time and have taken much for granted. The chamber can be of great relevance as a credible source for British SMEs to provide honest information about the Malaysian market.</p><p><span></span><strong>MHBH</strong> We are hoping that with the oil and gas chapter in BMCC this will create more opportunities and synergies between UK businesses and Malaysia. In order to weather the next couple of years, close cooperation and best practice exchange is essential, and there is a role for BMCC there. Opportunities can be created in this country; different and low-cost techniques can be deployed here for the purpose of making sure that the oil and gas business can flourish and thrive again. This includes the transfer of technology, experience, and personnel.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Three years on from Circular 331, what have been the achievements and the challenges that still need to be overcome for the success of the startup ecosystem?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Henri Asseil</strong>y After three years of implementation of Circular 331 the main consequence has been the depletion of capital. We now have banks directly investing in startups, we have venture capitals (VCs) funding them, and we have money going all the way to the startups and the employees. The disbursement of funds means we can now offer good salaries for these professionals to stay in the country; they can find well-paid jobs that are both lucrative and attractive. Companies are now able to look further out for bigger plans and bigger bets whenever they desire, deterring them from moving away in the meantime. Of the USD300 million of a total USD500 million included in the 331 pot, with Leap Ventures having raised USD71 million in the first closing. The pipeline is looking promising, and now we are over 40% deployed after just one year. The fact that we can take the risk and lead in big deals like this allows the private money to piggyback on the work we are doing. For example, we just closed a USD10 million investment out of a USD25 million round. Circular 331 had an amazing impact in a short period of time, and this something that has not happened elsewhere in the Middle East. That being said, we could still do better. There are many cracks to fix before we establish a fully functional ecosystem—some players are not operating correctly, talent is not being given a chance at the super-early stage, and we have big infrastructure problems with chocking internet data caps.</p><p><span></span><strong>Maroun Chammas </strong>We have witnessed some of the biggest challenges come from the same teams when they are not properly integrated and lack cohesion. Putting a bunch of talent together working under the same business model can be tricky if we do not address early-stage problems such as solving business life expectancy and keep the team together to make them able to run successfully. We have applied specific programs to overcome this challenge by measuring the probability of success of the startups in the first three months. This way, we have avoided wasting precious funds in teams with little chances to succeed and we have been able to focus on those startups with a promising future. 331 has been going for three years, and we will still need another five years to have a comprehensible idea of where startups, teams, and businesses stand.</p><h4>When it comes to the availability of funds, the approach from banks and VCs toward the risks has been different. What is the banking sector's take on the risks accrued by the ecosystem? </h4><p><span></span><strong>Nadim Kassar </strong>Banks generally shy away from risks due to the commitment we have toward our depositors. The high-tech industry is rarely understood for the banking sector, since it deviates from our traditional business lines. However, the emergence of 331 and all the initiatives that have followed have enabled our enrollment in the knowledge economy by funding many of these startups. We are now better equipped to fully understand how the ecosystem works. We have created a team of young talents that understands the industry and opened our portfolios to a new range of growing companies that we did not fund before. Companies such as Berytech and Leap Ventures have helped us better understand how the ecosystem works, and we have been successful in this new and exciting endeavor.</p><h4>The spur of funds to the knowledge economy has brought attention to sectors whose potential was previously unidentified. What segments are the most promising?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Elie Akhrass </strong>We recently held a market study and identified three interesting sectors that can add to Lebanon's international competitiveness: financial technologies, wellbeing, and visualization. The country has the talent and the potential to play an active role in these three sectors in the region. We have a strong financial sector with a long tradition of operations abroad, one of the best healthcare industries in the Middle East, and we have creativity running through our veins. The results from this study show that we can be great performers in these three sectors.</p><p><span></span><strong>Henri Asseily I</strong>n my opinion, Lebanon's biggest strengths lie in its people's resilience, their connections, and openness to other cultures. We are in a demanding region and have always been an open nation to trade and exchanges that are good fundamentals for the creation of an entrepreneurial mindset. We have invested in different interesting companies across different sectors, some of them existed way before 331 was put in place, and we want to keep exploring opportunities in new endeavors in the digitalization of banking, in e-commerce, and in creating an e-government.</p><h4>With the access of funding solved by Circular 331, the remaining problem goes up to market access for the products coming out from the knowledge-based economy. How can this problem be solved? </h4><p><span></span><strong>Henri Asseily</strong> This is the most important thing to the ecosystem, since there will be no company if the products do not succeed. In the knowledge economy you compete against top-notch companies and startups, hence offering the best product is crucial for your survival. Companies also need to tailor their products to the markets they are willing to attract, adjust to their rules, and realize than each market offer different opportunities and demands different assets. What we hope to achieve through the knowledge economy is to see design created in Lebanon and manufacturing produced in Germany or China. Most of the industry that comes out of the ecosystem does not need large factories with overwhelming machinery; they require small factories to produce thousands of electronic devices.</p><p><span></span><strong>SALIM ZEENNI </strong>This was precisely one of the AmCham's goals when we organized Startup Lebanon last year: to attract people by increasing their expectations on the startups we took with us. We do not want our ecosystem players to emigrate; we want them to be exposed to international markets by producing and exporting from their own land. I do not think there is such complexity in customs; we have the Greater Arab Free Trade Agreement (GAFTA), which stipulates a strong custom framework across all Arab nations. We also have the Euro-mediterranean Free Trade Agreement, granting our products direct access to Europe. We also have the GSP system with the US. My point of view relates more to a lack of technology than to difficulties in our customs system.</p><p><strong>HENRI ASSEILY</strong> We still need adequate customs laws to match the growing needs of the industry, since the current state is deterring investments to flow to certain sectors that are more dependent with the import or export of supplies and finished goods. We have seen some cases of high caliber companies that have to stop their profitable business due to the high monetary requirements they get at customs. After all, capital is not unlimited, and it will flow through the easiest paths to reach its targets, hence manufacturing holds little chances to benefit from it. Lebanon has the interesting and potentially profitable position of being in between the problems any emerging market presents and still having fully fledged development in certain economic areas. We can design and build products that match the needs of developing countries around the world. We understand the issues and we have the capabilities to create a competitive local industry. The fact that developed nations are not faced with these problems, and that they do not experience them first hand, gives us the comparative advantage to capitalize on these opportunities.</p><h4>The consensus seems to point at the hindrance antiquated rules cause to the system. How can this issue be solved and how can you as players bring about these changes? </h4><p><span></span><strong>HENRI ASSEILY</strong> The strategy we have embraced is to put pressure from the bottom to the top. With all the complexities in the political sphere, we are aware that the change must come from the economic environment, so we apply pressure to at least bypass the unsolved problems that political classes should be addressing. For instance, putting pressure on the use of the internet, which is jeopardizing the real sectors of the economy. We want to build up the knowledge economy, and to make it really valuable and interesting, so that nobody can sweep it under the carpet. We want to make enough buzz so the problems that are dragging the sector's potential down can be solved. </p><p><span></span><strong>SAMER KARAM </strong>I am actually on the other side of the table concerning these issues. I do not believe we have any challenges. We are no different than any other country when it comes to challenges. All nations face obstacles, and they all deal with them in different ways according to their capabilities and the opportunities they see in them. Lebanon is not departing from an undesirable situation; we have a stable economy, we are not under siege, and we have human talent and economic resources. But we seem to focus more on the problems rather than the solutions. My view is that today we do not have to see why this or that happens, but how we can bumper the opportunities that are in front of us and how we can stream the pipelines of talent, funds, and accelerators to exit profitable startups. There is USD600 million available today, and that is not remotely close enough to how much the knowledge-based economy can take. We have an enormous pool of talent waiting to consume these funds and develop its ideas. We have the money, so let's do everything that is in our hands to keep people here.</p><h4>In terms of promoting this new breed of startups and to help realize their potential at an international level, how are you attracting potential investors to Lebanon? </h4><p><span></span><strong>MAROUN CHAMMAS </strong>One of the concerns that needs to be raised today is the need for seed capital. Berytech started Speed as an accelerator for growing startups and the response has been overwhelmingly positive, but we need to have a stronger ecosystem at the seed level. It is all about the level of the universities and the technical schools—all the things that are pre Speed. We need to call attention on universities to do more with their students, to foster their talents while they are still studying. Today we have a bug chunk of startups that have come out of Speed to operate in Lebanon, in Saudi Arabia, or in the Emirates. But in order to widen the pipe and accelerate the process, we need the universities and technical schools involved in the ecosystem. </p><p><span></span><strong>SAMER KARAM </strong>This concern Maroun talks about is actually being shaped at the moment. We have a big conference coming up this year, where the target is that 30% of an estimated 100,000 attendees will be students. We are aiming at going one step back in the process and tapping the culture in the country. Sometimes, we forget that in order to make entrepreneurs, we need to develop an entrepreneurial culture. We need to nurture their minds and make them see their potential in the long term. Every Lebanese individual who recently graduated from university wants to open his or her business; they realize the ease in which businesses can be achieved in Lebanon. The problem is that many of them do not see the light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to the country's situation. This has changed with the stability brought about by Circular 331; we have created a non-political sector that  stays apart from corruption or conflict of interests at the political level. It is now just a matter of getting them to realize that money can be made this way. It is more hard work, it is longer term, and there is a high risk of failure, but the rewards are enormous. <strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>TAMARA ZAKHARIA </strong>The fact that most institutions are outdated creates a huge gap in linking talents to funds. When students graduate, they are unaware of what awaits them in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, and most of the time their skills are not parallel to the challenges they face when developing a startup. That is why we created Innovation Weekend as a joint initiative with Startup Megaphone to serve as a bridge between university students and the private sector. We had students from all over Lebanon coming for a three-day workshop where they faced the task to solve a company's problem as a practical experience method, the company was so impressed by the students' work that it decided to set up an innovation unit, and it offered the finalists the opportunity to join its program. </p><h4>How can such initiatives be scaled up to bring about necessary changes in the approach of tertiary education toward innovation? </h4><p><span></span><strong>HENRI ASSEILY</strong> Academia in Lebanon has never been research focused. The fact that universities in Lebanon are teaching-driven does not create the necessary type of people to get them into the entrepreneurial spectrum. Students need to go back to research. <strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>NADIM KASSAR </strong>Universities here are focused on getting their students jobs once they graduate. The education system does not cater to the creation of entrepreneurs at all. Of course, every graduate cannot become an entrepreneur and the concern of universities to find him or her a job is both fair and understandable, but we need more effort from their side. <strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>SAMER KARAM</strong> Entrepreneurship is a last resort. This is a heritage of many academic programs that do not see that innovation comes from entrepreneurship, and this has an impact when resources are allocated on research. We try and connect companies to young talent to incorporate them with those areas where company innovation is needed, since these kids have no limits for their thinking. Companies are impressed by how much can be created in such a short period of time and by how many new concepts can come about. Corporations need to focus on internal investments and on creating value that comes out of innovation. They realize that, and that is why they are prone to support the ecosystem. But we need to bridge this cooperation before a few key players take over local industries and vanish any chances of success for an exited ecosystem.</p><h4>Are there a fair number of technical schools and an adequate level of quality among them to graduate the qualified people Lebanon needs? </h4><p><span></span><strong>HENRI ASSEILY </strong>Wherever you ask this question the answer will always be the same: It is never enough. The world is in a constant state of evolution and everything is moving: intelligence, software, digitalization, mobilization; it is us who are lagging behind. The world does not have enough people to feed this ever-growing revolution. We have increased our level of talent production in Lebanon, and we are able to retain them within our borders. Things are moving forward indeed, but it is never enough. </p><p><span></span><strong>ELIE AKHRASS </strong>In the particular case of the UKLTH, we are in the process of creating an academy to deliver certified technical and soft skills trainings, and where we can set a forum to discuss everything that is happening in the ecosystem. We have reached a consensus and will start it by the end of 2016. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Most of Colombia's ports are adequate, but the problem lies in the connectivity with the rest of Colombia. We are going to have four terminals in Buenaventura, which is sufficient. However, the connection among these ports and inland is inadequate. The government is making huge investments in 4G concessions, but we have to expedite this process if we want to be competitive. The government has to pay more attention to the port in Buenaventura, not only in order to be competitive, but also for the people. The condition of the port is currently abysmal, and there is a great deal that needs to be done with regard to social matters. We have a foundation called Étika Verde and are currently working in different neighborhoods in Buenaventura to educate people on environmental issues and on how to invest in their own companies to help them progress. We have an agreement with the government in our concession to invest $80 million over the next 15 years. We are starting next year in Cartagena, investing $50 million in a project, and for Buenaventura we have to invest $80 million. We bought a new conveyor belt system to charge vessels in Buentaventura. We invested around $5 million this year and next year we are going to build a specialized warehouse, for grains, which will cost around $15 million.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Overall in Latin America, ports are fulfilling their goals. Over the last 20 years many countries in the region underwent privatization, and Colombia also took part in this process. This has been beneficial for the region and for the country. In my view the government does not need to be paternalistic toward the ports and should leave their operations to private enterprise. In fact, shortly afterwards privatization Colombia's ports improved their operations. This has been hugely beneficial to the country's foreign trade. As such, I am not really worried about the ports. They are well managed and have a good level of investment, with some ports belonging to international, and some to Colombian companies. What is a concern is the lack of connectivity between ports and cities. This is a severe problem for Colombia. One of our stated goals is to work on the development of the ports. However, the problem is not with the ports, it is with the logistics from the ports to the cities. This is what the country needs to improve on. Currently, it is considerably more expensive to ship cargo domestically from Cartagena Port to Bogotá, compared to shipping it internationally from China to Cartagena. This is due to the poor connectivity and logistics between Colombia's cities.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The currency depreciation and the fall in commodity prices made 2015 a complex year. Our terminal port is specialized in the transport of liquid and solid bulks with hydrocarbons, a sector that has decelerated. The two important port competitors of Barranquilla are Cartagena and Santa Marta. In order to bring more cargo into their ports, the operators had to drop fees to be more competitive. Barranquilla is an important port for hydrocarbons, and as MichellMar is located within the city we subsequently faced a difficult year. The main advantage that a port in Barranquilla has is the Magdalena River, which in the near future will be navigable. That is a major competitive advantage because the river runs through the middle of the country and will allow shipping companies to transport cargo to the heart of Colombia. The gate to the Magdalena, and consequently to Colombia, remains Barranquilla. Every single ship that either comes to or leaves Colombia will have to stop in Barranquilla. That route will connect the mines with the port, which represents a massive opportunity for us. If they improve that infrastructure, we can reduce the time and cost of transport. Therefore, we will definitely be more competitive as a result of better connections. Sometimes freight from Barranquilla to Europe costs the same as cargo from the mines in Boyacá to Barranquilla.</p>]]></sections21>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the status of the privatization program and what impact will it have on the businesses you represent in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ABDULRAHMAN AL ZAMIL </strong>Saudi Arabia has historically been an important focus of investors. In the last 40 years, Saudi Arabia basically started from scratch. In the early 1970s, King Faisal established real working funds, an agricultural fund, an industry fund, and a real estate and housing fund, among others. We all started with nothing, but these funds have been crucial to the growth of the country. Another reason for the success of Saudi Arabia has been joint ventures. We brought the best companies and experts to Saudi Arabia to start joint ventures with local companies, and this kickstarted our industries here. Today, Saudi Arabia is fourth in the world in petrochemicals, with 107 million tons produced a year, and non-oil exports are at almost $60 billion a year. The Saudi economy has been growing in leaps and bounds. Local consumption of non-oil products is now at $200 billion annually. As per the ongoing privatization process, young entrepreneurs and businessmen here today have all been recruited from successful private sector companies and organizations. Half of the Council of Ministers are directors, executives, and presidents of leading private-sector businesses. People have been talking about the fall in oil prices and the hardships associated with that. For the private sector, this is the best thing that could have happened. It means the government is paying more attention to the private sector and to the need to diversify the economy. For the first time, people want the private sector to be prioritized, and there has been a transformation in all areas of the economy. I am sure I speak for everyone here when I say we have never been busier than we are now.</p><p><span></span><strong>HE DR FAISAL ALSUGAIR</strong> The discussion about privatization has been going on for a long time, and it has had its fair share of detractors and critics. Now the current environment has enabled privatization to accelerate and grow, providing better efficiency, better customer services, and better economic conditions and taking a lot of the burden off the government. Our number-one objective is to improve the quality of services. KPIs can be applied to employees in privatization. In privatizing, we can apply KPIs to employees. Secondly, privatization can guarantee financial independence. Today, a huge part of the budget is allocated to civil aviation for the sake of managing, running, and developing airports. It makes companies become financially and operationally independent, and able to generate money for the government rather than just spending it. Another crucial issue is that privatization encourages proper governance by separating the regulator from the operator. A government-run entity cannot do all that. Our airports today are both operators and regulators, but this is wrong. GACA started this process four years ago. We are now ready, and we have a program that is in the final stages of approval by the government and the privatization committee. We were going to privatize everything over a period of three years. In the end customers will see better service, they will see their rights in a clear and transparent way, and they will have a regulator to go to if there is a problem. An interesting example of what we have already achieved is Medina Airport. After we privatized Medina Airport in 2012, we had 40% more Saudi national employees working at the airport, which proves that fears of privatization having a negative effect on the employment of Saudis is unfounded. It has had the reverse effect in the case of Medina Airport, where Saudization increased by 40%. The income generated by Medina Airport for the government has tripled over that same period. What used to be a drain on government resources now makes SAR300-400 million a year for the government. It has been a huge success, and we expect to repeat that success in all the other airports around the country. Technically, Medina Airport was a BTO because the government owns the assets; we will use the same model in Riyadh and Dammam airports.</p><p><span></span><strong>HE MOHAMMED AL HUSSEIN </strong>Since the 1980s, the government realized that regardless of how much it spends, it will never meet demand. So privatization is key in this field. At our council, we have a scheme that covers private health insurance for about 10.5 million people, 3.5 million of those being Saudis. The visitors' visa also establishes compulsory health insurance. Even if he or she visits for two days, they will have health insurance. CCHI has about 2,500 providers, most of which are private. We still need private health insurance to grow; we need hospitals and health clinics to grow because demand is constantly rising. The government will motivate investments in private healthcare and the privatization of government hospitals either by partnership or operation. In five years, the figures will have totally changed. Demand for health services is expected to double by 2019 compared to 2012. We are still trying to see what obstacles are left to attract private investors. One such obstacle is the human resources gap. There is about a 50% gap between supply and demand in human resources. The government and The World Bank insist on having a good training system to cover the gap I mentioned. That gap cannot be met by the government alone, so private investments will play a huge role in the sector. CCHI's 2020 strategy offers a lot of attractive opportunities and initiatives for private investors. The entire sector is geared toward privatization, and that is the only way we will be able to meet Saudi Arabia's rapidly growing future needs. It is also important to note the effect that the digital transformation has had on the health sector. We can now go to any hospital and all the information is in the system. Of course, this transformation requires a lot of investment and work, but it is truly helping transform the health sector significantly. The Ministry of Health is working on a new program that will give everyone his or her own medical card. That is a huge project, and once it goes ahead with it, we will see a lot of changes for the better. Another project covers insurance, making all insurance transactions 100% digital. It will contain all medical and insurance information and history, every visit, and every transaction.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2016?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ABDULRAHMAN AL ZAMIL</strong> I am extremely positive because of the new trend that I have seen in my business and my industry. We are fighting with specialist committees and chambers to make sure that everybody spends government money to recruit and train Saudis. When Aramco set out to meet the demands of this transformation, it committed 70% of its procurement spending to local products, whereas before it was 35%. Every major company is looking at that. Today, electricity is almost 75-80% procurement, which is billions. The same is going on with desalination. We are positive because we see real changes and real players instigating and leading these changes. This is not just talk anymore. This is really happening. Oil prices will go back up, but we should not relax because of that. This change has to continue; it has to keep moving forward; and it has to be successful. The future of the people, the country, and even the region hangs in the balance.</p><p><span></span><strong>HE DR FAISAL ALSUGAIR</strong> Stress from short-term economic pressure has helped remove obstacles that were in our way in terms of privatization, and it has helped us accelerate our programs. It has been a very positive event for us in the medium and long term. I see a positive outlook for 2016 and beyond.</p><p><span></span><strong>HE MOHAMMED AL HUSSEIN </strong>I believe everybody should be positive. Yes, oil prices have been a big challenge. Saudi Arabia has known the importance of diversifying its economy for decades, but it never really took that challenge on seriously. Now it is happening for real, and things are changing for the better. We see real efforts underway, we see an understanding of the importance of privatization, a concerted effort to move away from oil reliance, and an acceptance of the importance of education, training, and technical competence to develop Saudi manufacturing and industrial capacity to meet the challenge of employment and the needs of a rapidly growing country and population.</p><p><span></span><strong>TAWFIQ AL OHALI </strong>Even though it is a very challenging year to meet patient demands with existing budget constraints, I too see this situation as positive for Saudi Arabia. All sectors realize this is the time to support this company and move forward, because this is the future of the supply chain in the medical field. We are more cost-conscious, more efficient, eliminating waste, and utilizing budgets far better. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have been in the business for 68 years, and are part of the economic and social growth of this country. If you analyze the infrastructure and the economy, after expansion the next step is innovation and that is what we sell: planning with imagination and innovation, new ideas of planning. My father started the company in 1948 when he was 22 years old; he was an architect who oriented his business toward industry and residential housing. I entered the company in 1980 and took over the role of Director after my father died. That is when I started our planning division, which was basic manner but we developed a methodology that has been well received and helped us grow in that direction. I had to hire people at the architecture firm who were more orientated toward planning, feasibility studies, and the like.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There is still space to grow in some areas, but this depends on a number of factors. One important element is that the purchasing power in Mexico continues to grow; therefore, demand remains at a healthy level. There is still space to expand in Mexico's retail market, but it has to be done well. There are currently 14 projects planned for the south of the city, and likely only three of them will be completed. They will probably affect existing shopping centers, for they are older and will impact the retail sector in that part of the city, yet the opportunity to grow is still there if developers are able to create a unique design with diverse offerings. Another way of making companies successful is by bringing brands into Mexico in order to diversify the market and fill unattended gaps.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>When I joined the firm in the planning division 15 years ago, we were doing about 10 to 12 market feasibility analyses per year; now, we do about 60. We specialize in this area since the market demands it more through banks, real estate, and the professionalization of the industry. Before 1995, most of the shopping centers and office buildings were built through private equities, family and friends, or major corporations and developers. After 1995, many investment funds came to Mexico, such as GE Capital and Prudential. All of this money came to Mexico and demanded more professional methods to analyze and develop projects; therefore, we grew with that market. As the city grew, the market became more complicated, land became less available, and the competition grew larger.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>One advantage Mexico presents for building high-tech warehouses is that the cost of both labor and land is relatively low; therefore, companies can save money by outsourcing this sort of technological upgrade. Our products rely heavily on the overall state of the economy. Whenever an economic shock occurs, companies are quick to cut off warehousing expenses; yet, a turnaround can occur just as quickly as a crisis recedes and new projects again return to normal conditions. The exchange rate of the dollar is not favorable for Mexico at the moment, so our finances are constrained by the fact that our production supplies are in dollars. There are some industries, such as automotive, that are booming right now in Mexico, but our industry in particular is facing some challenges due to taxes. Mexico nevertheless has a dynamic economy, a sizable population of young people, and an incentivized industry structure; hence, we see plenty of opportunities to continue moving forward.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Foreign investment has increased. We have seen several companies opening or expanding their businesses all around Mexico, from the US, Italy, Germany, Japan, and Korea among others. There are state-of-the-art industrial parks. Distribution is much more centralized and more institutional. Large family companies are disappearing; some of them have been acquired by US companies, changing not only their names but their whole selling structure. Most of the recently installed OE manufacturers are looking and also supporting the development of local suppliers. Large users are approaching manufacturers to get direct contact and obviously, trying to get better prices and services and ensure there is a commitment from the manufacturer. Challenges have not changed, but the methods of negotiations have. Attracting customers has always been challenging. Fortunately, Timken has an extensive product portfolio with new products every year and we are working closely with distributors and end users to help them to improve their reliability and performance. Having more competitors abroad has led us to create different strategies.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 2007, Item started setting up a central warehouse for the US market to support and supply products to two existing distributors in the US, and then in 2011 Item defined the central warehouse as the headquarters for North and South America, and we have since then expanded. In 2014, we set our goals based on being close to this market, where a great deal of manufacturing was happening. Mexican, American, and other German companies also relocated here because of the long history and relationship between Mexico and Germany, which began with Volkswagen in Puebla and was followed by other suppliers coming over. The original plan was to have four partners, so we are now in the process of defining the fourth territory. This is difficult because we cannot reach this area as just one cluster, given its extensive spread. The infrastructure in Mexico is still in the development process. There is great potential in this market and, for Item in particular, we see Mexico as part of Item America and Mexico should have around one-third of the entire sales of Item goods in the next two years.</p>]]></sections21>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Ithraa play in Oman's economic development?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HH Sayyid Faisal Al Said</strong> The organization was established in 1997 with two objectives: to attract investment into Oman and promote and facilitate doing business with local and international investors. With regards to our investment promotion strategy, especially for 2015, we are now focusing on how to cluster three major sectors that we have promoted for the past five years: petrochemicals, logistics, and tourism. Different projects can be clustered within these sectors. We are focusing more on attracting big name companies and experienced professionals, mainly from Asia, our neighboring countries, the US, and Europe. We held a meeting for interested investors from all of the major companies operating in GCC countries, and focused on some important sectors for Oman's economy. According to our survey, 75% of 100 investors who attended that meeting would like to pursue business opportunities in Oman in the next three years. There are many positive indications that are encouraging us to continue our work in 2015. Our investment promotion plan, activated every five years, is in effect now. We are revising the sectors and target countries, re-evaluating the initiatives to introduce, and researching whether to target local or international investors. In 2015 we will be more focused on project promotion. After selecting a number of projects, we will carry out direct marketing to international investors. After the selection of one project from each potential sector and internal research regarding regulation and approval, we will approach these investors with proposals.</p><p><span></span><strong>Taleb Al Makhmari I</strong>f I were to highlight some of our recent Ithraa success stories, I would certainly include the 2013 UNCTAD Award for Excellence in Promoting Export-oriented FDI. This is a major international prize and one we're very proud of. We recently organized trade missions to Brunei, China, Italy, Iran, Ethiopia, Dubai, and Italy, and the trips were very successful and have helped strengthen our business ties with these important international markets. We also played a lead role in the success of the Omani Products Exhibitions held in Riyadh, Dubai, and Doha. This initiative was designed to help expose local companies to the many commercial opportunities available in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. And with mega events such as the World Cup and the World Expo coming to the region, it's important we help local businesses explore and penetrate these markets. In December 2014 we organized, for the second consecutive year, the Oman Competitiveness Forum. This attracted presenters and participants from across the globe. It was a resounding success and has become an annual flagship event for us. Having a competitive national offer is central to our work in promoting non-oil exports and attracting inward investment.</p><p><span></span><strong>Azzan Al Busaidi</strong> The Directorate General of Planning &amp; Studies was created to provide information on Oman's business environment as well as serve new and returning inward investors.</p><p><span></span><strong>Nasima Al Balushi </strong>We offer many services for Omani exporters. One of the services we provide is to collate studies of different markets that have been identified for exporter strategies. We also help them participate in international exhibitions and B2B meetings, as well as business matchmaking. In terms of capacity building, we are providing training seminars on different topics for exporters. We have identified 21 countries that are lucrative for Omani exports, and we have identified 59 products that have the potential to be exported. Our activities focus on exporting those identified products to these countries. We want to increase our oil exports as well, and in 2016 we will be focusing primarily on the GCC. An exhibition in Jeddah took place through a committee called OPEX to include chambers of commerce as well as other organizations. Around 100 companies participated in different sectors over the course of three days. We participated in a fair in China for the marble industry, and two other events including one in Italy. We attended a business matchmaking event in Ethiopia, which was also very successful, with over 20 Omani exporters there to meet potential business partners. </p><h4>What makes Oman an attractive place for investors?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HH Sayyid Faisal Al Said</strong> Foreign investors are mainly interested in sectors like logistics. They want to utilize Oman's location as a gateway for the GCC, making use of infrastructure in place and under construction, such as the upgrades underway at ports, airports and the railway line that will connect Duqm with the entire GCC. This infrastructure has significantly increased Duqm's opportunities to become the hub of the region within the next 10 to 15 years. Investors are also looking at petrochemicals and the downstream projects in Sohar dealing with metals, petrochemicals, and hydrocarbons. The most common word used by investors to describe Oman is stable. Oman is a stable country, politically and economically, which is important because investors are looking not only where they can do business, but where they can live and raise a family. We have built good relationships with many nations, East and West. It is a multicultural, open place. Our challenge now is how to properly promote the country to the business community, which we are working on now through building capacity and training. The market is very dynamic. If an investor is determined to do business here, it is possible. Of course some investors coming from certain countries will find the process smoother than others. We compare best practices and learn from other countries similar to us in terms of government size, population, and market. For Oman, it is very important to look into competitiveness, and Ithraa lobbies government agencies to improve conditions. Doing business in Oman is becoming more attractive to investors, though we need to continue to revise investment law and regulations to minimize procedures.</p><p><span></span><strong>Taleb Al Makhmari</strong> With the impact of globalization and the rise of the “Attraction Economy," it's increasingly important that Oman gets its international image right. Essentially, we're up against every country in the world competing for the consumers' attention and respect. Let's be clear, consumers are attracted to clear and consistent messages about things they value, from competent governance and friendly and hospitable people to financial transparency and investment opportunities. It's in these areas that Ithraa is working with a host of public and private sector partners to present unified and coherent messages. As a nation, Oman's always seeking to enhance its role in the global economy by making the most of the opportunities created by new or established global markets. For that to happen, Ithraa is actively encouraging and supporting more Omani businesses to sell their goods and services overseas and it's attracting more quality international investment. Indeed, all of this will help realize the goals and objectives outlined in Vision 2020.</p><p><span></span><strong>Azzan Al Busaidi</strong> The regulations are changing, and primarily the business environment could be described as favorable. If we look at economic growth in 2014, 4.6% and 10% stemmed from non-oil activities.  Oil activities actually decreased by 2.4%. This suggests that the environment in Oman is conducive, and that it attracts growth and investments. FDI accumulated around OMR36 billion ($93.49 billion) in 2014, and this is also an indicator that, despite the changes, it is still a market where people would like to do business. There have been some areas where Oman needs to work harder in order to improve the investment environment both from a regional and international perspective. There are a mix of challenges, some to do with internal laws and regulations that have to constantly be reviewed and approved. All countries in the region have a similar vision to diversify their economies, develop the private sector, and increase the creation of jobs. The competition will be quite stiff, but Oman has the potential to grow its private sector and succeed.</p><p><span></span><strong>Nasima Al Balushi </strong>The mining sector is booming now. We are trying to focus on diversifying into all sectors and not just the ones that are growing. We are encouraging companies from different sectors to go internationally with their products. Trade delegations are beneficial because they do not encompass just one particular sector like exhibitions do. We are trying to shift more of our exports to Africa because we see a lot of potential there. We believe this will help Omani companies diversify their markets, instead of just exporting to the region.</p><h4>What have been the main activities of Ithraa in the past year?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HH Sayyid Faisal Al Said</strong> In 2014 we saw major activity in our target market. We received many visits from interested investors, and negotiations commenced between potential foreign investors and Omani investors. Ithraa visited Brazil, Japan, Singapore, and India. In April 2014 we planned an Omani-Brazilian business forum. One potential investor from the forum has begun negotiations and trial agreements with some local oil and gas companies. We arranged another forum in Tokyo last October, focusing on aquaculture, fisheries, some manufacturing industries, such as automotive spare parts, as well as logistics. From that event, we have found investors interested in an ongoing discussion about opportunities in Oman, resulting in 15 investor visits. <strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Taleb Al Makhmari</strong> We work closely with domestic exporters and run an annual visit program to Omani manufacturers, which helps us identify any export challenges or obstacles encountered by domestic firms. The field visits also provide us with an opportunity to brief domestic exporters on Ithraa-led activities and services. We've also identified importers of Omani products and have invited them to visit the Sultanate. In this regard, we organize regular B2B matchmaking meetings, which link Omani exporters with international buyers. On the international front, we have trade and investment representatives in key global markets, all actively involved in promoting Omani products as well as investment opportunities. Indeed, helping domestic companies penetrate mature as well as emerging markets is extremely important to us. In fact, we've had considerable success in this regard and the number of Omani firms exporting to international markets continues to rise. With regards to more mature markets, we've been helping local companies participate in major international trade shows in the Gulf, the US, Asia, Africa, and Europe. We've also been encouraging Omani exporters to take advantage of the Oman-US Free Trade Agreement, which has seen our non-oil exports to the US reach over $480 million in 2013. Exports matter because they represent the very sectors that drive wealth, attract investment and talent, boost productivity and innovation, and generate employment. The production of exported goods and services creates jobs, both directly and indirectly in the supply chain. One study finds that every $1 billion in new exports creates 5,400 additional jobs. In fact, SMEs that export generally experience greater revenue growth than non-exporters and weather tough economic times better as a result; in one international study, SME manufacturing exporters grew revenues by 37% while non-exporting manufacturers experienced a 7% decline in revenues</p><h4>How can investment in education support competitiveness?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Azzan Al Busaidi</strong> Human resources are just like any other resource in a business, and human resources require a set of things such as healthcare, housing, and proper infrastructure. We need to widen the base to accommodate these resources. The majority of the resources today work for the public sector, and additional investments need to be made. SMEs need to be widened because they are renowned to be responsible for creating a large number of jobs in developed economies. In terms of education, it is an area where a lot is going on in both primary and secondary schools. The importance of the curriculum is taking pace with what is happening around the world. The focus must be on science and mathematics, and even at a higher level at training institutes, colleges, and universities. Education can be tricky because it takes a long time to see positive change happening. The government's focus on SMEs is in alignment with this, and the percentage of students in 2014 who wanted to join the private sector cannot even compare with today. Today, there is a growing understanding and commitment from the youth in either joining the private sector or establishing their own businesses. That is a clear indication that the entrepreneurship spirit is reemerging in Oman.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the current foreign export and investment environment for Omani companies?</h4><p><strong>Nasima Al Balushi</strong> There are many political issues that are happening, which pose both an opportunity and a threat for the Omani exporters. For example, we are dealing with tariff barriers in many countries in the GCC; standards are also being changed constantly, and we are not being informed properly. When exporters try to reach those more difficult markets and they are not informed, the financial difficulties can be harmful. The most important part is to work on interfering with the tariffs and facing different challenges through collaboration with the government. </p><p><strong>HH Sayyid Faisal Al Said </strong>In this region, there are many markets, such as Iran, Pakistan, and India, presenting a number of opportunities. Ethiopia, with a population of over 90 million people, holds potential for Omani companies to increase their size of business, establish new ties with companies in these markets, and utilize the multilateral agreements we have in place. Oman is two steps ahead because we have an FTA with the US and a logistics advantage. Any company wanting to enter the US market can do so using Oman as a base. We have also a multilateral agreement in place that makes Oman a backyard corridor for Central Asia countries going to Iran. There are a lot of opportunities and channels that can be used in this regard.</p><p><span></span><strong>Taleb Al Makhmari </strong>Omani companies that are new to exporting often need help getting started. Even companies that are aware of global opportunities often prefer operating within the confines of Oman's market, where they have successfully grown their businesses. Led by Nasima Al Balushi, Ithraa's Export Development Directorate is taking a proactive approach to supporting the export efforts of Omani businesses, ensuring, for example, that local firms are well-represented at important trade shows around the world. We understand that Omani companies require assistance expanding into foreign markets due to their own internal constraints and perceived trade barriers. Businesses have suggested that challenges with customs and compliance, distributors, intellectual property protection, financing, marketing, packaging, and language barriers are some of the biggest barriers to becoming exporters. In response to these challenges, Ithraa created the Trade Up seminar series, which is designed to help Omani enterprises that are new to overseas trade take the plunge, as well as assist those already trading overseas to increase sales. Through the Trade Up series, we have tapped into the experiences of seasoned exporters to give businesses ideas and advice on how to avoid the main pitfalls and build a successful book of export business.</p><h4>Can you highlight some of the most important roles in which e-services and ICT initiatives are being implemented on a business and government level?</h4><p><strong>Azzan Al Busaidi </strong>What we are doing is part of the government's vision for developing e-government as a single platform for nationals and residents or even investors overseas. We recently signed an agreement with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry allowing us to issue commercial registrations for foreign investors from abroad with investments from OMR1 million ($2.6 million) and above. We are working on making this service available online so that investors do not have to be in the country to benefit from services. According to the press and those concerned in this field, more than half of the services are available online. The aim is to try and increase the number of services provided online to the fullest in the next three to five years. There are two levels, and we need to explore the services by the government to the investors, or try and push other government departments to expedite the process of providing their services on their websites to the general public. The development is positive on both ends.</p><h4>What major opportunities do you see coming up in the next year?</h4><p><strong></strong><strong>Nasima Al Balushi </strong>Every year we are trying to increase the number of events and countries in which we will be attending events. Before we were considering one or two exhibitions, but we have developed substantially over the past few years. We are focused more on trade delegations in addition to the exhibitions with a focus on capacity building for the exporters too. Each and every one of the companies that have utilized our capacity building has been able to find a partner and market for their products. We are constantly conducting market studies for potential export opportunities, such as in Singapore and Egypt. We have a traditional presence in the GCC because it is easier to start exporting to neighbouring countries. Looking at culture and language, it is much easier in these areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>When we started the business in the 1990s, we did not intend to work in the public sector, but after a decade we conceded. We wanted to work with companies that understood the security risk of managing their business. Those that do, tend to be international companies. 90% of our business is in the private sector, but the public sector is increasingly opening up and presenting opportunities. We want to see a more transparent government. We are strong in the markets that we serve, and we see quite a bit of genuine interest in the different sectors that we attend to. Over the past five years, there has been more of an appreciation for the risk that management brings to a business. Our portfolio is balanced with 50% international and 50% local companies across the sectors. We serve many banks and oil and gas companies. With the elections, we saw quite a spike in our business through managing movement and security, providing vehicle protection, and securing events.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Once we complete the plant we will be reducing certain costs on import tax to between  5-10%, which will alleviate some of weight from our shoulders. This means that production will occur in Nigeria, allowing us to sell the same quality, but built in country. The current terrorism and criminal challenges in Nigeria have exposed the fact that the police and military need more modernized and specialized vehicles. We are proud to note that the Nigerian police are pleased with our products. And with the growth in the market, we know they will remain satisfied for some time to come. As part of our services too, Inkastrans offers professional armored vehicles driver training. In this regard, it is worthy to note that we trained the Nigerian Police on the operation of some Riot Control Water Canon Vehicles supplied to them as well as drivers of Ghana's Central Bank when we supplied them with Cash Transit Vans. Nigeria plays a large role in our global operations, and it has been that way for the past seven or eight years. We came at the right time, and began developing a brand.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We were paying 5% duty on imported parts, which increased our overhead costs considerably. However, with the recent lowering of duties as incentives to domestic assemblers, we have now become more competitive. For instance if you want to bring a fully built armored Land Cruiser into Nigeria today, you pay 70% duty. However enforcing these new incentives has been a challenge. This is because many manufacturers are panicking because the borders have been porous, and products enter through the back door. But with the new government's zero tolerance for corruption, the market will begin to shape up. People will be forced to pay the 70% duty. Currently, the duty is much lower than 70% because the borders are so porous. Now that the new government has declared zero tolerance for corruption and nefarious activities, we should begin to see much activity in terms of the manufacturing. I can assure you that because our products are made in Nigeria by Nigerians, they have shown the government that Nigerians have what it takes to produce in their own country, given the opportunity.</p>]]></sections21>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You're all VIPs of the business community in Nigeria. How have your businesses impacted the country?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Aliko Dangote</strong>  Nigeria's economy is dependent on oil revenue, which makes it vulnerable to fluctuating crude oil prices. Nigeria is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of crude oil; yet, due to our low refinery utilization rate, we are one of the largest importers of refined petroleum products. This opportunity and challenge were major drivers in my decision to embark on the $9 billion, 650,000bpd refinery project. The generous grant from USTDA will provide essential training of the critical human capital needed for this extremely technical project, particularly given that this has previously been a largely inactive sector with little to no opportunities to build up the necessary practical skills. The project will eliminate Nigeria's dependence on foreign refined petroleum products and, therefore, reduce costs of all goods and services. </p><p><span></span><strong>Femi Otedola</strong> The vision was to turn the then African Petroleum Plc around and build a world-class business. We saw a huge opportunity to build an efficient chain of retail outlets that would surpass the expectations of the shareholders. We achieved that and went on to expand the vision to become the foremost integrated energy solutions provider. Today, we own assets across various aspects of the energy chain and are poised to invest in further expansion and asset acquisition to solidify our position. </p><p><span></span><strong>Hakeem Bello-Osagie</strong> We have had a much stronger focus on quality of service, a much stronger focus on the youth market, and a much stronger focus on innovation. As the fourth operator to arrive, five to 10 years after every other operator, we cannot do what everybody else has done; we have to set ourselves apart to convince people to leave their existing operators to join Etisalat, in addition to tapping into the new customers in the market. We are very much a data company and a company for young people. The combination of Abu Dhabi and Nigeria has worked very well. I have to salute our foreign partners because, apart from the initial equity that it provided, it also provided the company with a significant proportion of shareholders loans so we have not had to rely on expensive bank debt as much as the other telecoms companies have done.</p><p><span></span><strong>Jim Ovia </strong>Zenith Bank is built on the core values of people, technology, and service. A super synergy between these values has been the backbone of Zenith Bank from inception to date. Zenith thrives by attracting excellent people and putting the right people in the right places. Zenith Bank staff members receive the best training available, which has helped to build a strong corporate culture of goal-oriented activities. By the continuous training of our staff and exposing them to best practices in all aspects of banking, our people are empowered to be creative, innovative, and, at the same time, operate at the highest level of efficiency.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Wale Tinubu </strong>We are committed to strategically expanding our African footprint, but we are first focused on expanding our operations considerably in our home country. When we went into downstream operations, our job was to become the leader. We entered the gas business, where there was only Shell Gas with the Agbara pipeline, and became the largest private sector gas distribution company in the country. When we went into the oil service business, we became the largest rig operator in the business. Now we are in the upstream sector, and we are certainly the largest indigenous company by reserve base and production. We are not stopping there, because we intend to continue profitably expanding our operations.  </p><p><span></span><strong>Tony Elumelu</strong> The principles underlying Africapitalism are at the core of much of what I do. I believe in Africa and I also believe that Africans are best placed to solve many of the problems that the continent still faces. In my business activities, both at Heirs Holdings Limited and at United Bank for Africa Plc—a banking group with operations in 19 African countries and presence in New York, London, and Paris—which I chair, I endeavor to demonstrate how a long-term view, making investments that create jobs and impact communities while addressing a social need can be consistent with the profit motive and a decent return on investment. The key to the sustained development and socio-economic transformation will be driven by entrepreneurial activity in trade and commerce rather than aid. The private sector is obviously best placed to drive this movement. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming year?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Aliko Dangote</strong> It is difficult to predict what will happen in the coming year, given the fluid nature of regional and global developments; but projections for 2016 from various sources suggest that the global economy will rebound slightly next year after the slow-down experienced in 2015. Across Africa, a number of countries like Nigeria and Zambia that are historically resource dependent will likely continue to face the after-effects of lower commodity prices.</p><p><span></span><strong>Femi Otedol</strong>a Despite the economic upheavals we are experiencing at the moment, the Nigerian economy is still resilient and will stand the test of time. For the oil and gas sector, I see increased participation of indigenous firms as a result of their continuous efforts in building capacity and solid business structures</p><p><span></span><strong>Hakeem Bello-Osagie Etisalat</strong>, subject to the government taking action to ensure that there are fair competition rules—and there have not been fair competition rules up until now—will have a good year. For Nigeria, I expect that in 2016 the government will begin to get a grip on some of the key problems from which it has suffered. It will be difficult for them to achieve a turnaround in the space of 12 months, so people should be realistic with their expectations. Next year will be challenging, but by 2017-18 we will begin to see the consequences of some of the key decisions they will take in 2016, and I expect that those will be positive.</p><p><span></span><strong>Jim Ovia</strong> The outlook for the remaining part of the year is bright given the public confidence in the current government since government policies affect businesses to a reasonable extent. Nigeria, being the biggest economy in Africa, is the preferred investment destination for everyone looking to maximize their return on investment.</p><p><span></span><strong>Wale Tinubu </strong>We are an integrated energy company with investments across the entire energy value chain in downstream, midstream, and upstream operations. The ConocoPhillips transaction is one that sees Oando become the leading indigenous oil and gas producer in the country. It certainly puts us in the top 100 oil and gas companies globally in terms of reserves and production, and it is a transaction that makes us the first Nigerian company to become one of the partners in an onshore joint venture. We intend to do more transactions of this nature to expand our footprint within the sector.</p><p><span></span><strong>Tony Elumelu </strong>From an economic perspective, I am very happy that the recent elections and transition in Nigeria were without incident. This is evidence of a growing political maturity. Business thrives in a secure and stable environment so peaceful elections and transitions are good for business. Governments and policy makers also need to focus more energy and attention on a consistent policy regime aimed at ensuring the right sort of incentives are created to make African economies more productive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our Medical tourism team attend and participated in the World Wide Meeting of Medical Tourism in Washington DC last August and were part of the Colombian Health provider institutions supporting the ProExport Colombia organization that promotes the most important Clinics and hospitals from Colombia. We present our clinic by showcasing our specialist staff and diversity of programs addressing issues such as patient safety programs and protocols, and continuous improvement programs, as well as patient benefits and the outstanding comfort of our facilities, the congeniality of our personnel and the efficient operation in healthcare delivery and administrative processes. We also have a website featuring complete information for doctors, patients and family plus all information required by insurance companies. Motivated by certification from an international high quality healthcare delivery system enabling us to offer our services in the US and Europe we work determinedly to retain this status. We estimate having invested almost $68 million in our healthcare delivery complex, mostly in top of the range medical equipment for our operating suites, at the ICU, and in in communication technology facilitating academic exchange among doctors worldwide.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are recognized as high definition dental surgeons for having the most talented professionals in all aspects of dentistry on our staff, and for the exacting standards of hygiene we insist on, and which today's patient expects. Our facilities feature computerized anesthesia, as well as CAT scan systems where digital prints are conveniently taken should a patient experience any symptom out of the ordinary. We are also currently working to receive additional accreditation, which is vital at the international patient level. We expect to have accreditation by the end of 2015, making us the first clinic such clinic in Colombia. We work with German multinational Sirona, whose annual technical updates on the latest equipment keep us in the loop. We also have a partnership with Bredent for implants, where we also receive any necessary training. We tend to offer more products and services from Germany than form any other part of the world. Equipment maintenance is done by a German technician, who works with is for three months, which is a true advantage for the clinic. Few other companies have access to such technology in Colombia. Our partnerships in the US are mainly for materials, such as aesthetic materials market leader Ultradent. Dentistry in Colombia is attracting considerable foreigner interest. First of all, documentation is swiftly available and insurance regulations are more convenient, whereby we are best placed to provide solutions to diverse problems.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Free healthcare zones bring a lot of benefits. Normally there is a 35% tax, and here it is only 15%. Duty-free healthcare zones provide stimulus for companies to grow and create more jobs. On the other hand it is challenging because there is currently a heavy bureaucratic culture characterized by meticulous formalities—we faced it while we were preparing our new building—and institutions do not have the freedom to make their own decisions, while the government is very slow at issuing authorizations. We faced many problems with this, as we had to stop the transfer to the new building until we got the permit. For the majority of specializations we have differentiated services. We have fostered a particular service culture, which we follow systematically. Our entire staff applies this culture to our services, the treatment of patients, and personal behavior. We have specialized groups in every area—in the treatment of spinal injuries, and orthopedics. We do not just offer general orthopedics, but differentiated groups with their own specialization: neurosurgery, cancer, cardiovascular surgery, pediatrics, and all specializations have their own program. Each institution does its best, and not merely in response to the presence of competing institutions.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>There are no specific sectors of higher demand—the Colombian economy grows steadily and in a comprehensive manner. However, there are certain companies that currently require more consultancy services, due to sudden or extensive growth. These companies mostly required advice on internal organization. This allows them to focus on their core business activities at critical junctures. We tell all our clients that Colombia will be the fastest growing economy in the region for the foreseeable future. The role of our company is to professionalize their internal processes, as well as develop solid strategies and increase competitiveness. Outsourcing will be a growing area of activity in the future. However, companies have to understand that they need qualified companies to outsource some of their operations; otherwise they run the risk of losing control of their business activities.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Five or six years ago international companies were coming to Colombia and undertaking everything themselves, by bringing in expatriates to run their operations. Yet over the past three or so years, it has become even more imperative for companies to optimize their resources, whereby outsourcing has become an ideal solution. They only have to send the people who are totally focused on the business. The back office support and everything else that they need is provided through outsourcing. And while this may not be a cheap undertaking, it expedites business processes. With a good outsourcing partner, an international company can start up operations in Colombia within a month, from setting up the company, to opening bank accounts, and be ready to invest within the same period of time.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In Colombia, the trends in human resources are focused on the welfare of employees, such as workers' compensation, personal development, development of competency-based skills, leadership and even happiness at work and emotional salary. In the technology arena, the trends include collaborative internal social networks and e-learning as a tool to disseminate knowledge. Outsourcing is viewed by our clients as an effective alternative to optimizing resources—i.e. saving time and money—while allowing them to focus on expansion and business growth. We began in the health sector and with SMEs, which tend to lack a proper HR department, thus motivating clients to outsource due to cost savings and headcount flexibility.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have worked with around 10 universities abroad, including the Tecnológico de Monterrey, El Politécnico de Turí­n in Italy, among others. We encourage our students to spend time abroad, which naturally is an expensive endeavor; we provide scholarships and loans wherever possible to enable this. Meanwhile, many students come from abroad to study here for a few months, especially from Mexico, Argentina, and the US. At this point we have 6,000 students altogether, and 1,000 of those are post-grads. We have one PhD program in engineering in association with the University of Cartagena. In the near future, we will also be setting up another PhD program with the University of Cartagena. We are setting up a program in naval architecture. Half of Colombia's territory is coastal. The country also boasts a richness of biological diversity that demands extraordinary solutions. I am working to train researchers to consider the sea in the context of naval architecture, technology, and offshore oil. Meanwhile, Cartagena is in need of well-trained medical doctors. Cartagena is becoming an address for medical tourism. Colombia has excellent doctors and also produces medicine, albeit not in Cartagena. Local medical facilities require overhauling, and encouragingly new and significant clinics are being opened locally.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>At the graduate level, we have the Global MBA program, which is a program we run with Tulane University in New Orleans where we operate dual degree programs. They award a degree and we also award an MBA degree. Related students benefit from three international experiences. Some classes are taught by professors who are foreign nationals with international experience. At the end of the first year, the students go to New Orleans for two weeks and at the end of the second year they go to Paris for two weeks, and then Beijing for two weeks after that. We have another MBA, which is not global. Nonetheless, all the students on that program have international experience, too. This program is a shorter experience, and we have five or six opportunities for these students to study abroad, in the US, the Polití¨cnica in Valencia, Spain, the University of Chile, and in Peru. For undergraduates, we are members of the International Student Exchange Program, which allows our students to select from hundreds of destinations to visit. We also have additional agreements with schools in France, such as Sciences Po, Ecole Supérieure de Commerce, and Lyon. We have sent students to INAS for engineering training. I think France and Germany are the most important partners for exchange programs and we receive around 50 undergraduates a month from those two countries alone. Our university offers dual degrees with three schools in Europe, two in France and one in Spain. We also offer undergraduates international internships.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our university has a strong partnership with France, as we have a large exchange program with French universities, including Sciences Po in Paris, in Bordeaux, and elsewhere. We have also been building relationships with institutions in the UK, such as  University College, London, The University of Manchester, and Norwich University. We have seen a 30% rise in the number of postgraduate admissions. Moreover, our introduction of a number of new Master's programs has been highly successful, such as Development Management, in which students devise creative development projects for various regions of Colombia. We have also introduced Master's programs in Political Marketing and Political Communication; these garnered much attention with the presidential elections last year, and the local elections this year. We have been working on interdisciplinary models within the university, in conjunction with schools of Business Administration, Economics and Politics in order to combine our efforts and unite various disciplines. In terms of new faculty projects, we are focusing intensely on technology: how the University uses it and how students can professionally maximize its application. We are collaborating with other universities in Silicon Valley, the UK and France, and possibly India. We plan to begin offering graduate programs and executive seminars in this field, and eventually to introduce an undergraduate program.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our university has a joint research project in social science, which is developed with professor Miguel Angel Campos at the Autonomous University of Mexico. In the area of health sciences a professor named Gladys Espinilla who undertook a sabbatical year at the University of Washington, is persuing specific practical issues related to genetics. Another research group, the Rema Group, participated in a call for Colciencias and just won a grant to develop a research project with them, financed and released in an international publication. We have a very good relationship with the scientist Manuel Delquin Patarrollo, who was a member of the university board of governors of the university for several years. He oversees an immunology center at the National University of Colombia. And we have a graduate of bacteriology and clinical laboratory at the National University of Colombia, who is currently a senior executive at Colciencias. Regardless of the budget of each of these research projects, they can take advantage of mobility, either nationally or internationally. We have conducted several shared projects in the US, Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Chile. And through these international conventions of mobility there has been a huge increase in movement of our students and professors to different countries. In 2011, 12 students were studying abroad, but by 2014, this number was up to 60.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We are mostly interested in developing the relationship between Colombia and Brazil. In addition to Brazil, we are also focused on developing agreements with universities in Argentina and Chile. We have close to 200 agreements worldwide—Australia, US, Europe, and so on. Such agreements afford the university worldwide relationships—different cultures, different education systems—facilitating the exchange of students, and the exploration of new alliances through research. For example, in our operations in Australia, we have the double degree with Queensland University and a second university. We also have  degrees in universities in Switzerland in business administration and service or hospitality management. We are also focused on a school of psychology in Italy, which is a highly specific strategy. We have an international business office that is preparing to discover universities and countries we are interested in developing agreements with. We mainly promote the university through international meetings. We have workshops and we also encourage our professors to network when they are conducting their research internationally, working on theses, Ph.Ds., or Master's degrees. We put them in contact with these universities and develop their relationships. After that, we have the opportunity to explore the possibilities for exchange students or else joint research.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our research has supported some CRC decisions about contract, protocol disclosure and service complaints mechanisms to improve the defense of consumer rights within the communication services in Colombia. In addition, over the past seven years the research group in consumer psychology has developed a line of training for other regulatory Colombian agencies (such as SIC- Superintendence of Industry and Commerce) underlying marketing and advertising, unfair competition, protection, and consumer rights. We have been developing research in different fields related to our academic programs. Thus, in psychology, we are developing research projects in, for example, protocols for increasing verbal communication in children with autism; and in identifying the learning potential of highly gifted children that come from a low socio-economic background, as well as third generation therapies, (particularly the acceptance and commitment therapy) to treat emotional disorders. Research is carried out by doctors focused on these specific areas. In mathematics, we are working on a highly promising project involving the modeling and simulation of porous materials for industrial and biomedical sectors.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>our flagship programs each have a research unit. For example, in Economics, we have a research unit for Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Regional Economics, Health Economics and Applied Economics. In Management, we have research units specializing in business, such as the Organizational Management unit, the GIFI unit dealing with Finance, a Human Resources unit, and another promising unit in the field of Marketing. In the area of Accounting, we address several thematic areas in the GICCO group, a research unit for Accounting Studies. Each area has its own consolidated research units, which are also ranked. One of the strengths of the faculty is its rich history of research. In fact, economic research in Colombia saw early development at our university in the 1960's, and was instrumental in the planning of public policies in Colombia in the 1970s and 1980s. We also have an important presence at the regional level. For example, in Antioquia we are heading up key projects with the local government on projects of strategic importance for the Department. We are involved in a project for education indicators, one on regional GDP metrics, and another on the economic impact of prosperity.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our university provides seed capital to some of the best business projects that our students develop. For example, we now provide financial and technical support to 60 student entrepreneurs. We tend to prioritize social sustainability projects in terms of fund allocation. In fact, socioeconomic and environmental sustainability is another of our values at EAN. We also promote innovation and intend for projects to be of maximum social application. In doing so, we leverage our links to national agencies that promote entrepreneurship nationwide; for example, we belong to the National Industrial Association and participate in all round tables and meetings in order to better capture the needs and trends of the sector and translate them into the classroom. We also have close ties with the public sector and other institutions and social agents in the country, as well as organizations that boost innovation nationwide. I could cite the Food and Agriculture Organization, for example, although we have signed partnerships with all of them at one time or another.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We continue to work for energy and oil entities, as well as consumer goods companies. In addition, our clients include advertising agencies and marketing services agencies, as well as pharmaceuticals companies. This diversity of clients represents a major transition from the past, and over the past year we have undertaken three large projects for state entities. As you may know, our government has been ready to channel more tax revenues—themselves on the rise in a more vibrant economy—to state investment. Most of our work remains in Bogota, catering to foreign investors requiring office space upon entry to the country. Meanwhile, local companies are expanding because business is brisk. These companies need either more space, or else to optimize existing space.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In Colombia, companies located within free zones take out insurance with European or American companies, which demand strict precautions against the risk of fire. Fire safety regulations did not always exist, and the requirements initially came from insurance companies, rather than through regulations. Then in 2010, with the NSR-10, the government required all installations and buildings in Colombia to have fire protection. Hydrocarbon services are our second biggest market. We have worked with main players in the Oil &amp; Gas industry installing fire protection systems for crude oil storage facilities. We are now trying to expand our business in the free zones where we have a pronounced advantage as industrial users of such zones. This allows us to favorably import most of our items (fire pumps, accessories, pipes, and other items) from the US, Spain, or China.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The free trade zones have had an impact on the real estate market, especially with regard to warehouses. Flex warehouses, which can be used as an office and a warehouse have become popular. In 2013, three or four office buildings became LEED-certified. Now we have many buildings that hold this certification. This makes Colombia more competitive within the wider Latin American region. The resources being used in those buildings make them more efficient. They do not use that much energy, and we obviously do not use heating, just air conditioning. Now we have less space so rents are rising again. We have so many offices that I thought rents would be stabilizing, but this is not the case. We are looking at office spaces that are $32 to $48/sqm a month. In terms of retail properties, we have numerous shopping malls where rents can be around $100 to $300/sqm each month.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The world and the global economy have changed significantly, and you have to swiftly adapt to things. Our success is going to lie in adapting to changes in the global economy, adapting to the world buyer, and staying ahead of the curve. The most obvious investors would be from the US and Spain, solely due to their knowledge of the Colombian market. Currently, we are working with American investors and for subsequent phases we will be looking towards Europe as well. Colombia is enjoying greater international prominence because of its openness to investment. Tourism is the most rapidly growing industry in Colombia, with new hotels having opened in Cartagena such as the Four Seasons or the Marriott. Investors are ever seeking fresh opportunities and markets, and especially when considering Cartagena's proximity to the US it becomes an obvious choice as an investment address.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Pension funds are a source of equity, which we use to buy long-term land, which we develop for them. I believe we are the only fund in Colombia buying land with pension fund capital, and we have done well thus far. Other funds in Colombia mostly operate with foreign or private equity. This has been a complicated process, but we are happy with the outcome, and are launching another fund this year. We have already invested the $25 million generated from the first fund, and want to increase the volume of the new one. In Barranquilla and Cartagena, we are currently in the planning stages for four projects. We anticipate these areas accounting for a significant proportion of our business within five years. New land will be bought with the fund, which allows us to co-invest. Our company equity goes into funding the land, and we leverage the fund for the actual purchase.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Aslew of large infrastructure projects in the region are attracting foreign investors to Colombia. Five years ago, 80% of the attendees at local construction and infrastructure conventions were from Colombia. In stark contrast, these days, around 60% are from abroad. This reflects a surge in interest from foreign investors, be they contractors or builders, seeking opportunities in Colombia. The Caribbean region in general is growing. For example, net sales of new properties last year in Barranquilla grew by about 25% over the previous year. The influx of internal investment started with infrastructure, but lately investors have been moving into real estate as well. There has been a change in their risk perception. Initially, they had been looking for constructed buildings already generating rental income. But now, we have seen that these investors are approaching companies such as ours looking for off-plan projects, where the selling process has not even begun. They are beginning to see the risk as worthwhile, which is logical because with higher risk comes higher return.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have properties in Bogotá, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Cali, and Medelln, those are the main cities in Colombia. And as you would expect, the challenges are different for each city and for each segment. Office space in Bogotá is set to see a large supply come through. Part of that supply has been created by the changes of the zoning code, which prompted landowners to license and build in order to secure their existing building rights. In the hotel space, we had an income tax exemption for projects that would be up and running by 2017, so everyone is trying to get into that window. It is set to create additional supply ahead of demand, but I foresee that being a temporary scenario. It will take two or three years to readjust, but once that exemption expires in 2017, I forecast a long period of silence and very few developments being realized. In that respect, yes, we are going to experience somewhat of a crunch over the next two or three years, but conditions will ultimately improve and become notably more robust than what we are seeing today.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Most investors are still national; there isn't significant foreign investment, although it has slightly increased. We are seeing around 10-15% of foreign investment. We have fiduciary rights in smaller projects, around 30-40 thousand billion pesos each. So these investments are more appealing to individuals than big funds. In the future, we will be looking to creating cities within a city, meaning that housing projects will have integral utilities provision. To elaborate, these are projects of a certain magnitude, that would include housing, but also commercial establishments, supermarkets, schools, transportation, and so on. In summary, they would be a kind of city where people enjoy a full spectrum of services. This is what we are planning for the future. In fact we are starting a sizeable micro-city project in Cajica, which will include a mall and over 1,000 housing properties in one project, which allows this micro-city model. This is the largest project OIKOS is set to develop in its history on an investment of over 1.4 billion pesos.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Local companies are capable up to a certain point, but the real question is whether Colombia is ready to leap forward in terms of infrastructure development. At present, there is not really the capacity in terms of scale, since this is a highly ambitous program. The adequacy of the scale and the scope of the contracts will be the final test in upcoming financial closings. The government has to make a choice on whether to introduce 4G over longer periods, or whether it intends to concentrate its investment efforts on individual areas. It is clear that there is insufficient local capacity, and the idea of foreign companies is not to cannibalize local markets, but to develop them. The government wants foreign banks to invest $400 million here, and they will demand a premium price. Traditionally the success of alliances between local and foreign companies has been much higher in Colombian sectors such as energy and O&amp;G, rather than in the transport sector.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our main investments are in the plant itself. However, we consider all projects and try to sell a diverse range. We could undertake this across Colombia, although all facilities are established here. We have been trying to bring our production systems in line with other developed countries. Free zones such as Zonas Francas can be regarded as either a threat or an opportunity. From one perspective they can threaten as companies from other countries are able to compete through satellite bases. Sometimes the conditions are even better for them than for us. It also means that there is a lot of construction required and this it is an opportunity. In our case we have the capacity and are closer to customers and sites. So while free zones can be seen in both ways, we see it as an opportunity. Beyond that, we know from past experiences that we will be competitive in these cases. We have already completed a number of projects in these areas. And while we do not have permanent strategies to do business in other countries, we have ventured abroad.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Many Western companies, from US or Europe, have not seen Latin America as a real opportunity in our sector. It is seen as having only tier 2 or tier 3 markets. Yet it is surprising how Mexico, being the largest trading country with the US, receives relatively little attention from US firms compared to the Middle East, Asia, or Europe. We entered Latin America to try to understand what was being done and to do something different by holding the decision-making process here. Still today, our decisions are 99% focused on the region. In terms of these multi-billon dollar investments in Mexico or the US, you would be amazed by the percentage of projects that deviate over 10% to 15%. If this is multiplied by $5 billion, there is significant revenue at stake. We started working on a large infrastructure project on the west coast of Colombia, in Buenaventura. José Amarante has been present in the country ever since we started talks with the national infrastructure agency and local agencies such as the IDU for the metro rail.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Renewables will increase the country's total energy production and allow the country to sell any excess. At the local level, small energy producers that benefit from renewables can sell their excess to the national network. On a larger scale, it will increase Colombia's revenues from sales of energy to countries such as Venezuela, Peru, and even the US. In terms of installed power, Colombia has the potential to generate a surplus within the next five years, as supply is so much greater than existing demand. Recently Panama and Colombia have had problems with the agreement to the electrical interconnection between the countries, but the connection will be up and running by the close of 2018 at the latest, which will allow us to sell our energy surplus to Central America. When it comes to the stability of the system, for low and medium power connections, such as houses and small businesses, the grid is not expanding at a fast enough pace to catch up with future demand.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The Mulaló-Loboguerrero Project has a high strategic value as it places our company in the current outlook of the Colombian infrastructures. This project means becoming part of the limited group of companies that are developing designs for so-called 4G highways, the country's new central  routes, which are under PPPs. Besides, this project is a big technical challenge because of its structural difficulty since it involves building nine tunnels. Ayesa boasts the best expert collaboration in this area. All this, along with the experience and references related to similar previous work, is essential to properly carrying out such projects in Colombia. Therefore, the knowledge we have acquired in this field and our financial strength enable us to manage important projects such as this one. We are currently developing two geographic information systems; one for the National Agency for Environmental Licenses and another for the Bicentennial Pipeline. In the latter project, we also perform integrations with the SAP system.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We work with multinationals such as Citibank, which was a client back when the company started, but which unfortunately decided to withdraw its account after my father died. After 14 years it placed a call for collection agencies and we received the highest rank according to several internal indicators provided by Citibank, receiving the account. One of the factors that gave us an advantage was that the bank highly regarded robust cyber-security. As we perform a specialized service, our strategy to acquire new customers is to invest in targeted scenarios such as events by the National Collection Association. The collection sector has evolved in the past few years, and clients are now looking for agencies that have a strong client base, robust technologic support and highly qualified human labor.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We see BPO services as the main tool to building bridges with the US. For example, Everis' largest BPO center in the world is located in Colombia. We expect that the merge with NTT DATA will give us even more opportunities to build those bridges. On top of that, the human resources in this country are above average. Costs are also competitive. This means that Colombia is ready to provide services to European countries and the US, for example. Meanwhile, India is falling behind in BPO services and Colombia is taking over, benefiting, too, from the virtually non-existing time difference from the US. Additionally, the government is focused on boosting BPO services and activities.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We began providing services to the Spanish companies that moved to Colombia. These were high potential Contact Centers that believed in offshoring as a means for growth. We assisted them with technology but also with the human support they needed, high-qualified local people with local knowledge. In the second phase, the strategy was to grow with new clients from different industries like collections, finance or education. Presence has specific solutions for different industries and that helped us reach new clients. Now we are addressing corporate clients, helping them in their quality improvement strategies and making human resources profitable. We also have a social initiative for blind people in Contact Centers in which the Colombian government supports us, motivated by our social integration programs.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We had been present in Brazil for 40 years—our second largest investment on the continent was a large fiber optic in Argentina. In terms of market and size, our third most important market, in close competition with Argentina, is the Colombia. Economic growth prospects, combined with legal stability for investors were both key factors. Our timeline for investment of $5 million was 2013-2016, and our investment plan includes equipment, capital, and premises. Many multinationals spend more money on land and location, but we opted to lease the best available technology and equipment for our operations. Our next investment began in January 2015, when we developed our connectivity factory, to facilitate the connection of our cables, and is effectively a separate plant and investment.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>While Anixter's core business has always been cabling, we have evolved into data center experts. We entered the security business because it was highly complimentary to our core activity, in that installing cameras requires cabling. Moreover, today security is gaining significance in light of new products such as Smart CDs or Safe CDs, and we are playing a central role in the segment. Security in broad terms is seeing notable annual growth of around 20-25%, which is in turn driving growth. Cabling solutions are also growing, albeit modestly in recent years, as today communication is driving growth. In Colombia, at 50 million, we have more mobile phones than people. The government's aggressive approach to providing internet combined with the arrival of global companies is obliging local companies to compete with inferior technology. If we compare the volume of local companies' investment in ICT today to 10, or even a few years ago, the difference is vast.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Initially, the banks and financial systems were the more demanding industries requiring data centers, and traditionally had their own IT department and data centers. Then the authorities noted that it was not secure to have computers and storage systems in one location, and the telecom industry saw the opportunity to offer an alternative. This expanded beyond the banks to all types of business. Today each ministry has its own data center and there is a shift toward centralized information areas. This has created an important need for data centers, and third parties or call centers are supplying many solutions that used to be done in-house by the companies themselves 10 to 15 years ago. Now they have greater opportunities to provide better services to customers if they work with a PPO (preferred provider organization) that can provide an online website for their customers, although again, this needs infrastructure to ensure it remains online.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Traditionally, our activity has been in the residential and commercial construction segment. However, through a series of products, such as power transformers and MV switchboards, we are making an incursion into new sectors. In recent years we have been the first to introduce a new concept in the residential segment of the Colombian market, which has already been present in other countries with more mature economies, like the US and Europe. We can say that the automation sector is well developed in the residential sector of Colombia. In many of the new sectors we are covering, screenings of the specific necessities of the sector are not our only objective, but rather, proposing innovative solutions to the market. This is the kind of process we are investing in, whether at a local or wider level.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We stage Expoartesaní­as, which is the largest fair in Latin America lasting two weeks and attended by more than 1,000 artisans. We attract international buyers and the international press, and it is also an attractive fair for the tourism sector which is why we work with travel agencies. Over 20 countries participate in the fair, and we see over 100,000 visitors annually. In terms of intellectual property, we first ensure that the communities or the techniques being considered for this status comply with traditional methods of production. We are determined to protect our handicrafts, as in recent times we have experienced certain problems with European designers working with Colombian handicrafts but not crediting the producers or the country. Colombia is a major textiles producer, and we are expanding, and not in terms of technology alone, but with added value products, which is what attracts our buyers. We try to maintain this handmade quality, while increasing manufacturing efficiency. Around one million people work in Colombia's handicraft sector, and many have  products that could be commercialized at various retail outlets, which we are keen to facilitate.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have become the most important shoe company in the country in the medium-high and high segments. Today, with 140 stores, we reach the adult market with the BOSI brand, the youth segment with ADDICT by BOSI, and the Bambino brand, which is geared toward juniors. Our entire product range is made of leather. We are anticipating challenges in 2015 because of the increased price of raw materials and imported leather. However, over the next two years I anticipate growth of between 15% and 20%, as we will have a larger store network. Here inventory turnover is excellent, and few products become obsolete. We are highly skilled in terms of inventory management, which renders the whole commercial dimension of business more efficient. We run a traditional promotional campaign to tie in with our anniversary, between March and April, and also have minor promotions in late December. That being said, motivating our customers is the priority rather than exhausting the inventory. Last year we also launched a range of accessories, which has received a spectacular reaction.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The company was created in 1993, and at that time was completely different to the company in 2015. When we began, the market was highly competitive in terms of labor costs and the exchange rate. There was not the same level of innovation, flexibility, and sustainability. Once we moved to Medellí­n, we changed the way we thought and the way we produced. We used to make only basic products, what we call commodities in this industry, but we then expanded our portfolio. We were originally a three-product company, but made the decision to start producing up to 12 different products, and began to utilize innovation as part of this expansionary process. Our main business is the export business. We export 92% of our output, and of that, 90% is exported to the US. Our main customers in that market are Levis, Polo, Ralph Lauren, and we are working with Michael Kors and Adam Levine for Kmart, and during the past 25 years we have produced for a number of name customers including GAP and Tommy Hilfiger.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We won a number of public contracts, which often had non-conventional architecture, and required a wider range of machinery and equipment. This included high-rise buildings, where our original equipment was no longer useful, and we had to expand our portfolio and capital according to the growth and demands of the construction sector in Barranquilla. We have completed a considerable body of work in Barranquilla and the region in institutional construction projects, universities, and have worked comprehensively with the public health and EPS institutions. At that stage, private construction was rather inactive, and had we been entirely dependent on residential construction we would have faced bankruptcy. Today our ratio is divided approximately 50-50% between public and private contracts.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our headquarters is in Barranquilla, and handles all imports, external commerce, and relations with our providers. About 95% of our products are imported, and 90% of that comes through Barranquilla, and 10% through Cartagena. When we began to grow we expanded into Bogotá, Medellí­n, Calí­, Bucaramanga, Periera, Manizales, Santa Marta, and most recently Barrancabermeja, the epicentre of the petroleum industry in Colombia. Today petrol, gas, and mining represent the bulk of our trade. The other industries we cover include paper, alimentation, and sugar cane. For the petrol industry, we have specialised parts, tubes and valves for replacement when industries require them, which can be at very short notice. We are all also in the business of maintaining products for these industries in compliance with all international norms. And with regards to the construction industry, clients request that all buildings and structures have fireproof tubes and valve networks, which today is obligatory.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have undertaken the wiring and electrical engineering for several huge projects including the Unidad de Planeación Minero Energética (UPME). There, we undertook power system studies for the interconnection between mining and energy projects in Central and South American Countries. We also undertook an analysis of the FACTS implementation to link Central and South American countries via a DC link between Panama and Colombia. We have also done jobs as far away as Iraq, at the Doura Thermal Plant, where we installed a start-up electrical protection system. We also undertook a project at the Minera Escondida in Chile were we were engaged in the testing of equipment, associated protection and control devices.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our main expectations in the region are the oil pipeline to the Pacific, which is under study. This pipeline will transport oil from Llanos Orientales to the Pacific shore and a gas pipeline will transport from Camisea to the South in Peru, which is probably the most important project to be built in the near future in South America. It is a gas pipeline of more than 1,000km in length, together with a shorter condensate line. That is worth around $4 billion. The Bicentenario Oil Pipeline is still the largest project that has been carried out by SICIM. In Mexico, our first project was the Manzanillo-Guadalajara gas pipeline, and followed by: the Chihuahua Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline; the TAMAZUNCHALE Gas Pipeline phase 2; the Sonora Pipeline Corridor; and the Los Ramones Phase II South - Sections I and II. We are also promoting business in Bolivia and Chile.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>After developing a portfolio with a wide range of solutions, including mobile devices, wireless broadband, connected-home solutions, and mobile solutions for government and enterprise customers, Motorola Solutions separated from Motorola Mobility in 2011 and underwent a transformation process and is now totally focused on mission-critical solutions for governments and commercial markets. Our focus has been the public safety market, because of the unique situation that exists in Colombia. The police, the army, and the navy required specialized telecommunications solutions and they informed us of their requirements. All our efforts have gone into this. However, we have also had some resources allocated to oil and gas and utilities companies. Due to the fact that the situation is changing and that we are close to signing a peace deal, we have been creating market solutions based on demand. We now have people focused on public safety, oil and gas, carriers, and utilities. We have been trying to allocate people to the various vertical markets present in the country. We continue to provide tailor-made solutions for the educational sector, with a strong emphasis on addressing underlying security needs.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The main challenge in our market is the major players, but the good thing is that there are numerous operators. There are at least six to seven operators taking into account Virgin and other companies. Having numerous options is conducive to innovation, but with the major operator, it is a challenge for the regulator to ensure market fairness. Right now we have a less dominated field, and our interest lies in data services concentration because it is to close to voice concentration. If there is only one device for voice and data, it is likely that customers will have the same operator for both. The concentration in voice is evolving quickly towards data, which is a major concern for the  market, and the regulators. Perhaps three years ago, we started to invest in security on all levels, from connectivity to hacking. In any telecommunications company, you have the traditional services, which are 60-70% of the current revenue. But for us, around 30% of revenues are coming from the digital services like security, health and insurance, and other such areas.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>B<strong></strong>uilding the right cultural approach is a key consideration for us, because UNE is a state entity, and Tigo, on the other hand, is a rapidly moving, multinational telecommunications company. We have been supplying the government successfully, especially in the spheres of education and health. A key responsibility of ours is bringing services to people who cannot otherwise access them, which amounts to the democratization of telecommunications. I think that in terms of apps, and of entire digital world, once you understand what people want it becomes easier to deliver it to them. When you look at the company profile, especially Tigo, 65% of our customers are less than 30 years old. The data business is growing by 30% in the post pay segment here in Colombia on the mobile side. The prepaid data business mobile segment is growing by 40%. People may state that in Colombia mobile penetration is at 100%, but in fact what happens is that people have two handsets. Hence, there is an excellent opportunity to keep selling phones and connecting people.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>From the start of our operations here we found interesting opportunities; there are many Colombians living abroad and communication between those people and their relatives back home was not fully exploited on the mobile network. Calls in this segment were being made through the fixed mobile network. We brought the best rates for international calls in mobile telephony and saw rapid growth in this segment. This led to new opportunities, too, as foreigners coming to Colombia also saw us as the network to reach. All in all, we are a Colombian company and want to contribute to national development. We have been growing swiftly in Colombia as an MVNO company and this has represented continuity to the global company's development; we have been the fastest growing MVNO since 1999. Moreover, we continually explore fresh possibilities for business activity. Some two years ago, we looked into developing closer relations with a strong partner and approach Bancolombia, the largest player in the local banking sector, and an institution keen to engage with people-friendly systems and technology.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>This is a crucial period for ETB, a year after formation, a year when we celebrate 130 years of operations, and a year in which we launched a fiber optic service into homes, our own IPTV service, and our own mobile service, ETB Mobile. We started deploying fiber less than a year ago, and at this point we have more than 600,000 home passes and about 10,000 connections. We expected to close 2014 with about 800,000 home passes and about 20 to 25,000 home connections, which is a successful deployment for the first year of fiber. If you compare us to Telefónica in Brazil and Spain and several parts of Europe, and Verizon in the US, none of these companies reached 10,000 connections in their first year, and we will probably have doubled that number by the end of 2014. The idea is to end next year with about 80% of homes in Bogotá passed with fiber optics and to create our rate of connections significantly in 2015, and we hope to reach 130,000-140,000 connections, which is a major jump from the 20,000 we expected to close 2014 with.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We do not expect a full recovery, but ultimately the mineral business is cyclical. Experts agree that recovery in prices will begin after 2017, but not before. On the other side, global coal demand is expected to grow by an average of 2.1% from the actual figures until 2019, from 5,690 Mtpa to 6,462 Mtpa. In such a situation, you can try to take advantage of the lull, as a new entrant to the business, to make your name known and provide alternative services to customers, as well as develop capabilities and infrastructure in readiness for a busier future. Meanwhile, we have acquired an important network of coal laboratories in South Africa and Western Europe in anticipation of future improvement. It is difficult to define a timeframe.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Sustainability is indeed a key issue for CHT in Germany, and thus, for all CHT companies and branches worldwide, with Colombia no exception to the rule. We have to meet various targets in terms of sustainability and environmental issues. For our local production and the goods we import from Germany, we exclusively utilize water-based, rather than solvent-based products. We also place emphasis on creating new employment, and using domestic products whenever possible. Ultimately, by making more efficient our use of water and energy, we will increase our domestic revenues and capabilities. CHT Colombiana has incorporated certain special new products and ideas in the construction sector, while in textiles having begun to implement water and energy conservation systems.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>One of our key segments is oil and gas, wherein much has occurred in the intervening period. The other sectors where we are thriving are industrial sectors for packaging, food, construction, painting, and coatings. Colombia remains an attractive market for companies keen to establish a local presence. That being said, the market is quite fragmented, which does not help. And yet the main sector to have suffered is oil and gas. We are compensating for the heat on our upstream business, given that companies are not drilling extensively this year, and are focused on chemicals for production. We plan to remain an important player in the oil and gas business.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We decided to exclusively sell products manufactured in Colombia; today these products account for 65% of our sales—a notable ratio. The rest we import from Europe, Asia, or the US. We have continuously sold only Colombian products for around 20 years. We then started working to develop more specialist products, and formed a partnership with BASF to do so. In line with the growth in agriculture and industry, we began adding related products. Today, we are involved in many industries—the chemical industry, plastics, rubber, and metals, among others. We have around 47 chemical engineers working with us. We also have a vertical integration system, and our own transportation for efficient delivery to clients. Our objective is 24 hour delivery; yet in many cases the product can be delivered to the client within 12 hours.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We still see a long way to go in the Colombian market to reach our long-term targets. Our success was mainly possible due to several factors, the first being numerous product launches. Secondly, the depreciation of the Japanese yen meant that products could be priced more competitively; and thirdly, we have maintained our dealer network, and in 2014 made the decision to expand it. Most of our dealers are owned by Motorysa; however, we also have a number of external dealers in small- to medium-sized cities, whereby we cover about 95% of the Colombian market. Motorysa concentrates on developing vehicle distributions in the automotive industry. Currently, we are focused on Mitsubishi, but we are also developing several Daimler dealerships that will start early in 2015. There are other brands we will shortly develop as distributors. The automotive market is growing by around 8% per annum, and our sales are doubling. We ended 2014 on growth of 80%, and in 2015 we expect to grow by a further 50%. Our strategy for this is well grounded; however, we will need to observe developments in the general market. We expect to achieve our target as long as the market grows by 5% in 2015, which however, is uncertain due to the direction of oil prices and depreciation of the peso.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Daimler has gained a leadership role in different sectors of the market. This includes premium vehicles, the luxury segment, and in a historic first, we became the leaders of the bus segment. We were also leaders in the larger vans segment and dramatically increased our market share in the truck business. Last year was successful in terms of market share and volume. However, our operations were impeded by a 2013 law that amended the process of licensing new trucks. As of April 2013, you could only register a new truck once you had scrapped an old one. This made it difficult to sell the volume of vehicles we had. The truck market in 2013 fell by more than 60%. Even though market shares were good, certain areas of business were difficult. We had a pipeline of orders and sales plans, but when the game changes, the factories still deliver placed orders. We ended up with an oversupply that we had not planned for. With surplus stocks, dealers must sell off vehicles at large discounts, and we assumed the costs. At the same time, in 2014, we saw a fantastic performance from passenger cars and luxury vehicles. The vehicle market in Colombia has recovered, and is growing at around 5% per annum. The premium/luxury segment, however, is growing above that rate at around 20% and we are growing by around 40%.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The more protectionism you afford to the local industry, the more you are telling member companies that they are uncompetitive. In the future, Colombia could become highly competitive. We have two options: if we build an assembly plant in the Pacific or Caribbean it could provide an export solution, although it requires deep-rooted government understanding. The industry estimates that by 2020 the automotive sector will be less than 10% local assembly based. Moreover, with the free trade agreements (FTAs) that we signed with the US and Europe have been gradually reducing import tax such that by 2020 all cars arriving from Europe will have zero import tax. In order to draw wider attention to the importance of the sector for the government, the first automotive sector study to be conducted in Colombia was undertaken. The findings are set for imminent public release, and tell quite an interesting story about how much the automotive market contributes to GDP. Over 76,000 people work in the sector, and we argue that it is time the government propelled it to international standards. Taxes in Colombia are ridiculous. Here, for example, a Q7, the Audi SUV, costs around $100,000; you can almost buy an R8 in US for $110,000. Even the low-entry models are expensive. The cheapest assembly car here in Colombia costs around $12,000. Colombia has expensive cars, low fuel quality, and traffic jams because of the quality of the road network. This is the result of the government not taking our importance into account.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We develop the business by listening so that we can fully meet client needs, at which point the product essentially sells itself. Despite the usual YoY shift between brokers common among clients, those who work with us tend to stay for the long-term. Our efficient service ensures a minimal rate of rotation, enabling us to maintain a close relationship. Our client base expands through word of mouth. Today, boat insurance services have a very low market presence in Cartagena. We are one of the leaders in nautical insurance, but the cost is high as few people are currently insured. On the other hand, the cost of the insurance is low in comparison to the value of the property. The Ministry of the Environment has declared that all boat owners require insurance of COP2 million against damage or contamination. No one has liability insurance for their boats because people consider it prohibitively expensive. We have targeted our marketing operations at yacht clubs to get members to insure their vessels, but with limited success thus far. It would be logical for everyone in the club to be insured against an accident, such as a fire that could spread. We have many expensive boats here in Cartagena, but people remain reluctant to insure them. Overall, however, the country is doing well from my perspective. Other areas of the economy may be fluctuating, but the insurance sector is actually experiencing growth.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The restructuring resulted from an alignment with QBE's worldwide risk appetite. We had a Group CEO that was in office until mid-2012, and he opted for inorganic growth by acquisition. That led to over 130 acquisitions in a 30-year period, which is why we have the global footprint that we do. Given our change of strategy and the need to integrate the acquisitions that were made over the past 30 years, some were not compatible with our current risk appetite or the classes of business that we were working on. From an IT and even a cultural standpoint, some of them were so different that they simply clashed with our structure. Since 2012 we have sought a new integration that aligns our strategy implementation. We are moving away from our concentration in mandatory third party liability vehicle insurance (SOAT), which has been our flagship line of business for the past few years, and is responsible for at least 60% of our business. In a ten-year period, we went from newcomers to the driving force and the number one company in SOAT in 2010, with a 35% market share at the time.</p>]]></sections11>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The company had two lines of business, the first of which was the construction of gas plants and the second the operation of oil facilities and well testing. The business of the construction of gas plants was what triggered crisis at the company, whereby it discontinued that line of business and is dedicated exclusively to oil facility operations and well testing. Unless we make a strategic alliance with a major company, we are not interested in resuming that activity. We have clients like GeoPark, Pacific Rubiales, Parex Resources, Perenco, and Mansarovar today. These clients are only focused on well-testing activities given the problems we faced between September and November 2012. Right now the oil sector is not growing as it should be, due to several government policies that are not being enforced properly, such as environmental licenses, which currently take too much time. If they do not have environmental licensing, then companies cannot drill.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The energy sector will be highly important for us next year with the tanks and oil fields projects we have planned. Furthermore, the sector will have some circumstances that aren't good such as the low price per barrel, the changes to the tax environment, the reduction of the investment plan of Ecopetrol, the higher cost of production and transportation, among others, but we have a strategic plan where all these situations will be overcome the best we can and also with partners and highly qualified employees. For Equipem Atlas Oil this will be a period of important growth. With automated mechanics it is about selling the whole package. At the moment, project management is our focus.  We also have a company in Venezuela called Petrosema and our aim is to continue bringing new services into the oil sector. You cannot stay still and continue to sell the same products that every other company is offering; we have to evolve.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We were focused on drilling services, including the acquisition of new technologies and tools to maximize efficiency and security. We also included high capacity lifting equipment in our inventory. Our company was successful in winning a major oil transportation contract with Ecopetrol with a bid of $40 million to transport their entire production throughout the country. We have an 85-truck fleet transporting oil throughout the country, and are entering a venture with Transporte Sánchez Polo, a major company located in Barranquilla. Ecopetrol awarded 30 contracts to 75 companies, and we will be combining our fleet with its own one to provide more than 100 trucks in total. We are also entering a venture to move coal to the ports in the north of the country from the north of Santander.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We have not been affected by the falling price of oil, as we are in an industry that is able to directly pass increased cost on to our clients, whereby they who have felt the knock-on effect. Today, due to limitation of exports for groups such as EcoPetrol, there is a great effort to assist those industries that work with hydrocarbon derivatives to ensure that their products are competitive in the international market. Paints, adhesives, household products and agrochemicals are the segments that we supply the most. They have been impacted by inflation in the price of hydrocarbon derivatives, but the industry as a whole, following the crises of 1999, and again in 2008, became structurally prepared to deal with shocks such as the fall in the price of petrol. We are used to the international market having more experience, but we have improved substantially in terms of quality, and in some products are highly competitive today.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In Colombia, oil production is mostly generated by the government, and in such a scenario it is important to have industrial agreements that reflect those industries' interests and not only those of the government. Oil is a global business, and we are oil producers, but we are not an oil country. Today, the oil countries are the US, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela and so on, we produce and export oil, which is an important commodity, basic and important to our national economy in fact, and contributing 29% of overall tax revenues. Last year, we exported more than the 50% of the nation's total.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Stratigraphic oil wells are special test wells where the ANH uncovers options in new areas, or limited areas, which are areas where the industry does not have enough information about the geology, the formations, and so when oil companies try to obtain blocks to drill, they need specific information, because without that information their risk in the investment is increased. The sooner they have more information, it is easier to make the decision to invest, and in these areas, the information available in Colombia is close to zero. The role of the ANH is to discover geological or total geological information to guide companies, to enable speculative drilling for hydrocarbons. The ANH has five projects, in Tolima, Cauca, Buenaventura, Antioquia, and Magdalena.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are in a moment of uncertainty due to certain trends in the oil industry across the globe. However, I see that the sector is set to reorganize strategies and priorities. We have left the panic behind of the early days when de oil price dropped. We are looking ahead to develop new drilling activities. Colombia has numerous social particularities as a country, including the peace process, and the oil industry overlaps many of those scenarios. Therefore, we must be careful and responsible at all time. In other words, being Colombian in this industry with the nation's current level of openness and the number of foreign companies is a major plus as we are deeply familiar our country. Also, we have proved that we are here to serve the country for mutual development.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We have reduced our drilling activity over the last few months, as we believe we need to be more conservative regarding investments, especially in a context in which sales volumes have dropped from year to year. We wait for service companies to adapt their needs and strategy to the current situation, and I have to say that we have already seen a change in this area—we have better offers than those we had by the end of 2014. This encourages us to already rethink certain drilling projects we had postponed (CPO-4, Llanos 32, Llanos 34, etc.). We anticipate ending 2015 with 10 million barrels, and so far are fully on track to achieve this.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have become the advisor for the government on numerous infrastructure projects, having decided to play this role in every PPP program undertaken. We have undertaken particularly interesting projects such as the only urban concession project in Colombia for entry to the port in Barranquilla. It featured a toll road, the only one built within a city leading to the port. Bonus took on all the projects of Autopistas para la prosperidad. These projects ended up being so extensive that we had to split them into nine separate tranches. We took on Conexion Norte, Conexion al Rio Magdalena2, Pacifico 1, Pacifico 2, and Pacifico 3—these are the concessions that were awarded last year, constituting the first wave. We are currently in a bidding process for these last two projects valued at $7.5 billion. This is the largest 4G program to date. 4G is worth $21 billion in total, and these schemes alone are valued at $7 billion.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Ocensa is Colombia's most important oil pipeline, and the backbone for oil exports. The pipeline transports 65% of oil produced in the country from the Los Llanos Basin to the port of Coveñas in the Caribbean. Ocensa is over-demanded, being the most convenient and cost-effective means of export oil. In mid-2013, 27% of the company was for sale, owned by a number of E&amp;P players, including Pacific Rubiales. Our value proposition to Pacific Rubiales was acquiring both the 5% equity and 5% of the transportation rights in the pipeline for a combined $385 million. To finance the acquisition we raised acquisition finance from local and international banks. From equity co-investors we raised more than twice our fund's ticket size.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The European market was not growing, and the fact that companies that had weathered the crisis, but faced slim growth prospects, has rendered Latin America an interesting investment proposition for a number of reasons. The country boasts legal stability, market scale, and corporate formality. We now also have security and the long-awaited peace process in place. Colombia's economy has been well managed. And even this year, while the country will not grow by the targeted 4.8%, due to oil depreciation, the forecast 3.5% growth rate is in itself respectable. Growth will be largely determined by Colombia's much-needed investment in 4G and infrastructure, without which it will be hard pressed to be competitive.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The most important consideration is the match between assets and liabilities. The long-term income from PPP projects will allow organizations to make payments. We expect to see the structuring of financing over the shorter term coming from banks, and long term from pension funds. With the new Basel III regulations adopted by the banking sector, banks will find it expensive, in terms of cost of capital, to extend long-term loans. Thus, over the coming years we will see banks trying to work on shorter term loans, and we expect pension funds and insurance companies to be on the longer side of the debt curve. If we fail to involve the pension funds, such long-term loans would not be available. When long-term credit is unavailable, two possibilities arise. Either you increase equity and become a lower risk, lower return entity, which is not the norm, or else the developers assume the risk, which is clearly a less secure prospect.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The Colombian market has brought positive surprises, and despite our focus on multinationals, local companies have also turned to our services and products. For example, we now work with Terpeland Banco Agrario. In the finance sector we have offered high levels of security, excellent products and services, and also our vast expertise at the international level. We have many references from our international customers. Our international expertise,  puts us one step ahead of our competitors. At the same time, we have international partnerships that make our portfolio of services unique. For example, we have partnerships with Cisco, HP, IBM, and Microsoft. We have been aided by the openness of the Colombian economy that has led to the arrival of many multinationals and investors. Our portfolio of products has also evolved thanks to these circumstances. Colombia is a leading market in the region when it comes to attracting investors. Our vision is to grow alongside our customers.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Colombia is a land of opportunities, and we intend to participate in its success. There is a considerable dynamism in the sectors in which we work and DuPont day to day puts science to work creating sustainable solutions essential to a better, safer and healthier life for people everywhere. Our real challenge is bringing this innovation to Colombian locals, specifically to the Andean region. Ultimately, innovation is only as good as our capacity for it to serve local needs. One successful example of this is in our work with small farmers and milk producers in Colombia. Through the latest technology we have introduced, in addition to knowledge and support, we have helped small artisan producers increase the yield of their cheese production and be more competitive in the market.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The pipeline that we are building will make Colombia more competitive and allow the country to directly export crude to Asia. This particular pipeline is designed to transport heavy oil that has been transported in Colombia. Colombia imports probably 80,000 bpd of naphtha and diluents to mix with the heavy oil so that it is transportable, which is an additional cost. Our pipeline design will minimize the need for diluent, making the transport costs competitive. In addition, having a terminal on the Pacific coast will provide direct access to Asia. The actual markets and the contracts will depend on the exporters and the traders and whoever buys and sells that oil. Enbridge is exclusively a transporter. We do not own the oil and nor do we pump it. Our role has been to provide a market advantage, whereupon then it is up to other firms to sell the oil, be it China, India, or even the US Gulf Coast.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In every municipality in the country we have a police station, a justice office, and hospitals, even in urban areas of less than 20,000 people. In the past, all purchases had to be coordinated centrally, and they would often sell large products to smaller cities, whereby the cost of printing became prohibitively high for municipalities of more limited resources. We have closed two deals: one with the National Police Force, for hospitals, and another with the Notary Association. For the former, laser printers are now forbidden because the toner produces dust which can be dispersed in hospitals and create health issues; ink is more environmentally friendly. In 2013 we won the largest bid in Colombia for document scanners, which was worth $2 million, for the Colombian judiciary, which purchased 1,200 scanners. Our manufacturing plant produces 150 units per month for worldwide consumption.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The IT market is growing, and our demand for professionals is growing, too. Demand exceeds supply, and we are working with universities and schools to capture new talent that will become the industry's next generation. We work with universities, and the government, among other agencies, to find the best way to enhance our position as a country. Bogotá is important for our numbers; however, we have other cities around the country that are also economically significant, and therefore, also in terms of our presence and clients. Medellí­n, Cali, Barranquilla, and Santander are among those areas. We have teams dedicated to comprehending the different customers and required solutions, which is tied to our channel program. We approach our customers with solutions and our partners have the capability to cover products that we do not carry in our portfolio, for example, specific application for mining or designing applications.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>For each peso that the government gives the free zones, it receives COP18 or COP20 in taxes. The scheme of lowering taxes is interesting, because the country still ends up generating more tax returns. People think that these are fiscal holes, but in reality they pay the percentages over a far greater quantity. In the end, the companies pay less tax, yet the state receives more. The companies end up having more business, taxed at a lower amount. The idea is to present companies that are not in the free zones with what is happening, including the advantages not just for Colombian but foreign companies as well, as it is an opportunity to gain backing from the government on the legislative side.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We would like to see more investment from Europe because they can bring us more advanced technology. They have a similar culture, particularly investors from Spain, and the crisis blighting Europe at the moment is a good incentive for them to explore our markets. If you are South American then you already know the market, and if you are active in one country it is relatively easy to understand how others in the region work. If you have a typical machine that produces a range of products, you can sell it faster. This is the reason we prefer European industry, particularly as we plan to expand the free trade zone within a year. We can expand to include packaging and other type of logistics services for products if we receive interest from German and other European firms. We have expectations from the other countries in Europe, the US, the Caribbean, and South America, but the global economy is not promising at present.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our location permits us to receive raw material and finished goods that enter the country through the Buenaventura port. We can use this port to take our production toward Latin America countries and other continents. The Buenaventura port, one of the main Colombian sea ports through which is moved 41% of overall cargo in the country, is located just six hours away from Ibagué on the Pacific coast, and will be our main port for importation and exportation. In addition, we might take advantage of the navigability of the Magdalena River, one of our principal waterways, and to transport goods north to the Atlantic coast to transport merchandise to the rest of the world at a lower price. Improvement of the road infrastructure in Colombia is evolving positively, so this will undoubtedly be a process that will shorten the distance and expense of moving goods.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>One of the most important functions of a free trade zone is its catalyzing effect on national development. These zones play a role in generating employment, improving industry, and bringing investors to the country. Our advantage is the ability to produce new products that can compete on an international level, which in turn develops Colombia in broader terms. In 2011 we began operations and started to seek out clients. The FZT has invested around $11.5 million in roads, public services, and all of the amenities for clients, such as industrial and commercial services to help them settle. Ultimately, the role of these FTZs is to generate national growth and development. We are in the process of encouraging national companies based in Bogotá and central Colombia to relocate to the coast. We are noticing, with the relocation of the industries that are currently located centrally, that they are migrating here because of the climate.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Most business process outsourcing (BPO) firms and call centers cater to the domestic market. We mainly anticipate having Colombian BPO firms, although we do expect some foreign companies to show interest. The most important consideration is that we generate employment, either through existing Colombian BPO players, or because new players that enter the market are attracted by an attractive service location. The bottom line is that we want to create at least 20,000 jobs. That would be double the amount of jobs we created in Uruguay, where we have a mix of logistics and office space. About 50% of our activities there are in logistics, which does not employ as many people as the service industry, whereas here we only have service companies. Ultimately our aim is to move Colombia to the top of the pyramid in terms of the value of services. Right now we see that there's a lot of call center work being done from here, but we would like to move more into BPO services.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>I would say that in the UAE there is a much larger expatriate population, and this can sometimes drive different expectations. We do see some differences within the region. Generally in the UAE, the customer base is willing to be more experimental with different colors and different Q designs, which means it is bespoke for the customer. They want the car to be one of a kind, with their signature on it. No other car is produced like this in terms of the selection of colors, and the accessories within the car, such as a gold or platinum finishing. They all want something special and they are prepared to take the time to get the product that they really want. They may come to us with a color for example, from a material or any type of object, and ask for that to be used for their car, and we can deliver this. We are expanding in the region. In 2015, we are looking to open four new showrooms regionally, as well as three new service centers. Planned investment across the region in terms of infrastructure is about $11 million.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Customer service is crucial. A great number of our clients are repeat customers, and it is usually at least the second Porsche that they are buying. I guess a large part of this is customer satisfaction. We are the largest Porsche dealership in the world because Dubai has an abundance of millionaires. All of that is a consequence of our increase in sales for Porsche, because Porsche is a dream car to many people. Growth simply comes from customer satisfaction. The market is saturated; everybody is here so you have to distinguish yourself and the only way this can be done is through customer satisfaction. Most products are virtually identical, with excellent cars and no difference in quality. We have worked hard to build an extraordinary buying experience for our customers, and we are trying to replicate this across all of our brands to give customers a standard service during their purchase and after sales experience that they cannot find anywhere else.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>This market is very much driven by SUVs, primarily because of the landscape in addition to the average family size being a bit larger than what you see for example in Europe. With our SUV range that spans the QX50, QX60, QX70, and QX80 we have something on offer from mid-size to full-size SUVs. This is a good contributor here for the region. Simultaneously, we must not forget that the market is starting to evolve and develop segments that have not been as popular before—Sedans being a good example. This is because the region is also changing and we are seeing more expatriates move into the region, especially in the UAE, causing the trend in automotive purchasing behavior to adapt accordingly. The UAE has the highest premium market percentage in the region, so by default, this must be the most important market for all the major brands. I believe that for any automotive brand to be successful, having the right products is a necessity.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our client base is constantly evolving, which is what makes the UAE market unique. The UAE is comprised of 90% expatriates, with the other 10% of the population being Emirati. This creates some interesting challenges in an ever-changing market; people stay here on average from three to six years. New people are always bringing with them a vision of products they see in their own countries. In terms of conducting retail sales, we use a network of showrooms for our cars within the UAE. Basically, we are a service industry and no matter which company you look at, we are providing a continuously increasing range of trucks, cars, car-based services, testing services, and so on. We do not attempt what we do not know or understand, and as a result the organizational model we have means that we can “bolt on“ new countries and franchises quickly onto a central operating core of finance, HR, and planning. With little manufacturing taking place here in the UAE, all products are imported, so we purchase vehicles directly from manufacturer. Locally, we differentiate ourselves with our services: how our trucks are maintained, the services we provide, and our transparency.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Typically, hotels always treat food and beverage as a minority, but in our establishment it's 50-50. In the past, hotels would treat their restaurants as hotel restaurants. They would assume that people staying at their hotels have no other option than to eat at the hotel; therefore, they would kind of take the restaurants for granted. We approach all this from a totally different angle. Food and service are important, but experience is the most important factor, in the sense that people want to go out and have an experience. People want to have a good time and be in a place that is happening. We are constantly looking for new ideas and continually trying to create new concepts to keep the food and beverage business thriving. In this market, there's enough for everyone. Increasing the number of three- and four-star hotels will be healthy for Dubai's tourism sector overall. Dubai has recently become an expensive destination. Flights are expensive, hotels are expensive, and dining out is expensive. What the Dubai government is doing now is escalating the number of medium-range hotel options to attract different kinds of clients from different parts of the world. It will bring new tourists and visitors to Dubai.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The impact of the exchange between the euro and the ruble has affected the amount of customers we have coming in from the CIS. In general, we have around 40-45% of customers coming in from the GCC, about 35% from the CIS, and the rest from elsewhere. Now, the euro is 20% more valuable, and we see the impact but the high-level clientele we still see coming. To replace the market coming in from the CIS is difficult because it was large. We are working hard to make the difference, and with a product like ours at the Palm that is a leisure and beach hotel, we are looking to attract new clients from African countries. There are wealthy people that are coming in and want a clean and well-organized environment. Nigerians travel a lot of with large families, and they need large units. We have a strong percentage of Nigerian businessmen. We also have a market coming in from Brazil. However, the Chinese are looking for a different product because they do not have large families. The European market still remains crucial to our business as well. A positive point is that the government is always working on events and things taking place in the city to keep people busy and draw people in, which benefits our business. It helps us to create more business opportunities and will help our yearly average.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The hotel industry in Dubai is greatly expanding, there is a larger inventory on hand, meaning there is more competition. On this stretch alone, there are 12 properties and over 5,000 rooms. Competition is tough because everybody fights for the same piece of the pie, and the slices become smaller and smaller. People would say cutting the price is the best way to do it, but I beg to differ. The most important thing is to offer and ensure your customers that they receive great value for money on their stay. If you can convince your customers that what they are spending their money on is worth it, then you have done your job. For us, we have large rooms on this stretch, with our smallest rooms being about 40 sqm and our largest being up to 101 sqm. Our products are comparable and provide great service. That is how we create great value for money. The lead up to World Expo 2020 looks promising. I believe there will be a drop in occupancies compared to 2013-14, because of the number of hotels opening, and everybody's competing for the same business. The new mid-market hotel establishments such as the three- and four-star boutique hotels open up a larger spectrum of tourists from various locations across the globe that can come and visit Dubai on a variety of budgets.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>At the end of the day, any additional room that opens up is good, whether it is three, four, or five star. If you look at serviced apartments and hotels, there are something like 650 right now. If you look at different districts you have different products and there are a tremendous amount of serviced apartments. There is a lot planned for the future, and personally I'm waiting to see what actually happens. The growth of room inventory in the city has grown tremendously and there are many more hotel and service apartment projects on the horizon to be opened before 2020. If my information is correct, there are presently 650 hotels and service apartments in Dubai and another 100 are under planning or construction at present. This massive growth does increase competiveness and in turn challenges rates and occupancy levels of the existing hotels unless the visitor stream increases equally to fill the new properties as well. Approximately 50% of our customer base comes from GCC countries and the other markets are the UK, Australia, the US, and other European countries. There is continued growth, but region wide you also see a lot of opportunities to move to other places.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>If you had come to Dubai in the early 1990s, you would have seen a remote area. But you can see what it looks like now. When the metro was built, people questioned its use as everyone has cars; however, now you can see how successful it has been. I believe it will be the same for the tram. It will be similar for other projects that have built the future of the city. When there are so many hotels, it is easier for others to come to Dubai. I am not just thinking about my own pockets, but about what will come to everyone in Dubai. It is not just hotels, but we do need more hotels here. Dubai is competing with major cities around the world, such as Istanbul and London. It is easy to work here; we have a fantastic employee environment. Whenever there is feedback from our guests, we act immediately on it. Wherever you go in the hotel, you will see Islamic art everywhere. Everywhere else in the city, you see hotels with modern art. Our approach is to always support charity; this comes from our religion. As hotel managers, every month we have charity projects and all our employees are part of this. It shows our responsibility to the community.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The Dubai healthcare sector is maturing with regards to healthcare tourism. We are helping Dubai become an international medical tourism hub. If you think of international medical hubs all over the world, they basically compete on price, quality, and customer service. This is a real challenge, but I think Dubai is doing an excellent job in responding to it. The main reason Moorfields is here in Dubai is because of the demand for the quality of service that we are able to provide. Quality is non-negotiable and is 100% aligned with our clinical practice and standards in London. I believe this is our competitive advantage in the market and we have built a medium to long-term strategy based on it. Dubai cannot compete on pricing. We need to compete on quality. If our pricing structure is going to be controlled to help control internal costs, the quality of the healthcare services we all offer must still be competitive. People are coming from abroad to Dubai because of the brand name, because of the healthcare reputation, and because of the medical outcomes achieved.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We as well as other hospitals in the region are trying to attract top talent from all over the world to practice at our facilities. It will obviously be a challenge for us to pay these doctors a competitive wage if we are put under unrealistic pricing constraints. We actually have no problem with the regulation of price increases—we think it is a good initiative to keep inflation in check—as long as the methodology used to establish the cap is properly debated and based on real medical inflation. What we appreciate about the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) is that it has realized the decision was sudden and has now set up working groups to discuss how we are going to take this forward. The key thing is that in healthcare you cannot just look at CPI inflation. There is a shortage of doctors and nurses, and that is our biggest cost. We are building a 267,000sqft new wing of Mediclinic City Hospital, which will house a fully integrated oncology center, the first all-inclusive oncology center in the GCC. The project also includes a new day surgery, a centralized laboratory and rehabilitation unit for the group.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We definitely need to become more competitive price-wise, because patients are obviously not only looking at Dubai as a very attractive medical tourism destination. Southeast Asia has become very popular, and Eastern Europe as well. Therefore, I think it is good that we look at regulating prices, but at the same time we also need to look at what is happening in other aspects of pricing, such as increasing general costs. If you cap costs at one end, then you should cap the other end as well, otherwise healthcare facilities cannot be profitable anymore nor will there be the opportunity to invest in well-educated staff or in good equipment. In order to attract medical tourism, the quality needs to be superior, and if it is superior, then patients are willing to pay that extra money that Dubai will charge. At the same time we need to look at the expenses that clinics are facing, and I think that here we still have some potential. All of our surgeons come from Europe and of course there is a high level of trust here in the GCC countries in expertise from Europe.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The cost of a hospital bed is $500,000 upward and there will be a demand for 5,000 more hospital beds during the next five years to match the local supply demand situation alone. We are also interested in taking part in medical tourism, which is a $100 billion worldwide industry. In the region it is worth $20 billion, and Dubai is the number one preferred tourism destination due to its top of the line infrastructure and the best hotels as well as safety and security considerations. Approximately 35,000 people come every day, creating huge opportunity. Top-of-the-line healthcare and hospitality create the perfect environment for tourism. The return on investment in medical tourism is five times the return of even a five-star hotel. There are not enough people involved in the healthcare business. An investment in even one hospital bed can give you a tremendous return. The bottom line is 10-15% on the return of your investment. If you take out the emotional element of healthcare provision in order to showcase see the business opportunity you attract investors.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>With the rapid pace of Dubai's economic growth, the talent gap is inevitably a moving target and success presents its own challenges in attracting and retaining the right talent. The number and scale of initiatives that have been launched over the last few months in the UAE generally, as well as in Dubai, also affect the economy. For example, Expo 2020 demands a certain set of skills that are quite different from those related to the creation of a hub for the Islamic Economy. Dubai and the UAE have put the development of a knowledge-based economy at the top of the agenda. Based on our own experience, we believe collaborations are key and we need higher education institutes. We know what some of those gaps are and higher education providers can help meet needs, but we also need vocational training and short-term training providers to focus on the skill requirements.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Every student has to spend time in the field during their co-op program. Engineering is nine months, business is five months, and networking and computing students spend seven months.  As part of the curriculum for graduation, this requirement incorporates different companies from various industries across the globe. These companies usually prefer to build long-term relationships; however, if it is short-term, as happens with other universities, they do it solely out of courtesy. Currently, we have about 60 students working in approximately 25 companies such as Dubai Silicon Oasis, Emerson, Coca Cola, Schinder, and Dubai Aluminum (Dubal). Fractal Systems, an innovative technology providing company, is housed on RIT Dubai's campus.  Among the projects it  currently has students working on are the development of the largest drone with the longest flight time and new state-of-the-art display systems. The co-op program is very important for us, and we are fortunate to have such companies that believe in our students, our faculty, and our ideas.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>I think the establishment of the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA), and the Dubai Education Council (DEC) has had an enormous impact on education at the primary and secondary levels, which is of great importance to universities. Those are the institutions that feed students to the universities, which are at the third tier of that process. Naturally, the better the quality of students at those two first tiers, the better quality we receive at universities such as ours. There are also other initiatives regarding technology in primary and secondary schools that HH Sheikh Mohammed has personally spearheaded. These will all have far-reaching effects on future generations. Our mission focuses on students as vehicles for the advancement of society. We provide counseling, and we are training 60 members of the UAE government, which will lead to a diploma in Government Services. Rubbing shoulders and keeping contact with those various entities helps us in terms of the relevance of what we teach.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>One of the innovations at Hult is our campus rotation model.  Students start their program at one of our five campus locations and then for the last two modules have the option to rotate to one or two other campuses for their electives and action projects. Another thing that differentiates us from other business schools in the UAE is our global presence. We have a policy of bringing in professors from around the world to provide relevant subject matter. Our professors are noted for their academic credentials, talent for teaching, and practical business experience.  We also do business simulation activities, constructing scenarios in the classroom and applying them to real life business, allowing us to work with a number of corporate organizations in solving their day-to-day business challenges. Hult is about to merge with Ashridge Business School, which is the biggest business school merger to date. Our partnerships are almost exclusively from the private sector, representing around 90%. We are working on both fronts, domestically and internationally, with clients.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>There are a number of private and public sector partnerships that we are fostering in order to bridge the gap between academia and industry. As a general standard, this process starts with the University advisory boards, which include key members who are at the forefront of industry. It is their role to advise the University on economic trends, new government policies, developments in the private sector, and so on. Our students are required to spend three months on a work experience placement in a relevant industry to their studies. We have noticed that when students complete their internship, they often come back with a clearer idea of what they'd like to specialize in. Internship programs are extremely important components of our students' education as they bridge the gap between academic theory and industry practice. We will be rolling compulsory internships out to the Faculty of Business soon. We have seen a 60% rise in employment opportunities being offered to our graduates over the past year.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The outlook for Dubai is extremely positive, but the critics are never satisfied. One moment it's a property bubble, when the market is experiencing growth, and the next the market is down, when it's stable. Dubai is the best property development market in the world right now. Market values are solid and investments continue to flow. To succeed in the real estate market it is essential to have a five to 10 year vision, and to be able to look ahead with a keen eye on opportunities for growth and development. Our company is steadily growing and diversifying into boutique hotels, malls, and affordable housing. We have concrete plans for the next five years and Expo 2020 will impact our business too. My aim is to promote different areas of Dubai that link to the Metro, which will be very conveniently located near to the Expo 2020 venue and the airport. The government is currently establishing a viable, clean, and transparent environment for real estate development. Most of our current projects will conclude in 2016, so I am currently focusing on new projects and acquisitions with commencement dates of 2017 and 2018.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The demand for housing is high. Rental prices are going up, and all this helps investors decide to come here. Lower oil prices will not affect individuals, only the government and its spending, while individual's salaries stay the same. The governments might change their programs or tap into their savings, but we haven't seen any changes in terms of salaries or people being affected. Even though Europe is an attractive place for investment, the UAE, and specifically Dubai, is considered a good investment destination in terms of tourism and construction and other activities going on here. Prices have dropped down in terms of real estate, meaning that many have decided to buy, rather than rent. That helps us a lot in terms of getting investors. We do have some international investors that want to tap into real estate in Dubai, but mainly our residents either live in Dubai or the GCC. Mainly these people come here a lot to do business in Dubai, so they don't mind having a unit here as a home. The prices for hotels are high, so it's a win-win situation. Time sharing doesn't exist here yet, so that also helps a lot.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our main business is property development. We decided to develop Bay Gate because Dubai is a business and a tourism hub, so there are two directions to take. At the time of deciding what to develop, we noticed significant demand for a stand-alone, single owner, office towers. We chose the location because it is downtown, which is the heart of the Dubai business community coupled with the close proximity to the metro station. The project is expected to be completed in 2Q2015, and for us this is a grand achievement. At the moment, we are reviewing and studying other developments in Dubai, which could include the hospitality sector. The most important thing is that international partners have to be aware of the local market. The Dubai market is a tough one for those just beginning to enter. However, provided that you know your business, it can become quite comfortable. With this, it is important for international investors to have a local partner. We have all the multi-national companies from all over the world, but this is based on demand and evaluation. Whenever there is a slowdown in one area, then people will go to another, and we have seen different nationalities from all the continent.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The consumer here is looking for assurance and comfort in their securities rather than their returns. Security has topped the agenda for investments, and so our research has gotten us up to speed. We have tied up as an exclusive agent in the Middle East with a developer from one of the richest families in Frankfurt, and in London we have added additional strength with our team on the ground. We are working with a number of financial institutions to serve key investors in Europe and Spain in particular. In established markets the realtors are happy with an 18-21% profit. Here, unless they get 200% profit they wonder what is going on, but the approach has to be reasonable. The challenge ahead will be for people to be realistic in the price that they offer, and the terms of consumer expectations is going to be higher. The transaction volumes will dictate the price as well as the payment plan regardless of the project.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Over the last two years, corporate institutional and family investors from the GCC have been improving the diversity of their real estate investment holdings.  This has meant that we have seen, and in my view will continue to see, an increase in the amount of capital flowing to overseas markets, particularly the UK. This should, in due course, increase the liquidity of the Dubai market by freeing up investment opportunities held by local companies. At the moment, a key weakness in the Dubai real estate sector is the lack of availability of product, particularly income producing, to foreign investors. One of the most important differences that we see in this market from the previous cycle is the interest shown by overseas investors, particularly seeking to spend capital originating in Asia Pacific. Dubai's commercial and residential sectors are at different positions in their respective cycles and the strong rental and capital growth that the residential markets experienced in 2013 has now stopped as the market adjusts itself to unsustainable levels of growth. We expect to see a decline in rental values in the middle tier residential locations.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Property prices in Dubai have had a lot of publicity, mainly around residential prices, because we have seen a great deal of growth in the last two years. The rate of growth stabilized in mid-2014, which is a good thing. Growth rates of 30% per annum are just not sustainable. The measures taken by the government and Central Bank have had the desired effect and the danger of overheating has been taken out of the market to a large extent. We now see the market as active with a sustainable growth pattern. In terms of actual property prices, although they have risen considerably, they have only come back to where they were in 2007-08. In terms of property prices, especially in the office market, Dubai's are favorably low compared with most similar cities around the world. This is beneficial because it makes Dubai that much more attractive as a place for companies to come and for people to live.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In terms of the cost of living, one thing we are seeing this year with the supply coming into the market is stabilization, if not a decrease in pricing. If you were at Cityscape last year, most of the properties were high-end, very expensive luxury apartments and villas. This year it was all about affordability. If you look at the market as a whole, our report said there was actually a slight contraction in prices over the last quarter, but YoY there is still phenomenal growth. In terms of the rental side, with the rent caps, we may be seeing rents come down slightly. Everybody thinks this means their rent is going to be cheaper, but that is not really the case. If you have been in a property for 10 years, you are caught by the rent cap, and are probably paying 50% less than what the landlord could get if you moved out. The market rent may have come down by 1%, but the majority of tenants are still paying considerably less.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>T<strong></strong>he market is not just residential or corporate as there are schools and healthcare providers to consider. A smart city also means smart business and one of our clients' primary concerns is predictive maintenance. They ask us to predict an asset failure, rather than deal with a real one, which we are fully equipped to do. Traditionally, your service provider fixed a vroken asset. Now, Emrill can predict and address problems before anyone knows that there was one. We have brought much technology and innovation to the market including temperature, vibration, and flooding sensors. Dubai's landmark buildings are now about 15 years old and are going to suffer failures and need repair. Through cloud-based technology we can monitor the performance and efficiency of their systems and assets.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are moving forward with 4,500 employees, which is not an ideal model. I am sure we could use a lot more technology to reduce the number of staff. We are considering creating a much larger control room as well. This would mean that before we send any teams to check on a building we have all the necessary information from the remote system. This kind of technology will help the future of facilities management. The Middle East Facility Management Association (MEFMA) LEED certification program will also add value to the company and the industry. We aim to have categories for facility management that will be four or five star, which will make it easier for clients to select the right facilities management services and company. As with hotels, there should be a list of requirements to fulfill, a certain level of certification, and a minimum number of services being provided for a business to obtain a particular facilities management rating.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Dubai is far ahead of the regional market, but unless that market recognizes the need for intrinsic values—cost of resources required to provide a definitive output—they will remain under pressure to build a sustainable FM services industry. Our focus has been on creating a brand that reflects a strong value system. The core values are transparency, delivery, and sustainability. We have large, multinational clients, and within that, different industries—banking, oil and gas, integrated workplace, and so on. In addition to this diverse portfolio, I also work with large local businesses with government and non-governmental companies. We have continued to outperform the market average compound annual growth of 22% on growth of 25%. While there have been challenges in the Middle East, we have seen growth in the Indian subcontinent. We have been able to expand to Sri Lanka and have grown 50% in India over the past year.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>If we go back to the very beginning Ejadah's founders had the foresight into Dubai's real estate industry and identified a fundamental gap in the sector at the onset. This was the sustainability of buildings, infrastructure and communities. Since our establishment, we preserved this as the essence of the group and cemented our core competencies in delivering this value to industry stakeholders.  Dubai's real estate industry quickly became an international marvel as developers started breaking ground with spectacular buildings, putting the city on the world map and driving the establishment of the facilities management sector. We take the UAE's vision very seriously and embed systems and processes in our business to support this vision. Technology, marketing orientation, supply chain management and sustainability are key business focus areas. It's important to understand where our business is today. We manage more than 115 million sqft of commercial, residential, public and leisure communities. While we do this, we impact all community stakeholders whom we consider to be all our customers, including developers, government bodies, investors, landlords, individual owners, tenants, and visitors.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We initially built our facilities with no real industry in mind, but later modified them in order to offer tailored solutions to certain sectors, including automotive spare parts, petrochemicals and chemicals, lubricants, building materials, FMCG, and retail. Then, we moved into power generation and project logistics. All of our investments thereafter were catered toward a particular industry and to a particular type of customer. There is definite belief in the growth of volume that is going to come out of the region in the next few years. Dubai has won the right to host the World Expo 2020, so we aligned our goals with the Emirate's 2020 vision and set out our own targets. One of our goals is to have operations in six countries by the big year. Kenya is definitely earmarked for development, and we have already started to build facilities there, as well as in Saudi Arabia. Southeast Asia is another area with potential.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In 2015 Al Maktoum International at Dubai World Central (DWC) firmly established itself as a key regional and global cargo hub, with freight volumes surging 262% to 758,371 tons for the full year 2014, up from 209,209 tons in 2013. The relocation of all dedicated freighters, including Emirates SkyCargo to DWC from Dubai International in May last year was a major driver behind the sharp rise in cargo volumes. To meet this growth Emirates SkyCargo opened a new state of the art cargo facility capable of accommodating 700,000 tons while the existing cargo facility is being expanded to 400,000 tons. A key attraction is that the airport located less than 10km from Jebel Ali Free Zone and linked via a bonded road to the region's largest port—Jebel Ali Port. With a turnaround time of about 90 minutes between the ramp of the airport and the port, DWC offers highly convenient sea-to-air or air-to-sea service.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our customer base is quite varied, which differentiates us from other traditional storage companies. Because we offer a spectrum of storage solutions, our clients includes individuals that want to manage their own belongings as well as SMEs where the economies of scale dictate that it makes sense for them to outsource their inventory management, rather than invest themselves in leasing or building a facility and equip it with everything including covering operating costs and staffing. We already store a lot of display stands and items related to exhibitions throughout the year. On a yearly basis, we have a seasonal influx of such cargo, and with the Expo we expect it to spike. That said, a storage solution company like ours definitely has to be prepared. One has to note that the Expo is not going to affect all the sectors of the economy, but will nevertheless create a tangible demand for certain industries that will serve it. We are definitely on the right track for expansion.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The UAE has tremendous potential as an international hub for transport and logistics for three main reasons. First, if you consider the geographic positioning, we are geographically in a perfect spot between Europe, Asia, and the US. We are in the center of the GCC, and then if you look just at flight times, which is our business, in 3-4 hours you cover all of the Middle East and parts of the sub-continent and you can reach the east coast of Africa. Add another hour and you are in the CIS countries, all the way up to Moscow. The opportunity to service the Caucasus republics is often neglected so this is an important point of opportunity. Then if you add another two hours you are in Europe and halfway through Africa, and far beyond India. Thanks to its geographic location it is the perfect place for trade. The second reason Dubai is likely to continue flourishing is its development of free trade zones.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The Middle East is an extremely important economic hub, and continues to be one of the key growth markets for FedEx. Dubai is growing at a faster pace than the global average. This growth is driven by the region's accessibility and favorable geographic location. The Middle East serves as an ideal bridge between Eastern and Western economies, making it an essential multi-modal logistics hub for the world, connecting key manufacturing hubs in Asia with the demand in the Americas, Europe, and Africa. Our focus is always on ensuring that our logistics solutions match the needs of our customers and as the demand grows, so will our offerings, team, and fleet. Last year for example, we increased our FedEx flights through our Dubai hub to a total of 44 FedEx flights and 700 commercial flights a week, connecting the Middle East to global markets and providing our customers with speed-to-market. The Middle East's airlines are growing rapidly, and the development of new airports will ease the congestion and avoid delays that may have an adverse effect on the movement of freight.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Research and development is very important globally, but in this region people do not invest heavily in it. Most of the companies in the IT sector operate in a sort of trading environment. They see what is happening elsewhere in Europe, the US, or India, and then they bring it here and provide it. But from the perspective of innovation and implementation, there is a lot happening recently here and I have seen that our region is very interested in adopting these innovations. Dubai has set several world records, including the tallest tower, longest fully automated metro, among many others. We have also adopted cellular technologies that allow you to conduct financial transactions from your mobile, including paying for parking. We were one of the first countries with completely SMS-integrated parking. And now we are moving closer to creating the world's first “Smart City.“ At Finesse, we strive to bring in the innovative technologies into this region and we invest heavily in research, development, and training.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are absolutely putting major efforts into Smart Government initiatives, not just today, but more importantly for Expo 2020, which is going to be automated and have state-of-the-art, machine-to-machine communications. When we look at the Middle East, Dubai and the UAE are the crown jewels in the Middle East in terms of government stability, currency stability, and maturity of infrastructure. The UAE has made it easy over the past few years in terms of foreign company presence here. When we look at each country, we look to identify the sectors that make up this set. In places like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, or across the Middle East or Africa, we look at the government, which includes the central government and ministries, local governments that focus on citizen services, municipalities, defense, and intelligence. Also, we look at the energy sector, as it fuels a lot of the growth in the region. We are looking at healthcare and education, and the financial and telecoms sectors, which are all essential to the economic engine.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our global client base is diverse; however, we have a significant track record within the public sector that includes the government of Dubai, as well as other federal, central, and local governments around the world. Within the MENA region, we have additionally focused on the oil and gas industry, telecommunications, and education sectors. Looking to the future we would like to capitalize on our successes in the UAE, Kuwait, and Oman, to expand our portfolio of solutions primarily within the oil and gas industry. We are all aware that the oil and gas industry contributes very heavily to the GDP of this region, and this is where we genuinely feel there is the opportunity for the growth of our solutions, and also for us to deliver real tangible value to the clients that we work with. Data security is of paramount importance to this industry, Tejari has several operating models which fully cater to the needs of ensuring data security and integrity.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>There are so many areas on which Dubai and Cisco can collaborate. The most important one is data sovereignty in terms of who owns and protects it. Data, government, citizens, and business security are all important aspects of that as well. There are always the standard challenges that we are very familiar with that have to do with hardware and software integration. In addition certain practices and policies must be implemented to change the regulatory environment. The use and ability of data has to do with the governance of data, and that will become more prevalent and visible as we start hearing more of where we are in the initiative and as the government reveals new services and aspects of smart Dubai. Our overall strategy for the country is to do business, succeed, and grow, but more importantly to contribute in a longer-term fashion. We are striving to contribute to the digitization that is taking place in the country and to help the nation become more competitive.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Huawei has enjoyed a presence in the UAE for over a decade. The country remains a significant one for Huawei as both a growth driver and a region where Huawei contributes to building a better-connected world. Furthermore, the role of ICT has never been more important to the fabric of the UAE's national development vision. Huawei has established an end-to-end ICT solutions portfolio that gives customers competitive advantages in telecom and enterprise networks, devices, and cloud computing. All three of Huawei's main business groups—carrier, enterprise, and consumer—are active in the UAE and serve both local customers and those across the wider Middle East. Last year we even launched a Smart City Center of Excellence in the Middle East to assist governing bodies and telecoms operators in driving smart city initiatives from concept to reality. Today, this center acts as a knowledge hub for industry professionals to share best practices that will prove fundamental in improving the quality-of-life of citizens in the UAE.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>I would say that, in alignment with the government and the trends of the industry, the work that we have done in driving the adoption of cloud computing in the region has been phenomenal. While this trend has been growing in the Gulf at a rate of about 50%, our growth has been about 450% last year, which gives you an idea of our ability to outgrow the market and also the dominance of Microsoft's activity, which is very important. This is the value that SMEs and government entities can have from us and also we built a partner ecosystem in the Gulf over 20 years so that today there are over 1,500 companies that cooperate within this ecosystem and we are taking them with us to the cloud. The second is the work we are doing in education. I am excited about the fact that Microsoft picked Dubai to host the Global Forum in Education. Microsoft has some large and strategic projects in education such as the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Smart Learning Program.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our strategy is simple: if it computes, it computes best with Intel. We are committed to innovate and shape computing in all its forms. Our product portfolio has changed to reflect that. For 45 years Intel has been pioneering microprocessor technology for the modern world, setting the wheels in motion for technology advancements every person on earth relies on every day. Today Intel provides the essential technologies to make all things smart and connected. Over the last few years, the opportunities have been primarily driven by the consumer. There has been a lot of growth in consumers that represents more than 60% of our business in the region. We have a very young population, with 50% of the MENA region below 30 years old. If I look to 2015 and beyond, we see high performance computing growth in the region.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Imoved here from Hong Kong, which is really a world city. I see a lot of parallels with Dubai. You see many people from other places, as well as a number of corporate business heads here. The environment is very conducive, and very open. It makes investment and business operations easier than other places. I think the government of the UAE has been visionary in creating an environment that nurtures companies that come here to set up operations and we look to continue that. We expect to increase our technical capability in this area. We see Dubai as a good place for investing and building regional capabilities. I think the efforts of the local government to create for example, airports that are easy to transfer through, have helped. It may not be an immediate thing that comes to mind, but it makes business easier if you can fly in and out easily. Not all countries have that capability.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Dubai is the hub for the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan [MENAP] region. DuPont is well positioned for accelerated and sustainable growth in the UAE, which represents one of the fastest-growing markets for the company. DuPont is committed to supporting and participating in the new economic, industrial and scientific developments in the UAE. The accessibility of Dubai also makes it easy to operate from. A lot of key decisions are made in Dubai. Over the last three years, we have tripled in our employee size in the UAE. With a strong and rich diverse team in the UAE, we are continuing to strengthen our capabilities on the ground that will help us better serve the local markets—a perfect example of our ambitious plans for growth. Dubai has been a great location for us to grow and expand due to its business-friendly environment. We see strong opportunities in the UAE and indeed throughout the GCC region.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>First, the UAE for us is kind of the hub of the Middle East, for several reasons. It is our regional head office, so all corporate functions are based here. It is also a hub from a logistics point of view—out of 18 factories you mentioned, 15 are for Nestlé Waters, the bulk of which are in Saudi Arabia. However for food and beverages we have one in Iran, and one here in the Dubai Techno Park, and one that is a new project we are currently building in Dubai World Central, which is an onshore factory. The UAE means ease of communication, of shipment, of attracting talents, favorable business conditions, and support of the authorities. The Middle East means growth, future potential, talent, and innovation. It also means business unusual is business as usual, when you think about what is happening in the region in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon with war, instability, and the difficulty to predict what tomorrow is going to be.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Since January last year there has been a huge difference in the activities that are going on just here in Dubai, and I'm not even talking about the new infrastructure projects. Like the bridges, that's a lot of concrete and we love that. This is where we can fit in our products. I think we will see more and more projects finishing and happening in Dubai. There is a need for more infrastructure, more metro connections, more highways, and flyovers because the roundabouts cannot cope with the traffic. We have four focus countries. The first one is Saudi Arabia, where we are just about to establish a new legal entity with a JV with Kanoo. Saudi Arabia by far will be the biggest country in terms of sales. Then there are the UAE, Egypt, and Iran, but it's on hold now. Egypt is also a massive market with some 82 million people, many of whom are young.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our strategy revolves around facilitating the shift to innovative electronic payment solutions. Technology is at the heart of our growth strategy because the ultimate objective is to provide banks and cardholders with convenient and secure means of payment, and to do that we have evolved our technology over time. We recognize the various opportunities in the UAE, such as smart government and e-commerce. We have also been investing in financial literacy programs, targeted at youth, recent graduates, and professionals, that teach current and future consumers how to use financial products, spend responsibly, save, and budget. Consumers can have access to the best, most advanced, products in the world, but if they do not know how to use them, then consumers are missing out on the full experience or not getting the most value or benefits from these products. We are working closely with government departments and authorities, including Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority and Dubai Shopping Festival, in order to make sure we promote usage of cards.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong>The vast majority of the wealth in this region has been created in the past 40 years and many families are now going through a profound shift with that wealth, and often the businesses that created it, being handed down to the next generation. Families that are not prepared for this transition are putting their businesses and accumulated wealth at risk of failure. Among several factors that threaten this wealth transfer are unresolved family issues—a major cause of concern in the region. Quite often, the head of a family is so emotionally attached to the business that he may neglect to establish a structure or corporate governance to ensure the company's long-term health. In the Gulf region, families with assets of over $100 million tend to be led by first- or second-generation individuals. We are one of the world's largest money managers with $1.7 trillion in assets under management.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Wealth creation is slowing down, but it's still here. Production costs are still way below the market price. We never know when this is going to change. The other thing is diversification. With the drop in oil prices, people here in the region see how important it is to diversify their assets as well, and not to be reliant on one single income source, despite oil still making a lot. That is how we can add value. Being a boutique private bank focusing on wealth management for private clients, we are mainly targeting entrepreneurs and wealthy families, providing a unique access and expertise on emerging markets. Falcon Private Bank will focus its growth mainly on this region and on Southeast Asia. We want to grow in the double digits, as we have done in the last couple of years, by increasing our share of wealth organically and by hiring talented professionals.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Lombard Odier is not a newcomer to the region. As far as the Middle East is concerned, we have one office and that is in the UAE. This gives you an idea of the commitment that we have and the importance we give to the region at a global level. In that sense, the UAE, and Dubai in particular, is really the bridge between our Asian offices in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, and our European offices. We have formed relationships between Switzerland, London, and Asia with our local contacts here over a span of more than 50 years. To speak of the whole of the UAE, we are confident in the growth of the Emirate. It should reflect in the growth of the market. There is a demand in Dubai for liquidity in the stock market, but there is also strong demand for fixed-income markets and new issuances in fixed-income, as well as in sukuks. Clients more and more are valuing performance, which means that we have to be innovative to make sure that our investments are both performing and out-performing the others.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The main challenge for the region today remains the price of oil. This is very much a hydrocarbon-based area, and the weakness in oil prices has a direct impact on the region's growth prospects and capacity to fund its ambitious capital expenditures programs. The simple reason is that oil and gas rich countries in the region have accumulated a great deal of wealth and reserves, and have gone through long term investment strategies that have proved efficient in terms of making sure this wealth is invested in a diversified portfolio of assets and also away from the region. When it comes to Dubai's economy and its business potential, I am very impressed by the speed of its turnaround. Dubai went through difficult times, and during those times Société Générale remained faithful to the Dubai market and to its regional hub. Today, Dubai (and the UAE in general) witnesses a greater stability and healthier financial situation which have definitely reinforced the UAE's profile as a regional safe haven.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Global equities are exciting. We are working with index and service providers to expand this range further. We are also working with a few Chinese exchanges to make sure we provide access to Chinese and RMB denominated products to our market participants. One of the key focus areas for us is to develop physically deliverable products. We launched plastics last year and that was one such initiative in the hydrocarbons base. Currency futures have been the most active segment for us, followed by gold and precious metals. Our volumes are largely in currency futures, but the precious metals segment also has a lot of potential for further growth. We are excited about developments in this space. We have traditionally been growing our currencies portfolio very substantially, but we have also set our targets for precious metals and the development of the local gold market. We've already seen a large chunk of the diamond market move from Belgium to Dubai. We've also seen many instances of Dubai serving as a broker between Africa, India, and China, which are some of the most exciting markets right now.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We see ourselves at the beginning of the Dubai-Shanghai trade corridor. Everyone knows this is the world's most stable source of crude oil production, especially water-borne crudes that are servicing the north Asian market. We find that the transformation is more in what is happening on the trading patterns and the fact that China is the number one oil consumer today. In terms of targets, we had a transformational year where we were up over 33%. We were trading 6.5 million barrels a year in 2013 and now we are well above 8.5 million barrels a day. Next year we hope to continue with a strong growth cycle. We've had over 85 different participants in the exchange, and when I started in 2012, there were about 50. There is a growing interest and participation in the trade dynamics of the East-of-Suez-market, meaning that we also have Western companies from London, Singapore, and the US that want to price the actual activity in this market.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>What we have achieved is to further establish Dubai as a thriving center for regional and international listings in a variety of asset classes. Most of our listings were of sukuk, establishing us as one of the world's leading exchanges for Islamic bonds and enabling us to play an important role in the internationalization of this asset class. In total we attracted $13.4 billion worth of sukuk into the exchange in 2014, and it was 5.5 to 6 times oversubscribed. It was also diversified in geographical terms of where investors came from, mainly the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. The first sukuk listing from Hong Kong reflects the growing synergy between East and West. Nasdaq Dubai will continue to strengthen its connections with East Asia to offer listing opportunities across a variety of asset classes including equities. Egypt is also more than ever a key market. Its economy is reviving and its fast growing businesses have a strong appetite for investment. The relationship between the UAE and Egypt is particularly strong, with the UAE supporting the Egyptian economy with billions of dollars and UAE companies playing an active role there. Nasdaq Dubai is here to help Egyptian companies expand in terms of visibility and investment beyond their local markets and our 2014 agreement with Misr for Central Clearing, Depository and Registry (MCDR) enables us to do that. Other significant listings over the past year included the IPO of Dubai-based Emirates REIT in April 2014—which was Dubai's first IPO for several years—and then the listing of the shares of Orascom Construction, one of the most established names in Egyptian business, in March 2015. Some may argue that it is Dubai's city infrastructure, but I believe the key driver that Dubai has, that cannot be copied, is the intellectual capital that is here. The DIFC alone has thousands of financial experts whose input is available across many sectors. Islamic finance, inside the DIFC and outside, is one of the areas in which Dubai excels in depth and breadth of knowledge. Another innovation is our Murabaha platform for Islamic finance, opened in April 2014 by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammad, Crown Prince of Dubai. It was developed with Emirates Islamic, and provides a unique solution for financial institutions and their corporate and individual customers to conduct Islamic financing transactions in a streamlined, flexible and transparent manner. It offers significant advantages over alternative Murabaha channels, including speed, liquidity, a fixed price for the traded certificates, zero spread, and Sharia-certainty. In less than a year, the platform has attracted a number of new financial institutions and achieved more than AED 31 billion ($8.5 billion) in transactions.</p>]]></sections21>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>The Islamic economy is an evolving area, and its evolution creates a lot of opportunities. Abdullah Al Awar is the custodian of this strategy. To begin with, maybe you can articulate the seven pillars of this strategy, and also elaborate on why you think Dubai is in the best position to be a global center?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ABDULLAH AL AWAR</strong> HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai, launched the Dubai Islamic Economy Vision in early 2013. This was due to the fact that there was considerable interest in the term Islamic Economy, and, of course, the progress and the potential that this economy serves. This is why Dubai decided to embark on this vision, given the fact that arguably there is no global leader today when it comes to Islamic economic sectors. So what does the term Islamic economy mean? We often hear the term, and I have counted many people, including myself, who refer to the Islamic economy as only one or maybe two sectors, which is not the case. The Islamic economy is comprised of several sectors of the economy; it represents trades, transactions, and economic activities between institutions and consumers that are based on some sort of faith-based belief that has a market or commercial impact. His Highness revealed the road map in August 2013, and it revolves around the development of seven key pillars that form the strategy. To recap, Islamic finance is one of the sectors, as is the halal industry, which would include various products and segments, such as food and beverages, but also lifestyle products, such as cosmetics, and in the medical space as well, specifically pharmaceutical products. The third pillar focuses on enhancing family-friendly tourism, or halal tourism as some people prefer to call it. The fourth is the Islamic digital economy. The fifth is lifestyle, arts, and both fashion and architectural design, as well as other forms of design. The sixth pillar revolves around the education and knowledge sector. This mainly involves the dissemination of information, as well as human capital. And the last pillar is the development of the Islamic economy and standards. What is unique in my opinion is that these pillars actually converge with each other; there is a synergy between the pillars. Our view is not to handle or manage the pillars singularly, on the contrary, we would like to see linkages and development across the seven areas. Our strategy is developed based on that approach. Our philosophy is also a little bit different from others, I would say, because we believe in inclusion. Hence, we work with the stakeholders and today our stakeholders include foreign government bodies and local Dubai government bodies, but also the private sector, which plays an important role in communicating the strategy and achieving His Highness' vision.</p><h4><span></span>Obviously, sukuk is performing very well as an asset class, and takaful consistently outperforms conventional insurance. Mr Jamal Bin Ghalaita, can you quickly outline in what ways Dubai can be a leader in these asset classes?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JAMAL BIN GHALAITA</strong> The subject of sukuk is quite wide, there is a regulatory angle to it, a financial requirement for it, and there is a user angle too. These are three theories I see as the pillars for sukuk. From a regulatory point of view, the regulations are changing. The second part of the sukuk is the requirement for liquidity overall. If you look at Islamic banking requirements today, the most liquid Islamic banks are finding it hard to deploy their money around the world. Therefore, most sukuk today are oversubscribed for the simple reason that there is a lot of liquidity around the world. And also people have enough conventional bonds, which have a different structure to sukuk. Sukuk started as an asset bank structure, which gives more comfort to the sukuk holders, but if we go to the end-users, they are looking for more sustainable, long-term funding. The long-term funding needs to go to the capital markets, and the capital markets will issue the sukuk. The issue is that the product has not evolved over time. A lot of people have moved and so you have this Islamic category that is used to source this category, and then you have the countries that are tapping into this industry, such as South Africa, Hong Kong, and many other countries. I think that even London has a good structure for sukuk, and we are seeing global corporates start issuing sukuk. I will not list any specifics, but there are a number of companies looking to attract liquidity and they are rated AA or A. These companies can tap into Islamic sukuk, and Dubai is the right hub for launching these sukuk. This is where, hopefully, we can work together with our partners to launch a more creative sukuk structure for people who want to shift from just bonds and trading because there are two, three, or four structures of sukuk that would attract more clients. As I said, it is not just the bonds that are issued that should be guaranteed, but also the underlying assets that should be protected because these attract more liquidity, not just from Islamic banks, but also from conventional banks, as well as individuals.</p><h4><br>What is very interesting to me is that one of these pillars is the digital economy, which is not what we typically think about when considering the Islamic economy. I know Mr Badr Buhannad has something interesting to say because he is launching initiatives to incubate and facilitate tech start-ups in the Islamic digital sector. How are these ideas progressing?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BADR BUHANNAD</strong> First of all there are a lot of questions to consider, such as what the digital economy represents and how it links into the structure of the seven pillars. Let us start by defining the digital economy. The digital economy is the internet economy. The internet revolution started in the 1990s and it is really enabling sellers and buyers to conduct business through e-portals and the internet in general, thereby eliminating many of the boundaries and costs that previously existed between the parties. Being within the seven pillars, the digital economy is really enabling the other pillars to conduct business. It is harnessing technology and the internet to promote ease of doing business. Being in the Dubai Silicon Oasis zone, we always back the initiatives of His Highness, especially with the Smart City development and the Islamic economy. And we are responsible for two initiatives regarding the Islamic economy—we are responsible for creating the entrepreneurial hub for entrepreneurs to produce products, services, and technology that supports the transformation of Dubai as the capital of the Islamic economy. And we are also really pushing the boundaries of Arabic content creation and looking at how we can encourage well-established companies to create products and services for Muslims around the world.</p><h4><span></span>With all the diverse players in the country talking about the Islamic economy, one common thing that we hear in terms of challenges is, of course, the issue of human capital. Ms. Randa Bessiso is here to speak about meeting the needs of an economy through human capital development. What advantages does Dubai have?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RANDA BESSISO</strong> Dubai is perfectly placed in this part of the region and in the global economy to actually translate this vision of becoming a hub for the Islamic economy into a reality. We already have in place a number of successful initiatives that will enable Dubai to succeed and claim that space. The UAE is the first country that has a purpose-built free zone for education, and it is home to the highest number of international branch campuses in the world. Between Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and the other Emirates, there are about 30 international branch campuses, and that is just higher education. In addition, there is vocational training and hundreds of institutions that work on the development of education, training, and life-long learning. We have been a partner of Dubai International Academic City, with a branch of the University of Manchester in Dubai Knowledge Village, for eight years now. We support 1,700 part time MBA program participants and doctoral students. This is in addition to working in collaboration with a number of stakeholders in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and in the UAE in general. We have seen how collaboration and inclusion in Dubai actually helps facilitate the creation of a knowledge economy. Dubai has world-class infrastructure, well placed in the center of the MENA region, as well as close to Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, and we are attracting young talent. The alleged brain drain that we have talked about has been reversed, and now we are witnessing a brain gain.</p><h4><span></span>According to Deloitte, two-thirds of bankers in the GCC said that it was a difficult challenge to find technically proficient people to fill entry-level positions for Islamic finance, because obviously this is an evolving sector. Mr Ghalaita, do you find that to be true and how do you deal with that challenge?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JAMAL BIN GHALAITA</strong> I think that the challenge is there and the issue is that university curricula do not include Islamic finance as a major. However, a lot of universities are adapting to this need because it is quite a broad subject that will help to evolve our economy. It should be part of the education curriculum and the critical part of this is the universities. Universities have to be the provider of both the sharia and economic aspects of finance education because today we are only producing scholars. We need to produce students who know how finance works when it is sharia compliant. Today, we take conventional bankers like me and convert them into Islamic bankers; they have to go through a lot of education, and some people do not succeed.</p><p><span></span><strong>ABDULLAH AL AWAR</strong> Islamic finance is not difficult for someone who is business-orientated and who has been brought up with it, but the other way around is actually extremely difficult. I think that the other option is to take a scholar who has an understanding of the religion and the ways of sharia, and equip them with the business knowledge.</p><p><span></span><strong>JAMAL BIN GHALAITA </strong>Currently, the most successful method is when people move from conventional finance because they have already learned the business, and then they are educated again. However, there is still the potential to go the other way.</p><p><span></span><strong>ABDULLAH AL AWAR </strong>But I want to make the point as far as knowledge and the build up of talent is concerned that we want to encourage more diversity, because the Islamic pillars are not focused primarily on Islamic finance; there is a need for other sectors too.</p><p><span></span><strong>JAMAL BIN GHALAITA</strong> I also think not just with education, but with sharia also, there are ethics to consider. For example, genetically engineered products or produce would prove challenging for sharia to approve in the future, because if it is anything harmful to humans it could be conditional on sharia approval. Halal standards have been formulated over time, and these are the challenges that will come in future.</p><p><span></span><strong>RANDA BESSISO</strong> In Dubai we have already launched the first initiative with Hamdan Bin Mohammed Smart University, in collaboration with the Open University of Catalonia, which has a specific MSc program for Islamic finance and Islamic studies. There is a Center of Excellence for Islamic Finance that is being developed. Therefore, we have already moved forward in terms of new initiatives, but obviously Dubai-based organizations alone cannot drive this, and we need that inclusion and we need to continue to attract the talent that can be re-skilled and up-skilled to facilitate all seven pillars. In recent research conducted by Deloitte and Dubai International Academic City, Dubai was ranked number four in terms of the most sought-after education destinations, covering the area of the world from China to North Africa, and Dubai has really overtaken some of the other better-known destinations by coming in just behind the US, the UK, and Australia. Dubai ranked 12th overall, with the quality of the education system ranked ninth in the WEF Global Competitiveness Report 2014-15. So, we have established our credibility, and with Dubai Knowledge Village we are working with one of the best regulatory frameworks for higher education that will attract quality investment and institutions. Furthermore, we have success stories in terms of credible frameworks that are facilitating the fast development of the overall support network for the seven pillars. This includes the area of human capital development with a focus on UAE nationals and the fact that education has been placed at the top of the UAE National Agenda for economic and social strategies.</p><p><span></span><strong>JAMAL BIN GHALAITA</strong> One of the questions we have is looking at the situation in the US, where the private sector supports education because the cost cannot be born solely by state schools. Lots of schools in the US, as you know, are supported by the private sector. I think there should be more involvement by the private sector in supporting the education of people and the curriculum, and that means financial solutions.</p><p><span></span><strong>ABDULLAH AL AWAR </strong>From my perspective there has been interest from the Dubai private sector, not directly in education, but related to talent development. I was pleased to see that after the announcement of the vision by His Highness, there was a company established in Dubai, in Knowledge Village, that I think is the first of its kind in the world, and it focuses solely on the development of specialists in Islamic economics. It decided to set it up in response to the vision and while it is from the UK it moved its operations to Dubai and changed itsmodel to focus on recruiting specialists within the seven pillars. This is a good example of a private sector company providing support to the industry.</p><p><span></span><strong>BADR BUHANNAD</strong> I think that is one issue that is very important; the private and the education sectors working together. It is especially important for young people who are just finishing high school and going to university because they want to be able to see where they will end up in the next four or five years. Hence it is pivotal when we are opening new programs that the private sector is there to sponsor, guarantee, or to show growth in these sectors. I would like to give an example of the private sector and education working together. The Dubai Silicon Oasis and the Rochester Institute of Technology have been with us for the last five years, and they have proposed another graduate program, and we had one company involved that works with drone technology, specifically developing drone software. When they have problems to solve they work with the students. So part of the student program is to work with our companies to solve their problems. We have a specially dedicated place where they work with the company in that area as well, so this is really about having the private sector and the education sector working together to create results, especially in the new sectors that are emerging in Dubai.</p><p><span></span><strong>ABDULLAH AL AWAR</strong> If I could make a point, because I do not want to ignore the point that was made earlier about Islamic economic values attracting wider audience. Today when we talk about transactions or instruments, whether these are finance instruments or halal products for others, we should not just be talking about consumption by the end-users. This is important to the sector's overall strategy, but I agree in terms of relating both to Islamic finance, for example, and values on a more global ethical scale. To me the challenge on one side is saying we want to develop products for everyone, not only for Muslims, but when it comes to workplace standards I think there is room for improvement to include similar requirements. Take for example principles of responsible investing (PRI); how many Islamic finance institutes have signed up to that? There is only one globally that has signed up. Why is this the case? If the principles and values are similar then we should see more. A lot of people would be attracted, I think, to standard setting through the International Sharia'a Board or others, and also standards that require companies to report on, for example CSR activities. If these standards are in line as much as possible, than Islamic products will increase in number</p><p><span></span><strong>JAMAL BIN GHALAITA</strong> This is the point we are trying to reach; if you want to eat halal products, or alternatively you want to eat just any product that is available on the market, you will know the difference in terms of the ethics and the production conditions, and so forth. The same thing applies to sukuks and bonds. We should not copy what is being done today with bonds; we should bring a different financial product to the market to differentiate ourselves, and that is what we are trying to do together with the Dubai government initiative and Abdullah's team.</p><h4><span></span>Can you foresee innovation being part of this, in terms of new instruments?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JAMAL BIN GHALAITA</strong> Yes, we have been working with NASDAQ, and hopefully we will be working with a commodity market as well to offer different products that will provide liquidity in a halal way. With NASDAQ we have launched a certificate that is similar to the London Metal Exchange certificate. We intend to have a joint workshop in the future to share these ideas about how we can develop the NASDAQ product and certificate further. In fact, it was actually NASDAQ that took on the idea and developed it. This is where we see the future; we need to be innovative and more flexible in our products. I do not think that halal certificates should be the same standard; they should be different and provide a different quality. And I think that halal should be closer to organic rather than genetically engineered.</p><p><span></span><strong>ABDULLAH AL AWAR</strong> These will all be part of the standards developed by the UAE, the Emirates authorities, and the Saudi Arabian authorities who took the view, as Mr Ghalaita said, that halal certified products are not just categorized based on the process. Halal also goes beyond just the issues of faith, safety, and the treatment of the animals that are being slaughtered. Everything tie in, such as certification and logistics.</p><p><span></span><strong>RANDA BESSISO</strong> I think we need to educate the public here, and we also need to give them information about the benefits of halal products and continue to build that Islamic brand. But we also need to look at how we can translate it into a more universally acceptable and familiar term. Global ethics and government are already being taught as part of business degrees, including those at Manchester Business School, and I think that we just need to continue to look for avenues to promote the sound ethics that underpin that halal brand.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>MENA, with all its population, still only represents around 2% of the total global pharmaceutical market and it is very fragmented. This has put pressure on some of the smaller companies to not be physically present here, but rather look for partners who can become an extension to their values, their best practices and their compliance to market their products. That's where NewBridge comes in, we have the expertise, network, and the distribution channels, to drive innovative pharmaceutical products to the market and be the one-stop solution to these companies across multiple geographies. Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry comes from two sources, big pharma, and small or midsize companies such as those in the biotech segment. When these small or mid-size companies want to reach the world, their initial focus is usually the US, Europe, and Japan. As for the rest of the world, they usually prefer a partnering model, and depending on the country or the region in question they usually prefer a regional partner and this was the niche we found for ourselves. These innovative companies usually want to access emerging markets, get a piece of the action and the growth, but at the same time they don't want to establish structures themselves in each country or region. They have a very focused strategy and also finite resources, hence the partnering model.</p>]]></sections01>

The amount of cash that changes hands versus electronic methods is much greater than many other parts of the world. We have a great technology for cash called Retail 360. It allows clients to be able to deposit their back office cash much quicker, and they can put it on their balance sheet, which is better for their cash flow and security. This is different from the traditional methodology, which will take away some of our traditional business but we believe investing in it now will help in the long term. Some of the electronic security that we are working on with major construction companies for the UAE, from an access control and a video analytics point of view, is also interesting. We are looking to help retailers understand what their footfall is doing, which direction they are walking, and what they are looking for. We can analyze that very quickly and offer them detailed metrics to improve the offering, traffic flow for their customers, which is something we do very well in other countries. Being able to bring that to the UAE is an exciting development for us.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The MENA territory is one of the few markets worldwide where there is a significant growth in this sector, of 9-10%. Our products have a great potential in the region because there is limited competition due to the innovative approach that we take. Our aim for the coming years is to become a category leader in those therapeutic areas. Previously, the MENA region was managed by one of our affiliates in the Netherlands.However as a pharmaceutical company, proximity to our stakeholders is key. We cannot really be a true partner unless we are there on the ground. Close to our patients, doctors and the medical community, close to our business associates and, of course, close to the healthcare providers and authorities in the region. We had to recruit local talent who have a long-standing experience in the MENA region, understand the culture and speak the same language as our stakeholder. We currently have around 170 people in the region working for Astellas having almost doubled our presence versus the previous year.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Investment in healthcare is high here, mainly because this is a rapidly-growing market. There is a need for more technology. This will position the Gulf or the Middle East as a unique market. At a time when we see the European and US markets more or less growing by 2-3%, the Middle East is growing at a rate of 8%-10%. In the UAE in 2009, there was a population of 3.4 million. Now it is 9 million with a projected jump to 14 million in a few years. This will create a need for more hospital beds and more quality of care. This aside, lifestyle diseases are a problem. Obesity is causing diabetes and diabetes causes heart problems. Also, we see cancer becoming really widespread. We now have the means to diagnose, so we are seeing it more, but also because the disease is spreading because of lifestyle. All this is a burden to the Ministry of Health and it needs to tackle this. In 2014 we equipped the Ministry of Health in the UAE with 11 new CTs. It wanted the latest technology, and the best for its patients. We went together to Chicago where we had launched our best technology. There has been lots of discussion around sustainability of growth in this part of the world. Like it or not, we are all talking about oil prices dropping. We are an oil price-sensitive market and the bulk of the GDP is oil dependent, but in most of these markets the official plan is that healthcare investment will remain as is.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>One of Bombardier's main objectives in the region is targeting aircraft sales, but we have other goals to increase our customer services and presence. Bombardier has significantly increased its presence in the region over the years. Most of the sales force is now based in the UAE. The office we are in presently has expanded from eight people to 24 now, and we are still expanding. We chose the UAE obviously for the basic elements it provides us with, such as businesses in the city and airlines including Emirates, which provide us with connections between the Middle East, Africa, and our home in Montreal, Canada. It is easy to fly from here, and it is an easy center to use. That is really why we decided on Dubai, and we have been here since 1998. Dubai International Airport is very crowded and busy, and there is probably no more room for business aircraft there. We feel that this is something that is going to work against users of business aircraft. Otherwise, we don't have problems in Dubai.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>People haven't given up completely on leisure tourism, but the timeframes have differed. Obviously, business tourism is more of a short- to mid-term investment and leisure tourism is a longer-term investment. With the opening of the Nacala Airport, we are going to be in a position to be able to compete with other global destinations. Obviously, we need the infrastructure, but I think the most important thing is to be able to compete with global destinations in terms of times of flights. Also, the opening of new airports and the bringing in of new airlines, which has been happening in the last few years, is also going to open up the. We depend a lot on Europe, but when Nacala Airport opens up, I believe Emirates is going to fly to Nacala. That opens up a huge market, so not only Europe, but also the Middle East and Far East. That is something that we need to maximize and exploit. We work with closely with INATUR in terms of marketing. The issue is that it is expensive to market Mozambique because the country is an expensive destination to reach.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are promoting Mozambique as a destination in itself, rather than merely an add-on. Mozambique has enough to occupy the visitor for two to three weeks without adding it to a tour to Botswana, Namibia, or South Africa. Mozambique has so much to offer that is refreshingly different. Our safaris offer an excursion into Gorongosa National Park where the visitor will not see more than 20 other game vehicles, as the territory is wholly untouched, and therefore provides a new way of seeing Africa. Tanzania and Botswana are established destinations that we can never compete with, so instead we aim for the unique. We are looking to expand our offerings in beach and island areas, because people here on business occasionally stay for up to three weeks, and want to leave Maputo without having to deal with visas to Kruger National Park, or taking expensive flights north. There is enough to do around here over a weekend, and we are trying to develop these products and packages to cater to that potential.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Predominately the profile of an average tourist is business people looking for investment opportunities, then families who spend two to four weeks at the beach or island resorts, and adventure travelers. These visitors are generally between 28 to 50 years of age. Most of our visitors are budget orientated and self-catering, particularly South Africans, who visit Mozambique during holiday seasons. The country needs to be more introspective in assessing areas in which we are still lacking. As our leisure tourism is too seasonal, and as we have great potential we look to develop domestic tourism. Often some hotels and resorts shut down in between these periods. Mozambicans could visit during low season, but this requires strong tour operators with a large capacity, without which it is difficult to offer lower prices even in the low season. If you empower the tour operators to have this capacity beyond the high season, it would make sense for them to direct their bus fleets to promote domestic tourism excursions.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Tourism remains expensive and we lack the competition among multiple airlines required to handle domestic flights. Most events in Maputo are conferences, meetings, and business tourism, which is why hotels are at 95% capacity booking. Thus, while we do have considerable potential for leisure tourism, the MICE and business travel segments currently dominate the sector. The government must take up the challenge of promoting the image of the country, and we will certainly assist with whatever steps are considered necessary. Mostly though, we need to invest in infrastructure, roads, and health issues, without which investors are reluctant to make a commitment. Normally, tour operators in Mozambique do not have more than six or seven employees, but we have 30 people working at our current head office alone, and furthermore in our other offices. We are also finalizing our new premises in the city's premium destination, Kenneth Kaunda Avenue. Currently, the quality of human resources in Mozambique's hospitality industry is lacking. We have to invest heavily in training to address these problems.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Last year we approved a new vision and a new mission for the university, which is to have a greater focus on research. That means that research will be the basis of all our activities in terms of training our students. We expect that our research results will be used to improve our lectures. In order to build a research university, it requires a lot of investment, particularly for the training of lecturers. We expect to train people as much as possible to the Master's and PhD level so they can participate more in the university's growth and development. Our university has the most international students in the country. They want to come here because we are among the best in Africa. Because of our ranking in the region and the world, we are getting many foreign students, traditionally from lusophone nations, but also increasingly from other source countries. We are working on developing our relationships with the private sector, but not enough people recognize how we can help private business. The examples that we have with petroleum companies like Anadarko show that this can be fruitful. Maputo Port is also an impressive example.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We decided from the outset that ISUTC (Instituto Superior de Transportes e Comunicaçíµes) would begin by concentrating on engineering and technology. Of course that was a problem because most high school graduates do not tend to favor physics and mathematics, which is why after ten years we still did not have more than 400 students. We decided to be a more aggressive in organizing a range of training sessions in these areas. And once the post-graduate degree courses began, our school's name became more well-known to the extent that over the past four years, we have more than doubled the student body. The relationship with the private sector is excellent, and we are already on the second of our courses with Vale due to the success of the first. I know that Vale is keen to increase the professional training of its workers, and even if professional training is not our core activity, we are pleased at the prospect of entering this area. Meanwhile, we work extensively with the National Roads Administration (ANE). I organized the city's courses in the field of maintenance two years ago, and welcomed around 100 participants from the ANE.</p>]]></sections11>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Clinicare has been growing over the past two years and our aim is to continue that growth. The intention is to expand our clinic in Maputo by a further ten treatment rooms because our work has been positively received by both the local and expatriate sectors. In 2015 we will also be expanding into the provinces, specifically to Nampula in 1Q2015, and then to Nacala. We are currently finalizing details, such as human resource requirements, in order to move into northern Mozambique. Health insurance is becoming a significant market for us because a number of larger companies are coming here to serve their expatriate clientele. Thanks to the environment that we provide and the people that we have, they don't need to go to other places for certain surgeries and other procedures—they can have them carried out here. Over the past three or four years, even the public sector has been investing in new equipment and resources which has been beneficial for the population, as is competition. The number of private clinics in Maputo has increased over the past three years.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Maputo Private Hospital is a member of the Lenmed Group of hospitals, South Africa. The Lenmed Group was established more than 30 years ago, and owns seven hospitals in South Africa, as well as two international facilities namely Bokamoso Private Hospital in Botswana and Maputo Private Hospital. This is a 105-bed institution, that provides all the major clinical disciplines, supported by state-of-the-art technology. Some of these disciplines include internal medicine, general surgery, anesthesiology, orthopedic surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, radiology featuring MRI, CT scans, nursing, ICU, NICU, casualty (24/7) and four well-equipped operating rooms. Supporting the above functions, we have a modern pharmacy service. These services are provided by 16 full-time specialists, 122 nursing staff and a further 100 specialist consultants that make use of our facilities to see private patients. The proliferation of health insurance in Mozambique has resulted in more individuals being able to be treated at our facility. Private patients (not covered by a medical care provider) have to pay significant amounts toward admission deposits, which in certain instances result in delays during admission to the hospital.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The clinic was established in 1993 and has seen growth since then. We began with a building in Maputo that we have increased in size with several new consultation rooms. In the near future we will construct a new building. The sector is improving. In the beginning, only Cruz Azul and our own company were offering good quality private health services, but today competition is on the rise, which is a healthy development. Having new private clinics in the region is good because if you need a specific service, let's say a scan, several clinics now offer that service. Also, we have an excellent relationship between the clinics, and where needed, we utilize each other's services and technologies. Besides, many doctors are present in several clinics at different times whereby we are effectively an extended family. Our business goal, naturally enough, is to provide patients the best possible treatment. Our staff has been at the clinic with me for around 20 years and is extremely adept at doing this. At this point in time we have 140 employees (up from 75 in 1993) and 20 beds where we offer the best healthcare.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Two years ago we were a 90% public service provider, and only 10% private. We worked for banks, for example, to provide new branches and related evaluations. Now our business is 60% public and 40% private, and we want the ratio to level out at 50:50 ultimately, with projects involving both large corporations and smaller enterprises. We have ranked among the top three in Mozambique in terms of consultancy services over the past five years. I think in less than five years we will be number one, and we look to double our business within five to seven years. Today we design tailored solutions for our clients, and over the next few years we will launch the second phase of our project to build supply water systems in rural areas.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The combination of Kentz and SNC-Lavalin is part of building a global Tier-1 engineering and construction (E&amp;C) company. This created a group with approximately 45,000 employees, annual revenues of about approximately $10 billion, and a backlog of roughly $13 billion as per 2013 figures. Our new capability to take the full EPCM scope on projects will provide further value to our clients, while our focus on providing our specialist and responsive services will mean our execution for clients, who have supported us for many years, will only be strengthened. In respect of prospects on the African continent, we see opportunities that will see us providing technical services and delivering more complex, turnkey projects in remote locations. We are now able to meet our clients' needs by offering SNC-Lavalin's strong Front-end Engineering and Design (FEED) capabilities, full EPC projects, as well as Kentz's leading construction expertise in Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Instrumentation, and Piping (SMEIP).</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our main objectives include becoming a reliable partner for the Mozambique government for the country's infrastructure development, which is our core business. We believe that we can play a major role in assisting in that growth, which we can do through our ability to attract private investment for the construction of infrastructure at competitive conditions, delivering EPPM and turnkey projects; all of this of course with our long term experience and knowhow of working in Africa. We are proud to be part of the Maputo Catembe bridge project. This will be the largest suspension bridge in Africa and among the top 50 in the world. GAUFF has been contracted to act as consultant for the quality control of the construction of the bridge and link roads.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Bechtel is the largest engineering and construction company in the US, employing about 53,000 people. We have annual revenues of approximately $40 billion. We currently operate in Angola, Rwanda, Mozambique, and Gabon, but also have a presence in Egypt. What attracted us to Mozambique initially was the LNG project, which was our flagship scheme through the middle of last year. Today, three of our four business groups are looking at all sectors in Mozambique. Mozambique has vast potential, and equally vast needs, which is widely acknowledged. The newly discovered wealth in the form of coal and gas reserves, as well as important mineral discoveries in recent years, have created a possibility for Mozambique to begin tackling some of its difficulties. There is some interesting work going on with respect to Coal-To-Liquids (CTL), and we are poised to sign a contract to support one of those contracts with early engineering work. We have been approached about a fertilizer plant project, too. Infrastructure is our short-term focus, as it is for the government.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>MMD is a family company established in 2005. Our first project simultaneously involved a demolition at the British High Commission and construction of a six-floor building on Av. Karl Marx. Since then we have continued to grow and we have reached the fortunate stage where, after only six months, we have projects and clients in excess of our capacity. With the need to expand came the decision to purchase another Mozambican company that had already been operating for a number of years called JR Construçoes, a move that provided the additional capacity required to undertake our projects. In 2008, we faced the same problem on a larger scale and purchased another company called PRUMO. The new scale this provided allowed us to bid for jobs that were previously only awarded to foreign firms, with whom we are able to compete today. We now have 550 employees and are a major player in the market, competing with other large-scale companies. Yet we are not involved in infrastructure projects, such as roads and bridges, but focus solely on buildings. Clearly the oil and gas project locations are significant prospects. We are looking forward to going to Pemba and Palma, to which I would add, Nacala, Tete, and obviously Maputo.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Lis is a small 100% Mozambican company, and one of our largest clients since 2010 has been Cidadela da Matola. We developed the environmental project of that area, and today we are beginning to build the first phase of the infrastructure project, while supervising the construction. This project includes a mall, residential buildings, a hotel and conference center, and a building for the provincial government, as well as office buildings, a cultural center, and museum. In construction, we also undertake work for Henan Gou Ji, a Chinese company engaged on a landmark project called “5,000 houses.“ The project is a joint venture with the Mozambican government's Housing Promotion Fund (FFH), which is the agency overseeing affordable public housing. We are interested in working for the government in all areas related to construction of buildings, infrastructure, and civil engineering projects, among others. Our first goal from Lis Construction is to be able to support the LNG-related construction projects taking place in the north of the country. We are trying to become a sub-construction company of the large players operating there. We want to support all the industries in the north of the country, in the first phase of construction of their bases, and so on.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Fertha Construçíµes is a Mozambican-owned company that we purchased in 2010. The company was founded in 2005. Since then we have been working to bring the company to the next level. We have secured some tenders and we are growing slowly on the same path of the national economy. We are a small company that indirectly employs 110 people. We are looking to take advantage of all opportunities emerging in the country, while gaining scale to a extent to seek potential partners of greater financial and technical clout. We tend to join up with bigger companies so that we can actually cover the country in different fields, including building roads, bridges, water sanitation, dams, electrical power plants, and so forth. We have been working mostly in the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, of buildings, roads, and some other private projects. Today we are predominantly focused on rehabilitating infrastructure such as the central hospital, or local municipality roads, mostly for institutions. Most of the work we undertake is public sector related, in the education sector, the health sector, and on a municipal level. At this time the building sector for us represents about 70% of our work.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Since it started its first service in Africa in 2001, the CMA CGM Group has increased its presence and become a major player on the continent. It has continuously reinforced its presence and its services, and is now pursuing its maritime and inland development in Africa. The Group is present in 43 Sub-Saharan countries, with its 72-branch network and 1,300 employees. As the second shipping company operating in Mozambique, the CMA CGM Group operates at all five main ports—Maputo, Beira, Quelimane, Nacala, and Pemba—where it is also physically represented by its own agencies. Currently, refrigerated cargo and exports of certain dry commodities are our strategic focus areas. This includes a diversity of products such as timber, tobacco, cotton, grains, and nuts. Our group offers its customers weekly calls to Mozambique. Our three different shipping services to and from the country allow us to accommodate customer needs by offering personalized service with tailor-made solutions. On top of that, our innovative inland solutions provide safe cargo transportation from the port to ramp, or door-to-door delivery to any of the hinterland countries in the region.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Besides Maputo, Beira, Quelimane, Moma, Angoche, Nacala, and Pemba, LBH is also present in Mocí­mboa da Praia port, which is a small, but strategically positioned facility at the heart of the gas field. We hope to service the larger players from it. We have also launched a service called LBH Xpress. We operate a weekly service from Johannesburg and Durban all the way through Maputo in the north. There is no doubt that the north is the destination of future development. The closest sophisticated engineering systems are in South Africa, we have warehouses in Johannesburg, Durban, Maputo, and Nacala to service the LBH Xpress trucks and the customers. As shipping agents, we now handle almost any type of cargo, from small boxes to cape-sized vessels, nationwide. Our services have extended considerably and we can do a complete logistics management service. We have a joint venture with Barloworld in a highly sophisticated transport management system for bulk commodities. Tonnage-wise, we probably handled 2 million tons in Beira last year, 8 million tons in Maputo, and 13 million tons nationally.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We arrived in 1998 and first opened the office in Beira. A couple of years later we moved to Maputo but then in 2013 we returned. Beira is the business center in terms of trade and is also a gateway to Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi. More than 50% of our overall business moves through Beira. From a business point of view it is much easier to connect to other countries and optimize the cargo we ship. Therefore, the relocation was done with business optimization in mind. We are operating at the four ports of Nacala, Quelimane, Beira, and Maputo. Quelimane is a small port for us, with a bi-weekly call. Nacala has a weekly call and Beira and Maputo twice a week. The biggest challenge for us in terms of expanding that is Beira because it has yet to develop into an international port, so in terms of us optimizing and enhancing our business even further, Beira is the bottleneck. We want to continue the journey begun in 2014 with an optimization of the value of the business that we have and the activities that we do.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>With current and future investments to come, as well as job creation, training the local workforce, support for social activities, and adding value to raw materials we import to produce our own output, we are already contributing to national development. We also believe that in the future we could locally source some of the raw materials we currently import and produce more products locally. And meanwhile, we forecast double-digit annual growth supported by innovation and investments. Looking ahead, the manner in which the government chooses to allocate revenues generated from the exploitation of Mozambique's natural resources will determine the national business environment and broader national development.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Maí«va's first investment was in the Sabino soap factory, and growth in 2004 brought with it the opportunity to build a second plant to manufacture oils, a complementary product. We then pursued greater synergies by packaging our products ourselves, and today produce the plastic bottles in which our own products are sold. Maí«va Plast, created in 2006, produces plastic packaging. Both oil and plastic factories are located in Matola. In total we have five factories in the Maputo province, one under construction, and another in construction in Sofala.</p><p><span></span>And meanwhile, we have plantations in the province of Inhambane. We work to empower farmers through sunflower and soya production contracts, to supply the provinces of Manica and Sofala. Our goal is to reduce our raw material imports. If the agricultural industry is able to use locally sourced raw materials, we will be able to decrease the final consumer price. The future lies in agriculture.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our strategy is to ensure that our products have the right nutrients to meet Mozambican necessities widely among the population. Accordingly, we have introduced a range of products that respond to the economic reality of Mozambican families. We play an active role in helping the country, and being a leading nutrition, health and wellness company is precisely where we can add value. We want to be part of the socioeconomic development process and part of the solution is providing the right products to promote national health. Our intention is to support a better quality of life based on our products. We play an informative role on good nutrition, for example through our “Healthy Kids Program.“ We work with the Ministry of Education and teachers to provide modules, tools, and materials to teach good nutrition to foster healthy living.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Tropigalia is a nationwide distribution company, mainly for food and beverage products. We started 10 years ago with a vision of bringing market leader brands from Portugal to the Mozambican consumers. Over the years we have also expanded for into certain leading world brands. Meanwhile, our strategic priorities for the next five years include sustaining our market leadership in formal distribution. Added to this, we intend to expand and export our “Gourmet" brand, currently our 2nd biggest turnover generator with 272 select SKU's, from groceries, to refrigerated and frozen products. It is also a registered Tropigalia trademark in Mozambique.Meanwhile, in pursuit of investment resources for expansion, our company is going public in 2015. We must also invest in local production for the domestic and Southern African Development Community (SADC) market, which provides potential access to around 250 million consumers of products made in Mozambique for which no duties are paid. Today we are in the process of opening an industrial cluster with five agro-businesses to replicate earlier successes.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our priority is to sustain our investment, not just in terms of coverage, but also on quality. This includes services on voice, data, and image, because today we also have image services like mobile television. Our investment plan will exceed $200 million. Our market share is at around 28% to 30%. Maintaining this position requires the provision of excellent services to our clients, and also enlarging coverage area not just with voice services, but also data and image. Nowadays, smartphones have become ubiquitous and people demand image communication. First there was an increase in data services. For the voice services we introduced new packages, and subsequently we introduced TV services on the phone. We also pioneered mobile banking in Mozambique through the Mkesh service.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our main focus remains serving the country and expanding communications to everyone in Mozambique, to all social groups and to the remotest areas. We understand that by giving  people access to telecommunications, we are opening their horizons and possibilities for growth, thus  contributing to the development of the country. We started our implementation in rural areas by serving the un-served or underserved. About 30% of our clients had access to communications services for the first time with Movitel. We have not yet fulfilled our objective of total coverage, but we are almost there. For the present year the company tends to focus on the medium and high-income segment as well as corporate sector. It is time to address  other segments of the market, for which  creative services and solutions must be developed. The ICT sector provides many opportunities to better serve medium- and high-income clients, and it is an important component in corporate development. Access to good quality communication services is crucial.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Vodacom Moçambique is an integral part of Vodacom Group in southern Africa. Sharing borders with South Africa and Tanzania, which is connected to the Congo, allows us to serve as a link between the whole international group in southern Africa in physical terms, making us an important part of the picture. We have been gaining market share over the last year, primarily driven on the back of significant growth in our network. In 2013, we expanded our network by 70% with our largest-ever investment. In 2014, we have so far increased our network by 50%. I think that will make us the second-largest network in the whole country. We certainly cover all the major populated areas, and we are merging into the rural areas where people live.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>There has been significant economic growth due to the recent discovery of important resources, and a subsequent rise in demand for telecommunications services is evident. TDM is the main provider of infrastructure in Mozambique for landlines, mobile telephone services, and the internet. As such, TDM is an important player in terms of overall economic development, and is currently the sole player in terms of fixed-telecommunications services. Until 2010, TDM's network was by far the largest telecoms infrastructure in Mozambique; in 2008, all provincial capitals were linked through a national backbone transmission network using fiber-optic cables. This infrastructure allowed TDM to satisfy existing demand. In addition, TDM also provides an ADSL network for internet services on copper cable and a CDMA network for both voice and internet services in areas not covered by copper cables.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are looking to leverage our unique access to captive iron ore (our global resource inventory stands at three-quarters of a billion tons) and the locally-produced thermal coal to establish a vertically integrated, mine-mouth smelting operation producing iron and steel products. By-products of vanadium and possibly titanium will also be produced. Against a backdrop of slowing global economies and the flattening of Chinese development, Mozambique and the SADC region continue to enjoy strong growth rates of more than 7%. The demand for construction steel in Mozambique is growing very fast, driven by the commissioning of large-scale infrastructure, mining, LNG, and power projects. However, the country is entirely dependent on imports.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>I foresee the sector developing steadily. And despite the low price environment and logistics shortfalls the fact remains that the quality of the coal in Moatize is good. What is more, it is easy to extract, being at a shallow depth, unlike some deposits in, say, Queensland. Another point to consider is our proximity to the Asian market. In an international context, our geographical location renders us are closer to India, and it is that proximity that makes the Mozambican coal important. So I think business will develop, even if not to the extent we anticipate, and there will definitely be major growth over the next five years. Vale has already started doubling its capacity, and we are set to do so, too, as is Jindal; so while prices are indeed low, this means it is time to either optimize the scale of operations, or else pull out.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We completed the expansion works at the Moma mine in 2013 and have all but ramped up to full, expanded capacity, having invested approximately $400 million. With this expansion we have seen a significant QoQ rise in production since mid-2013. Overall expansion increased our capacity from 800,000 tons per year of ilmenite to 1.2 million tons. We export to around 35 countries, but the main ones are the US for ilmenite, Europe for zircon, and China for ilmenite and zircon. We will be renewing our mine concession in 2029, and have 100+ years of mine life. We would expect prices to recover quite strongly in 2015. We have a large deposit with considerable opportunities for further production.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The initial production plan is for 3 million tons per annum, yet in the international coal market over the past one and a half years prices have declined by 50%. Unless the market improves we cannot increase production. Having now decelerated we await improved market conditions. Among measures to adapt to prevailing conditions we recently terminated outsourced mining contracts. There are three aspects that we are still considering; one is the mining itself, another is processing, and the third is logistics. We have removed contractors from the mining component, in processing we have negotiated lower costs with our contractors, although not sufficiently. And meanwhile, logistics currently poses the greatest challenge, as our costs reflect the high volume of handling and re-handling, whereby around 45% of our cost structure is accounted for by logistics. We are discussing steps with the government to address these excess charges. It has adopted a highly sympathetic view, and a committee is in the process of studying the issue with a cost structure and comparing it to other countries such as South Africa. This will hopefully lead to lower logistics costs.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The main insurance companies in the market are in process of evaluating the new legal framework recently approved known as Special Regime of insurance and reinsurance for the Rovuma Basin, which appears to us at first glance, that isn't very clear and somehow contradictory. We as a whole consider important that the competent authorities must clarify of what in fact wants to be achieved with this specific legislation recently approved and seem to us that a strong message should be passed to the international investors about the importance for the country to have local insurers effectively involved in all insurances of the big projects particularly in the Rovuma Basin.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>I've been in insurance for 20 years, and about 12 or 13 of those years were in South Africa. What makes insurance in Mozambique so complicated is that although it is a country that is growing quickly, we are still struggling to keep up with what has happened in the past in other countries. Looking at the occupational diseases act and injuries at work, over here it is still underwritten by insurers in the form of worker's compensation insurance. It is definitely a different approach to insurance than what we have in South Africa. Mozambique is an exceptionally large country to live and work in, and to get something from the North to the South with the road networks not as good as they should be takes a massive amount of time. We do not have set offices, and that is definitely something different. We do not have a network of repairers, tow vehicles, and spare parts distributors. I think the absence of a settled service provider network is the key issue. You need to be able to source our things and get them to the client whenever they are needed.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The government has a regulatory and supervisory role. It has a new and dynamic approach and is bringing in a vision as to how companies must develop this industry. It is more aware of the insurance industry now. In the past, the government was much more concerned about the banking sector than the insurance sector. However, while the government authority is more active than before, there is still a long way to go.  Along with the insurance companies, brokers and other players in the sector, the government should ensure that it promotes the industry. Most people know very little about insurance products, besides motor insurance and workers' compensation. We have numerous large-scale projects where huge international companies are coming to Mozambique under specific agreements with the government, and insurance is a part of that. We have the capacity and a good insurance offering in the country. It is essential that our insurance regulator and the association lobby such that the majority of the business stays in Mozambique.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes in these environments it is up to the government to negotiate and attract big investors and the results will depend on the concessions they give. The jury is still out in terms of what is going to happen in the north with regards to the emerging oil and gas industry. We as the insurance industry received an urgent letter from the Ministry of Finance through the insurance association requesting our comments on the possible concession that the government was considering for the exploration area of oil and gas in the Rovuma basin. There was a proposal for these operators to be exempted from having to comply with local insurance legislation like all other companies that are locally based. Naturally, the insurance association was concerned about this trend and what it could trigger in other economic sectors. Furthermore, such a policy would be in contradiction to the official policy of the government of supporting local retention, in alignment with policies of other countries with major extractive industries.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our first priority lies in infrastructure. We want to improve our railway capacity, either through construction or maintenance of the existing infrastructure. Our intention is to widen the diversity of our cable TV products in TVCABO, offering optimum solutions and moving forward by paying close attention to market trends. We ensure that we are always able to offer the latest communications technologies available. Our main centers for real estate operations are in Maputo, Nampula, and Beira. We are engaged in both business and housing, and are in partnership with the Bank of Mozambique and Emose. This means that we manage the housing owned by both and, of course, we also try to introduce new land to the market. When it comes to tourism, we want hotels to attain higher standards in the key touristic areas of the country, and to improve our operations in Gorongosa. There is enormous potential for Mozambique to produce a diversity of goods in the textile industry for example, as well as in the furniture industry, although it is so important that the right technology and skills are available. For that reason it is necessary for people to be adequately trained in this type of work.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Everything is available here for investors, from infrastructure to fast-paced education and better roads. We also have manpower available to work, so if a company brings technology and training they can maximize their use of Mozambican workers. We also have fertile lands and water, as well as a strategic location on the western shore of the Indian Ocean. Mozambique has been growing for the past 15 years at a rate of 7% or 8% per annum, which clearly demonstrates a stable economy. Meanwhile, our strong democratic institutions are also an incentive to long term investors. Mozambique will succeed in developing a more diversified economy. The oil and gas segment should add value to the diversification processes of our economy, and will offer Intelec Holdings strong opportunities for sustained growth, in turn creating a sustainable corporation that able to contribute to employment, while adding value to the nation in broader terms. Intelec Holding's focus is on creating and exploring local opportunities. Agriculture was not our main focus at the outset, but we recognized that the country has fertile land and plentiful water supply, as well as the required non-skilled manpower.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The company was created by my great-great grandfather 117 years ago, and remains a 100% family-owned enterprise, with a 50% stake each held by my brother and I. We forecast 40% to 50% more revenue in 2015 given the numerous large-scale projects on our books, especially those in real estate. We are currently working on 20,000sqm of offices and a shopping center in central Maputo, which will be completed by the end of 2016. In the residential area in Maputo we started a 10-floor building featuring 11 luxury apartments. In the energy sector, we have a partnership with Petromoc wherein we sell petrol. We have three stations and we are building a fourth here in Maputo. And in the communications sector we are present through the newspaper Noticias, in which we are shareholders. We have a presence in the automotive business in nine of the 10 provinces, importing Mitsubishi and Fuso trucks, and Alfa Romeo and Fiat automobiles, as well as specialized vehicles for mining and other industries. In addition, our agricultural operations make us the largest taxpayer in the Niassa province. Mozambique is an extremely difficult market that does not promise rapid returns on investment. In order to enjoy these, a business must be prepared to invest in the country for at least five years.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have two products specifically directed at the construction and real estate sector. One is aimed at construction activities where risk is characteristically high. When firms decide to build in Mozambique using the bank's money, the cost of the apartments or the building itself rises, making it difficult to compete in the market. They are more cost efficient when they utilizing their own money, so we try to assist them in the short term by supporting their financial base and, at the same time, making them more efficient. The other product we offer relates to mortgages. Our operations are also linked to the national growth of SMEs. We signed an agreement with the African Guarantee Fund, the African Development Bank, USAID and IFC, and are sharing our clients' risk with these multilateral entities. In doing so, we reduce our lending rates offered to clients, the ultimate beneficiaries of these credit lines.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The construction and real estate sector is among the many sectors we support. We have a full package designed with property developers, whom we support right from the construction phase up until sale to the end-buyer. The country is vast, and you cannot compare the real estate market in Maputo with that in the north of the country or the midlands. I would say there are three basic markets in terms of real estate in Mozambique. You have Maputo, which is the main city and also a mature market. Then you have what I call the second segment, comprising emerging cities including Beira, Nacala, Nampula, Tete, and Pemba. Those five cities are today under pressure to grow, which presents a huge opportunity for investors. Then there is the third segment, namely the remaining cities, which is not yet a particularly exciting prospect. As a result, diverse packages need to be designed to support activity in these segments. At the retail banking level, we forecast GDP growth of around 8% over the coming years, which promise much opportunity for the financial system. Less than 18% of the population is banked, so we have to find ways to bring that population into the system, and to service them. We also need to devise means of assisting domestic SMEs to grow, and to make sure that the populated rural areas are covered.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Mozambique is not only seeing investment in residential property, but also commercial and infrastructure as a whole to include roads, bridges, schools, and hospitals. This is positive, and banks have a role to play in terms of financing the construction itself, or else in the purchase of residential properties. BancABC is quite active in this, and in dealing with numerous construction companies in mortgage financing. We recently launched a mortgage product for retail customers, which was innovative in that it could potentially provide more people access to housing. Competition among the banks is forcing us to innovate new products to find fresh avenues for income and customer service. We definitely need new players, and a diversification of the financial sector, with insurance and pension funds being a good example.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are part of Coca-Cola, which is a franchise bottler, and we have seven franchises across Africa. In Mozambique we have the franchise for the entire country. In terms of volume, it is on par with our business in Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda, and the returns enable us to invest in the market and develop infrastructure. Per capita consumption across the country is at 25 liters per capita, but as the country becomes richer, higher disposable incomes will lead to greater consumption of beverages. In 2014, we launched our water, Bonaqua, and have plans to launch into other beverage segments. We will continue to drive our range as well as continuing to innovate in terms of flavors and packs. Certainly, with the capacity that we are set to have in Maputo, the capacity we introduced in 2013 in Chimoio, and our plans for Nampula, we are excited about the huge potential of this market.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>On a global basis we have operations in 180+ countries. What makes Mozambique unique to British American Tobacco (BAT) is its classification as a high growth potential market. This is driven by several environmental factors within the country. The first is that Mozambique has a population base of over 24 million people, and when we look at ongoing developments in the country, we see the economic circumstances of citizens are improving rapidly. As consumers' disposable income improves, there is an improvement not just in total sales volumes, but also in the brand mix that consumers decide to purchase, with notable growth envisaged for the premium offers. The second unique area within Mozambique is that there is a significant population below the age of 18, which means we'll have a significant number of consumers coming of age, while the consumer business is envisaged to increase as people start having better livelihoods. Last year we contributed in excess of $35 million to the government as a combination of all taxes.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>With our operations starting in Zambia and eventually moving on to the headquarters in South Africa, Mozambique was considered a gateway for growth in Africa for Tata. We started with the representation of Tata Motors Limited (TML) and also sell vehicles manufactured by TML in Mozambique. As a strategy it was a sound decision to start off with the vehicles, although now we represent other companies of the Tata group. Given the challenges inherent to the Mozambican market, we opted for an incremental growth strategy where the first step was to build brand visibility. What we want to do from now on is secure a larger presence through representation of other group companies and to take the Tata brand forward in Mozambique. Having said that, we have now diversified into other businesses in Mozambique such as pharmaceuticals, steel trading, consumer durables, and chemicals. We have also developed a relationship with Vale through group company Voltas Engineering Services, which has contracts to maintain and service mining equipment owned by the company.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our footprint in Mozambique dates back more than 60 years. Since 1951, it has included major reference projects such as Africa's first operational control center for the railway connection between the capital Maputo and Ressano Garcia. This is why we believe there is a legacy that binds us together and creates an environment favorable to do business in Mozambique, while we keep supporting the country development has done so far. In the past, we have partnered work on the prominent Cahora Bassa project. And as in the past we are ready to work on new projects and challenges in the energy sector and keep writing a page in the country's history. The production of gas discovered off the coast of Mozambique will emerge as an important area for innovation. Siemens possesses the know-how, products, solutions, and services necessary to help its customers to extract these resources safely and efficiently. Our gas turbines are the most efficient in the world.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Kazakhstan has the most stable political and investment favorable climate in the region. Around 4% of the country's GDP is spent on healthcare, and there is a growing pace of state investment in the healthcare sector. The overall vision for the health system is reflected in the State Health Care Development Program for 2011—2015 and the Strategic development plan of the Republic of Kazakhstan till 2020. One of the targets of the 2020 development program is to raise life expectancy from 62-63 to 73: this is a good target and could be achieved given certain special health care reforms, which should concentrate on the prophylaxis of disease, which includes immunization of the population.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our main business lies in the distribution of medical supplies. We have reached certain success in this area and can call ourselves the number one distributor on Kazakhstan market. At the moment we are working on a vertically integrated structure for our company, aimed at our presence on all the sectors of pharmaceutical business, from manufacturing to retail. Our project for manufacturing of medical supplies is in the process of its realization, and we hope to start the validation of a manufacturing system next year. Our structure also includes a retail company. In two years, we are planning to double the number of our pharmacies and complete the project of a national retail network. At the moment we boast the largest branch network in Kazakhstan.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Kazakhstan has become attractive to the pharmaceutical industry companies that decided to start manufacturing here. There is real support from the government for local producers of pharmaceutical products, meaning that they do not have to pay certain taxes. If you export your products to another country, there may be some problems, as the firms are strongly encouraged to sell their products to the state. SK Pharmacy is the sole distributor for the Ministry of Health, and has signed a contract with local producers, which will last seven years. Several major international companies were established in Shymkent and Almaty, and there are Russian producers working out of Karaganda. This segment will continue to expand as Kazakhstan has committed serious investment to pharmaceutical manufacturing and the pharmaceutical business. For us, and for other pharmaceutical companies, Kazakhstan has become attractive. In all of Central Asia, only Kazakhstan has a comprehensive reimbursement program. We have a number of high-tech products in pharmaceuticals, oncology, and other areas.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Getz Pharma's mission is to develop,  produce, and market safe, effective, and quality medicines that will improve the health and quality of life of men, women, and children. As a new company, we registered only 11 products in Kazakhstan. Now, our business is worth more than $2 million per year in Kazakhstan. Our tender business has been growing from year-to-year, but last year's devaluation has influenced our business, of course. Moreover the government is also giving priority to local manufacturers for tenders which is understandable, but our strategy is to deliver more and more modern and effective medications to a Kazakhstan reimbursement system with reasonable prices. We offer products for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, bronchitis, asthma, allergy, and obesity. We also have antibiotics. The retail market is oriented towards American and Western European companies. The culture is that whatever is manufactured in Europe  is estimated as the top-class. Now, according to changing situations, people cannot afford to buy only innovator's brands, and people prefer to buy generics from Eastern Europe, Russia, and Belarus.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>All the products that we offer are compliant with European safety standards. Our vehicles also have numerous safety systems, such as advanced breaking, or a system that helps control the truck and wakes the driver if the truck veers out of its lane. Environmental safety is another side of the story when it comes to the trucks that we sell, and our oil and used parts must be disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner. Whenever possible, the waste that is being produced is recycled. MAN also mandates the professional training of our staff. Our mechanics are continuously trained, and the company makes this investment so that our clients have complete peace of mind when it comes to their own investments and safety. Like any healthy company, we have our ambitions. The company wants to grow and maintain our leading position in the national market. MAN has everything necessary to achieve this goal; a good team, a high-quality product, and the transfer of knowledge and services to our clients. In concrete terms, we want to increase our sales volume, as well as the amount of vehicles being produced, and we want to expand our service capacity in the country.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The biggest share of our sales in Kazakhstan is the long haul business, basically long-distance transportation. In the long term, we're also targeting the construction and mining business. These two segments will expand in parallel and also with the overall growth of Kazakhstan's economy. The long haul segment will continue to grow because of Kazakhstan's importance and position as a transit country between China, Russia, and Europe. We expect that segment to grow, especially with the completion of new roads. The roads on the Chinese and Russian sides are not fully completed and the roads in Kazakhstan will require even more time. But the potential and current entrepreneurs here know that once that connection is made and once that transportation infrastructure is in place, they will start transporting goods in large volume, and there will be a keen need for good long-haul vehicles. Furthermore, Kazakhstan will solidify its status as the main transportation and logistical hub of this region. From Volvo's perspective, it's all about uptime. Our vehicles are advanced, and we know through our high-tech capabilities how to avoid truck breakdowns, by constantly monitoring the condition of the vehicle, which gives us a significant edge.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>President Nazarbayev said that developing a qualified workforce is a high priority for the country.  There are more and more ambitious young people with good basic knowledge available on the market but the Scania-specific knowledge we have transferred ourselves. We provide, our colleagues with all kinds of training using Scania's global training program. The training is partly organized in Kazakhstan, and partly at Scania's training-facilities in Russia, Sweden, or the Netherlands. Additionally, we bring knowledge to the country. We have some experienced Scania colleagues working with us here in Kazakhstan that we brought in from abroad to help us implement local standards, to teach and develop the existing human capital. Training for Scania is fundamental, and it is as important as personnel. Scania opened its first office in Kazakhstan in 2005, but the real operations started in 2007. Kazakhstan's geographic location is excellent, and we believe that the road transport between China and Russia and Europe will leverage this situation. The Silk Road is the backbone of the transport business, and, moreover, the country is economically and politically stable. The confluence of these factors makes Kazakhstan one of the most important players in Central Asia.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>All our products are certified according to international standards. At this stage there are two types of cement that are used—dry and the wet cement. Most of our production capacity is of the wet method. However, all the new production capacities that we are adding is for dry method concrete, because those are more energy efficient, and more economical in terms of volume. All the local producers are colleagues, but also competitors in some sense. In this regard, the modernization and optimization of our production capacity is to keep up with the high level of competition.  We continually invest in updating and modernizing our production capacities. We have recently invested a lot into improving our technology, which improves the technological process of manufacturing. This allows us to be at the forefront of the industry, and keeps us competitive.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Half of all the cars produced worldwide contain Sika products.  Considering that automobile manufacturing in the heart of Central Asia is growing at remarkable rate, we expect the size and sophistication of our operations here to expand. We are in contact with Asia Auto, as they are building new factories at the moment and we are currently negotiating with them. Our company plans to develop the automotive segment in the future. We are in touch with production chains and locomotive factories in Astana. Sika provided them samples last year, however they still have to activate production this year. We are expecting great capacities from Asia Auto's new factories, but it will be at the end of this year, or the start of 2016. We will sell them silicon, mastics, and fixing materials. The construction sector is our real bread and butter. From foundation to roofing, we can supply most of the materials. For construction, we can start from the beginning to the end. Our clients are both private and public, and we work with the whole industry. Perhaps 80% of our business is in construction. Last year, 20-25% of our sales were in Astana, but in the next two years we expect it will reach 50-60% because of Expo.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The real estate and construction market in Kazakhstan is currently booming. As far as the construction sector is concerned, by 2020 Kazakhstan will become the second largest market in the CIS and Eastern Europe region, second only to Russia. This country is an important market, despite the hard times we faced in 2008 and 2009. Hilti is committed to establishing a sustainable business in Kazakhstan. The Energy Sector is a pillar of the national economy. The oil and gas business is of significant importance to us. Not only do we manufacture power tools, we also sell a lot of very specific products designed for the oil and gas industry. If you look at the oil and gas industry from the power tool sector, for us it is about 13% of potential volume. The rest is from specific projects that come from our engineers such as installation systems, fire stopping products, anchors and direct fastening systems. We work very closely with the key oil and gas companies in the west of the country. As for mining we are focused mainly on uranium by providing solutions to the mining industries.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Kazakhstan is the ninth largest country in the world, and the two leading cities in the hospitality industry here are Almaty (the former capital) and Astana (the new capital). Almaty attracts more people probably because it has a longer history than Astana. However, Astana's potential is significant. Astana has gone from nowhere to having seven international chain hotels. The Marriott only opened in August 2014, and I think the potential is significant because of the willingness of the government to capitalize on events such as Expo 2017. You cannot create an event like Expo 2017 without having a solid network of hotels. The hotels create an attraction for certain events, and economic potential. Once the visa process becomes easier, and it is more convenient to access Kazakhstan by air, this will help to make the country even more attractive. The fact that Astana is a new city has managed to generate a buzz. Kazakhstan's President has a very clear vision, and not a short-term one.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>I have been here for the past 20 years, and when I first arrived there were no five-star hotels. I am proud of Kazakhstan; all of my department heads are local, including the chef. All of them have an international profile, they studied in Switzerland or in the UK, and they are perfectly fluent in English with excellent training. We just shape them to give them the mentality and hospitality standards of the Hilton. In the hospitality industry, especially here in Kazakhstan, human resources are the most important element. We provide around 8,000-9,000 different training courses in many languages including Mandarin, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish. The entire staff has access to, and the right to take, these training courses. There is some mandatory training of course, but there are optional courses as well if they want to develop themselves; we are investing time and money on our staff. We are investing in our human capital.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The hospitality industry in Kazakhstan is developing. Back in 1997 in Kazakhstan, there were only two international hotels, the Hyatt Regency and the Regent Hotel, which have now been re branded as the Inter Continental Hotel. There were no other establishments that could be viewed as international hotels, and today, there are approximately 6,000 rooms, running from two-star non-branded accommodation to five-star suites. Moreover, there are approximately 1,000 new rooms under construction that will be on the market in the next year and a half. The room supply has increased notably, and will continue to do so. The new visa regime launched by Kazakhstan last year is also helping the country to attract new investors as a developing and promising country for the hotel industry, and we are mostly receiving business travelers—the leisure sectors have yet to become relevant to the accommodation industry. If Kazakhstan invests, then its role will increase.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Five-star resort service is growing in Kazakhstan. In Astana, we are looking forward to the opportunities of 2017, but the government should consider what will happen after once Expo closes in September 2017. I consider Astana to be a fast-growing city with a multimillion dollar budget, and there are many opportunities for us in terms of business to expand and constantly improve our service in the atmosphere of healthy competition, especially considering Expo 2017. I believe that there is a great opportunity to continue making Astana an ideal place for events, fairs, conferences for software, and even a place for large and specific expos to take place four or five times a year in Central Asia. Currently, there is nothing like that in terms of large expositions in this part of the world.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Astana is a fast-growing city and is one of our target markets—it is in our strategic development plan. We have a very good understanding of how the local Almaty market works. It is essential to know the market properly to come up with a good product or service. A factor that requires consideration is the market segment we will operate in for Astana. As for Almaty, the market volume is as great as in Astana. However, given that there are 1.5 million people living in Almaty, and 800,000 to 850,000 people living in Astana, the demand is not the same in terms of quantity. Nevertheless, Almaty's market is very saturated, whereas the demand for housing and so the prices have been growing much faster in Astana.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The FDI level in Kazakhstan is increasing. Looking at the past six or seven years, it has grown steadily, year on year. The real estate and construction sector will surely develop and bring in many international investors thanks to the many international events and government programs, such as the 2011-20 Housing and Utilities Sector Modernization Programme, Expo 2017, or the Affordable Housing 2020 Programme. These programs provide stimulus to the real estate market not only in Astana or Almaty, but also throughout the entire region. My day-to-day operations are connected to the commercial real estate market only, so that is why preparations for the Expo seem the most interesting to me.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The devaluation most certainly has affected both the demand andthe offer. The real estate market reacted accordingly; we saw a minor increase in construction costs. Subsequently, the offer in the real estate market became more costly. For a certain period the buyer demand decreased, but later on returned to normal. By the end of 2014, the situation started changing again in view of another devaluation, which affected both the construction costs and the demand for real estate. In 2015 we will focus on the projects we started in 2014. We have quite a large volume of work on our table. We will certainly have new projects as well, and in the near future, we are bringing some new projects to Almaty. If we come across interesting projects in other regions we will definitely consider participating in them.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In terms of the trends, you have to understand that Kazakhstan is a very big country. If we compare Almaty and Astana, for example, in Almaty the seismic activity defines the market and makes it quite different than Astana. Concrete constructions are being used for buildings that can withstand earthquakes up to nine on the Richter scale, which obviously is reflected in the pricing as well. In Almaty, the pricing policy is also defined by a strong continental climate, as it is very cold in the winter and very hot in the summer. Subsequently, appreciation of construction and equipment costs takes place, which provides comfort of living in difficult climatic conditions. Almaty is a huge city. It's a megapolis. Recently, we have seen an increase in demand for real estate, especially when it comes to residential real estate. We see an increase in foreigners coming and buying apartments here.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The money the government is putting into the healthcare sector is acceptable in my opinion and it is not just going into consulting, but also into hospitals, systems, and processes. Kazakhstan has restructured its healthcare governance. What was the Ministry of Health is now the Ministry of Healthcare and Social Development. In my mind, that is a prudent transition, because the two are connected. Social development has to be a part of health care and vice versa. In 2015 we will be able to evaluate how the transition performed, and by all indications it is going to do well. The issue in Kazakhstan is that citizens do not do a very good job at taking care of their own health. We do not exercise enough, we do not watch what we eat, and that leads to cardiovascular disease, which is largely preventable with exercise and diet. We need to use exercise and dietary discretion as medicine instead of tablets and injections. That said, there is also progress being made in this area.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>It is cheaper and easier, in fact, to treat diseases at an earlier stage and prevent certain diseases. In doing so, we can avoid hospitalizing the patient, a process that can end up being quite costly. To help avoid many of these expenditures, HealthCity is dedicated to the early diagnosis of disease. Our facilities have been designed for patients who are interested in monitoring their health over the long term. That is, for people who want to invest in their health. People are welcome to visit and receive a comprehensive diagnostic package. Instead of traveling to South Korea or Europe, for example, they can receive reliable medical services in Kazakhstan. Family and pediatric medicine, and diagnostics for women are our fields of specialization and cover a wide range of preventive services that can save patients time and money in the long run. The goal is to start moving away from the outdated Soviet medical approach, and adopt a proactive—rather than reactive—style of healthcare.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our national program “Salamatty“ is being spread not only by the government, but also by private sector. Every single patient has the right to choose which hospital they will be treated at. The difference is that public clinics have funding from the government, which we do not receive. However, we can still bid for government tenders. For example, nowadays cardiology is very important in Kazakhstan. Also, extracorporeal fertilization—and we take part in these programs.  Our hospital works to fully integrate itself into the national health program, even though we do not have access to the main budget. There is a widespread assumption these days that private healthcare is an alternative to public healthcare, but this is not the case. Like education, the private sector occupies just 10% of the overall healthcare sector. Out of this 10%, around 80% of practices are represented by dentistry. Establishments like ours, scientific institutes and medical centers, are extremely rare. Today, private hospitals are usually small enterprises with a very narrow area of focus.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The healthcare sector in general rates quite positively. The government spends time and attention on providing healthcare, especially in the rural regions, and not just in major cities like Almaty and Astana. There are more and more cardio centers. The number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing over the years. There are an increasing number of programs that are related to different aspects of health. They are also integrated with international health programs. There are a number of research centers that are focusing on neurological and cardio issues for which, in the past, people had to travel abroad to receive treatment. One of the huge shortages in Kazakhstan is in oncology treatment. This is something the government is working hard to address. Kazakhstan certainly has potential, and the government is doing a lot to improve the qualifications and training for doctors, as well as introducing new technology to improve healthcare. There was a period during the 1990s when many doctors left the country or changed careers. But in the last couple of years the government has been working hard to promote training for doctors.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>International investment is playing an important role in the development of health services here. Competition is the drive of improvement and hence, growth of the private medical sector is essential, first of all for encouraging competition and improving the quality of provided services. For example, quite a few years ago all the healthcare facilities in Turkey were state-owned, but recently the number of private medical companies have grown which resulted in higher service quality standards across the country. We are now witnessing similar changes in Kazakhstan. The private sector is more flexible in addressing the challenges, we're able to introduce new methods and solutions much faster.  That's what leads to positive changes in the sector. Sema Hospital spent over $10 million on equipment for the hospital. Our hospital is using the latest American, German, Japanese and European technologies. We're also representing Fatih University, one of the top Turkish universities, which runs hospitals throughout Turkey.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>High economic growth opportunities and low insurance penetration in Kazakhstan point to large growth opportunities. It is important to understand who is buying insurance in Kazakhstan. The largest customer is the corporate sector; we call these legal entities such as big oil companies, banks, some producing companies, malls, and similar entities. As for individuals, only the middle class buys insurance here. The population has not accumulated any wealth or anything they could lose. People don't buy earthquake insurance because they expect the government to help them out. It will take years to develop insurance culture in order to motivate individuals to buy more insurance products or just to understand the role these products play in the success of their business. There is compulsory third-party motor vehicle liability insurance here, and everybody has to buy it. However, Eurasia is not extensively involved in this business. We prefer to work with voluntary lines of insurance such as property, property damage, business interruption, machinery failure, aviation, marine, satellite, construction risk, erection risk, and ecology. Compulsory lines of business are, unfortunately, not profitable. Eurasia benefited from its international expansion. Having a presence in such emerging markets as China and India presents an opportunity for Eurasia not just to support its performance but also to successfully withstand the soft cycle.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There are now many local car factories in Kazakhstan that produce vehicles for major car brands, such as Toyota. This growth in the number of cars on the road affects the growth of the insurance industry. At Kompetenz, we try to educate our customers about the advantages of choosing comprehensive insurance over the minimal compulsory insurance that only covers the driver's limited liability. Here there is great potential because Kazakhstani people love their cars. As traffic becomes more intense, accidents will increase. When you compare our road conditions with Russia, for example, they have a claims ratio of up to 90%; we still have 30%, which works to our advantage. In 2014 we pushed hard to develop our retail insurance lines, whereas in 2013 our operations were 90% corporate and 10% retail. Over the year, we increased our retail and SME representation to 40% of our portfolio, bringing our corporate representation down to 60%. In comparison, our net premiums this year have already risen by 30-40%. The harmonization of the legal system is one of my main ambitions for the next three years; the law on insurance was drawn up 15 or 20 years ago, and a rapidly changing environment requires new approaches. We want to emulate the best practices on the market and use them to build our own system here in Kazakhstan. This involves opening more capacity in the national insurance market.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>There are about 34 companies in the market, five of which are life insurance companies, while the rest are other types of insurance companies. Within those, there are giant companies such as Eurasia, Kaspi, and BTA, which work internationally and perform reinsurance—they are not direct competitors. The direct competition is the middle segment, where you have Amanat Insurance, Almaty, and London Almaty Insurance, and their strategy is similar in terms of development; but the advantage that Standard has is its path, growth rates, and the progress that the company is making. When we acquired Standard from Astana Finance, we took a number of precautionary measures. Our investment portfolio is very liquid, and very diversified; we do not have non-liquid bonds. At the moment, about 50% of our investments are dollar investments, and our balance is in gain. Of course, the devaluation had an effect on the economy. For example, salaries and some of the other expenses had to be adjusted based on the indexes, but in general we were not negatively affected. In terms of sales, the plan is to sell over KZT5 billion worth of insurance in 2015. We are also looking forward to working with reinsurance, both locally and internationally, as well as finishing the automation process that started two years ago. Of course, we will keep working on developing new projects. The development of family insurance will be another segment to cover and we also plan to work actively on international insurance.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Overall, it was challenging year. A strong start in January was followed by the event on February 11 that induced us to make new plans for the new reality. The devaluation that took place has definitely affected both the B2C and B2B sectors. Moreover, given the historically strong relations we have with Russia, the situation there has also impacted overall development. Nevertheless, thanks to corrective measures, strong relations with partners, and, first of all, the dedication of every team member, we secured our leading position in the B2C segment and realized a number of important projects in the B2B area. Here, I'd like to especially underline the positive dynamics demonstrated by the healthcare team. This year we are going to fight to win back market share, sales, and reinforce our position in the market. For instance, we suffered some headwinds in kitchen appliances. It is not possible to win all the battles, and this is why we do not prioritize.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Penetration rates compared to the population is in the range of 170% to 180%, but that's based on active SIM cards, which means that some people might not have mobile phones, but some people might have three or four SIM cards. The smartphone penetration rate is still growing. It's still less than 30% according to our statistics. This means that many feature phone users are still migrating to smartphones. This became a major trend last year and this migration will keep continuing, maybe for another two or three years. We are heavily focused on the smartphone market to move basic phone users to smartphones. In terms of 2015, we intend to strengthen our position in the enterprise market and continue our leadership in the Kazakhstani consumer electronics market by introducing new products that will further push the boundaries of innovation and bring new experiences to our consumers, enriching their lives. We will stay true to our commitment of bringing meaningful innovation and inspiring experiences to consumers by introducing new groundbreaking products.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In my opinion, the interest in ICT in Kazakhstan is quite high. Dealing with a wide range of representatives from various branches and sectors in Kazakhstan, we are convinced of this. And this is not just the interest of window shoppers. It is absolutely clear for everyone that it is impossible to organize effective management and production processes without modern ICT, and this applies to both commercial and government organizations. We, as a company that has traditionally been at the forefront of innovations, clearly feel the challenges of the market and try to meet the expectations of our existing and potential customers and partners. A feature of Kazakhstan is that the local market craves innovation. Acquisition and continuous updating of knowledge, including ICT, is a priority for the representatives of the market. In turn, we, as the representatives of one of the largest technological corporations, use our experience and knowledge to make this happen.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The IT sector is growing quickly in the country. There is a lot of investment in IT infrastructure projects because the government and state bodies understand the importance of IT. The Ministry is also supporting a lot of initiatives, and we have had a number of talks with local institutions about the future development of the country. Nazarbayev University is playing an important part in these activities as well. Cisco initiated its presence in Kazakhstan when the first Russian office was set up. After that, the value and potential in the market became even more apparent, so the local office was set up. We have a lot of people working here and we continue to hire. There are two offices, in Almaty and Astana. We see Astana as a point of growth, so we continue to invest heavily in the capital. Our future is there. An important part of our activity here over the last 10 years has been the establishment of Cisco Academies. This is innovation in the sense of education. We teach teachers, and we support them with teaching materials. This allows universities to offer courses to students and issue Cisco certificates.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The history of our company started with a single helicopter. It was the first foreign-manufactured helicopter in Kazakhstan. Soon afterwards the shareholders decided to start an aviation company, because according to the law of Kazakhstan all helicopters, including the ones that are used in rescue missions and commercial flights, can only be put into exploitation if owned by an airline company. Today, the company owns and uses 13 helicopters and two airplanes manufactured abroad (Eurocopter, Bell, Cessna). Our aircrafts provide private (VIP transfers, tourist flights) and government-oriented services. For example, we work with the Ministry of Agriculture in their forestry department, with the Ministry of Health we provide ambulance aviation services. Our company also collaborates with large oil, gas, and energy companies, monitoring gas pipelines and powerlines, and with the Geological committee that uses our aircraft for aerogeophysical research. We also work with the Ministry of Emergency Situations and make flyovers to explore mountain lakes around the Almaty region to determine their congestion or conduct search and rescue operations. When it comes to private sector, we take our visitors to visit scenic landmarks in the Almaty region, of which we have around 20 standard routes, or we can offer individually-designed routes at the request of our customers. Quite often, clients require urgent VIP transportation for long distances, to Taldykorgan, Bishkek, Issyk-Kul, and Taraz.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Internally, Western Kazakhstan is promising. The Atyrau area is not well served. The European blacklist has restricted it because the flights that go from here to Atyrau also connect onto Amsterdam. The scope to develop that area has been very limited. Every so often, new operators enter the market. They try to challenge Air Astana on these routes. What I admire about Air Astana is that they hold their ground. They do what they are good at. I know from experience, from talking and working with Air Astana that safety is a very high priority for them. An increase in the number of international airlines that service Kazakhstan would invigorate the sector as well, not just to Almaty but also to Astana. Whether it is through the hub and spoke model, where airlines fly into Kazakhstan and then fly somewhere else, or just serve Europe, Asia, and the Middle East from Kazakhstan, any such developments spell good news.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Only recently since the financial crisis of 2008 has business aviation in Kazakhstan gradually recovered, and Jet Airlines was one of the pioneers in the segment, being established in 2004. Abdullatip Issaev (current CEO of Jet Airlines) and I worked in this company before, for different periods from 2004 to 2009. The company's key goal back in those days was to manage a fleet of the corporate jets owned by shareholders mostly for their corporate needs. The first jets that the company owned were two Tupolev-134s used in passenger aviation, but reconfigured by the manufacturer into corporate jets with luxury interiors. As we started operating those jets, we realized that the operating costs in terms of flight hours was too high due to fuel consumption. The age of the planes was something that worried our shareholders, too, as both of the jets were over 20 years old. Hence, we began developing alternative programs for our shareholders and started considering foreign jets that were a lot more economical. We were the first in Kazakhstan to acquire directly from the manufacturers and operate the Cessna Citation X, the Hawker 850XP, and the Hawker Beechcraft Premier IA jets, and that was a great a success. We are now providing consultancy services and were the first to bring in the Gulfstream G200 jet for one of the big local banks.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We started the business in 1998 with a focus on VIP charter flights. We focus on VIP Charters we started in 1998. Re-oriented in 2011 for scheduled regular flights. We started out with a mix of Soviet and other foreign aircraft, such as Yakovlev-40, Falcon-20, Bac1-11, and Tu-154. Starting in 2011, we began our regular flights. Our first aircraft on these routes was a Fokker 100, the perfect vehicle for this region because it has enough range and fuel space, and optimal passenger capacity, and is much cheaper than new aircraft. We started with just one aircraft in 2011, and now we have six. In March we expect to obtain one more, and by the end of this year we want to take in at least two more to increase our fleet. The goal is to make Bek Air less costly. At the moment, we are still facing some obstacles to operating a low-cost airline. The economy and mentality of Kazakhstan needs to change. For example, the passengers do not understand if we charge extra for luggage, which is central to this business model. Passengers should gradually get used to such a service.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>There are 18 Air Charter Service (ACS) offices worldwide, and we are the youngest, although not the smallest. Before relocating here, our company had operated out of Moscow, but as the number of flights and clients from Kazakhstan increased, the need for a separate office here grew. ACS Kazakhstan works in three directions, namely business aviation, commercial aviation, and cargo charters. Business aviation and private jet flights used to be our biggest service when we opened our branch office in Kazakhstan three years ago. Now we also work in commercial jets, although they are still the smallest part of our local business. The third area, and now the fastest-growing business for us, is cargo charter. The cargo charter business that we undertake is quite complicated. Most clients go to logistics companies, which can provide similar services as us, but we deal with more complicated projects and businesses, which the other players in the market refuse to do. These are mostly oversized cargo, dangerous goods, or goods being shipped to dangerous destinations, some extraordinary cargo, and cargo that is extremely urgent. These services are needed by all sectors. We do not concentrate on any one sector per se, but most of our clients for these unconventional shipments are in telecoms and the oil and gas industries. For the moment we have only five brokers, three of whom are working on private jet charters. We have two people on the cargo side, and we're planning on hiring more brokers this year.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The large energy consuming companies, for example KazMunaiGas, are obligated to do a yearly energy audit, and we are helping them by providing these energy audits. We have received the accreditation for these audits; however, we do not want to limit ourselves to energy audits. AKEE is already developing additional complex mapping of energy consuming processes in order to find—through the use of analytical methodology—large energy saving solutions. This advanced service is not available today in Kazakhstan through any domestic entities, but available worldwide. We are now bringing these services and the associated methodology into the local market. Our current constraint is that in Kazakhstan, there is a noticeable lack of engineers that have been trained to apply this methodology, but with a two-year training process, a solution is not far off.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Alternative power engineering is one of the main priorities in development of the company for the next three years. Now we perform works on the construction of the solar power station, the largest in Central Asia, in Zhambyl region with projected capacity of 50 MW. Now we are negotiations with several investors for future projects with a general capacity of 180 MW. There are four projects on the construction of solar power stations, also one of the new projects is an offshore wind and solar power plant in the Caspian Sea, and another is a wind power plant in the Central Kazakhstan. We also have experience in hydro energy, but here there is little demand in Kazakhstan, therefore we aren't focused on it now. Today we work with 14 manufacturing partners in green energy. We pay great attention to training of our employees who pass regular training on production enterprises abroad. Now we have wide experience in designing and construction in this area. We are one of the few companies in Kazakhstan that has a really strong knowledge base in green energy.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are actively participating in the renewable energy program. Most of such incentives are run in the Zhambyl region in southern Kazakhstan; there are a significant number of solar projects there. We are currently discussing the possibility of getting involved there with an investor from France. We have also signed the MoUs and all the necessary documentation with a Portuguese company, EFACEC. In fact, Alageum Electric is participating in the World Expo 2017 together with EFACEC. This company has huge experience in setting up solar, wind, and hydropower stations. EFACEC transfers to us their technologies and documentation and provides training for our employees, so that we are able to manufacture their products here in Kazakhstan. Thus, the local content of the products manufactured here will be 60%. The most important component of a solar power station is the inverter system. We are developing our capacities to produce inverter systems for both the domestic and international market.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>EUROBAK was established in 1999 by a number of European companies present at the time in Kazakhstan, and was supported by the EU delegation and a number of embassies of European countries. The main objective of the association is to represent a collective voice of the business community. For now, we have over 150 members, including 30 consulates and embassies from European countries and worldwide. EUROBAK represents European, Kazakhstani, and multinational companies. We stage different types of events, such as meetings with government officials, workshops, working groups and committees, as well as networking events. EUROBAK is one platform where government, businesses, and diplomatic communities can meet. It also plays an active role in promoting Kazakhstan as an attractive investment destination. I believe that it is up to the government to make Kazakhstan more attractive, for example, the rule of law is an important factor for investors when making a decision to work in the country. We are meeting on a regular basis with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Ministers, where we present the issues that are necessary to address to enhance investment climate and remove trade barriers. Overall, we are very happy to see that there are some extremely positive changes that the government is now introducing.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have been focusing on the resource base, and also believe that vertically integrated holdings are not the right way to go. Instead, we focus on what we know, and create infrastructure around our line of work. Raimbek combines the kind of work that I do as businessman and as an advisor to the Prime Minister. This helps the company evolve, and is what we are focusing on right now. Diversification has been very important for our economy since the first day of independence, but unfortunately the problem has not been solved yet. Oil and gas is something that Kazakhstan is known for. However, we don't give up and we are still looking for the possibilities for diversification. At this point we have identified agriculture, processing, and transit potential, as well as ecotourism. Of course, it is always better to sell petrochemical products as opposed to crude oil, or heavy equipment as opposed to metal. In terms of Raimbek Group, our strategy does not revolve just around Kazakhstan. We also have facilities in China, as well as CIS countries and the Caucasus, and our products are being sold in these regions as well. Kazakhstan has potential for zonal expansion as it is politically stable, and its geographical position is also very good. Raimbek is focusing on its resource base, and concentrating on three areas.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>It is easier to find an investor for projects starting from $10 million, and more effort is required to attract a smaller investment. However, it is still possible, and we are currently using an investment company who helps us with our search. We are confident in the success of our regional projects because mining is one of the priority industries in Kazakhstan, and it gets a lot of attention from the Government. The drilling rods that we are going to produce are a product without which drilling is impossible. Our rods will be made of high-quality steel like those currently imported from Europe, but will be offered at a much lower price as the rods will be produced locally. Success is almost guaranteed. This is an opportunity to start discussions with investors as well. Obviously, the mining industry of Kazakhstan has great potential—Kazakhstan has a large mineral resource base. Mining is a strategic sector of the national economy and therefore receives considerable investments from the state. The market is also making a comeback, following its downturn, thus providing opportunities for companies like LSH to grow with the industry and with the country as a whole.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Carlsberg has a brewery in Kazakhstan and distributors all around the country. In every region of Kazakhstan we have more than one distributor. Carlsberg Kazakhstan is growing, and covers all regions with a population of more than 10,000 people. We have our dedicated sales team working on more distributors. In 2003, we started the modernization of our brewery, including constructing new facilities and introducing high-technology equipment—Carlsberg Group invested a lot of money. From 2003-2010, the company invested $185 million in development, and during 2011-2013, that figure was around $37 million. Carlsberg Group research center selected a special brewing barley Null-Lox, which preserves the freshness of the beer for a long time. These new varieties of barley are highly resistant to diseases, and require less expense for the malt. Carlsberg has strict procedures regarding testing the product. Every month quality managers conduct random purchases of Carlsberg products in every country in which we have operations. Over the last year Carlsberg Kazakhstan earned the highest score for the quality of our product.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Bühler develops original grain processing technologies, designs and manufactures its own machines and devices. Thus, it was inevitable for the company to enter Kazakhstan's market—the country produces 15-20 million tons of grain a year. In the 1990s, when Bühler just started its operations in Kazakhstan, there was lack of mills, and those that existed needed revamping. At the time, the equipment market was highly competitive, but Bühler was the only company who could secure timely delivery of highly-efficient, high-capacity mills in large numbers. Kazakhstan managed to become a big global producers and exporter not only for grains, but also of flour. Our company operates in other sectors than grain processing. We are actively working in pressure die-casting, paints production, and nanotechnologies. On top of that, Bühler is constantly improving its services and staying close to its clients. We are opening service centers across Kazakhstan. One center is already open in Almaty, and next year we are planning to launch a new one in Kostanay. These centers will provide after-sales service, repairs, and we will use them to store spare parts.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Ican see an unbalance in geographical distribution of power generation, there are several coal power stations in the eastern part of Kazakhstan, but there is need for energy in the western part. There is also a disproportion of energy distribution between the north and south. There is a shortage of energy in the south and number of power stations in the north. In general, the country is heading towards a deficit of energy. There is a need for importing energy and building new power stations, as well as refurbishing the existing one. Because of the vision that is supported by the state, we see increased development of the renewable energy sources like wind or solar. ABB is supporting Kazakhstan in almost all areas mentioned before.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Kazakhstan is still a new market with a lot of possibilities. The country would like to manage its energy use in a better and more responsible way. This is our core business and we are here to help Kazakhstan to make the most of its energy. It is all about connecting products, software, and systems altogether. This breaks down to energy producers and energy consumers. Kazakhstan is unique because of its growing oil and gas sector, where we are one of the leaders in systems for power supply and automation, as well as the transportation of oil and gas. We are one of the main technology suppliers for pipelines, and we have wide automation capabilities. Infrastructure plays an important role in the Kazakhstan market with ports, airports, water treatment, and electricity, and basically everything that enables a better lifestyle and business for the people.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Expo 2017 is attracting serious investment in technologies, and Kazakhstan would like to make Astana a benchmark. Schneider Electric is currently helping 200 cities around the Globe to become more smart and connected. We would like to use our knowledge to create smarter cities in Kazakhstan. Creating a smart city of the scale of Astana from scratch is a dream, so someone needs to make it happen, and we can help in five different areas. First of all we have the electricity grid where we are able to actively connect every user. The Smart Grid makes energy work with various applications and maximizes the potential of electrical devices. We are moving to a more efficient energy solution with better distribution. The second area is water, and we are helping with water transport and safety, as we know it is as important for the people as energy is.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our activity is not focused on end-user business. After the success of our thermo technology, power tools, security systems, after sales, and hydraulics units, we have decided to forge into packaging as well. We are responsible for all the neighboring countries from our base in Almaty—Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. We established our regional presence in all of these countries, and we are doing well there with our components and products. We started our centralized warehouse here in Almaty last year to improve our logistics. In Kazakhstan we have implemented several projects. In 2014 we developed a 200 MW boiler house in Shymkent, in Astana we work for Akorda, which is the Residential Palace of the President, and we have developed a 20.8 MW boiler house for Nazarbayev University. We have also managed a project in Turkmenistan, where we have reconstructed 11 boiler houses.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Logistics companies face complicated structural changes in this business. Though the tenge was devalued by almost 20%—which had a negative effect on many importing businesses—the flow of goods within the Customs Union between Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, as well as China, grew. Moreover, thanks to the support we received from our coordinating office in Switzerland, we managed to maintain our market share. We also manage a Germany-based company under the Militzer &amp; Munch umbrella called InterRail, and they have just signed a contract with the Kazakhstani Railway Authority. The agreement allows us to develop railway shipments because we will have access to a special economic zone, get special rates, and be operating in an advantageous environment. I would estimate that 50% to 60% of all our imminent business is driven by the railroad, and the rest is road, airfreight, and customs clearance. Altogether we have 50 employees for Militzer &amp; Munch and Fedex employs 100. There are nine offices, including our head office here in Almaty.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>For the DPD group of companies in the CIS, Kazakhstan is very important. In terms of profitability, our operations in Kazakhstan come second after Russia, and ahead of our business in Ukraine and Belarus. By revenue, of course, it is much lower than Russia, but this is an emerging market and we believe our share will be much greater in the future. Parcels are currently leading the market, but in the category of consolidated cargo, we are number one in the country. In 2013 we penetrated the business to consumer (B2C) market; a new market for us. E-commerce is also growing in Kazakhstan, which is why we were able to take on several well-known B2C projects. It is particularly easy for us to apply and develop new technologies because we have our own IT solutions, through our IT staff in Russia, who have developed our entire electronic resource management (ERM) system for all our operations in the  CIS region.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Asia Sky Express, a Turkish company, wanted to establish a network in the former Soviet Union in Central Asia and the Caucuses region. It opened offices in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Tajikistan, and now we have a network in the Central Asian region. For the first time, we have worked with TNT as an agent for delivery to Central Asia. All the cargo that goes to neighbouring countries goes through Almaty and Kazakhstan. Now the company is also acting as a bridge to Russia. Thanks to the customs union, it has become easier to a certain extent to deliver cargo to its members, and we also see an increasing amount of cargo traveling on these routes. It is now impossible to offer high quality service without having an elaborate IT program. We have developed our own software—ASELogic—which is tailor-made for our needs. We are open to cooperation with any foreign companies that need express logistics services in our region.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In 2014 we had strong revenue growth and achieved an impressive gross profit. We have a unique service in Aramex called “Shop and Ship“ which we created for our clients. It is hard for clients to do online shopping and get their orders in Kazakhstan, as transit time is a major challenge for them, as well as customs clearance. There are around 20 international companies providing courier services and freight forwarding. There are more than 70 local companies, and all of these are providing good levels of service. We have more than 45 developers working on our website and technology to develop customer service. The current situation in Ukraine has transformed our business, as our trucks were coming from Europe through Ukraine, and then Russia to Kazakhstan. Now transit time is longer and documents are more complicated to obtain. The situation between China and Kazakhstan is the same. I hope that circumstances will improve over the next three to five years.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>A business cannot grow faster or bigger than the market itself. People often ask why our operations are growing so much faster in certain countries. This is because economic drivers vary greatly by country, especially in the service sector.  The transport and logistics sector in Kazakhstan is challenging due to its immense territory, low population concentration, and an imbalance between import and export of finished goods.  Moreover, the Kazakh economy is quite dependent on natural resources, while the industrial manufacturing base is rather limited. Our strategy is to be closer to where our customers are and meet their turnkey transport and logistics requirements. Over the past 20 years, we have established eight locations across Kazakhstan and 20 in the rest of the CIS, which makes Globalink one of the leading full service transport and logistics providers in the market. Public sector and government active involvement in the infrastructure development is crucial. However, sometimes you need to step back and draw a line delineating the public and private sectors to avoid any conflict of interest.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The National Bank took the right step to reduce the shock of possible future events as volatility of the Russian Ruble has its direct impact on Kazakhstani producers, exporting to neighboring countries. However, from the business point of view, this did not significantly affect the banking sector, as the majority of local banks do not have massive foreign currency liabilities since the last world economic crisis and thus, KZT liabilities and lending are well balanced. But ultimately, we are in the same boat as our clients. They rely upon our bank and the bank steps in when it has to, so that our clients feel safe and sound. Compared to last year, assets grew by 38%-39% and loan portfolio grew by 39%. Deposits and current accounts have grown by 33%. Capital, which is one of the most important indicators, has grown by 41% and the bank's net income grew by more than 45%. All these achievements were as per nine months of 2014, and we expect to retain this level of performance for the remainder of the year.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The worst effect of devaluation was a shift in our client's preferences; they moved towards US dollar deposits from tenge ones. This devaluation has undermined trust in the national currency. The retail deposit structure has also changed: before the devaluation, tenge deposits accounted for roughly 60% of the total deposits as opposed to 40% now. However, the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) launched a relevant and timely initiative and started quoting swap operations. As a result of the February devaluation, March rates reached 100% overnight. Obviously, we faced liquidity problems, due to a tenge shortage. During the summer of 2014 we performed a number of swap operations, and the situation has improved. However, it is necessary for the banking system to continue to restore trust in the tenge. As an institution, we are adjusting well. : As of November 1, 2014 the bank's assets equals 307.4 billion tenge, representing a 54.6 billion tenge (21.6%) increase from the beginning of the year.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The growth of our assets last year increased from $100 million to $300 million. Currently, we have about $700 million in assets. The shareholders began actively investing in the bank; the bank's capital historically has been around KZT5 billion. This year it was increased to 11 and by the end of this year we plan to reach KZT20 billion. At the beginning of this year, Qazaq Bank was 28th out of the 38 banks in Kazakhstan. Currently, it is the 21st. This speaks to an aggressive growth strategy. After the financial crisis, a lot of banks here in Kazakhstan became more rigid in terms of giving loans, they became more selective with the projects and more risk averse. This was a good opportunity for Qazaq Bank to expand its loan base to acquire new creditors with a good history. We targeted creditors without toxic assets. We decided not to focus on a particular sector; we are equally present in corporate retail and SMEs. In essence, we are trying to reduce the levels of bureaucracy, have a more client-oriented approach, and speed up our loan process, all of which allows us to become more efficient and draw clients from other banks.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Various factors have had an impact on the financial situation in Kazakhstan. These include the devaluation of the currency, and also the political impact of what is going on in Russia and Ukraine, and the resulting uncertainty there, especially in terms of its impact on the customs union. The Russian ruble has also been devaluing and that has created certain issues for us. President Nazarbayev has laid out some guidelines that highlight the government's support for the national economy. At the moment we are clarifying our strategy for the upcoming years. Our bank had positive results in 2013, increasing our loan portfolio by more than 20%, beating the market average growth by nearly 10%. We have achieved a strong profitability in all of our business lines. In 2014, we were more focused on increasing the quality of our existing portfolio in all areas. We have been dealing with our remedial portfolio, and our work with overdue loans allowed us to achieve a NPL level of 13%, one of the lowest levels in the banking sector of the country.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>On November 28, 2014, the bank closed its doors as “HSBC Bank Kazakhstan“ and next business day reopened as Altyn Bank. By purchasing HSBC Bank Kazakstan, Halyk Group acquired strong client base, sound business practices, highly skilled English speaking employees, and client-oriented corporate culture. Looking back it was a big leap of faith to believe that client loyalty will survive change of such magnitude, but it all paid off as clients continued to bank with us after the acquisition. On corporate banking side, we will continue to work with our existing clients—large multinational and state-owned national companies. There are very few banks in Kazakhstan that can provide same level of service to these clients, as it requires extensive international experience and deep understanding of clients' businesses and needs. In retail, we will develop new private banking offering for high net worth individuals (HNWI). Altyn Bank is uniquely positioned to take advantage of growing needs of HNWI by leveraging its client relationship model the bank used for years in the mass-affluent segment. Last but not the least, we will work on developing digital banking and other online services.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In the past 15 years, since the moment Humana became part of the Grupo Conclina C.A., we have learned a lot and moved from being a company in the insurance sector to what we are today; an enterprise that operates in the health sector. We have implemented a successful strategy to provide high-quality health services to our clients and we now want to ensure that this relationship grows and becomes a true partnership. This means a new approach to the company's strategy, which is our main goal for the future. Also, we want to be an active part of the process to build a high-quality health system in the country through a network of clinics and hospitals. Being part of the most important health benefits group in the country, Conclina, to which Hospital Metropolitano also belongs, we know the importance of having strategic alliances with the best medical providers. Our aim is that our members receive timely medical services and are attended to with quality equipment and infrastructure.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Ecuador is one of our more important markets right now. Best Doctors started its Latin American operations here in Ecuador. The country has a dynamic economy. We do our third highest volume of business in Ecuador, just behind Mexico and Venezuela. If we account for sales per capita, Ecuador is our most valuable market. During our six years of operations in Ecuador, we have experienced remarkable growth. Best Doctors is a Global company. Best Doctors has enjoyed a 30% average growth rate over the years. Even though we started operations in Ecuador six years ago, we only started commercializing our products a year and a half later. We are set to reach $20 million in sales, and we have experienced growth rates of 40% every year. These numbers have earned us the reputation as one of the leading companies in the country. The insurance culture is still in its first stages of development, and Ecuadoreans are just starting to realize the importance of insurance products. Right now, only around 15% of Ecuador's population has private health insurance. This figure is low, but it shows opportunities for growth in the Ecuadorean insurance market.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Insurance is certainly a growing market that is becoming more sophisticated. In general, that means that there are more products. Another indicator we are seeing is market consolidation. There are too many companies for the size of the market. Companies are merging, and international companies are buying local entities and consolidating them. This pattern is set to continue over the next few years, which is positive both for the industry, and the customer. Larger, consolidated companies are able to bring better products and services to the market. About seven or eight years ago, Bupa decided to continue its growth story in Latin America. It acquired several companies working in the insurance sector, and one of them, Amedex, had offices here in Ecuador. Latin America, and Ecuador in particular, fit Bupa's profile, as a developing market. We have invested in growing our business in this market, and strategically, the company has a long-term commitment. Bupa has a very aggressive growth plan, and we want to quadruple the size of the company within five years. That is a challenging, but achievable goal, and our corporate business is a key component in our efforts to achieve this.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The market is evolving along similar lines to Latin American countries, such as Peru, Uruguay, Argentina, or Chile. Until 2009, the industry was quite basic. Since then, the market changed with the public becoming more exigent, more demanding in terms of design, quality, functionality, and the equipment that we fit our buildings out with. Two examples of our answer to that new demand is Ciudad del Rí­o and Karibao. Before Ciudad del Rí­o, people tended to live backward to the river. In this sense, we have followed European trends as it is to live in a river-view property, where they can enjoy the quality of life associated with the peaceful colors of the water and clear skies. Another value-added aspect is the design. We moved upscale to more aesthetically pleasing designs for our clients to enjoy. This is a strong trend that other promoters and developers are now adopting in their own products. Pronobis is proud to be one of the industry leaders, and this is one of the ways we have confirmed our commitment with our clients.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have seen constant growth of the sector, especially in Quito, confirming its status as the largest market. The main reason for that is the current availability of mortgages, as in the past decade banks have been keen, because of the dollar, to extend long-term mortgages to clients at favorable rates. Formerly, it was not possible to secure a mortgage at a better interest rate than 15%, while today the 10% mark is the norm. A major growth factor in the real estate sector is the social security bank, which has started giving mortgages for 15 to 20 years at better terms in competition with the banks. The mortgage market has duly become interesting for a much wider audience, which fuels the purchase of houses, residences, and offices. As the economy has grown so too has money entering circulation. Companies are now starting up in larger number and we build a large volume of corporate property.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The most important challenge for the sector in the coming years is keeping the trend of financing home buying in the country, which has many benefits for the economy. The national government has knowledge that this is a key driver of the economy. Financing is the first challenge, and the second one is finding a social interest home building model. We need to find a model that is sustainable and which allows people, who are not able to get a proper home right now, to be able to do it in the future. Before 2009, if you drew a pie chart of how homes were sold in Ecuador, you would find that most of them were sold at prices above $50,000. It was 2009 when this trend changed or inverted. After 2009, most new homes are bought at prices that are under $50,000. That is a big step in being able to tend to the largest market.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>When the company was established, it had a strong focus on large surface and high-quality housing units, because there was a demand for such properties. However, this changed over the years, and so did our strategy. We have always been a flexible firm, and as purchasing power has declined we have started developing smaller projects. The market no longer demanded high-quality finishes. The type of property we first launched to the market 15 years ago is no longer in demand at all in Quito. Some other constructors have tried to develop such schemes, but it was extremely hard for them to sell. We have always analyzed the market evolution and adapted ourselves to the types of properties that respond to saving capacity and purchasing power. In this context, recent economic and social developments in Ecuador have led to a situation in which the middle class has increased, while at the same time, the higher social class has seen its purchasing power reduced over the years. We are talking about a segmented and broad middle class in Ecuador, which is our market niche.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>With the creation of Universidad de San Francisco de Quito (USFQ), the educational sector became competitive for the first time. Before then, it was a public system with no competition. Competition makes you develop, and ultimately makes your university better. Since we have started, the whole education system has been transformed, not only on a university level but also from K to 12. We are the only university in Latin America to offer a full Liberal Arts curriculum in the tradition of the UK and the US. Just by our example alone, we have changed the attitudes of students and professors, improved the quality of teaching, and emphasized the necessity of research. We are not research-oriented and do not receive state funding, although in spite of that we are the top research university in Ecuador. We have the largest number of PhDs of any institution in Ecuador by far.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Universidad de las Américas (UDLA) has a strong, but limited, research program. It is strong in the sense of focus, but limited in the sense of scope. Universities do not receive any funds from the government, but we have to work with the government. We will not develop a good research project as a whole if we do not collaborate. We do not receive funds from the government, and we devote most of our resources to helping our health science schools. UDLA probably has the best-developed research center in Ecuador, especially for study areas such as cancer. We have noticed that different indigenous communities in Ecuador have diverse problems of a genetic nature. As a result, we are conducting genetics studies and we have a center that is focused on diabetes. There is a traditional food from Ecuador called chocho. We are finding that certain types of chochos that we develop can fight diabetes. This is fantastic because it is natural, cheap, and people like it. We have been conducting experiments for the past three years and will shortly publish the final study. Again, the concept is: do your research in topics of significance to the country, and not just of academic orientation.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>At the moment we are transitioning toward the new law and academic framework stipulated by the regulator. This framework has yet to be proven, but we will do our best to make it work, even if we do not completely agree with it, such as the requirement to hold a PhD to become a dean, vice-president, or president of a university. Time alone will reveal the wisdom of the new legal framework. We want to feature on the global map, and even in the international rankings. As for the next 20 years, after updating new skills and curricula, we are driven to develop the health-related component of Universidad de Especialidades Espiritu Santo (UEES): the school of medicine and related areas, such as intensive care technology, and neurosurgery. We plan to build a university hospital within the next five years. We have already approached four of the top-10 hospitals to leverage their experience and advice in what will be a greatly ambitious project. All of our efforts will be geared at establishing an agreement with one of the experienced international institutions.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>For over 45 years Escuela Politécnica Nacional (EPN) has espoused a system to balance secondary education with the training of professionals, having offset certain deficiencies in the disciplines of physics, mathematics, and chemistry. Once students are enrolled at EPN, our staff expose them to both pure and applied scientific research. Teachers at EPN know that they have to teach, research, and work to fulfill our social responsibilities. Research must be linked to teaching, because knowledge is dynamic, and academic staff must have published 20 to 30 articles in indexed journals. Arguably, what Ecuadorean universities are missing is patentable innovation. If it is a center for engineering and sciences it should be possible to patent one's work.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Technology is a basic issue that every bank has to deal with to operate successfully. You have to understand our target market, which is military personnel. It is like a huge company with offices all over Ecuador and in certain other countries. They need a bank with a national presence, and we are a medium-sized institution. We have dealt with this reality by joining forces with Banco Pichincha. Between 2008 and 2012 we were perfecting our financial ratios, so we were not paying much attention to IT. In mid-2012, we decided to change that. We started to invest a lot of money improving our IT, and in 2014 the vast majority of our projects are IT based. We are buying new BPM and CRM software, analyzing the core software we use to attain customers and register transactions. We improved our webpage, too, but there are still many areas to be improved. We need it to be more efficient, to save money, and to better serve our customers. They need electronic payments and other technologies to perform transactions. Improving our IT will allow us to introduce products and services that will hit our target market.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We want to be a multi-banking institution capable of offering integrated services and solutions, for example, we need to improve our technological processes to offer our clients alternative banking tools.  My appointment was also part of the bank's strategy to diversify and expand its operating segments, while giving the institution a more pluralist character with additional products and services, as well as higher levels of technological sophistication. Technology is essential, as today we would be incapable of offering all the services and products we have, while also reaching higher banking penetration levels domestically. New technologies enable us to be faster and more efficient in our activity. I think one of the challenges facing emerging economies is the low banking penetration level, which sparks further problems. I think technology plays a key role in increasing banking penetration; nowadays it eases many processes and people can perform any process on a computer or mobile phone. Moreover, new technologies enable the faster launch and implementation of products, services and strategies, reaching clients more efficiently, too. I think this is the road to follow in Ecuador, both for us and for the other banks, as the current banking penetration in the country barely reaches 40%.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We operate 22 banks on three continents. Of these, six are considered the largest banks, and in Ecuador one of these is ProCredit—among the top six. I think, on the one hand, that the financial resources SMEs need in order to increase their investment pose a challenge. In addition, the human resources component can be challenging, and that in many cases their performance could be enhanced through greater technical knowledge. Our clients have many strategies for their businesses; however, they don't always have the technological knowledge to back it up. Both aspects are related to the efficiency that these enterprises need for the future. Efficiency is important because Ecuador is a  relatively small market, compared with its neighbors. We need to improve efficiency and quality. Meanwhile, as a private bank, we were the first to service the agricultural sector, and also the first to launch special credit—EcoCredit—to invest in measures to protect the environment.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Ecuador is not well known as a country that promotes design. However, we have taken this to our advantage, because our furniture and design combine the best of Ecuador—the resources, and the identity of Latin American design. Today we are well known across Latin America. We have expanded in the US, and have also been pursuing further expansion there, too. We are exporting products made in Ecuador to the US since 2001. We have around 10 active dealers and many other design firms in the US, which is currently the largest market for our brand. We also have distribution in Mexico, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Costa Rica, and are starting to do some business in Dubai, too. We have two licenses in Venezuela, but that is slightly different. The license is more like a franchise as with here. We recently opened a showroom in Chile, and are opening one in Peru in October 2014. I would say that about 60% of our business is international.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are expanding to Latin American markets and export to around 20 countries in the region. Meanwhile, we have our own operations in Peru, Colombia, and in Central America. We make products for brands like Whirlpool that are sold in Colombia, Chile, and Central America. In Ecuador, we hold a 70% market share in stoves and 65% in refrigerators. I know home appliances well, which will allow us to build on our strengths in the local market and also in Peru, where we are already in a strong position. We are also growing in Colombia and in Central America, but the ultimate goal is to have a presence throughout Latin America, where our target is do the same that we did in the Ecuadorean market. We need to establish industrial clusters linking the suppliers of the product, which will give us productivity and curb transport costs in the supply chain. We need the government to incentivize innovation to develop the national knowledge base.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are an Ecuadorean brand born in Ecuador and sustained by Ecuadoreans. But what is more important for us is to emphasize that we use Ecuadorean raw materials, produced locally, to create Oriental food products using our knowledge. We want to show Ecuadoreans, Latin Americans, Europeans, and even Chinese people that Ecuadorean raw materials can be used to make healthy and delicious Oriental food. Some of our sauces are actually being exported to China now, such as our chili sauce, which is made with Ecuadorean chili. Ecuador can produce chili sauce all year round because of our equatorial location. We see this as an opportunity for export. More than 10% of our products are currently exported within the region, but also to Europe and China. You have to pursue your goals every day and adapt when needed by developing new technology and products. You also need to encourage your employees to pursue growth, adapt to change, and innovate.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Marbelize is the fourth largest exporter of tuna in Ecuador. We are also the first to develop new kind of products. We are innovative; we invest in research to develop new products and create new trends. We were the first company in Ecuador to package tuna in a glass container. Our largest export market is Europe. Asia is our main competitor. To compete with them is a big challenge. Their prices are very low, at around $10 per box. The challenge is to give the end consumer an excellent product, but to have them pay for it is difficult. We try not to compete on price, but rather on quality. That is why we have diversified. That is why we don't sell a lot of canned tuna, but instead pouch packs. We sell these in a catering size that is intended for hotels, hospitals, and schools because they value good quality. My biggest challenge is to open up new markets. We are working with the government to open up markets because there are customs duties everywhere.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are a city with a strong agricultural character and tradition. We also have a strong commercial character and over the past few years have focused on the development of services, especially education and health. Much of this city's growth was unplanned and as a result, there is a high level of informality. Our canton suffered from improper planning during its economic and industrial development, causing it to be less developed than other cantons in Ecuador. At the moment, we are planning our municipal goals for 2025. This process must involve both the public and private sectors. We have great potential as a canton, but need to unite in our efforts to address the disorganization of previous years.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have developed a series of business products that suit the region and its unique characteristics. We understand the mindset of our people, and that also means that we know the needs of the enterprises here, and is why we have been able to support them throughout the disparate economic situations the country has experienced. Another way in which we play a key role in regional development, while setting ourselves apart from the competition, is through our agility in meeting the client needs. Our role here has changed over the years, too. We have provided funding channels to a wide variety of economic sectors, and that is the best example of how we have contributed to the development of the region. We have to keep in mind that the country itself has developed, and with it Manabí­. Arguably, the region has not grown to the same extent as Guayaquil, Quito, and Cuenca, but it has notably expanded.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are a particularly productive province thanks to our highly skilled workforce. However, as a region we have suffered from severe climate conditions, which has affected our productivity and reduced our industrial output. Nevertheless, we have played an important part in Ecuador's development. One of our major achievements has been consolidating our long-term productive vision, as well as developing our road infrastructure plan, the latter being some of my early programs. We have improved the quality of the national roads in our province, and extended their reach to underserved rural communities. While we have already invested in over 7,000 kilometers of road infrastructure, our region requires more than 15,000 kilometers. Therefore, we have taken important steps toward developing the road infrastructure to best serve our industrial and agricultural producers.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The tuna industry is alive and well in Ecuador. We are currently constructing new facilities to accommodate our expansion. We also expect our production capacity to increase by 10% as a result of the new EU trade agreement. In fact, our expansion plans were based on the assumption that the trade agreement would be signed. Europe accounts for 70% of Seafman's sales, even though we do not have our own brand there. We were active before anyone thought tuna was economically viable, and have remained in operation as the industry evolved. Seafman is known in Manta, and in the industry, as a school because we put a tremendous emphasis on the training and education of our employees. If you visit other plants, you will always find people who started at Seafman. Our training programs even extend into the universities.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Citibank started operating in Ecuador in 1960 with a clear goal: to facilitate trade activity between Ecuador and other regional countries through our large branch network. In this context, one of our main focuses over the years has been local and multinational corporate companies in Ecuador, as well as the other markets in which we operate; we provide them with the right tools to develop their business activity, which enables them to take advantage of the synergies between Citibank branches in several countries. The government and the institutional sector is another one of our main focuses of activity. All in all, I think Citibank has contributed to the development of Ecuador from several points of view by providing finance tools to companies operating in the country, bringing in international banking practices and standards, boosting technology and know-how transfer, and playing an active role in the professionalization of the banking industry. Finally, we have also adopted an active role when it comes to social responsibility, engaging in activities to boost financial education and entrepreneurship in Ecuador.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Liberty has a large footprint in Latin America. We started operations in the region in 1995-1996 by entering Venezuela and Colombia. We subsequently entered Chile, Brazil, and Argentina. The intention of the group is to keep developing its footprint not only in Latin America, but in emerging markets worldwide, for example in Asia and Europe. The Ecuadorean market has been of great interest to the group for a number of years. In 2012, the regulator essentially divested the insurance business from the banking sector in Ecuador, which created an opportunity for Liberty to enter the market. Also, the market has grown significantly over the past decade, in fact exceeding GDP growth, although it is still a small market. Premiums in Ecuador border $1.7 billion today, which makes it an interesting niche market to enter. Therefore, a combination of factors was involved in our decision to enter the country. I think it is preferable to maintain our momentum and keep entering additional countries in Latin America because having a greater footprint is beneficial. Another positive about the Ecuadorean market is that the insurance penetration level remains low.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Ecuador is a highly attractive country for doing business; the government is keen to open the doors to foreign investors, and we are also talking about a country that needs infrastructure for its development. For Siemens, it is vital to take part in Ecuador's largest infrastructure projects, especially those related to the government's plans to shake up the national energy and electricity matrix. I believe that Siemens can play a leading role in this process, saving the country significant expense over the long term. The Pacific Refinery is another top priority for Siemens, because in the future it is set to become a key element in the broader economic development of the country. Overall, Siemens is eager to participate in Ecuador's high-tech projects of social and economic merit. Finally, the high levels of investment in education and public health committed to by the incumbent government also interest Siemens as a leading manufacturer of medical equipment and technology. Siemens is well equipped to leave its social footprint on Ecuadorean society through the strength of its leading-edge technological offering.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Ecuador is an important market for the company. It is a market in which the automotive sector has undergone regulatory changes and the imposition of quotas. In response, GM has ramped up investment in Ecuador over the past few years. Ecuador is a market with opportunities that warrant this increased investment. Our medium- to long-term strategy in Ecuador is proven by our commitment to industrialize the country by developing a solid auto parts supplier base. As part of our efforts to help transform the production matrix, we have increased investment in our plant to maximize its potential. In 2014, we will complete the final expansion stage, where a $70 million budget has been allocated over the past three years aimed at productivity and quality, the development of new products, and attracting new investors to the auto parts segment. By attracting new investors, we hope to increase the number of Ecuadorean parts in vehicles. Since we are a multinational company, we also boost know-how transfer by providing regular training courses to our staff, other companies of the auto industry and even other industries.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Ecuador is a great place for developing our global solutions. It is part of the Andean region, which is formed by Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Paraguay. Ecuador represents a huge opportunity for the company especially because government investment here is huge. In every segment, the government is our biggest client. The main segments that will be affected are health, domestic security, traffic, mining, and industry. The company realized that having a local person is good for the business. For countries in Latin America, 3M and similar companies tend to be more open to working with local people. Being a local allows for a better balance between what the company wants you to do, and the reality of what you can do in the country. Over the next three years, we want to break the $100 million barrier, which would be a significant milestone for the company and would position us as one of the most important of the 95 subsidiaries that 3M has across the world. This year the target is to surpass the $60 million mark. We are 75% of the way there, but need to increase our efforts.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In Ecuador, Alpina has a 40% share of the formal cheese market and 20% of the formal dairy market. However, only 30% of cheese is sold in the formal market in Ecuador, while informal producers account for 70%. In many cases, we are working with informal producers to help them develop better safety and quality standards. One example is a small dairy cooperative in Ecuador, named Quesinor, located close to our plant in Carchi. We have been working with them to help integrate standards for technology and hygiene and generate business value to commercialize their products. We feel that we have a social responsibility to ensure that there is a harmonious environment for business. Alpina buys more than 170,000 liters of milk every day. We have been working with the Ministry of Agriculture to source much of this milk from small farmers. By guaranteeing a buyer for these farmers, we can help support the market, and by working to identify the many cooperatives and associations and agreeing to purchase milk from them under formal conditions, we are helping to bring them out of informality.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There are three areas that we are going to focus on for the future. The first is our people. We really work hard and will keep working in Ecuador for our people, in terms of their development and training. In 2013, we increased our investment in training and development five fold. We care about our people, and we feel that we should give the best conditions to them, meaning quality, tools, technology, facilities, and opportunities for personal development. The second area is our product and brands portfolio, which we want to expand further and faster. You will see many innovations in the coming years aimed toward improved nutrition. Also, affordable and premium products are areas where there are still plenty of opportunities. And third, I can say that we want to grow also in new and different categories, which means investing in equipment, machinery, and different lines, but also looking at mergers and acquisitions.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Ecuadoreans are ready to take on a challenge, and our collaborators and team members are skillful, hard working, and quick learners. In this context, many of our management positions at the production plants and commercial areas are occupied by Ecuadoreans who have previously worked for other leading companies in the food industry elsewhere in region, which is more common today. The new productive matrix adopted by the government has brought many opportunities for local producers. In this context, we search for new market niches that can help us expand our business activity. For example, in 2014 Superior's portfolio has expanded significantly in order to offer more alternatives to local consumers. I perceive many growth opportunities, and we are determined to take advantage of them to expand into new segments of the food industry. We want to double our operational size over the next five years. Today, we are on the right path and convinced that we will continue playing a major role in Ecuador's food industry.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Ecuador is one of the leading exporters of cacao; other markets do not currently pay at a premium for Ecuadorean cocoa, and the country needs to further invest in international brand building, as we still live off past successes. I also think that Ecuador should increase the production of fine aroma cacao and start working to generate value-added from the product through a strong brand, by promoting it and make it more competitive worldwide. We expect to reach a 20% export level within four years—we started exporting two years ago and exports currently represent 10% of our business activity. There are several lines that offer interesting business opportunities. For example, the country still has a long road ahead regarding healthy food products in order to catch up with more advanced markets. Also, Colombian companies sell products worth $150 million using technology that has yet to be introduced here. Once this is done, there is another market niche to explore there.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We establish assembly plants in almost every country in which we operate. The growth and development of the plant in Ecuador has been stable and consistent. The plant has manufactured innovative and top-class models that are highly acclaimed. Over the past decade we have supported the government's efforts to substitute imported products for locally produced ones. As part of our efforts to help transform the production matrix, we have increased investment in our plant to maximize its potential. In 2014, we will complete the final expansion stage, where a $70 million budget has been allocated over the last three years aimed at productivity and quality, the development of new products, and attracting new investors to the auto parts segment. By attracting new investors, we hope to increase the number of Ecuadorean parts in vehicles. Since we are a multinational company, we also boost know-how transfer by providing regular training courses to our staff, other companies of the auto industry, and even other industries.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Sony has 15 offices in Ecuador, and was in fact the first brand to have its own premises here, believing in the need to keep in touch with the consumer. We have just started producing in Ecuador, manufacturing two television models, and in 2014 the number will rise to five. We attribute this to Ecuador's growth, and are confident of the high-quality proposition Sony brings the country. We have two direct Sony stores, and two franchises, in Ecuador. Franchising allows us to reach more people beyond the city centers. Currently, we have 150 direct employees, and are developing other sub-brands in Ecuador, such as PlayStation. Sony's presence in Ecuador speaks volumes in terms of its importance as we only have a limited number of television production operations in Latin America, namely in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and now Ecuador. Televisions account for 70% of Sony sales in Ecuador. The manufacturing operation is relatively large, which is important for the national market and the wider region.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are a competent player in the government's plans to transform the country's production matrix; our main objective is to increase the national production of natural rubber conterminous to reduce our dependence on imports of natural rubber from Asia. Moreover, we want to boost our exports and with this we contribute more to the economic and social development of Ecuador. At the moment, 50% of our production is distributed in our domestic market, whereas the remaining 50% is exported. Over the past decade, we also have developed three retread plants (Quito, Guayaquil, and the last one was set up in Cuenca). At those centers, we mainly work on large truck tires. These efforts are part of our profound commitment to the environment; moreover, we conduce saving costs and improving tire life. Ecuador lacked a culture of tire retreading and only recently we can see an increasing awareness of this opportunity.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>LINDE is the world's leading player in the gas industry, with a presence in around 100 different countries. In this context, Ecuador's relevance within such global operations is certainly important; we have always seen growth potential and business opportunities in this market. Despite what many might say about the size of the country, LINDE has always seen a growing and promising market in Ecuador. In this context, one of our strongest points is that we are involved in several economic sectors, and not only in the gas industry. This is one of the most attractive things of our operations in Ecuador, which began over 52 years ago. In this context, over the past two years we have implemented investment plans worth $50 million, and we have committed to broaden our business activity in the country in coming years.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The need for deep-water ports has long been on the agenda, for both the state and private sectors. With ships of deeper drafts coming our way, we are facing an interesting challenge in regard to Ecuadorean ports. While the port of Guayaquil has the market, services, and infrastructure to handle commerce with these new vessels, it temporarily lacks the draft in its access channel. On the other hand, there are other ports of deeper draft, but that lack the connectivity and the hinterland that makes attractive for shipping lines to call there. The government's response to that call is the creation of another port beyond the Gulf of Guayaquil. That solution is disputed by many official and private sector players in Guayaquil, who believe that a channel could be dredged in order for Guayaquil to be able to receive the traffic.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The idea to develop the Port of Manta is not directly related to competing with the Port of Guayaquil, or simply to building the deep-water port, but is geared to making the entire maritime and port network more competitive. Today, we have four main ports: Esmeraldas, Manta, Guayaquil, and Puerto Bolivar, all of which have their own hinterland and characteristic features. Our concern leans more toward specializing our ports for greater dynamism and activity. Manta will offer alternatives within Ecuador that are more in line with maritime transportation with large vessels. This will be the first deep-water port in Ecuador and the concession will be granted in 2014. It does not mean that it will be the only one, but for now, we are aiming to increase industrial activity related to the maritime industry around Manta, and stimulate the industrial and economic development of Ecuador.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Guayaquil is, in itself, a key city for the country; it has traditionally been a maritime port city with a strategic location that put it at the forefront of commercial development in Ecuador. Guayaquil has long led the development of foreign trade in the country as a consequence. For this reason, Guayaquil has always hosted the foreign communities in our country. However, I should add that Ecuador's other maritime ports are also of importance for the country; Manta, Esmeraldas, and Puerto Bolivar all have their own importance and market niche. We all complement each other and form a crucial network of maritime ports that underpins national development. The Port of Guayaquil at the moment accounts for the largest volume of imported and exported cargo, and there's a nationwide strategy to complement the role of the Port of Guayaquil with a higher specialization among the other ports. Guayaquil today enjoys many benefits in term of infrastructure and logistics facilities due to its leading role.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The port of Manta has two terminals—the international terminal and the fishing terminal, which is mainly to meet the needs and demands of the tuna industry. The concession is for the infrastructure and facilities of the international terminal. The idea behind the concession is to find a strong international partner to achieve an established expansion, which aims to boost the transfer of knowledge, and bring their international expertise into Ecuador. We want to specialize this terminal so it can accommodate deep-water vessels. Right now, we have a deep-water port that lacks the infrastructure to welcome those types of vessels. We have received interest from several large export companies in the agricultural industry that as soon as we start operating the new facilities, they will make Manta their natural port. All in all, the concession aims to develop the necessary infrastructure to make the Port of Manta a deep-water port, making our infrastructure more competitive and efficient; we will have a 400-meter long dock for containers, two carrying cranes with all the necessary associated infrastructure, and a partner in the concession will bring knowledge, expertise, and contacts.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We were established in 2002 and are the only company in the insurance sector headquartered in Cuenca. We have offices in Quito, Guayaquil, and Loja, and are set to open operations in Machala. We believe that we must provide the market and consumers with something new; otherwise, there is little chance of surviving the intensely competitive environment. From 2003, we experienced a growth rate of 25%, thus greatly in excess of the 11% insurance market average.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>As a local reinsurance company, Universal is a very small operation compared to the international reinsurance entities, although we believe that we help the local market to solve certain capacity problems. For example, certain large reinsurers request a minimum premium, which could be between $10,000 and $15,000 depending on the company, and that means that if a certain business isn't going to produce that minimum premium for the reinsurer they are not going to settle it.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>I personally founded Aseguradora del Sur with several partners, most of whom were from Cuenca, which is why our first registered office was in that city. Later on, I purchased all the shares from the other partners, and I now own 100% of the company. Over the years, the company has set itself apart from the competition thanks to the services it provides to its clients through its 300 brokers. These have a high level of satisfaction and identification with our company, and as a result we enjoy an elevated level of diversification in our business activity.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We are a local company ranked among the top 10 in terms of sales, while seven of those 10 companies are multinationals. We are one of the most financially solid and consolidated companies in the industry. Also, we have the structural support of over 110 companies—those belonging to Grupo Eljuri. The growth and expansion of Grupo Eljuri has fueled our company over the past few years, and we have basically grown in step. In this context, the automotive industry deserves a special mention. Grupo Eljuri has a strong market share in this industry, thanks to which we have been ranked among the leading companies for vehicle insurance.</p>]]></sections31>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>JOSÉ ANTONIO OLIVARES</h4><p>The government of Ecuador is highly invested in technology, and it has set the tone for the private sector on how they should allocate their budgets to this field. The best example of this is the City of Yachay, which is known as the “City of Knowledge" in Ecuador. In my 17 years at IBM, I have never seen such an ambitious and sizable investment in technology from the government. This investment also encourages local technology firms, especially those engaged with software production, to develop themselves. Ecuador is a leading software developer in the region if we bear in mind the size of the country, its economy, and its population. Ecuador has local software companies exporting regionally with a high level of reputation. In this context, Ecuador is firmly moving toward becoming a regional referent in the software industry thanks to the economic and industrial developments in the country over the last few years. And we have to keep in mind not only the technological production of such an ambitious project, but its future educational contribution to a country such as Ecuador and a region like Latin America. Ecuador is set to become a producer of IT talent from which the government, as well as the public and private sectors, will benefit. In this context, the City of Yachay will bring together the public, private, and academic sectors.</p><h4>ERNESTO KRUGER</h4><p>Ecuador has many entrepreneurs, and 20 years ago many people started technology companies. The problem was that we did not have a government that understood technology. We did not have a market or laws for entrepreneurs. Today, the new economy that the government has established has integrated well. A market needs to speak about innovation and entrepreneurship. Today, it is as if the stars have aligned and now entrepreneurship is possible, which is fantastic. I believe Ecuador was reborn, and became a new country. To this end, I think Yachay is important in the educational system because it is about research and new technologies, but it is only about applied research. Research needs to connect to reality. Reality is the companies, the enterprises, and the necessities. It is possible for Yachay to have incubators and accelerators, which is great. If Yachay has accelerators, this is good for us, because we need more help to do more with entrepreneurship and start-ups. Moreover I believe Yachay is doing well in involving the private sector. It is not possible to do only public work; that is not good. Good examples of this include Ireland, Israel, South Korea, Malaysia, and, of course, Singapore. These are examples of start-up nations. They have blended the public and the private sectors.</p><h4>JUAN CARLOS CISNEROS</h4><p>Ecuador has experienced significant changes in its IT industry, not only in terms of the advancement of its infrastructure, but in demand patterns and market trends too. These have been linked to generational changes in Ecuadorean society. I believe that today Ecuadorean human capital in segments such as software and applications is highly qualified and skilled. We have software developers that have worked with well-known multinationals in the development of new apps and software. However, our segment in particular still requires know-how and technology transfer from the main multinational companies operating in Ecuador. As an Ecuadorean, the Yachay project will be good for the country and the industry, positively contributing to building up such expertise and bringing even faster technological developments to both Ecuador and the sector. All in all, I think that the city of Yachay will better position the industry as one of the main drivers in Ecuador's efforts to change its production matrix, while boosting the export profile of this industry. I think higher education centers in Ecuador should follow the trend that Yachay will set, boosting cooperation between all parts and involving the private sector. The effect of the city of Yachay will impact not only the IT sector, but the entire economy of the country and its people too, because it will boost innovation in other key economic sectors for the country.</p><p>© The Business Year</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have 106 companies operating under Law No.41, which is for multinationals. The law is beneficial in terms of labor issues, as their employees do not need a work permit to work in Panama and they are provided with a visa for five years. It also guarantees certain tax exemptions. As the money came from outside the country, they do not have to pay tax on it. In addition, they are not charged any labor or migration taxes. It is difficult for most companies to employ expatriates in many countries, but we do not have this problem, and that is why many multinationals choose to establish their headquarters here because it is simply more workable. One of the most promising sectors for companies to get involved in is construction. Financial services are also growing, but I will have to say that, in relation to this, Bancolombia bought HSBC in a huge transaction, and right now it is one of the main banks present in Panama. Financial services have always been one of the more attractive sectors.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We developed a committee run by one of our presidents that created a joint venture to assess business necessities and how the Chamber could help satisfy those needs. For example, in Panamá Pací­fico, one of the main bases for multinational companies, around 9,000 or 10,000 jobs have been created to date. The presence of these enterprises in Panama has helped to increase employment opportunities in terms of wages and salaries. One of the factors attracting companies is the legal framework. Then, of course, there is the connectivity offered by the national airline, the low cost of living in Panama, and the stability and security of the country. I expect GDP growth of close to 7% in 2014. Direct investments should approach $3 billion, and the most dynamic sectors currently are logistics, construction, retail, and wholesale, as well as finance and insurance. Industry and agriculture will remain limited contributors to the economy. Unemployment will be stable at 4%, and the inflation rate will be close to 3% or 4%.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We always talk about Panama as the business gateway of the Americas. There is the canal, railway, ports, duty free zone, and the banking sector. Beyond that, there is a growing service and agro industry. It just makes sense. We always talk about the Panama Canal, but one should also consider the fiber-optic infrastructure here as well. It is a very solid location. Many US companies enjoy benefits from taxes to insurance, but beyond that exists the Panamá Pací­fico, the City of Knowledge, and business incubators. To date, under the Multinational Headquarters Law (SEM) initiative alone, there are 26 American companies operating in Panama, not to mention many others under different investment schemes. Over the last year, the Trade Centre created by the PanAmcham, has attended the visits of several trade missions, made up of US businessmen interested in what Panama has to offer as a market and/or business gateway to the Americas because of its connectivity and logistics infrastructure.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft's presence in Panama spans over 15 years. We are one of the oldest IT companies working here directly from its own office. While other IT providers tend to work exclusively through their partners, we work directly with over 1,000 small companies that resell our products and services. I also have responsibility for liaising with the government. We work with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Commerce and Industries in assisting around 3,000 small companies to develop and grow faster, driven by technology. Three years ago, Steve Ballmer, our former CEO, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with President Ricardo Martinelli, outlining different areas for us to work on, including education, SMEs, and intellectual property rights. We also requested President Martinelli's contribution.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>First, this is a country that provides a complete business environment; we act as a hub and as a service center. We are excellently located in the middle of the continent, and, thus, in almost the same time zone for all the Americas. Transport from Panama is convenient to any country in Latin America, and to any part of the US or Canada. The nation also boasts a highly educated population. Of our 2,500 employees, 95% are Panamanian. To date we have already invested $98 million annually, since 2003. We are in the process of privatizing the company, and are analyzing all investments in the region accordingly. The idea we have in Panama is to sustain our growth because it is an excellent location and well placed to serve the rest of the Americas from here. We are making plans for an IT hub with a staff headcount of around 100 people for this calendar year and the beginning of the next. This is a time consuming venture where people require training, and where regional activities need to be aligned.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have a presence in many regions for different purposes, like tax registration, and observation and research of taxation (ORTAX) issues. That is why we made the split into separate countries. Much of our financing has traditionally been done in Europe, but following the financial crisis, this supply notably diminished. We factor in the respective countries' economic size. At the moment, both South American east coast and west coast countries are the most important for us. Our key route is Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay, and the second Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. On the Pacific Coast is the port of Buenaventura. And we also use Panama as a hub to reach Caribbean markets. Right after them, we have the Central American countries: Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica. East coast countries are also very close in terms of size and business value to the west coast countries. For example, to the South American east coast, our weekly capacity is 4,000 TEUs, and the west coast 3,000 TEUs. All together we are talking about 9,000-10,000 TEUs per week for Asia and Latin America alone. Once we factor in further regional surveys, the figure naturally rises.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Panama is our fifth hub globally. As a hub, we have strong relationships with different ports both on the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans. We have also made fruitful use of the Panama Canal, the railroad network, and the logistics providers. The competitive advantage that we have is our intensive use of diverse logistics operators and stakeholders in Panama, among which there is considerable cooperation. What we have in Panama is not only critical for this market, but also for the way in which we cover Latin America and the Caribbean, as 14% of our global volume goes through Panama. Our most important routes right now, in terms of volume, are Asian imports. Two Post-Panamax vessels arrive every week from China, Korea, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia, covered from Panama, and serving the Caribbean and the west coast of South America. In terms of growth, the inter-American routes are key. The region is booming, and we have many opportunities here, which is the reason we are launching a new inter-Americas specialized carrier called SeaLand, and which will be operational in 2015.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Panama is an important part of our operations because it is the ideal place to carry out shipping operations. It is a primary port of passage for ships coming from Asia to the East Coast of the US, which is exactly how Panama came to be seen as a container transshipment hub as far back as 1995. In 1995, MOL signed a contract with Manzanillo International Terminal, which was our first hub in Panama. We then decided that we already had a hub on the Atlantic side so ships would transit and offload cargo there and we could connect with feeder vessels into South America and the Caribbean region. We decided we could also tap into places like Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Chile. We then opened a hub at Balboa Terminal, which despite minor setbacks has worked well for us. With the stabilization of services on both sides, the Atlantic and Pacific, we were able to establish a complete transshipment operation. It certainly makes sense to opt for Panama as a hub for the Americas in the same way that Asia has a hub in Singapore and Europe in Rotterdam. However, in Latin America, there is no doubt that Brazil is also critical, followed by Colombia, Venezuela, and Puerto Rico, and we have had success in Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. We plan to start operations in Guatemala in 2014.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Coming from the other global freight forwarders I used to work for, Central America is always a confusing market for global players. They feel that they should have a presence, yet they are not sure what they should be doing. There are many financial, customs, logistics, and political issues to face here. If you look around, you will not find many operations like this one for a global logistics or freight forwarding company. We invested a considerable sum of money to establish this operation because we believe in Panama and we believe in Central America. Our company has operations in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and we have agents in Nicaragua and Honduras. We have improved significantly since the Colón Free Zone was established, but I think that we need to put in more effort than we have been doing. Panama had a competitive advantage at that time, and customs were not as regulated as they are today. Now, countries like the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and even Colombia that are looking to do something like we are doing here.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Sustained growth has helped us to swiftly increase the capacity of our facility. When we started out, we developed the local market with limited interest in the international dimension. We are now beginning to look beyond Panama's borders, while remaining based in the country. Moreover, Panama's status as a logistics hub has the promise to expand our business tenfold. Currently, we have 3,000 PAL capacity, but our five-year plan anticipates growth to 54,000 PAL. We currently work with customers including Nestle and Supermercados Rey, one of the largest supermarket chains in Panama. We also work with Burger King and dairy product producer Estrella Azul. We are located right at the heart of Panama, which plugs us into the world. The Suez Canal only accesses the Mediterranean Sea and parts of Africa and Asia, whereas the Panama Canal is strategically located for access to both the East and West coasts of the US and Central and South America, while also boasting easy access to Europe, Western Africa, and Asia.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>DHL has two different divisions in Panama; DHL Express and DHL Global Forwarding, which complement each other. Global forwarding is more about ocean freight, airfreight, containers, warehouses, and also the road network within Central America. In the case of Express, it is a courier service that is very fast for the market. We connect overnight to Ecuador, Venezuela, Colombia, Central America, and the US. Meaning, particularly in the case of Panama being a hub for cargo, our customers can hire us to move all the goods from the Colón Free Zone right across Central America overnight. Also, the entire inventory is in Colón, meaning there are no taxes paid at the moment. This allows for an increased amount of flexibility in terms of inventory. With the expansion of the Panama Canal, we are expecting larger volumes coming in and out, and definitely a lower cost for sending goods by ocean freight. Panama will also be more attractive to use as a distribution center. It has many advantages, but I still think the canal is very relevant and the center of everything we do.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our strategy and focus has been to provide best-in-class outsourcing solutions and high quality of service and support to retain and attract our client customer base. Specifically, we strive to provide an outsourcing solution that enhances our customer service, sales experience, and other activities, such as social media, collections, retention, and even back-office work. Our strategy as a company is to have a robust presence and share our experience. The Panama customer experience centers are a priority for Sitel, due to their strategic location in the LATAM region, the Panama Canal, value versus the US dollar, and our close proximity to the US. As an experienced organization, we have a very particular standard called our “Global Operating System." This is a business model used across the board at Sitel. It is frequently revised and improved with input from our leadership, customers, and key personnel to make ourselves better and to understand that the call center industry is evolving and changing. For example, social media is more in demand. The faster we can adapt to the market's needs, the more successful we will become. It is about understanding the needs of our clients because they know what they want. It's about sharing what we know and becoming their partners.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Panama is a safe country, and when clients from countries like the US come to Panama, the environment is similar to Florida or other southern states. It is a safe starting point for a company that is new to outsourcing. Often, outsourcing involves currency exchange and cultural shock. For better or worse, Panama is very Americanized. You see all of the popular brand names here, and our shopping centers are indistinguishable from those in the US. Panama has the same currency and the same credit card system as the US. The country is very stable with a working middle-class, which puts Panama in a strong position. Certainly it is not the cheapest country in the region, but it compensates with its economic stability. We service Fortune 500 companies from the US, although not exclusively from our Panama locations. In Panama specifically, we service major telecom, logistics, and retail companies, as well as financial institutions. We also provide service to regional clients from Panama. We run a call center for the electrical company in Panama, ENSA, and for KFC and Pizza Hut.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our Panamanian office primarily focuses on first-party customer service, accounts receivables management, and business process outsourcing. We have strategically diversified the type of clients that we have, to not just ARM clients, but also the early stage debts, such as those calling customers who overlooked paying a bill and just need a gentle reminder. We offer a soft and friendly approach, which suits Panamanians, as the society is strongly service oriented, and a full 92% of our GDP comes from the service industry. We provide support for different industries, including the telecommunications, mortgage, and auto segments. Approximately 14% of Panamanian citizens are English speakers, so the talent pool is small, and when you take out people in the professional arena that speak English the percentage is even smaller, so there is a lot of competition within the call center industry to recruit and retain the best employees. Companies have to offer something that sets their organization apart. In our case, the things that define us are the skills that we impart to our entry-level employees up to our upper level management.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>I believe Panama is becoming an exemplar for other countries in the region. The level of progress in different sectors of the economy that you see and the improvement in infrastructure are renowned. Panama is world class in transportation and logistics and financial services, but is also progressing at a fast pace in other sectors such as tourism, health, and construction. Internally, we are working to capitalize on all the strengths that Panama boast. We are taking advantage of the logistics capabilities the country has to offer to be able to operate more efficiently with other countries in the region. One other example may be a new digital application for our Lubriderm product line (SunStop by Lubriderm), which helps people understand the risks of sun exposure. We were impressed by the level of support we received from different health institutions (Funda Cancer, Hospital Oncologico, and Asociacion de Dermatologos), as well as many other stakeholders. We continue to experience consistent and strong growth in Panama. We foresee that this trend will continue in 2014 and in the years to come. When we analyze internally how to allocate our resources, Panama always comes out as a top choice.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Bayer is a global enterprise with core competencies in the fields of health care, agriculture, and high-tech polymer materials. In July 2012, our department of Supply Chain Management for the distribution of products from Health Care for Central America and the Caribbean, as well as some countries in South America, was established in Panama. Currently, we ship products to 38 countries. Panama is our logistics hub managing all operations of import and export of Pharma and Consumer Care. As an innovation company, it sets trends in research-intensive areas. Bayer's products and services are designed to benefit people and improve their quality of life. A product that I can mention is Eylea, which is indicated for the treatment of patients with Macular Edema following Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO). Another product that we are launching is STIVARGA, a prescription medicine used to treat patients colon or rectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, and for which they have received previous treatment with certain chemotherapy medicines.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We entered the Panamanian market many years ago with a strategy of developing Sanofi in Latin America, where we are number one. The opportunities also went beyond Panama because we decided to locate our Central America and Caribbean hub here 10 years ago, while most of the pharmaceutical companies have their Central American business managed from Guatemala or Costa Rica. Of late, few companies have followed us in moving to Panama. We anticipate numerous opportunities here because Panama has been one of the fastest growing economies in past years, and the pharmaceutical market has a clear linkage with GDP growth. With a country that is developing so rapidly, we are seeing a number of new policies in healthcare. We are an important player in providing services for the government; we sell products to institutions, and are probably among the top-five government providers. In the private sector, we see an extremely dynamic and growing market, probably one of the fastest growing within Central America. Accordingly, we have adapted our portfolio to ensure that we can service the community.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our company is a provider of new ship parts and manufactured second-hand parts. We detected there was a lack of this type of service within the sector. Normally, when a ship needs a repair done, you have to send it to the shipyard in Europe where it was built. However, some ships are obsolete; they are taken apart, and they have intact replacement parts. Anchors, transmissions, bearings, and an endless number of replacement parts are still useful, and that can save the operation of a ship in a short amount of time and at a lower cost. I go on board the ships that are being taken apart, I point out the things I consider useful, and they take them out, bring them to our warehouse; they are revised, tested, and put on sale.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>For us the Canal Expansion Project means we will mean greater transit volumes and, as a result, the opportunity to expand. Because of that project we had to supplement our services and now have four companies. The main company remains PROSHIP, for steel contractors and other repairs. Then we have a diving company, for underwater inspections, another for professional manpower supply, and one that supplies consumables. In terms of the clients we are most interested in reaching, the managers of ships are crucial in that they are the individuals that place the orders on behalf of the owners themselves. These managers are generally based in Greece, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Germany. We have been keen to familiarize this group with our service offering of quality and time-effectiveness, and have sought to establish lasting relationships. Minor differences in price may not be an issue, but timing always is, and if a vessel goes over time charters can be lost.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The main ship services we provide are related to repairing the different components in an engine room. The equipment is divided into three important parts: the main engine, the auxiliary engines, and their components. The components to which we provide services are: the cylinder head, the cylinder liner, the fuel pump, the injector, the turbo charger, the governors, and the purifiers. These services are divided into two stages, the first stage takes place at the vessel and the second stage takes place at our workshop. On occasions, the customer only requests the service on board or in the workshop. Innovation is very important for DES; we must be up to date with what is out there in order to provide what the market demands.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We began with mostly corporate business, which remained our core activity for the first five years of operations. Following an acquisition, we expanded more into personal and retail banking. Since then, we have basically implemented what we call a universal banking strategy. In other words, we participate in many different markets in Panama, as long as they are viable in terms of a risk/return profile. The reason we have grown is because we started with a clear strategy in a growing economy; that and the fact that we have maintained a high level of service and are able to respond to our clients' needs efficiently compared to other local and foreign banks that operate in Panama. The investment banking industry in Panama has progressed significantly, and it is now a fundamental part or Panama's financial landscape. The increase in the size of transactions and deals partially explains this trend. In the past, these transactions were not sufficiently large enough to demand the participation of an investment banking team, as they do now. Today we have much larger transactions that need to be structured specifically to meet the demands of the issuers and the potential clients or investors.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The partners of Morgan &amp; Morgan founded MMG Bank &amp; Trust in 1996 in the Bahamas. Then, in 1992, we established our presence in Panama with a full general banking license, whereupon we began to experience notable growth. Our corporate finance area structures mostly publicly listed bond issues for highly visible and reputable companies in Panama and the region. These are companies who want to move away from bank loans, so that the market, and not necessarily a financial institution, dictates what they should be paying in terms of their interest rates for their debt. In terms of asset management, in 2013, we did remarkably well, and in 2014 we expect to grow our total assets under management to $2 billion. The country's legal infrastructure is attractive for people in the region, especially those coming from less stable countries. One of the most important strengths as a bank is the affiliation with the Morgan &amp; Morgan Group as it is a consistent source of clients, not only from Panama, but from other regions where the group has a presence. Clients' recommendations vary according to their particular risk profile, but our focus is always diversification and protection of the assets.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Today, the majority of our assets are in corporate and private banking, but we are targeting small entrepreneurs. We educate our customers about how best to manage their companies and family businesses, as well as their marketing. This also helps us because successful businesses repay loans. We experienced a $1.1 billion growth in assets in 2013. What we did in six years, other banks do in 16 years. Even though the financial crisis shook the banking sector in 2008, people knew that we were a new bank, and that we were not weighed down with junk bonds. People trusted us more than the older banks. We began with 25 staff, and today we have 350. There are now five branches offering many products and services, so we decided that 2014 would be a consolidation year, and in 2015 we will open more branches. I think that the Panamanian banking sector is very stable. As a country, we have existed for over 100 years, since 1903. Citibank was established at that time, and today we have 92 banks, 20 of which are Panamanian, while the other 72 are foreign.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The sector has grown to the point where today's 32 companies are to be joined by a further two that have recently been approved. Not surprisingly then, margins have become squeezed, with technical margins virtually at zero. A glance at the figures reveals an industry in growth with a healthy balance between diverse business lines. Yet the bottom gives a less than glowing account of sector performance. I would recommend potential entrants take a good look at the publicly available financials. I expect this to change to a degree because of the cyclicality factor. And yet I foresee sector consolidation over the next five to 10 years through mergers and acquisitions as the market becomes too small. We intend to play a role in these developments as the national leader. There is quite clearly an opportunity to make a serious advance in Panama within the next few years. In 2014, we will experience a general economic slowdown, but nonetheless register important growth when compared to other regional nations. And in terms of the insurance sector Panama will face a major challenge, as coverage of large-scale projects is not renewed. Bonds and construction policies are not renewable, with policies being written at the start of a project.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We wanted to target a niche where there was not much competition, such as the micro insurance services sector. We started our company serving low-income people with accessible premiums. Now, we are the ninth largest local firm and have had solid growth. In the last three years we grew from premiums of $500,000 to $42 million. We think this year we will go above $50 million in premiums, the Panamanian market is growing and we are taking advantage of that. We are also thinking of expanding to two other countries in the region one in the south and the other in Central America. One market that is very attractive for us is Colombia, so about a year ago we started to find a way to buy an insurance company there. We found a company that we could buy called “Eco Seguros." We are opening offices there in the coming months and will change the entity's name to our brand name “Nacional de Seguros." We have more than 100 agencies in the country and offer insurance through these agents. We are also venturing into something that is just starting in Panama, involving selling via massive agents like supermarkets.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Competition is high in Panama because brokers have fully penetrated the entire industry. One of the most important strengths our company has is our qualified staff. All of our employees have had previous experience at other companies. Insurance is a face-to-face business, but we also offer new and innovative products. If you pretend to sell the same as everyone else, you simply do not have any added value to incorporate into your product offering. We therefore developed a portfolio of tailor-made products. When we started out, we had seven products, and by the end of 2014 we expect to be selling more than 15. I think automotive and car insurance are the most demanded forms of coverage, but to that we might also add sureties, health, and individual life insurance. The board of directors of the company are conservative. They have a mix of banking experience abroad, and technical expertise in the sale of insurance products. They are also pursuing conservative goals for the coming years. They do not expect to see major increases, believing, rather, that by the end of the year, we need to demonstrate not only that we have increased, but also that we are contributing positively to the sector.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Pan-American Life is an insurance company focused on the local sales of life, accident, and health insurance. With more than a century of experience, we are the insurance company with the largest presence of personal insurance in Panama, and throughout the region. Our strategy has been to cater to individuals and corporations, leading both life and health sectors of the insurance industry. Our clients are individuals as well as local companies, banks and multinational companies across the Central American region. As a consequence of Law No. 41,we are also focusing on multinational companies that are arriving in Panama, as well as those from Colombia and Ecuador. Our main focus is the Americas, Central America, the Andean and Caribbean regions, the US, and Mexico. The expansion of the Pan-American Life Insurance Group into Mexico is a natural step that supports the company's strategic plan for Latin America and is focused on the international major medical and personal accidents lines. As a result of the Alico (previously part of MetLife) acquisition, 37% of our revenues come from the US and 63% are from our international businesses, with Panama itself representing 13%.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The growth of the economy is related to the growth of the insurance sector. For example, in 2006, we had premiums of $596 million, in 2011 we achieved premiums of $1.03 billion, and in 2013 we achieved premiums worth $1.24 billion, recording growth of more than 9%. The 2012 Insurance Law is also a major factor. This law is a major achievement for the insurance sector, and it is the result of the collaboration of the Superintendence, the insurance companies, brokers, and the government. For six to eight months, we were trying to come to an agreement to get every player of the sector involved. We introduced alternative channels of distribution. Previously, Panama was only a market for brokers. With this law, the companies can now offer services through alternative means of marketing, such as supermarkets and gas stations, for example. They need to have a contract between the insurance company and distribution channel, and these contracts must be supervised and approved by the Superintendence.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Zambia's location is a huge advantage for us. We can grow crops here and export them in any direction. Our seed producers send seeds as far as Kenya, but continue to produce here in Zambia. The Link Zambia 8000 project will be hugely beneficial for us, allowing us to export our goods through our border regions more efficiently and safely. At the moment, we are running with a project to focus on small-hold farmers, as these farmers are typically not based along existing railway lines. They are in the more remote parts of the country, so the opening of roads makes it easier for us to deliver products there. We are pushing technologies that will make them not just produce more, but also become more productive. The productivity per unit area should go up. Once that happens we are likely to see a boom, and this increased produce will need a market. This is something we think the government is doing right, and we hope that these projects continue. The Link Zambia 8,000 project is something that will change the face of agriculture, not just in Zambia.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Around 50% of the new vehicles that are sold in Zambia are made by Toyota. In 2013, we maintained our market share, but unfortunately the market is declining. New vehicle sales are declining because of the huge unregulated influx of second-hand vehicles into the country. That has a negative impact on our business. Around 5,000 second-hand vehicles are sold monthly in Zambia; in comparison, total new vehicle sales are around 4,500 units annually. Toyota estimates the total vehicle park in Zambia to be around about 500,000 units. Obviously, improving the roads will fuel our business, although it can also have a downside. One of our top-selling vehicles is the Hilux, a pickup truck. That model accounts for probably around 70% of our sales. Once the government has fixed all the roads, people will need fewer pickups.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>If I were to sum it up, our major success is our participation and contribution to Zambia's growth in the major sectors of the economy: mining, agriculture, and construction being some of the notable ones. One of the things we are now looking at in terms of participating in Zambia's growth going forward is our contribution in the power sector. Most recently, Citi pledged to source $2.5 billion in incremental capital to improve access to electricity for millions of people across Africa, as part of the “Power Africa“ initiative. If you look at Zambia's success in the past few years, and more so over the past decade, the country has been growing at phenomenal rates of over 6% and we are happy to have been part of this story. We believe that innovation is important to sustainable growth in any industry. We will continue to innovate on the technology front and the way we do business in general. We expect we will become much more efficient and reduce costs and continuously improve in our service delivery to our clients.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Clearly, the road projects have been a key driver of growth in the last few years. A country like Zambia needs to upgrade its level of infrastructure because its potential to grow is closely linked to the logistical connections with all the neighboring countries, and there are many of them, which means many opportunities to export. Infrastructure is absolutely key. Road building is going on at a quick pace. In the coming years, rail will also become an important segment. We have the infrastructure, which in the past two years has probably been the fastest pace-setter in the economy. We also have a high growth rate in the commercial sector. There are many new shopping centers popping up around Lusaka. There was a real lack of them before. It's not just Lusaka. You see the same in Ndola and other cities. Those cities are transforming themselves. This is all very encouraging and very much in line with our ambitions to build better cities.</p>]]></sections31>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>CHANDA MUTONI</h4><p>This year is actually also the 20th anniversary of Stockbrokers Zambia Limited (SBZ). We are very privileged to be a founder broker member of the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE), and today, the only remaining founding broker member amongst six broker members of the LuSE. SBZ has therefore played a pioneering role in the development and growth of the capital market in Zambia since 1994 and as a result has developed a deep understanding of both the regulatory framework underpinning the LuSE and the securities market environment in Zambia in general. SBZ has thus been involved in many of the large landmark transactions in the country over the life of the stock market. We started with the listing of Lafarge in 1995 and more recently we have been involved in the first ever bond issuance by the international Finance Corporation (IFC), the first ever AAA rated issuance in Zambia; the equity auction placement of Lafarge PLC shares (the first ever equity auction on the LuSE); the balance-sheet restructuring and capital raising by ZCCM Investments Holdings Plc; and the successful listing of Madison Financial Services PLC. The Madison IPO was the first on the LuSE in six years and we are proud to have.</p><h4>CEASAR SIWALE</h4><p>We think of ourselves as the funnel for capital wishing to match/identify Zambian assets. The assets are in country, and the capital is typically outside. And that capital is in two forms: firstly, cash for a business to expand or commence new ventures, and secondly human capital when someone comes in with a specific skill set that might not exist in country. For example, when we opened the theater Fresh View there were no cinemas in the county. We had to teach the staff how to operate the digital projectors, the integrated points of sale to how to handle the cinema tickets and be ushers because multiple generations of Zambians had not had this experience for many years. When we did the Mugg &amp; Bean, we had to take a group of Zambians to South Africa to teach them how to make the coffee and train them in customer service. All of that is a transfer skill, and from my perspective it is very important. As the middle class emerges we will see more Zambians travel a lot more and experience a top class service and they return home they will /should expect the same level of service.</p><h4>MUCHINDU KASONGOLA</h4><p>MAMCo was set up in 2008, initially to house the treasury and investment functions of the Madison Group. As you may be aware, MAMCo is a subsidiary of Madison Financial Services Plc, which includes two insurance companies and a micro-lending business that all require investment management services. The introduction of MAMCo meant that investment management competences would be housed in one entity, eliminating the redundancy that would have arisen in having similar functions replicated in each of the companies in the financial services Group. In addition, this structure enabled the Group benefit from economies that came with managing a larger pool of assets under one entity. After a few months of operation, it became apparent that we could do a great deal more than serving only the Madison Group's companies, which focused on insurance funds. In this regard, we set out to look at other complementary offerings targeted at third-party clients outside the Group. We applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission then for a Collective Investment Scheme license to enable us to manage, promote, and administer mutual funds or unit trusts. We also set out to get a license for membership on the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) that would enable us offer trade execution and brokerage services to our clients.</p><p>© The Business Year</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TREVOR JENGAJENGA</h4><p>In this market, penetration levels remain low, at 5% or less. It is like that because we have tended to concentrate on one niche—the corporates. The life insurance aspect has not been developed and no one has focused on it, particularly at the individual level. Also, most providers have neglected the mass market. About 80% of the population today is poor, so for a long time we haven't been able to develop specific products that would incorporate them. This is a young industry that until 1991 was also a monopoly, and no one took the initiative to develop products that would serve the average person. But, now because of competition, we have gradually seen insurance companies moving away from competing on price to competing on service, and now competing on mass marketing and niche products. Premiums are relatively low, but because we are doing mass marketing, we intend to create many new customers.</p><h4>AGNES N. CHAKONTA</h4><p>When you look at the population, how many of them have a policy? Very few people are insured. From an industry perspective, our activities are limited. Therefore insurance penetration is very low as evidenced by its contribution to the country's GDP. To improve on market penetration there is an imperative need to educate the people and the distributors of insurance. MLife is committed to public awareness. We do a lot of extensive training to educate our sales team about insurance in an effort to improve their interactions, and pass on the benefit to clients and the general populace. Of note, very few sales people join us with basic insurance knowledge. Most of them are straight from colleges, and you find that the Zambian educational system does not really address insurance. Hence, their knowledge of insurance and other financial products is limited.</p><h4>TITUS KALENGA</h4><p>Our income is in excess of about $30 million as of now. We are poised to grow in the next three years, and our goal is to be the number one insurance company in Zambia. Early in 2014, the shareholders of our company changed. We are now partly owned by one of the largest insurance groups in South Africa called Santam. It is a life insurance company, and it is probably the biggest life company in South Africa, which also ultimately own by Sanlam. These two now have an interest in our company to an extent of 49%. We remain on 51% as NICO Holdings. These guys have the muscle, the technical know-how, and the financial capability. Of the South African government's investments in Africa, probably the largest is in Zambia. My intuition is that clients will come to me. As I am talking to you we are growing to an extent of 62% over the budget this year alone. It is not yet over. Over the past year, we will have grown by 65%. Over the next three months, I need to catch up. My market share right now is about 10%-12%, but I am targeting between 15% and 20%.</p><h4>HUMPHREY KABWE</h4><p>When we came to Zambia, we thought there was a slight gap in the insurance business as at the time, there were not that many players in the sector. We thought we could come in and fill that gap. Most of the insurance companies here were focused on the traditional covers, namely property and automobile. Our primary focus, apart from providing the traditional covers, was giving cover to small- and medium-sized farmers.

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In this market, penetration levels remain low, at 5% or less. It is like that because we have tended to concentrate on one niche—the corporates. The life insurance aspect has not been developed and no one has focused on it, particularly at the individual level. Also, most providers have neglected the mass market. About 80% of the population today is poor, so for a long time we haven't been able to develop specific products that would incorporate them. This is a young industry that until 1991 was also a monopoly, and no one took the initiative to develop products that would serve the average person. But, now because of competition, we have gradually seen insurance companies moving away from competing on price to competing on service, and now competing on mass marketing and niche products. Premiums are relatively low, but because we are doing mass marketing, we intend to create many new customers.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>When you look at the population, how many of them have a policy? Very few people are insured. From an industry perspective, our activities are limited. Therefore insurance penetration is very low as evidenced by its contribution to the country's GDP. To improve on market penetration there is an imperative need to educate the people and the distributors of insurance. MLife is committed to public awareness. We do a lot of extensive training to educate our sales team about insurance in an effort to improve their interactions, and pass on the benefit to clients and the general populace. Of note, very few sales people join us with basic insurance knowledge. Most of them are straight from colleges, and you find that the Zambian educational system does not really address insurance. Hence, their knowledge of insurance and other financial products is limited.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our income is in excess of about $30 million as of now. We are poised to grow in the next three years, and our goal is to be the number one insurance company in Zambia. Early in 2014, the shareholders of our company changed. We are now partly owned by one of the largest insurance groups in South Africa called Santam. It is a life insurance company, and it is probably the biggest life company in South Africa, which also ultimately own by Sanlam. These two now have an interest in our company to an extent of 49%. We remain on 51% as NICO Holdings. These guys have the muscle, the technical know-how, and the financial capability. Of the South African government's investments in Africa, probably the largest is in Zambia. My intuition is that clients will come to me. As I am talking to you we are growing to an extent of 62% over the budget this year alone. It is not yet over. Over the past year, we will have grown by 65%. Over the next three months, I need to catch up. My market share right now is about 10%-12%, but I am targeting between 15% and 20%.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>When we came to Zambia, we thought there was a slight gap in the insurance business as at the time, there were not that many players in the sector. We thought we could come in and fill that gap. Most of the insurance companies here were focused on the traditional covers, namely property and automobile. Our primary focus, apart from providing the traditional covers, was giving cover to small- and medium-sized farmers. This is a gap that most insurance companies have not ventured into, and we felt we needed to go down that route. We have teamed up with and received substantial support from micro-insurance organizations that support this sector of the business. The peace and stability that existed in Zambia, and the policies we saw in terms of what we wanted to support from an insurance angle, brought us here and we got convinced that this was the place to be.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our primary products are meat and broiler chickens. We buy day-old chicks, grow them on the farm and process them at our plant. We also have a 420-head in milk dairy herd, and process milk on the farm. Additionally, we have a network of retail outlets throughout Zambia through which we sell our milk and chicken produce. And while we sell beef, we do not produce it ourselves. Galaunia Farms has expanded over the years, and our farming has become much more intense. Initially we were engaged in cattle ranching, which requires a large area, but have since discontinued this activity, and operate today around 3,000 hectares of land. The bulk of our production is sold directly to fast-food restaurants and institutional caterers, such as mines, universities, hotels, and other retailers. Shoprite, the largest retailer in Zambia, is one of our core customers, for example. Our sales are fairly evenly split between Shoprite, institutional customers, our own retail, and fast-food restaurants.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We could easily have become a warehouse like many companies, but in doing so no value is added to the country. Therefore, we have developed the dairy sector over the past 16 years and today operate 100 medium- to large-scale farms, and have 30 milk-collection centers for small-scale farmers. We support 3,500 such individuals and collect 7,500 liters solely from those milk-collection centers each year, and the volume is rising. One center is generating ZMW600,000 for the local community, adding value to the beef herd, as it is traditionally a beef producing region where crossbreeding results in better stock. Those 30 milk centers are a testimony to regional growth. Basically, we prefer to produce in the countries we are present in in order to support our brand. Moreover, all of that knowledge is transferred, whereby any talent we develop here can be used locally or else sent to our other facilities around the region. Ours is a great company to work for and considerable opportunities are available to our 400 staff.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We started operations in August 2013 as an important part of a German group known as CLAAS, which combines tractors, machinery, and other agricultural equipment. We import the equipment and have dealers in place that provide after-sales services. It has been difficult because people are not used to it. However, we are optimistic and we are up to the challenge. We are here to listen to the farmer, and in terms of the investment we are well rewarded. Since August we have sold ZMW10 million in equipment and machinery, and this gives us great optimism and zeal. Agriculture is the solution to the unemployment issue. Around 70% of the Zambian workforce is employed in agriculture and there is a lot of space to diversify the economy and grow in other industries. We are very optimistic about the market, because it is growing and the farmers will need new machines. Right now we have a 5% market share, but we expect it to grow up to 10% in the next years.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Dubai is a completely unique destination with its own brand of international and multicultural hospitality. It has international appeal as a travel and business hub, not to mention the world-class leisure attractions that continue to position Dubai as a premium and aspirational city to visit. Over the last five years, we have witnessed rapid growth and development here making Dubai a global leader in the hospitality industry, and this is due to the vision and perseverance of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum and the ruling family in building this remarkable city. We also aim to be unique in the level of guest services we provide. To cater to the diversity of the international guests we host, we have employed more than 1,000 people from 70 different countries as our JW Marriott Marquis associates. This enables us to become a truly international destination, where language and cultural barriers are eliminated and every guest feels at home. We also train our associates to behave according to our brand pillar of intuitive service. Many hotels train people to simply take an order and deliver food, but the hard part is really to teach people to anticipate what a guest needs before they ask. This might mean remembering the type of coffee the guest prefers in the morning, opening a door before it's approached, or preparing special amenities for guests who are celebrating or had a difficult day. This is exceptional service and this is what we endeavor to provide.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We bring European luxury to Dubai and, in doing so, we provide guests with a perfect balance of European luxury and style and the rich heritage and warm hospitality of the region. We pride ourselves on the quality of services we provide to our guests, such as our limousine pick-up services from the airport, the lady in red in the lobby—a signature of the Kempinksi group—and our international cuisine, which all add to that special guest experience. You will always find a lot of Arabic ingredients, dishes, and traditions in our restaurants, as well as in the amenities we send up to the room. In this way, we are integrating local traditions. Dubai as a much sought-after destination definitely helps our brand to become even more international than before because of the diversity of the business and leisure travelers passing through. It is also a great destination for corporate customers, and we have agreements with global companies such as IBM and Siemens. Dubai is like a showroom for the rest of the world where we are not yet positioned and our presence in the UAE helps us grow in other markets such as Africa and the Middle East.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>At Raffles Dubai, our competitive advantage consists of our caring colleagues, our high level of service, and the genuine earnest we convey toward our guests. It all comes down to the delivery and the quality. Annually, around 35% of our visitors are repeat guests, and we always find a way to exceed their expectations. There are a lot of attractive rates in the city, but I believe our guests choose to return to Raffles Dubai because of our fantastic colleagues. In a competitive market like Dubai, the people and their services are what matter the most. Consequently, the price becomes a secondary factor. Our guests are well-traveled; hence, it is important that we pay attention to their needs. People from different backgrounds and cultures have different expectations. Emotional intelligence is key to understanding your guests, and at Raffles Dubai we offer the ultimate in emotional luxury. In 2013, Raffles Dubai closed at an average occupancy rate of 80%, which is exceptionally high. This year we are anticipating that we will maintain the same figures, although many new hotels have joined the Dubai market. Our biggest yielding element is going to be our room rates. We have great strategies in place and are feeling very positive about our rate growth. Our guests are still willing to pay for a quality experience and Dubai as a city holds an alluring attraction to travelers worldwide.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Al Nabooda Automobiles is the sole distributor of Porsche, Audi, and Volkswagen in Dubai and the Northern Emirates.  In recent years, we have become the world's largest Porsche dealer and also account for more than one-third of all Audi and Volkswagen sales in the GCC. In 2012, we announced an AED900 million investment program to expand and enhance our operations in Dubai and the Northern Emirates, covering 10 individual projects. The first phase included the construction of the world's largest Audi new car sales terminal, which opened in Dubai in November 2012 at a cost of AED118.5 million. Work continues apace in delivering the 10 projects, which make up our current expansion investment program. We have recently opened the new AED85.5 million Al Nabooda Automobiles combined sales and after sales center for the Porsche, Audi, and Volkswagen brands in Fujairah and the AED120 million facility combining Porsche, Audi, and Volkswagen showrooms and workshops in Sharjah. Also pending final planning approvals, construction will commence soon on an AED300 million vehicle pre-delivery center and paint and body shop on a massive 130,000-sqm site at Jebel Ali.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>At the end of 2013, we launched the new Toyota Corolla and the Yaris sedan. We are just reaching our first full months of sales for those new models, which comprise a large part of our passenger car range. We have also completely remodeled the 2014 model year RAV4, and we will launch a new Toyota Yaris hatchback as well and another new model in the second quarter of the year. For Lexus, we will introduce a brand new model called Lexus RC and RCF, which is the sports version of the car that debuted at the Geneva Motor Show. It is an exciting year for us in terms of new models. Toyota is the market leader in the UAE, and we expect to retain our market leadership in 2014. The business is growing and we are investing in our infrastructure to better support our customers. We are investing heavily in training our staff to enhance our customer service. As the market grows, it is important to invest in the infrastructure we already have to support our customers.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Renault Middle East was launched in February of 2013 to promote the brand in the region, and so is a new component of the overall Renault Group. Phase one of our strategy was to make a clear analysis of the market, and assess Renault's weaknesses and strengths in the area, and to define short-, mid-, and long-term plans. In 2013 we increased our sales in GCC markets by 19% while the market was growing only by 8%. We have also brought out a wider product range during this phase, having achieved our first-year objectives of pushing for sales and being seen to be active. We will continue to pursue growth and aim to outperform our 2013 numbers. Renault worldwide has a formidable reputation for us to build on by making full use of our expanding network coverage. The UAE, and Dubai in particular, are the most dynamic markets in the region and offer the greatest potential for the company, which is why Renault Middle East is headquartered here. And aside from competitors, there are also complementary companies present here. In terms of the Middle East overall, the primary market is Iran, although the business climate can be rather challenging. The second largest market is Saudi Arabia, and the third the UAE.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>On the topic of start-ups and how to support SMEs, I would say the most important item here is the launch of Office 365. We have built a package so that any SME that wants to start its business in Dubai—or they are already having a business in Dubai—when they go to renew their license, they will receive this package, which has a data plan. We will enable them to start their business without any major initial investment, and for SMEs that is crucial. If their business is not IT, we can simplify things for them, and that will help them grow. In 2014, we have also signed with in5, which is an incubator a start-up owned by TECOM Investments, to provide all its start-ups with free software, and we will also connect in5 with the other initiatives that we are launching with universities in the UAE.</p>]]></sections01>

What the company has achieved is to apply its pedigree in knowing how documents move through organizations to develop a wide range of services around document management, and the most commonly understood is Managed Print Services. However, there are lots of applications that start with just scanning information and developed into full-blown integrated services. The document is at the heart of every single business process, and that is the set spot of our knowledge and expertise. Today, the only thing that has changed is the way we help our clients become more efficient and save money. Providing more environmentally sound technologies and services is also becoming more relevant.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Cities can use networks to manage services, provide citywide information, learn how citizens use managed services, and deliver business opportunities. We have seen a major impact through our support of showcase Smart City initiatives in Barcelona, Spain; Nice, France; and Hamburg, Germany. For example, Barcelona's Born District uses Cisco Smart+Connected City Wi-Fi and sensing devices to enhance livability for citizens, create a smart city blueprint, and demonstrate thought leadership. Nice's “Connected Boulevard," meanwhile, provides smart city services such as circulation (traffic), lighting, waste management, and environmental monitoring. Hamburg uses Cisco Smart+Connected City Wi-Fi to improve service delivery to mobile citizens, boost the local economy, and provide smart parking.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The formula is basically good pricing and good service. We don't do cheap and cheerful; we cater to the high end of the market. We use technology with the boats to make them work better. We have a custom-built management system with formulated algorithms that control the pricing based on supply and demand. Depending on how busy it is, the price will fluctuate. My background is actually in IT, so I have applied IT to maritime tourism. Xclusive Yachts has a diverse fleet, meaning we have small boats for two people for a couple hours, and then we have party boats. These are event yachts, meaning they tend to go out for about four hours, typically. We have boats from 22 feet long to a new 125-foot boat, which can cater to 200 people for large corporate events. All together, there are 17 yachts and boats in the fleet.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Dubai Marina Yacht Club caters to a variety of customers including boat owners, renters, residents, and tourists looking to enjoy our world-class repertoire of food and beverage outlets. We see a lot of interest from visitors from the GCC and other markets that are reflective of Dubai's tourism sector. We continue to innovate our services and facilities to uphold our world-class standards. We have a number of factors that work in our favor, such as the location within the largest marina in the world. As one of the key components of the larger Dubai Marina development, we position ourselves as a lifestyle destination that provides visitors with great services, unmatched views and unprecedented hospitality experiences. In fact, most recently, our services enabled us to receive the Five Gold Anchor award, which is undoubtedly the most prestigious accolade for marinas globally.</p>]]></sections11>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>It is important to develop the tourism sector in general in order to found the basis of a medical tourism sector. Currently, medical tourism is benefiting the provider rather than the patient. Of course profit is important, but institutions should be purpose-orientated. Services can be offered, but in terms of cost, Dubai cannot compete with Jordan, India, Turkey, Lebanon, or Thailand simply because Dubai has to import its human resources. In that respect, the sector must grow on quality of care and diversity of offers. Aligning our day-to-day operations with Joint Commission International (JCI) standards is one of the major moves that we have done to ensure that our patient safety standards remain uncompromised. We have established different committees tasked to look after all aspects of hospital services including risk management and patient safety. We also regularly perform case studies and create committees specifically for this purpose. However, quality is not just about getting accreditation; quality is a culture. In my first clinic, I was aware that I was not in a position to compete with the other private and public medical institutions offering free services, and the key to getting ahead was quality.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There are many new projects coming online and the authorities are doing a very good job in terms of regulating, enhancing, and developing the public sector. From a private healthcare perspective, the e-claims system will report healthcare provider activities both to the insurance companies and the regulator, meaning the regulator will have access to high-quality information to use in planning the future development of the sector. Another important strategy area is medical tourism and Dubai is in a good position to offer high-quality care and services, along with a very desirable destination, to international patients. These are two aspects of healthcare in Dubai that Moorfields is actively promoting. Since we opened in 2007, we have treated more than 31,000 patients and around 15% of our patients come from abroad—essentially, the GCC and MENA region. The global reputation of Moorfields is a vital advantage in attracting patients to our Dubai hospital for world-class treatment in the UAE, which will also extend to our new Abu Dhabi hospital in 2014.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In Europe, there are many centers for people to seek treatment for heart disease, cancer, and so on, but Dubai doesn't have that reputation. Dubai is not a center for tertiary medicine. It is, however, an excellent center for what we call elective procedures, such as cosmetic surgery. For procedures that are non-life threatening, people can very comfortably come to Dubai and be operated on by some excellent doctors. Dubai has a role to play in medical tourism particularly in the GCC; however, it has a long way to go before it is able to compete with Europe and North America, but those parts of the world have had decades to develop their healthcare systems, while Dubai has achieved an enormous amount in a short period of time and will catch up with the rest of the world. Our philosophy is to always meet a patient's expectations. Therefore, the focus should be on good clinical outcomes, as good clinical outcomes develop the reputation of our brand and provide long-term business growth.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>First of all we need to realize what medical tourism is. It is essentially people who will leave their existing country or place of residence to come to Dubai (potentially) for healthcare, and that will be because they either don't have the existing facilities in their own country, or because it would be cheaper to come to Dubai and be treated here than it would be to receive the same treatment in their own countries. Dubai is not cheap, and it cannot compare to places like India or Thailand, where there are excellent healthcare facilities for a lot cheaper. Price is determined by the cost of living in those countries, and it is obviously a lot lower in those countries than it is in Dubai. The cost of living in Dubai translates to higher salaries, which in turn translates into higher healthcare costs. Meaning, people will not come to Dubai for medical tourism because it is cheaper. Therefore, the only reason people will come to Dubai for healthcare is for quality. Dubai boasts many excellent facilities and our facilities are on par with any other facility in the world, but that being said, the perception of Dubai is one of being very new, and when people think of healthcare they like to consider older, established, well-proven places and institutions.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Our clinic has been designed to offer a comprehensive set of services and to be a one-stop solution for our patients, meaning that they can come and find all the services that they will need in one place. The clinic was designed not only for patients here in the UAE, but also all surrounding countries as well as patients from further afield, as we are centrally located here between Europe, Asia, and Africa. In many of those countries, patients don't have access to such services. Dubai is a hub that is very hospitable, welcoming, and easily accessible, while the quality of life here is both excellent as well as secure. It is an ideal place to deliver fast services to our patients. With regard to the outlook on our industry, the WHO states that three out of 1,000 children are born deaf. Considering this figure, the potential we have to service the region is high. I am happy to say that we have been able to attract many patients from the GCC and from Africa to come and use the services that we offer here in Dubai.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>I think one of the most important offers we have is our MBA program. In Dubai, the norm has been to fly in lecturers and teach Bachelor's courses in blocks, be it once or twice a month. Our program has regular classes spread out over the years so that learning opportunities are stronger. We include many extra-curricular activities. We do bring in numerous professionals from the industry to add value. We have a compulsory international aspect to our programs, whereby we take students overseas to apply what they have learned in an international setting. These trips are quite heavy in terms of requirements. The work is full on from the moment they land until the moment they leave. Our student body has grown, and we can't keep going to the same three places, as it would exhaust our resources. Our program is priced correctly, representing good value for money. It has certainly attracted considerable attention, having grown from 14 students in 2008 to over 240 today, with at least 200 people having graduated.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Dubai's society is international. The AUD has 105 nationalities represented in its student body. This diversity reflects the state of the city itself. Indeed, Dubai is even more diverse than our student population would reflect simply because I have heard numbers as high as 150 in terms of nationalities to have been granted visas to live and work in Dubai. And as with any form of diversity, the benefit derived is a richness of perspective and approach that yields superior results. Dealing exclusively with likeminded people yields little progress, which is why I consider diversity crucial to Dubai's success. The largest student group we have is Emirati, at somewhere between 15% and 17% of the population. Obviously, they are over-represented within AUD, and that to me is our greatest contribution to Emiratization. Our relationship with the Emirati community is such that they have placed faith in the university. Our contribution is to educate the students to a level that will enable them to compete with the best and brightest anywhere in world.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>From the first day, we decided to bridge the gap between theory and practice. We do not want to work in a way that only focuses on theory. If we look at our graduates as products, we cannot sell our products unless the people see their abilities. If you want to include someone in your organization, you will not ask them about their specializations, or their grades. The first thing you will ask is, “What do you know?" You do not ask them to define law. We focus on the practice and the skills that graduates should be equipped with to practice law. We have been to many organizations to sign MoUs in order to engage students in real-life situations and put them in real organizational contexts. For example, we have MoUs with Dubai Court, Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research, Dubai Financial Market, Dubai Chamber of Commerce, and Dubai Health Authority (in process). This is to prepare the students for the market.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>In regard to the authorities attempting to attract investment to establish Dubai as an educational hub, it is for the government to decide at the end of the day. There are free zones for those kinds of things in order to attract people. In many instances, foreign campuses will provide their own funds to build campuses; however, for any educational system to be solid, it has to find national investors. Dubai should concentrate more on developing a strong national university in Dubai so it gets government support, funding, and backing, and everything else so that when other foreign campuses decide to come, the educational system is already solid and ready. We are maintaining our standards at the highest level. We claim to be one of the strong universities here, although we only offer graduate studies with no undergraduate degrees. We are already establishing ourselves as a strong name here in the UAE. In the next five-to-10 years, if we continue this type of approach, we will be well established in the country.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We seek to leverage our technology platforms throughout the entire Gulf region. This said, Dubai is the optimal location from which to do so. Access to Dubai allows us to use our 3M Innovation Center, located in Dubai Internet City (DIC), to expose healthcare practitioners across the Middle East to the latest product applications and practices. A common business model is to share and, where possible, replicate already proven practices. One garners knowledge, experience, and best practices from abroad and applies it locally in a way that makes sense. It is important to understand that innovation centers are an important way for 3M to show our customers locally who we are and what we do. I am always amazed by what 3M achieves as a company in terms of the sheer breadth of innovative products and solutions offered to customers around the world. What we try to do in markets like the UAE is replicate on a smaller scale the 3M Innovation Center concept in St. Paul. Moreover, at our innovation center, we also demonstrate potential customer solutions that we may bring out into the region at some future time.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The City Index report analyzes the level of ICT driven benefits created in 11 of the MENA region's largest cities. Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Doha emerged as the top three cities in the ranking, and it makes a lot of sense as the maturity indicators reflect the aspirations of the government and its people. ICT deployment in the UAE has been progressively equated to socio-economic empowerment—empowerment not in terms of just providing connectivity, but in fostering entrepreneurship, and, through an extended scope, enhancing the quality of life of citizens. Qatar has a similar clear mission to the UAE, and is investing a lot in the country's infrastructure. I think all of these investments are fostering innovation and providing a great platform for any kind of business to grow. These countries are largely seen as being on the forefront of development when the vision is combined with clear plans of action.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Technology evolves at a tremendous rate, and establishing a long-term plan only does not always fit the industry well. This means that we are always kept on our toes. We have two principle focus areas. The first is basically to attract new companies into Dubai and the UAE, which is something we have achieved over recent years. Of course, as businesses change, we try to focus on the new industries that have the potential for growth and an appetite for the Middle East. Accordingly, the other part of the equation is to consider precisely which type of industrial activities we wish to attract. Microsoft is one of our partners and our partnership is mainly focused on start-ups. We also have a number of other partnerships and in different departments, companies, and sectors, focused on different spheres of activity. However our main partnerships, which are with numerous companies, are there to provide support to entrepreneurs. Microsoft has already gone through the process of signing an MoU to provide free software to companies within in5, the innovation hub launched in 2013.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In the UAE, we are absolutely at the center of the world in terms of digitalization. For the past three years, my mission has been to implement strategies to become the digital coach of companies leading this transformation, and also to work on major projects. Multinationals are working with us as partners in the development of their IT infrastructure. For the past two years, we have delivered more than 10 major projects in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. We are also connecting embassies all over the world with secure infrastructure, and security for an embassy is of course a must. We have delivered systems for one of the largest chemical producers in the Gulf, interconnecting more than 200 sites worldwide. Orange cannot be considered as just a telecoms company. We are delivering a package that integrates networks, information infrastructure, and applications. In smart cities, the application you have with our services will be around providing better interaction with the inhabitants by giving them access to the internet and services, all from a single integrated platform.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We use three global hubs: Cincinnati, Leipzig, and Hong Kong. These are our super major hubs and make all of the connections. From there, we go into regional hubs, one in Dubai and the DHL regional hub in Bahrain. We have main streams and side streams. Dubai is more of a commercial hub, which means that it is used more for commercial flights, while Bahrain is more of our own network hub. We serve approximately 150 flights a day from here commercially, including our own aircraft and those stemming from a joint venture. We have flights coming that we shuttle to Bahrain, among many others. Our key consideration, however, is how we can get your shipment to you tomorrow morning, anywhere in the world. That is why we are always looking to improve and enhance our service levels. At the moment, we work closely with Dubai International Airport and other airports in the UAE for the commercial flights. Al Maktoum is more of a cargo hub; however, it still serves us as a group, but as the Express division we need the commercial flight connections. The Dubai hub also serves as a connection for shipments from Africa, Asia, and Middle Eastern countries flying in and out again.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>FedEx is a major contributor to the business community. We facilitate international trade and enhance customer flexibility and speed to market through our well-established international air and intra-regional ground network, which connects over 99% of the world's GDP. Shippers from different industries turn to FedEx for its ability to provide access through innovative and customized solutions, and our business certainly benefits from that. As demand from key sectors grows, FedEx develops specific solutions that better meet its clients' logistics needs. For example, recognizing the growth of the aviation sector in the region and now specializing in shipping requirements, FedEx showcased its Aerospace Solutions during the 2013 Dubai Airshow. Companies from the aviation sector can now access an extensive range of FedEx-tailored shipping services that meet the time-sensitive demands of acquiring components to manufacture, maintain, or repair aircraft back into service. Such innovative solutions have enabled companies across different industries to reach new markets and fulfill the needs of their customers. Over the 41 years of our existence, we have constantly enhanced every aspect of customer interaction that facilitates the shipping process and enhances the overall experience.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The GCC logistics sector represents about $35 billion, with the major contributors from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Oman. In the UAE, there is an air-sea concept when it comes to logistics, whereby a company that brings a product by sea can warehouse on location. In the second leg of the journey, the product is air freighted to other destinations in Europe and the rest of the world. Sea-air shipment is growing in the region at a rapid pace due to the lead time and efficiency gains and Al-Futtaim Logistics is able to contribute to this requirement with our local presence in key ports and airport locations in the UAE. There is also growing interest in Egypt and the Levant, and our facility at Jebel Ali is another factor that gives us an edge to extend our offering to Middle East, North and East Africa. There are two methods in place that provides regular customer feedback across both B2B and B2C markets and covering our clients and the end customers. This allows us to have a clear idea of what needs to be improved or changed in order to achieve our objectives. The B2B surveys are conducted independently by a third-party research services company.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are the largest local, private facilities management company in the UAE. The key words here being: private and local. As far as the major players in the facility management industry are concerned, there are a few semi-government owned facility management companies. And then there are a few other players that are a part of international joint ventures. Al Shirawi FM is a purely local, private company that competes with these players and often wins. Today, our portfolio of clients is the second to none. We look after the entire Dubai Industrial City, which is the largest smart city in Dubai in terms geographical area (over 50 square kilometers). It is comprised of offices, warehouses, and labor accommodation. We look after varied services there, including the road infrastructure. We also manage what is known as the Business Village, which is where Dubai SME's headquarters is located. It is also where the Department of Economic Development (DED) is located. In addition to those, almost every AZADEA store in the Emirates is looked after by our firm. We have a significant retail portfolio. Although some of our competitors actually have the advantage of being connected to mall developers, we look after the stores in the malls. That truly is a testament to our capabilities.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Many people are talking about sustainability, and this is not a fancy thing—it is a reality. The concept of green is for the health of future generations and for the country's environment. We are lucky that the government supports sustainability. If we put our heads together, we will not reach the disaster scenario that some countries have experienced. If you live in a clear and nice environment, it is different than if you live with pollution; people are affected by this. In facilities management, we are dealing with sustainability by adding value to our clients. We advise them on how to reduce electricity and water consumption, for example. We are fortunate in that we maintain the majority of the mosques in Dubai. There are more than 240 mosques in Dubai. We also have many five-star hotels and many high villas in our portfolio. What I am trying to do is create an easy and effective method to maintain mosques. It is difficult to upgrade mosques to transform them into “five-star" locations. The type of carpet, the type of curtains, what type of AC we use, what types of perfumes we use inside, and the water temperature are all related to this.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>As a facilities management operation, we look after some quite large and world-renowned buildings. We work for clients like Emaar and Aldar, with which we deliver technical expertise. Through this, we build confidence with our clients. We have built a reputation where, if there is a challenging environment, we position ourselves in a market where the service we provide supports the business specifically, rather than selling identical products to everyone. It is molded to our customer base, and we don't simply customize a package services, but deliver precisely what the customer asks for. We are mobilizing a project in Abu Dhabi, which is another iconic building, as well as the Dubai Mall. We also have infrastructure projects where we support the municipality's assets, such as pumping stations and distribution networks consisting of highly technical equipment. We expect that the market, over the coming year, will see a major push on energy efficiency. There is also going to be a push in sustainable business, not necessarily in the green sense, but functioning in a business activities sense that are sustainable for the long run. We are keen to develop solutions and models where we can support customers in the long term through building confidence in the relationship over cost and the bottom line.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The UAE market, and indeed the Dubai market, is doing extremely well. It has gone through the fantastic experience of a major boom, a bust, and then a recovery, which is something not many cities or countries have experienced in the region. And the positive outcome is that Dubai and the UAE have learned and gained valuable experience from it. Dubai does not have the oil resources that other GCC countries have, yet it has been able to establish a very solid economy with concrete foundations. Since 2009, Dubai's economy has rebuilt itself on the fundamentals of what it used to be, which are currently the key pillars of its economy, namely trade, logistics, and tourism, and to a lesser extent real estate and financial services. One can easily see these pillars in the economy today; retail is booming, consumer spending is increasing, and there is a population influx into Dubai. On top of all that, tourism is growing at a very fast pace. Fundamentally, Dubai's growth today is much more comfortable, even though it is at a much higher pace than what we used to see during the crisis years. The Expo 2020 has already had some positive impacts on the local economy though its benefits are likely to accelerate closer to the event. The Expo will impact the same key pillars of the Dubai economy and should provide a further boost. I also do think that it will be a great way for Dubai and the UAE to showcase the achievements of this country, what it has to offer, and to highlight the future vision and economic growth that is likely to be seen in many years to come.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Historically, the SME sector in the UAE has been vastly underserved. There are over 200,000 SMEs accounting for nearly 86% of private sector employment in the country. At the same time, only 4% of bank lending is directed toward SMEs compared to 24% in developed economies, and probably less than 50% of SMEs have accessed banks for short and long term finance. In total, SMEs account for 40% of the workforce and contribute an estimated 43% of economic value in within the UAE. A key constraint to lending has been the lack of financial information and accurate historical data on SMEs, but we do see that this is slowly improving thanks to strong government support that has led to an increasing number of financial institutions becoming more farsighted in providing the funding that SMEs need to thrive and prosper. Today, the UAE has a strong and growing SME market with plenty of mechanisms and institutions in place to drive the sector. For instance, according to the recently published UAE report on SMEs, a total of 16,688 commercial licenses were issued in 2012, which is a vast improvement from the 11,743 licenses issued in 2009. The majority of these licenses were issued in Dubai, where events such as the rebounding property market and the strong performance of the UAE markets in 2013 have had a positive effect on liquidity and the country's SME sector.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are an investment bank that has two verticals; one is the debt vertical, which is the debt capital markets, and the other is the mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) vertical. On the debt side, we look to bring in innovative debt structures with better pricing for our clients to see what fits. We gather diverse solutions to provide one specific solution for each client. On the M&amp;A side, we're able to bring much to the table because of our connectivity and physical presence in the GCC and India—we have the right connections for clients in all of these markets. Alpen Asset Advisors is a new entity that we have launched in the DIFC and it acts as an independent financial advisory and asset management firm. It has a totally different product offering from Alpen Capital. At Alpen Capital, we raise money and provide solutions, while with Alpen Asset Advisors we help manage wealth. There is no conflict or overlap between the two businesses. The aim of the new company is to provide our clients with a wider solution base.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In recent years, our focus has been more on improving the breadth and quality of the services we offer to our clients, as well as introducing new technology solutions to meet the needs of the market, rather than aiming for growth alone. We have taken our new motto, “Taking care of Healthcare," to heart and all our achievements are built around that goal. We introduced our Pharmacy Benefit Management system, which is one of only four systems accredited by URAC in Abu Dhabi. We also introduced our online automated approvals web portal, called i*Care, throughout our network of healthcare providers. This portal, which automatically responds to providers' requests for approvals on treatment, was a first for the UAE market, and we are extremely proud of the results, namely faster responses for providers, consistent decisions for insured members, and efficient processes for our clients. In addition, we recognized how many of our members travel across the region and need smooth, simple access to healthcare wherever they go; therefore, we introduced our cross-border service. With our extensive regional alliances, we can offer cashless, fast services to managed members at contracted healthcare providers throughout our group's area of operations.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have always strongly believed that when operating in a country, you need a local face. Yet in truth, due to the specific situation of the UAE, where there are almost 85 insurance companies, the weight of nationals in the sector is low. We are improving and expanding our partnerships with universities in order to attract young talent and people. We basically have two different partnerships, one with the American University in Dubai and with Sorbonne University in Abu Dhabi. With a stronger presence here and a young energetic staff, we can do better than ever before. Each year, we try to raise the bar in terms of quality of services and understanding the expectations and needs of customers. We have segmented much more of our offer than in 2013 to ensure that we provide the best solution for each customer. Naturally, not all customers have the same expectations; for instance, some adopt a value-for-money approach, while on the other hand we also provide high-end solutions for those customers who require a dedicated person to provide them the best quality service. We are conducting numerous studies and getting feedback from our customers to see how we can improve on our offering. The second element, to my thinking, that makes us stand out in the business is the fact that we are able to provide nearly all the lines of business and solutions, even with some innovation, for both retail and corporate.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 2014, we are planning to use direct channels where clients can access our products and services online through our website. We are also aiming to work with telecoms companies, meaning that clients can buy insurance from their smartphones, and also pay their premiums through them. We're trying to provide comprehensive solutions for our clients. We want them to be able to come to us and find a single solution to all their needs without having to go out into the market and deal with different carriers. Our SME product is a prime example of this. We are investing a lot into services in terms of ease of access to AIG services, and we ensure that all of our clients get the same level and quality of service regardless of what channel he or she uses, be it online or traditional brokerage channels. We are also investing a great deal in training people, not just restricting it to our employees but all producers, and all people who sell AIG products. In 2014, we plan to have a training academy in our organization for both our employees and producers.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>An effective distribution channel is a must, making use of both brokers and direct sales, and relying on national representation. NGI has four branches in Dubai and is set to open another two in an area where we are little represented today. It all comes down to access to clients. In the interests of remaining conservative, I anticipate a 10% market share and gradual growth from there. The critical issue here is the performance of the new system going forward given that price is low and treatment costs and inflation in the medical sector high.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Insurance demand in the UAE is triggered by two major factors: demographics and the implementation of compulsory insurance benefits. Under demographics, the expanding population of expatriates in the UAE is enhancing real estate investments and large-scale infrastructure projects, both of which require insurance coverage, hence turning property insurance into a thriving business. Compulsory insurance benefits previously included motor insurance only, but recently health insurance has also been made mandatory by the UAE insurance authority. Due to high levels of car ownership and the compulsory law, the motor insurance sector will experience substantial growth.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Dubai National Insurance &amp; Reinsurance is a leader in the mid-sized insurance company market in Dubai. Our strategy has been to focus on stability and to grow consistently and smoothly every year. There is still a need for more education in this country concerning insurance. Most people's perception is that insurance is only called for when some misfortune occurs, and in any case they generally only think in terms of motor vehicle or medical insurance. In fact, insurance is much broader and more important than that.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>RAK Insurance celebrates 40 years this year. Having joined the company in January 2013, I set about repositioning RAK Insurance to put it on a different path in terms of distribution, operations, technology delivery, product innovation, and customer service. Incorporated into the strategic initiative of the organization in 2013, I planned to bring in international best practices and standards of operations, but all with a local flavor. We rebranded the company in May of 2013, and it was about positioning and understanding where we wanted to be as a company; clearly portraying that in the form of a brand.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Lamprell has four main product lines. Our original business, which we continue to have a dominant position in the region, is the rig repair and refurbishment business. We then moved into other new build offshore construction and have recently been successful with several projects for the North Sea, both fixed platforms and lift boats. Finally, we also refurbish and build land rigs. Since our IPO in 2006, we have constructed 16 new build jack up drilling rigs, converted, upgraded, or refurbished more than 168 rigs (both jack up rigs and land rigs) and built modules for nine FPSOs. In the longer term, I would, however, like to broaden our offering and, in addition to our current products, build more FPSO topsides and turrets and other modular solutions such as onshore LNG modules. I think by doing so, we can end up with a business model that is more predictable as each of these business streams is cyclical but only rarely would they all hit a downturn concurrently. The products that we are looking to build are in essence different kinds of process modules that we have a long history of delivering.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Schneider Electric is one of the largest corporations in the world, and a leading company worldwide in energy management. We are in the top tier of the Fortune 500. In 2013, we achieved sales of ‚¬24 billion, and we have over 150,000 employees globally. In 1Q2014, turnover from new economies (including the Middle East), stood at 41% in global revenues, and this reflected an increase of 8% against the same period in 2013. Importantly, 5% of our turnover is devoted to R&amp;D, which is a substantial amount for our industry. We need this level of R&amp;D to be continuously ahead in terms of technology, and to bring more energy efficiency to our customers. Globally, Schneider Electric is a vibrant, dynamic company that has grown sustainably over the last decade. We continue to grow, both organically and through the acquisition of experts in technology. We are present in most countries in the world. In the Middle East, we have around 5,000 people—engineers, experts, and salespeople—with roughly ‚¬1 billion in turnover.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We recently signed a very important MoU with the Ministry of Energy, mandating Dubai Carbon to undertake three annual cycles of CO2 emissions and MRV activities across the UAE. This is important as the data-centric approach will facilitate and encourage bespoke project activities. We also signed an MoU with the World Bank and specifically with the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development launching the Dubai Green Fund, a special purpose vehicle specifically created to access capital for green projects at competitive rates. We also plan to sign with Enpark and will sign with Dubai Holding. Real estate and buildings in Dubai are growing fast and there are numerous areas where green economic knowledge adds value. We will work with them to set their strategies for greenhouse gas emissions and sustainable development. On the skills creation side, we signed with the Green Project Management Association to introduce Green PM and PMO training in the UAE, as lots of projects can take advantage of the knowledge-based approach.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Council of Energy (SCE) has been carrying out extensive research on the future of energy in Dubai, looking at all aspects of energy production, distribution, and demand. On the demand side, it realized that there are things that need to be done. A study was carried out on how to reduce the demand for energy in Dubai, identifying the buildings that consumed a lot of energy and water. Then, it came up with a roadmap on how to tackle those challenges and make those buildings as energy and water efficient as possible. Almost 60%-70% of a building's energy consumption goes to cooling, which is basically air conditioning, and 10%-15% is consumed by lighting. The main task is to replace air-conditioning units with more efficient models or to connect buildings to district cooling systems. Etihad Energy Services was set up in 2013 by the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) under the leadership of the SCE. Our role is to improve the existing buildings of Dubai so that they consume less energy, electricity, and water. We are achieving that by creating and organizing a market for energy services companies.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>With the World Expo 2020, you don't need to worry about the economy; it will grow. However, 2014 might not be the highest in growth. It is a year for optimism and planning for the future. In 2014, we will know the size of the growth expected for the coming five years; hence, we will define the gap between what we are now and what we should be in 2020. Then, based on this assessment we will work out what needs to be done in order to be ready. For example, I know Dubai needs to double the number of its hotel rooms and air passenger capacity, meaning there is a lot to be done in our hospitality activities. Every operator in Dubai is now wiser and more experienced in ensuring that whatever growth is taking place is sustainable. In our hotel, though, we are undergoing serious renovation activities we managed to keep it under control and occupancy didn't drop below 90%. Now, all the hotels are preparing for 2020. Many have started renovating or upgrading. We are no different as the pressure is on. Another challenge is to try and keep an eye on inflation, and we need to do our best to manage it. When rents move, everything starts moving—schools, hospitals, and restaurants, for example. Everything is linked.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>I have been interviewed many times on Arabic news regarding the Expo. Public perception of the Expo is that Dubai has shifted plans to meet the objective of 2020, which is not true. Many years ago, Dubai had a strategy for 2021, and Expo 2020 is the icing on the cake. Yes, it clearly does have an impact on Dubai's strategy, but I maintain that Dubai has not diverted from its original vision and plan to realize it. There probably is an increased investment in infrastructure. And yet, I have asked myself whether 2020 had not been on the horizon, what would be the impact on Dubai? It is substantial enough to have realized its original plans regardless of World Expo 2020. The reality, however, is that the Expo is a vehicle that enables Dubai to reach its objective that bit earlier.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We can all safely assume growth. In the short term, I think there are probably some people who have been considering gently tapping the market here and have been lukewarm about operating in the region. What the Expo has done is given clarity to the fact that for the next seven years, Dubai is going to remain on the map. There will be infrastructure and connectivity growth. Today, no one can think of a world without Dubai. It has embedded itself, and I think that 10 years from now that will have become crystal clear. Jebel Ali will continue to rapidly develop as a port, and the connectivity with Abu Dhabi will be demonstrated. If I were all positive, I would not sound plausible, and I do have some level of concern, Dubai cannot be a regional hub if it is in the top three most expensive cities in the world. The key to Dubai's success was the fact that it was a regional hub from which to run business and employ people. The reason the whole thing blew up in 2008 was that it stopped being a low-cost hub and started being a high-cost center. Real estate, allowances, fees, and transport rose. When the city recalibrated, businesses and people returned. We have seen a further 40% increase in rent in 2014. We see increased school and food costs. If this carried on, Dubai is going to stop being a viable place for businesses to build regional hubs and they will pull out again and reduce.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Dubai and the UAE are growing exponentially. This event offers Dubai a long-term growth perspective, and will certainly contribute to its further rise. And as a six-month event it will also bear lasting region-wide significance. More than 20 million people visited in China when it hosted the Expo, meaning even if we target 10 million that would mean a large number of people traveling around the country and the wider region, which can only be beneficial for the entire GCC. The few negative aspects of the event, such as traffic congestion and large-scale construction, among others, are minor inconveniences when compared to the benefits that the population stands to reap, in terms of advanced infrastructure, metro and tram lines, and fresh family attractions, not to mention new educational facilities, and the internationalization of the city, through hosting the world at the Expo. We are confident in the way the local leaders will manage the event at a Dubai and national level.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We started with almost zero tourists, and I remember the first charter group was brought in 1991. Today, we have reached almost 11 million tourists annually, with a growth of approximately 10% to 15%. In seven years' time, we will have 20 million by default. Expo 2020 is a very important factor for development, not only for the tourism industry, but also for real estate, finance, consumer products, entertainment, and infrastructure. One day after the announcement of Dubai as the host city, the real estate developers started to look at areas to develop, with many projects tourism related, including hotels, hotel apartments, and residences, not to mention the development of Al Maktoum International Airport.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Dubai is leading the way because of what I call the three “s" theory of characteristics: social, systematic, and security. Dubai has a strong social network, and ideas are free to be shared. This is the social element. Furthermore, everything in Dubai undergoes regulations and organization; the regulatory environment has made Dubai an organized business oasis. In addition to this, security is the other important factor, including stability from a political and an economic perspective. Why is Dubai such an attractive destination for FDI and foreign investors? Because the Emirate has it all.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Ironically, although we are registered in Sharjah, we are overweight in real estate and almost all of our UAE assets are in Dubai, so that is where we interact, and where we meet people. It is a different business culture. One slight concern is that the sheer volume of property coming on to what is a fairly narrow market. If property prices start falling, it could spark a broader economic decline including share prices, a fixed income contraction, and a general squeeze on liquidity. This said, I foresee a fairly good ride for Dubai until 2020. This year looks promising for the Emirates Investment Group. We are invested in the real estate sector, and Dubai is on the way up. Experts are saying that asset values have risen significantly already, but in our case it's not an issue as we have not started any new projects.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The business environment in Dubai is actually, as a woman, one of the most equal playing fields that I have had the opportunity of working in. And I think that this is something that Dubai does very, very well. There are some incredibly successful Emirati businesswomen. Dubai is very much a work-hard environment, but I enjoy that. Business in Dubai works both very quickly and very slowly, so you need to be a very tenacious individual to be able to push pieces of paper around and not get beaten down by some of the processes.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>I think that when the financial crisis arrived, everyone predicted various scenarios. I always thought that it would be seven years before the world economy got back on its feet, and it has taken a bit longer because there have been too many false starts. International governments injected funds, but these failed due to a number of reasons, amongst them there being too little too often. However, having recovered, I would like to think that Dubai will experience the steady growth that it had up until 2002. In 2002, the economy of Dubai was very stable. The quality of work and what was produced was at its highest, and that fell during the boom. I can see a recovery of that now with expectations of quality being higher.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Dubai is the hub for the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan [MENAP] region. DuPont is well positioned for accelerated and sustainable growth in the UAE, which represents one of the fastest-growing markets for the company. DuPont is committed to supporting and participating in the new economic, industrial, and scientific developments in the UAE. The accessibility of Dubai also makes it easy to operate from. A lot of key decisions are made in Dubai. Over the last three years, we have tripled our employee count in the UAE. With a strong and diverse team in the UAE, we are continuing to expand our capabilities on the ground and that will help us better serve the local market. This is a perfect example of our ambitious plans for growth. Dubai has been a great location for us to grow and expand due to its business-friendly environment. We see strong opportunities in the UAE, and indeed throughout the GCC region. The next step for us in Dubai will be looking into the possibility of bringing DuPont science and innovation and providing localized solutions. The transfer of knowledge is an ongoing priority for years to come. We will be aggressively working on embedding our scientific knowledge.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Dubai is one of our larger territories in the whole of Africa and the Middle East, and also one of the key growth areas for Caterpillar. The entire region of Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and the CIS is managed from our head offices in Geneva. Given the volume and growth from the Middle East we clearly wanted to further establish ourselves in the region. We have already been operating from a marketing and sales support office in Dubai since the early 1980s. Yet with the increased volume of business, we decided to invest in a parts distribution center to better support our dealers and customers in the territory as well as in the nearer African countries. That decision was already taken prior to the crisis and temporarily suspended right after the crisis, and in 2011/2012 brought to completion. The logistics, infrastructure, and ease of doing business are all contributing factors to opt for Dubai as the location for our regional office. In addition, the safety and relatively low risk of doing business when compared to other countries in the region also plays a role.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Sovereign Middle East has been licensed in Dubai since 1998 and is now one of the largest corporate services providers operating in the Middle East. We are also a registered agent for the free zones of Dubai, as well as Ras Al Khaimah and Jebel Ali. We have further expanded our presence in the Gulf states by opening offices in both Bahrain and Abu Dhabi. There are no income or capital taxes in Dubai, except for oil and domestic banking, and no withholding tax. Companies in Dubai can obtain further significant advantages from the absence of foreign exchange controls, trade barriers, or quotas. The UAE also has a number of double taxation treaties with high-tax countries, giving investors an extensive choice of markets for a diverse portfolio of goods and services. When Sovereign first entered the Middle East market, our business was primarily based on providing offshore companies and management services for asset holding purposes. Now we are getting more involved with foreign firms and entrepreneurs that are coming to the Gulf to generate business here, and I think that this trend will accelerate as local markets mature and expand and particularly as we move toward Expo 2020 in Dubai.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>BASF has been in the Middle East for almost 50 years now. Proximity to our clients is very important to BASF, as it allows us to give them the best possible service. We launched our global strategy in 2010, which we started rolling out across different parts of the world. In 2011 it was Russia, in 2012 it was Africa, and 2013 it was the Middle East. With the “We create chemistry" strategy, BASF has set itself ambitious goals in order to strengthen its position as the world's leading chemical company. BASF's Middle East strategy, formulated in 2013, is in line with the global one, which is to “create chemistry for a sustainable future". We also have four strategic principles, namely: we add value as one integrated company; we innovate to make our customers more successful; we drive sustainable solutions; and we form the best team. We are committed to the Middle East, and are working to provide the same excellent service that we offer in other parts of the world. BASF has more than 750 employees in the region. In Dubai, starting from the 1980s, we have been involved with prominent projects and megaprojects in the Emirate, such as the Dubai Creek, Ferrari World, the Burj Khalifa, and the Dubai Metro.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Much more than just a city itself, Dubai is a gateway to the rest of the world. Africa, for instance, is rapidly developing today. Any enterprise looking to enter this continent is advised to establish their base in Dubai. Naturally, the same goes for those businesses keen on doing business in the GCC and MENA region. The AFC codes, being common law codes, are now considered as UAE codes and the government has conceived it long back. The UAE is the safest place to run a business headquarters within the GCC trade agreement area. When viewed from the West, the UAE is a gateway to Asia, and at the end of the day, Dubai is a very safe destination and has offered solid business potential over past four decades and undoubtedly, will inspire entrepreneurs for centuries to come.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Dubai is benefiting from the regional infrastructure boom in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and neighboring states. About 55% of exports into the GCC come from Dubai. We forecast trade rising by between 12% and 15% in 2014, and, thus, a strong repeat performance. In tourism, too, we saw another strong year in 2013. Occupancy in hotels was at around 81%, while tourist numbers were up 11% in the first half of last year—and we're expecting a similar increase this year. Our operative slogan is “Dubai; emerging stronger, looking forward." While 2014 has the same core drivers, we are observing changes within them. For example, in commerce, we see the emergence of new trade and investment corridors. In the region, Iraq is becoming a key trading partner, while Africa-Dubai trade relations are becoming increasingly important.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our strategy is very simple; to invest in people and attract a wide array of bankers to look beyond private banking toward investment banking and asset management. And, obviously, when one brings in people, a simultaneous infrastructure investment is essential. Investment in IT, HR, general operations, and real estate has been quite substantial. We selected Dubai as the hub from which to service our other regional operations, such as those in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Lebanon, Egypt, and even South Africa. All of these markets are supported in terms of IT and shared services from here in Dubai.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The finance sector has improved dramatically. On the regulatory side, the central bank has applied many steps and introduced regulatory requirements to enhance the business environment in Dubai, and the UAE in general. On the financial side, the local banks have improved greatly to mitigate risks and enhance their creditability and meet capital requirements. This has been improving over the last few years. We have also witnessed the central bank introducing many requirements on real estate regulation and lending practices. These will help avoid further crises in the future. The other area where I see improvement is in compliance, as it becomes an important issue for both local and international banks. I see many additional resources on the compliance side that have been put in place by the local banks, which in turn helps international banks to cooperate with them on a more solid footing.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Obviously not all banks are on par when it comes to cost of funding, but given the high level of liquidity and financing needs in the region it is not so difficult to be involved in “plain vanilla" financing. When it comes to structured finance, it is different. Project finance advisory is not a given strength for all banks. Every bank has areas of specific expertise, and one of Société Générale's key expertise lies in natural resources and energy where we have a global franchise both in advising and financing projects. As a global finance, derivatives, and structuring house in many different asset classes, we have a recognized strength when it comes to structuring in general. We have the capacity to come up with tailor-made solutions for our clients, whether it is on the financing side or on the investor side.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>As a technology company in the payments industry, innovation is at the heart of everything we do at MasterCard. But what exactly is innovation? A lot of people think that innovation means coming up with a new gadget. But that's not necessarily what it is about. It can also be about changing a current process—taking something that exists and finding a way to make it more efficient or convenient for the user. The UAE is a priority market for us in the Middle East, and we are leading the way with innovative payment products and solutions that provide issuers, merchants, and corporations with better choices and channels to grow their businesses, besides also providing unique benefits, rewards, and experiences that are aligned with the cardholder's lifestyle. In the UAE, we have collaborated with several financial institutions to introduce customized payment solutions that have been appreciated by the banks' customers and have also won industry accolades.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Network International is primarily in the payment processing business, and we have two core verticals to our business: issuer processing and acquirer processing. To grasp what we do in terms of processing, think about getting a credit card from your bank. You must apply to the bank, it sends the credit card, you use the card, and then you receive a monthly statement to pay off. Someone needs to do all the work at the back-end, from printing the card, sending it out, monitoring the monthly statements, making sure payments are posted, and that the entire process is done efficiently, seamlessly, and in a timely manner. That is one part of our business that is called issuer processing. Acquirer processing involves what happens once a consumer receives their card and wants to use it, for instance at a retail outlet. All of the back-end processes from processing a transaction at a merchant outlet, getting money from a consumer's card, settling with the merchant, and reconciling the transaction all in a manner of seconds while a consumer is at the merchant checkout, is managed by us.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Dubai is a key market for Visa. We recently strengthened our operations base here in Dubai to manage 92 countries across Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa. We are bringing many new resources and people into the country to serve our customers across the region, which will ultimately benefit the city. This move highlights our commitment to driving the electronification of payments in Dubai and confidence in the Emirate as the base of our regional operations, and reinforces the growth and increasing importance of Dubai as a regional and global player. There are a number of reasons why Dubai has been considered our headquarters. First of all, it is the hub point of our various locations, easily accessible for both our staff and clients. It is also easy to do business here because of the robust infrastructure. In addition, local legislation definitely fosters business and attracts foreign investment.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Freight forwarding is huge; however, we mostly specialize in sea and airfreight. We do very little land freight now; our number one activity is sea freight, with number two being air, and land is number three. In the area of customs clearance, we are well-enough established in the market to deal with any problems, and we have a good reputation with our customers. Customs clearance in Lebanon is not an easy business, but we are tough enough in customs clearance to handle any challenge. We also offer all other logistic services than any forwarder would do. We have door delivery, packaging, insurance, and warehousing. Lebanon is not an exporting country; it is mostly an importer. Freight forwarders that are strong and have a lot of power in exports are rare. For me, ABC Shipping is, if you want to have some sort of ranking, in the top 10 for sea freight exports in the country. We have great relationships with the major players, such as Maersk Line and CMA.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There is no doubt that Lebanon as a whole has been affected by the regional political environment. However, Chaddad Group hasn't been affected yet in Lebanon by these outcomes due to its strategy, which has made the whole company capable of emerging outside Lebanon. In addition to the business in Lebanon, Chaddad has other businesses abroad and development projects in Europe. We are also seriously studying several potential development projects in Lebanon. We believe that there are still opportunities to seize in the real estate sector. The demand for smaller apartments in prime locations is still very high. We are also developing a project in Algeria that is comprised of two towers of 20 floors each. The project should be delivered by end-2016.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Loft Construction was founded in 2005. The idea behind it is to offer something different to the local market. At that time, the real estate market was booming. Basically, we were thinking that the market would reach a point where people would become selective in their choices. All the buildings looked alike, meaning the prices would eventually fall unless you offered something different in the sense of creating a niche in the market. We have created such a niche for expatriates who mostly lived abroad in places such as New York or London and were familiar with the loft concept: industrial spaces, high ceilings, where luxury would not be simply defined by the type of bathrooms that you install, but by the design.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We have started many projects, and have completed maybe 150 projects in total. Currently, Beam's major project is the Rue Damas Tower, which is almost finished. Ciel et Jardin is another large project, which should finish in three years' time. It is a tower of 35 stories with three technical floors, a ground floor, and five basements. It is a purely residential building. But really, we are somewhat on hold. We are a bit hesitant to start most of our projects right now. The ones we have already started, we are still working on them, but we are on hold for the new ones because we are a bit worried about the economics of the situation. We Lebanese are a bit crazy sometimes; we jump into projects even though we are fighting, as we know things will eventually pick up. But right now, we are not worried about the Lebanese situation; we are worried about the Syrian border.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Real estate has always been a pillar of the economy of Lebanon; however, we have been through times when anyone could build anything and it would sell. Now, it is different. Today, you have to know the product that you are offering, because the market is tight, especially during these times, when the economy is not in the best shape. Our signature is to create a new trend in the Hazmieh region of Beirut—small units, in a trendy project, with high-quality specifications. Today, we offer 75-sqm apartments for $150,000. We believe that this is the type of property most needed in Lebanon.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our company is around 90% imports and 10% exports. We conduct all of our exports with other companies, carrying out only the logistics. Usually, in Lebanon, the customer goes straight to the carrier for exports. About 75% of the full-container cargo at Global Freight and Logistics (GFL) goes to Africa. Perhaps only 6%-7% goes from Lebanon to the Middle East. In terms of what we import, around 50% comes from China to Lebanon, and 45% from Europe. We get some raw materials from Saudi Arabia and Dubai as well. These raw materials are to make juice, wine, dyes, and coloring for textiles. Lebanon generally imports raw materials for textiles and then exports to third countries. While freight for order is based on containers, groupage, and airfreight clearance, packing is our specialty. When you go to Africa the rate is given from the carrier to the customer, and it is better than the rate given by freight for order. The carrier needs the cargo to be exported from Beirut, which affects the rate of the import. To get a competitive rate for imports, you absolutely need export cargo.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In Lebanon, not many deal in dangerous cargo (hazardous material). This highlights the importance of being able to move critical cargo, like biological substances or goods that are time sensitive. For example, we had a shipment of medicine for patients and it was moved in a cryo-shipper, which is a box that no one else has in Lebanon. We buy it from suppliers in the UK, Germany, and the US. We ship blood samples packed with dry ice to laboratories in the UK that must be delivered under 24 hours. We do this basically every day. Per year, we are talking about 4,000 shipments, so that is about 10 per day.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We do what others don't. For example, we worked with a major courier company that can't handle dangerous cargo. It had a shipment of lithium batteries, which required special treatment and extraordinary packaging. You cannot load this kind of cargo onto passenger aircraft; you have to load it onto cargo aircraft without passengers. That service requires a special license, and we specialize in that area.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Freight forwarding is huge; however, we mostly specialize in sea and airfreight. We do very little land freight now; our number one activity is sea freight, with number two being air, and land is number three. In the area of customs clearance, we are well-enough established in the market to deal with any problems, and we have a good reputation with our customers. Customs clearance in Lebanon is not an easy business, but we are tough enough in customs clearance to handle any challenge. We also offer all other logistic services than any forwarder would do. We have door delivery, packaging, insurance, and warehousing. Lebanon is not an exporting country; it is mostly an importer. Freight forwarders that are strong and have a lot of power in exports are rare. For me, ABC Shipping is, if you want to have some sort of ranking, in the top 10 for sea freight exports in the country. We have great relationships with the major players, such as Maersk Line and CMA.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Université La Sagesse (ULS) was founded in 1875, making it 140 years old in 2014. The university has evolved from a college that taught law to introduce new faculties and disciplines, such as business administration, political science and international relations, hotel management, religious studies, canon law, and ecclesial sciences. Additionally, there are 22 Master's degree programs. Administratively speaking, previously there was one head that ran the entire university. However, as the university expanded, a university council was established composed of vice rectors, deans, and consultants to divide up the task. This council adheres to the internal structure of the university and takes all the necessary and important decisions so as to progress all the academic programs. International relations, for example, is taught in cooperation with international universities located in Switzerland, France, Australia, and Canada. Currently, we have been working on obtaining accreditation from international institutions, specifically two located in Italy and the US. This university is a non-profit academic institution that receives tuition fees from students that in turn should be sufficient to fund professors, laboratories, infrastructure, and any expenses the university incurs. Moreover, ULS follows the Lebanese Maronite congregation, which is able to financially support the university when the funds are insufficient, specifically during difficult socio-economic times such as now. The Lebanese Maronite congregation has generously contributed $700,000 to ULS to help fund its activities.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In 2013, the Lebanese American University (LAU) spent between $40 million and $45 million, aside from equipment. We also have a capital investment plan that has $333 million in provisions. Currently, there are two buildings under construction in Byblos. One of them will house the engineering hall and the other will be a library. We are also working on the Byblos campus infrastructure, which will cost over $30 million, as well as revamping the power plant and improving the wastewater system. We have also just inaugurated a state-of-the-art building, the Gilbert and Rose-Marie Chagoury Health Sciences Center, to house the School of Medicine, School of Nursing, and School of Pharmacy. I believe that any talented student should be given an opportunity to come to LAU, regardless of social or economic background. Our budget for 2014-2015 is $157.7 million, $20 million of which is allocated for scholarships. This allocation has increased greatly in the last five years. We are looking ahead all the time. We are even looking at starting programs that aim to ensure adequate training for human resources and the expertise we need to extract gas and oil in Lebanon. As an innovative institution, we should play a major role in terms of providing engineers for the oil and gas industry. In recruiting for the new programs, we always try to attract expatriates back to Lebanon and we have been extremely successful in that regard.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our most visible investments are the new facilities that have recently been completed on the AUB campus—including two at the Medical Center. One building, the Wassef and Souad Sawwaf Building, is a gift from one of our new trustees, Mu'taz Sawwaf, and houses the university health services as well as a new PET-CT scanner and cyclotron, equipment that will improve our capacities for on-site medical imaging and diagnosis. In addition, our new medical administration building is about to open, enabling AUB to implement the first phase of our new vision for the medical center expansion, scheduled to culminate in 2020. These facilities have been complemented by the establishment of new research centers of excellence at the hospital and the hiring of newly recruited physicians, reversing the traditional “brain drain“ that has been plaguing Lebanon. On the main campus, we have also added a major complex for our Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, which consists primarily of new laboratories as well as spaces for teaching and for graduate student study areas. This new facility is named after Ray Irani, former co-chairman of our Board of Trustees who served for many years as the CEO of Occidental Petroleum. The fourth major building is for the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs. It is designed by the world-renowned Iraqi architect, Zaha Hadid, whose iconic and futuristic structure is the first of her buildings to be completed in the Middle East.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The time definite delivery of documents and packages remains our core business and is what we are mostly focused on. Our time definite service continues to improve thanks to our continuous investment in our network and facilities. DHL remains the market leader in the express industry, and we continue to grow in market share and revenues. We invest in every arm of our business, including our network, technology, fleet, facilities, and processes; however, the most fundamental share of our investment is on our people. We have a world-class international training program that every single member of our organization across the world undergoes.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In Lebanon, we can say that 3PL is definitely our niche. We foresee more demand on the way as it isn't yet a mature market, with some major traders that still resist the idea of putting their cargo in warehouses that they do not control themselves. We used to ship from all over the world, but the focus is definitely on Asia and Europe at present. We no longer focus on land freight in the MEA region because clients are hesitant regarding land freight in the current insecure climate; therefore, are requesting alternative services. We offer existing customers the ocean alternative and in the process have secured new ones to add to the trade.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We used to work about 50% by land, and now it is about 20%. It was 30% by sea, now it is 50%. By air, it was about 15%, but now accounts for 25%-30% of our shipments. Things have changed. Shipping by land is more dangerous now, and it was even impossible for three or four months in the past year or so. Recently, some roads reopened, which has allowed us to ship again; however, there are still some challenges. Another specialized market for us is in handling time-sensitive cargo such as medicine and food products; a market that has been growing lately. Additionally, we also offer complete supply chain solutions, from order management to storage to distribution.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>When we started, the market was excellent because it was just recovering from the war. It was positive, very upbeat and encouraging. We started our operations in October 2010 with our flagship store, Centrepoint, in City Mall; from there, the success story started. Today, four years later, we are operating nine stores and employing more than 400+ persons, amongst whom 90% are Lebanese. In spite of the turbulence and many challenges in the market, the months of April to July 2014 have been great for us; we are positive that going forward the business will be fabulous. We have grown consistently in Lebanon and our performance is stable. Our strengths lie in the two pillars of efficient operations and logistics; we are cost-effective, proficient in supply chain management, and we use our resources optimally. The Lebanese market is a little more mature than the Gulf market. Customers are very knowledgeable, demanding, and fashion conscious. There is cutthroat competition, but still the value segment is one where we can stand out, especially when providing excellent customer service.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>When there has been hardship or strife in Lebanon, it has brought out our passion, not slowed it down. The company is insistent on staying in Lebanon and turning negatives into positives. The company believes in this country no matter what. The best way to fight extremist ideas is by becoming more prosperous. The most prominent trend is the shift toward digital, which poses a challenge as one has to respond and adapt quickly. People are anticipating and embracing everything digital, but the local infrastructure is not up to international standards yet; however, once in place, the shift will be an overnight revolution. We have seen this already with smartphones. This is an indication that people are ready to “jump on the digital bandwagon.“ As such, digital is no longer a separate department in an agency; rather, every department needs to be digitally switched on. I do not mean everyone needs to be a programming expert, but everyone needs to be well versed in all the latest digital trends and developments. Leo Burnett is making sure its people are prepared in this respect.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Novartis was brought to life on a global level in 1996 with a merger between two companies, Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz Laboratories. These two companies had been deeply rooted in Lebanon for 50 years serving the medical community in the country. Though separate entities, they had excellent portfolios, which also partook in manufacturing activities. In 1996, following the merger on a global level, Novartis was formed, and since then it has been a leader in Lebanon as well as in the region. Until a few years back, the Lebanon office was a country-based operation that reported back to a Middle East cluster. About two-and-a-half years ago, we formed the Levant sub-cluster, where Lebanon is currently the regional hub for Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. At the time, Levant was formed, the Lebanon representative office had about 20 to 25 associates, and now there are more than 100. For me, Lebanon is a laboratory where we create innovation. This country is driven by innovation and embraces it too. Human talent here is unique and not too costly.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>One of the selling points for Citi is its globalism. Our footprint spans over 100 countries, including Lebanon. Historically, prior to the civil war, Lebanon used to be the financial center for the region. Beirut played an important role, and Citi has been present here since the early 1950s.  Even though we closed in 1988 because of the civil war, we reestablished our presence and commitment to Lebanon in 1995. For Citi, Lebanon is an important center despite shifting dynamics, and not only for Citi but for other multinationals, which saw the rise of other centers such as Dubai. Lebanon still represents a significant part of our operations for a number of reasons, one of which is that we view Lebanon as an excellent talent pool. We are a global bank; we need to cater to clients from diverse cultures, in a number of regions that speak other languages. Hence, in Lebanon it is easier to find talent that is open, trilingual, and has a good educational background. This is one of the major reasons that we value the franchise. The second factor is our history in the country and the role we played throughout the civil war era.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The automotive industry is very much related to the economy and stability. If it goes well, the trend will go well. If it goes down, the sales of the car industry will drop and shift toward cheaper cars. It all depends on where we are headed. It is a challenging market. At times some dealers dump prices for the sake of sales, which creates a negative momentum in the market. It is difficult not to follow them, but sometimes you need to in order to maintain a certain margin and to lead. This is a tricky thing. It is a difficult market, and it is constantly shifting. Creative doesn't necessarily mean successful. A creative strategy can be a failure, too. The most creative was the multi-balloon structure. This was a financial system to help people afford a car. It does this by creating what we called “balloons.“ For example, you pay a regular installment every month; however, if you get a bonus at work then you are able to pay a larger “balloon“ payment and then return to paying the regular payment. Basically, people are able to have bigger cars on a smaller budget. It was creative, but it is difficult to advertise it. When a person comes, it is easy for them to get confused. You need a creative mind to understand this concept. People tend to like simplicity. It was a creative financial strategy.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>ANB is one of Mazda's oldest distributors in the world. Initially, the Mazda brand was not well known; however, today it is recognized for its reliability, quality, and a mixture of many other attributes. It is a beautiful car from the outside in. The craftsmanship is excellent and the engineering is Japanese, produced in Japan. Mazda cars have a five-year warranty with unlimited miles that no one else provides, and we provide extensive after-sales service. This is the key to Mazda's success in the automotive business today. You have to do more than sell the car; it is also about what comes afterwards. This means the body shop, the paint shop, the insurance, fixing mechanical problems, maintenance, spare parts availability—the whole suite of services. This is why twice we have been recognized as providing the best customer service for Mazda in the world. We won an award that we received in Turkey from Arabia 500 relating to being one of fastest growing company in its field among companies in Arab countries and Turkey—they call it Arabia 500 plus Turkey. In 2012-2013, we were named as one of the fastest growing Lebanese companies. We received several other awards in 2013 for our marketing ability.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>At Porsche Centre Lebanon, we recently introduced several new products, such as the new generation Panamera, 911 Turbo, and Turbo S and the all-new Macan. We are enjoying a clear demand for them. As usual in the first year of production, we have a limited quota for the Macan in 2014. I am pleased to say that we have already taken binding customer orders for over 70% of our allocation, which, given the current times, is a fantastic achievement. No wonder, our new product offer is the perfect, all-round, four-door sports car and people here love it, given their preference for high-rise vehicles with outstanding driving performance. We are furthermore looking forward to the introduction of the new 911 Targa generation, which is expected to arrive next month. Our model range has never been more attractive than today, and I am hopeful that this will give us the necessary basis to keep our sales as stable as possible despite challenging economic times. The 2013 performance matched that of 2012, with close to 300 new cars delivered to Lebanese customers across the country. Given factors beyond our control, we are satisfied with our 2013 results.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Islamic insurance, or takaful, is the same as conventional insurance, with the only difference being that at the end of year the profits are redistributed to the policyholders, whereas in conventional insurance profits are redistributed among the shareholders. The main advantage of Islamic insurance is to achieve the principles of cooperation among participants in Islamic sharia principles of equality and integrity. That is the main difference. Otherwise, the insurance process is almost the same. Islamic insurance can be considered one of the largest growing industries in the world. We are working through our own bank, Al Baraka. Although growth has been slow, it is happening nevertheless. We are increasing our network of brokers and offering more and more direct lines, which creates a more personal relationship with customers. Our customers and brokers prefer to work with Al Aman Takaful because they see that we have better ratings, better services, and better facilities. Working with brokers and attracting the right ones is an excellent way to improve your exposure, because they all bring with them a basket of clients they can direct your way. Meaning if you can persuade the brokers of the quality of what you offer and your services, then you are thereby increasing your market share and exposure almost directly. We prefer to deal mainly with small-to-medium-sized brokers, those who are interested in doing business and getting their commissions, as opposed to large brokers who impose their own regulations on the insurance companies, and even impose their own clauses. All in all, we have a solid business plan, and we are expecting to see some good results over the coming years.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There is definitely better growth in the life insurance business than in the non-life segment. With the struggling economy, we foresaw that our retail business would decelerate, as we experienced in marine cargo a decrease in the sub-issued component and it appeared that more people were opening letters of credit (LCs) for smaller amounts out of prudence in a time of economic slowdown. Marine cargo insurance tends to follow the general economic trend, and so we expect lower premium generation from policies as customers are only importing what they need for a shorter time period, rather than building up stock. On the other hand, during periods of drawback, people tend to save by buying life investment products for essential needs, one of them being education plans for their kids. We have two young, well-performing companies in Egypt: AROPE Life Insurance S.A.E and AROPE Insurance for Properties &amp; Liabilities S.A.E, and once greater stability takes hold we foresee solid performance. We offer the same products and services in Egypt as we do in Lebanon, including retirement and education plans, as well as a raft of non-life products.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>At VICTOIRE, we leverage our experience, meaning we know what to give our clients, and we know what they need or don't need. We have a close relationship with our clients, which is essential if you are going to provide tailor-made policies and products. We talk to them, listen to them, understand their needs, and never impose ourselves upon them. Ultimately, our job is to provide options, and then it is up to the client to approve and go with it, otherwise we change it until it has suited our clients' expectations. This approach has been a fundamental element of our growth, because back when VICTOIRE started off as a brokerage representing other insurance firms, it was the investment from our clients that enabled VICTOIRE to become a standalone insurance company. In other words, our clients became our shareholders, and that was simply because we had their trust, we had a partnership relationship with them, and they didn't think twice about becoming shareholders in VICTOIRE as a fully-fledged insurance company providing its own policies. We are not owned by a bank, and we are not owned by any leading financial or political interests in Lebanon. We have only one focus and one interest: the business of providing insurance. VICTOIRE is a family-managed company, ultimately, and this is reflected in the shareholders as well, which are the Sultanem family, the Rizit family, and the Shamaoun family, among other smaller shareholders. Though it is family managed, it is not family owned.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In Lebanon the main two insurance policies we sell are car insurance and medical insurance; this is how you penetrate the market initially. These are the two basic forms of insurance that everyone uses in Lebanon. When I say “car and medical,“ they represent about 60%-65% of the portfolio, while the rest is general business. There are some companies that only do life, but for us, the companies that work only in life are not as big as the other insurance companies. Some of the companies that have banks on their backs get life policies automatically. Whenever anyone takes out a loan, they have to have life insurance as well. Their life portfolio might be bigger because there is a bank that is behind them. Each policy that we have in this company is sold without a bank's assistance. This is unfortunate in Lebanon because the banks that own insurance companies oblige you to go to one insurance company and this is not professional. We are trying to keep our prices competitive, but there are some policies where I do not play with the price. For example, third party bodily injury (TPBI) motor insurance policy is one area we do not play with the price. Actually, Al Mashrek was the first company to create this policy in Lebanon. My father created this policy with the government and a single policy cost $50. Most other companies played with the price; but we didn't. Today, those companies that sold the policy at less than $50 are in big trouble due to the accidents that are happening. The courts are being more generous in compensation claims, creating big problems for those who undercut the standard rate. Many have now gone back to $50, but there were four or five years where they were playing with the price.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Bancassurance is a specific business model brought from the south of Europe, though it has not taken off in the MENA region yet. Now this model is spreading all over the world, in the South and North of Europe, in Asia, and there are some reflector countries such as the UK, and the US. In the US, it has changed; it is an interesting model that has become very profitable. This is true in Lebanon as well. This is because the only channel of distribution of bank insurance is the bank, so there are no agents or brokers. Here in Lebanon, three banks make up the capital of Bancassurance: Fransabank, BLC Bank, and Banque Libano-Française—three powerful alpha banks. Bancassurance defines what products to implement and serve life insurance for the different banks. Bancassurance designs its products to respond to clients' needs, makes the actuarial studies, and also negotiates with the reinsurer, meaning we have the full package. This is why it is so successful. After, we sell life products through the branches. In fact, the model is very profitable because you sell at any branch for a much lower cost. If you sell by a broker or agent then the commission is very high, and if it's at the branch the commission is low. And for the clients, the model allows them to have all their financial and insurance services answered at one place, meaning the bank has bank become a “one-stop-shop.“</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We currently have a strong recruitment strategy. We are planning to increase our head count in order to support the launching of new products and product categories into different segments. Jean-Claude Yared &amp; Fils is currently known mainly for pipes and fittings, but there are still many products we could expand into. The strategy is to keep introducing new products and developing them into new segments with the right customers and team members. The goal is to consistently increase the market share in respective product divisions, and, of course, increase the company's market share as a whole while maintaining sound, logical returns.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Karambois was started three generations ago by my grandfather in Beirut, Lebanon. It then expanded into the Levant area under the leadership of my grandfather and his sons. The company gradually established its position as a major player in the region. Our company has evolved over the years and is today at the forefront of the regional timber market, particularly in Lebanon. Although the market has drastically changed over the last decades, we continuously strive to expand and optimize our operations and to diversify our product range in an effort to satisfy the market's needs. Our major obstacle remains, of course, the persistent instability in the country, which often halts expansion and diversification plans. This instability, however, also drives us to optimize our business to make sure we are always ready to deal with a volatile local market, especially for our hospitality business.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Since we started, we have been trying to find the right partners. We don't work with just anyone; we have to be conservative. When we work with someone it is because, at the end of the day, we are suppliers and they are going to cut, assemble, and perform the installation. If the fabricators are not fabricating their product in the right way, this affects our image as well, as both the system quality and the installation quality of the system are interdependent. This is why, when we chose a fabricator, we have certain criteria to ensure they deliver the highest quality. That is why we only work with select companies. We supervise because we have to be sure they deliver the right product in the right place with the right image.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The Lebanese ceramics market is developing, and displaying a continuous higher demand due to the increase of construction projects that are being executed and the material knowledge that people are gaining. That is why the Lebanese government should focus on improving this sector by creating financial and geographical facilities to enhance the production and the manufacturing of ceramics.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I think Colombia has experienced a technological leap in many senses. Our ICT sector is doing a great job, although there is always room for improvement. This is an open market, and I believe private companies will realize their own transformations. This is an excellent market for Oracle, that offers numerous opportunities, and the government is also assisting considerably. The standard of education in Colombia is high, and therefore there are many skilled, young professionals available. At Oracle, we hire and train them to provide various ICT services, both for the local market and overseas. Colombian professionals are a key reason why we have chosen Colombia, and not another country, for our activities. We work with a diversity of companies, small, medium, and large, and engaged in all industry sectors, as well as working with the government. This said, we do pay particular attention to certain industries, namely communications, financial institutions, retail, and government, because Oracle's offering covers whatever might be required. These segments are growing steadily in Colombia.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have to penetrate further with broadband, especially in the poorer parts of Colombia. That will help us develop the country and improve the way Colombians live. I believe the desire is there from the public sector, and everyday there is more alignment in the private sector to work toward executing initiatives with the government. One of the most important infrastructure projects is the building of a Wi-Fi network for the people, something that will bolster the democratic process. Another priority is developing everything around “Big Data." Our main public sectors are health and education, and in the private sector we are focusing on oil and gas. We have concentrated our efforts in Bogotá, and to some extent in Medellí­n, meaning that one or two years ago more than 90% of our business was in these two cities. Then, after the first peace talks, a number of cities including Cali, Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga, started growing. The growth of medium-sized companies is driving the market, and we are looking for coverage.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Without technology there is no way to develop our industrial matrix and take advantage of the emerging market and drive the country to the next level of growth. The government's policies for ICT are fostering corporate growth. One of the more interesting developments in Colombia is the emergence of one of the largest communities of social media users for websites such as Facebook and Twitter, and most of the nation is excelling in terms of technology uptake. Since 2012 we have grown by close to 91%, almost doubling the Colombian operation. We have also almost doubled our staff base, and doubled our revenue. Competition is coming to Colombia, and the country is being noticed abroad because of the investment environment. One of the reasons SAP is growing is because we have the technology to help it do so.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Saudi Arabia is probably one of the most important countries that we have in the Middle East. It is the strongest country we have at the moment. We are finding that the need for project management in the private sector is becoming more prevalent. Hill International is getting more calls from people in the private sector, which in the past didn’t use project management because they thought they could manage things on their own. However, they are realizing that having a project management company not only gives them the structure that they need to manage the project, but also gives them the policies, procedures, and systems that are needed to manage their projects. When we sell our services to a private owner, we bring in established systems, policies, procedures, project controls, and quality people. At Hill International, we have such a large base for resourcing, and are able to provide project management, program management, and construction management, as well as perform design reviews, cost monitoring, training, and value engineering. We will sit with the client and understand their goals and objectives and design a program that will fit their budget, from design through to the grand opening of their project. The risk to a client of not having a project manager on board could be substantial. Project management companies, if they are doing their job correctly, will ensure the client is getting the design they approved on schedule and within budget.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Nesma and Partners started as a civil construction company. Later on, we made a joint venture with a US electromechanical group as well as with AGAP Arabia, an oil and gas construction company operating in Saudi Arabia. We had three companies under one management, all in different fields. In 2004, we decided to integrate those three companies into one, thus forming Nesma and Partners. Our expertise varies across diverse construction fields including oil and gas, construction, infrastructure and superstructure, power, roads, and also airports. We have a wide capability; thanks to the integration of those three companies. We have various projects we are working on now, including hospitals, taking part in building one of the three packages in the Riyadh metro project alongside our joint venture partners, and we are also building Phase I on Jabal Omar project consisting of several hotels in Mecca, right in front of the Kaaba. Hilton suites has already opened one hotel for business, while the others are scheduled to open on various intervals within the year. We also have industrial projects in Jubail; one is the nylon factory for Chevron Phillips and Petrochemical Conversion Company, the other is the packaging plant of the Sadara project. We have many repeat clients we are working with such as Aramco, in oil and gas mainly, SABIC, the National Guard, and many other clients.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Roots Group Arabia was established in 1982 in Saudi Arabia with one core activity, which was the wholesale of construction-related materials. It started with building materials, and now we account for a 40% market share in the gypsum board segment, which is one of our strongest products. Today, we operate in our markets across three platforms, distribution which is 60% of our business, construction with 25%, and manufacturing with 15%. We have also expanded our product offerings from materials to equipment such as construction equipment, tower cranes, power generators, and tools. In 2012, we signed on to be the distributors for CASE Construction equipment. However, we offer a host of products and equipment, including well-known brand names. In 2013, we acquired Ideal Standard MENA through a 40% stake. This provided us with the right know-how, as well as distribution and manufacturing capabilities. We have seven manufacturing plants in total; therefore, we are extremely active in adding new brands. Either we acquire new ones or enter into joint ventures to form agencies. Our objective is to increase our product mix in the sector and expand geographically. Both of these together are behind our decisions on how to move forward and grow. In the markets, we are present and our strategy is to have a leading market share. In order to achieve this, we have to maintain strength in the after-sales side of our business.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Since the company is still in the early stages of its development, the upward momentum is expected to grow for the next three years, although naturally this depends on the state of the market and the performance of new entrants, which could see business pan out differently. We plan to conduct our business as we have done to date to meet the new regulatory challenges, market needs and environment, and stakeholder expectations. The government has taken a number of initiatives to promote the real estate market, and one is to establish refinancing companies, similar to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and others. If this initiative proves successful, it would bring a paradigm change to the way the real estate business is conducted in Saudi Arabia and contribute positively toward economic growth as a number of investors, particularly foreign investors, would be lured toward this market. I see this as one of the mortgage-related challenges and a step toward the development of the secondary market, which is not effectively available here. A well-regulated and clearly defined secondary market would naturally encourage both investors and growth.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In the mortgage market, it is not yet clear what the problem is at this point in time. I think even if the banks took a hit, they could absorb it. The mortgage business is still quite small and the largest mortgage banks have only SAR10 billion of exposure on their books, which is 5% of their total assets. If the banks take a 10% hit, they can write off SAR1 billion. We cannot do this, because we were established on a new model of non-salary assignment, which has never succeeded in the Saudi market before. Dar Al Tamleek’s model is closer to what you see in the rest of the world. We are being extremely careful at the moment, because we cannot take a hit. I will give you an example. The banks’ default rate in the industry by the end of 2013 was 0.65%. In our case, we had almost no defaults, and our delinquency rate was very low at 0.25%. We had 5,000 customers at the end of 2013, and only nine customers in total were late with their payments by at most three months. That is because we pay a great deal of attention to risk and credit criteria. Dar Al Tamleek will continue to do so that, as we cannot take on a lot of risk at the moment.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">It’s important to clarify that the housing and residential market in Saudi Arabia has a special nature and issues. The housing market doesn’t have that big of a demand; there is a necessity but no demand. The economic definition is a principle that describes a consumer’s desire and willingness to pay a price for a specific good or service. This is not the case here; consumers want and have to buy, but they cant! My segment is the middle-income bracket, i.e. those who can afford to buy. They can move fast in terms of loans and mortgages. We are in retail, so we are targeting these segments en masse, and I go and camp out in places like malls and hospitals. This is my segment in terms of homebuyer clients. Of course, there is another segment in refinancing. As the rates are changing, many people do not know that through refinancing they are going to save a lot of money. We are now hiring personal financial planners. This is another segment of clients that we will target; those who have already had loans for the past 10 years and are now thinking that they need a change. We will do this for them. Nobody else but the banks is doing that for the client.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">What we have is diversity and specialization. For example, I was recently talking with one of our VIP clients as we were in a bid to get his aircraft under management. He called me and said that he was signing with NEXUS. When I asked why he said that, it was because in every area we had a specialist member of staff, which gave him comfort. We are not a one-man-show; NEXUS Flight Operations Services is a team with specific roles. This is what has made us successful with our customers. As far as airlines outsourcing management goes, our organization is a significant player. Airlines save by outsourcing to specialized organizations. That is how we can be cost-effective for the airlines and government customers. Today, as a whole group, we have 1,100 employees. In terms of aircraft, in 2012 we had three under management, but now we have about 23. This is only in the private sector, of course, not including the other aircraft that we support and manage in terms of commercial and ad hoc customers.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">MEPC was established in 1992 as one of the economic offset program companies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The offset program aims to extend the industrial base for the aviation field. We currently provide MRO services on several engines for the Ministry of Defense (MOD). MEPC is the only company in Saudi Arabia—and the Middle East—that deals with military engines and is AS9110 certified. MEPC is also planning to expand into the commercial sector in the near future. Our main fleet is the F-15, C-130, Tornado, and other aircraft. We are looking closely at new aircraft on the market and the engines they use. Our strategy is to use our engine experience for long-term planning; for example, we do our analysis and communicate with customers to anticipate where the gaps in the industry will be in five or 10 years. Military forces will expand over the next five years, as well as the commercial side, which will provide more opportunities for MEPC.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Aircraft Component and Accessories Co. (AACC) started in 1988 as part of a group of four economic offset companies, and it is the only one of them that is based in Jeddah. It was started with the intention of doing maintenance work for the C-130 aircraft. The companies were all established under a royal decree in order to support military aviation in Saudi Arabia. For commercial aviation, the operators can get the services from across the globe; however, the military is much more complicated due to the regulations in force. Our perspective is to go further into Typhoon components, along with the new F-15 SA that will be delivered by 2015. We are planning to expand into new military platforms, and have the plans and equipment ready. Hopefully, we will start the overhaul for our large commercial aircraft landing gear at our new facilities, which are located at the northeast edge of the King Abdulaziz Airport in Jeddah.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">It is important to understand the history of Boeing in the Kingdom. It can be traced back to 1945, when President Roosevelt gifted a DC-3 to King Abdulaziz Al Saud, which went on to become the nucleus of Saudi Arabian Airlines in the Kingdom. The Kingdom skipped railway and highway development, and is only now catching up. Instead, we went straight from the camel to the airplane. Some time ago, a competitor was interviewed, and the same reporter subsequently interviewed me. The competitor said they were making Saudi Arabia a home market. My response was that this has always been our home market. This is neither a slogan, nor mere talk; we are part of this economy and this country. In five years I would like to see all the initiatives we are currently working on bear fruit. Within a decade, I want us to have penetrated the manufacturing segment in the Kingdom, and have grown our support business and training services in the Kingdom, along with expanded support to existing programs.</span></p>]]></sections31>

We attribute this to the government’s desire to implement IT infrastructure that will transform Saudi Arabia into a knowledge-based economy. We are pleased to be working with many customers here, such as Saudi Arabian Airlines, to help it grow its business through the use of technology. For example, Saudia recently implemented a business intelligence platform, which gave it the ability to access a wide range of company data and make more informed decisions. This has improved its ability to compete and be profitable as an airline. This is one example of how we view our success as our customers’ success. There are also many high-performing Microsoft partners in Saudi Arabia, such as the Ministry of Finance, which has extended the Electronic Payments System (Sadad) to serve 29 million citizens.</span></p>]]></sections01>

As of today, Saudi Xerox is the single largest Middle Eastern operation by any measure of the Xerox partners. It is with immense pride in the Xerox people in Saudi Arabia that I say this, because it is their hard work that allows us to say this. To put it into context, there are more than 89 countries represented in Xerox Middle East &amp; Africa, and it is not just the results that make Saudi Xerox a leading light in this stable; it is capability, reliability, and consistency.</span></p>]]></sections11>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The development of Al Faisaliah Center was inspired and created by the King Faisal Foundation 13 years ago. Al Faisaliah, A Rosewood Hotel, was created by the same foundation that built Al Khozama, the first Rosewood hotel in the Middle East 35 years ago. Al Khozama is associated with outstanding service and quality. Al Faisaliah Hotel, when built in May 2000, was established as a five-star luxury hotel, and its name remains synonymous with quality. Al Faisaliah Hotel’s popularity index is extremely high and we have occupied the number one position for the past two years on Trip Advisor. We are also among the top ranked hotels on Booking.com and Google+. We are the first choice for hotel seekers in Riyadh, which is precisely where we want to be. From a tourism perspective, I view Riyadh as being different when compared to Jeddah. It is a corporate city, attracting a large number of business entrepreneurs.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Ritz-Carlton Riyadh fits perfectly for a summer getaway where families can immerse in luxury while staying at a majestic and elegant oasis located within 52 acres of luxuriantly landscaped gardens, abundant water fountains, Chorisia trees, native palms, and 600-year-old olive trees. Splendid amenities include more than six distinctive restaurants and lounges, a lavish spa, and unprecedented service that promise an unforgettable summer getaway. The Ritz-Carlton Riyadh is one of  the most luxurious hotels in the world and has won, since its opening, many international awards for the finest luxury hotels, and this contributes to it occupying first place in the Saudi market. The Ritz-Carlton Riyadh accommodates all kinds of corporate VIPs and will attract more families in the coming period with the launch of our new Ritz Kids program. The Ritz-Carlton Riyadh has redefined luxury business travel for global visitors in the Kingdom’s capital with a range of services and facilities tailored to the high-end international business guests.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Over the years, the reputation of Four Seasons has been built on service, and we at Four Seasons Hotel Riyadh recognize service as our key differentiator, it is the service that our people provide to guests that sets us apart. We have spent millions of dollars to make this the nicest property in the city, and underpinning this considerable investment are the people we work with. This combination is the bedrock of our success. We spend a great deal of time finding the right people and making sure they are equipped to give our guests a memorable experience. These days there is no doubt that the demands of our guests have changed as they are ultimately seeking a “meaningful“ travel experience—and in this context that means the pursuit of something that is authentic, reflects the local landscape and is enriching to them. At the end of the day, it’s not a matter of how many square meters the rooms are, or what kind of sheets and towels we use; it is really about the experience of staying at Four Seasons Hotel Riyadh.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">InterContinental was perhaps the first international hotel chain in Saudi Arabia. The first hotel was the Riyadh InterContinental, which opened 40 years ago. The brand has become extremely popular here in Saudi Arabia over the decades, to the point where there are more InterContinental hotels in Saudi Arabia than there are in any other country outside the US. That fact in itself attests to the popularity and reputation of the InterContinental brand. Today, there are 18 InterContinental hotels across the country. The InterContinental Jeddah is one of the oldest hotels in the city, and it also has one of the best reputations, having become somewhat of a classic hotel with a great heritage. Guests and employees all like the InterContinental Jeddah. How we leverage our reputation, and our brand name, is by consistency and the constant improvement of our services over the years by keeping our reputation fresh.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Rosewood Corniche opened in 2007 and, since then, has introduced many new concepts to the Jeddah market, including specially trained fragrance butlers, a seemingly unusual amenity to offer guests a choice of exotic scents, and the Rosebuds program for young children. We also introduced the Red Sea Romance package. Designed exclusively for newlyweds and married couples, the package allows them to enjoy an undisturbed stay at Jeddah’s number one hotel. We were even the first hotel and entity in the Kingdom to introduce the “cronut,“ which was at that time only available exclusively in the Rosewood Corniche Soleil café. Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest travel markets in the Middle East. Growing domestic demand, a strong corporate sector, and the continued expansion of religious tourism are all fueling the development of the hotel industry. Rosewood Corniche celebrated a record year amid strong positive growth throughout 2013. The hotel’s room revenue increased by 8.2% in 2013, while occupancy levels increased by 3.7% compared to 2012. We are extremely proud to report such positive figures for 2013.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Jeddah is the commercial center of Saudi Arabia. As we look back in history, Jeddah was the one place that was in touch with the rest of the world, and it is a gateway to the commercial hub and for pilgrimage to the holy places. Most people, even today, have to touch down in Jeddah, either by air or sea. Jeddah still has to be passed through before going to the holy places. In the 1980s, all the embassies were based in Jeddah. All the embassies were shifted to Riyadh in the late 1980s, but until then, Jeddah was the most important place in terms of diplomacy, commerce, and tourism. The people of Jeddah are different because they have been in contact with the rest of the world for centuries. That is the beauty of Jeddah, which makes the city a very unique place. The King is based in Jeddah every summer, and during this time the city receives more attention. It is a unique place.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our Board is committed to the principles of good governance and regards corporate accountability and transparency as key pillars of business success. The management in turn is relentlessly striving to adopt best global practices and standards in dealing with all business matters, no matter how small or complex, in order to promote the success of our businesses to the benefit of all our stakeholders. Additionally, since becoming a CJSC in 2010, we have implemented more rigorous policies and standards for engaging and directing our employees and other stakeholders in complying with local and international regulations and relevant laws. We have created an environment of greater transparency and accountability across the organization. Finally, we have set clear guidelines for day-to-day decision-making and behavior based on the culture and values of our organization.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In 2011, we changed from being a family company to a CJSC. This required a major change. The objective of the change was to separate ownership from managing the business in order to secure continuity for the group for the coming generations. Basically, a board was assigned in 2013 lead by the Chairman, Sheikh Mohammed Abdulaziz Almoajil, and decided to keep all family members away from managing the business and make their involvement limited as just shareholders or a part of the board. The Board decided to assign a CEO who would be responsible for the whole group. With me coming from a multinational background at Proctor &amp; Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pepsi Co, and other major names, my objective is to implement the best practices in the market and put this group on a track where tomorrow it will be a real professional company.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Within the family, it was agreed to separate ownership from management long before floating the company. This is always a challenge, but becomes far easier once the company goes public. We ensured that family members’ needs and concerns were all addressed using a forum where we would all get together. It is a process whereby everybody knows they are being heard. It is important to keep the flow of information going. An annual general assembly was held prior to listing to instill the institutional culture. Restructuring was a priority for the company. My father never had the luxury of going to school, and, therefore, could not read or write. He created an empire; however, it lacked the appropriate procedures and governance that you want to ensure sustainability into the next generation. Prior to taking the company public, we really had to enforce and abide by corporate governance, which is vehemently dictated by the regulators. At that point, we started carving out businesses that were irrelevant to construction sector, to avoid confusing potential investors about what kind of business Al-Khodari was.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We started in 2008 creating joint ventures in niche markets with international players to provide solutions to our clients. We are in discussions now with various players in the hydrocarbon sector that provide unique solutions for common production or delivery problems. Part of our focus for the next five years, in parallel with the engineering sector growth, is to grow our non-engineering joint ventures to provide such solutions to our clients. Our focus will always be to create local value and transfer of knowledge in any partnership we enter into, whether it is manufacturing, services or technology. We created a joint venture with LISEGA from Germany, and opened a plant that began operations in early 2014 in Jubail to produce pipe support systems to support the power, petrochemical, and hydrocarbon sectors. The demand was huge, and we are actually the only ones in the Middle East to offer this.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I think the market has, to a certain extent, already started to react. The Saudi stock market, over the course of the past year, has grown by around 25% in terms of market capitalization. Over the same period, the Tadawul All Share Index (TASI) has outperformed the MSCI World Index, the Emerging Markets Index, whilst marginally underperforming the Frontier Markets Index. This appreciation has occurred under the backdrop of trading metrics that show a decline of 29% in YoY trading values, a 36% decline in volumes traded, and a 31% decline in transactions conducted. These statistics are positive, suggesting that investors may be adopting a longer-term investment horizon compared to historical standards, perhaps increasing their exposure to prime issuers in preemption of the entry of foreign investors.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We try to stay focused on the life investment market and the personal lines business, travel, and personal accidents. Credit and portfolio management is another key area we focus on. We do not feel that we can add much value to the motor or health insurance segments. We also do corporate insurance and are quite focused on being Saudi British Bank’s corporate customers. We have taken quite a difficult route with life insurance because that is not a compulsory line of business. Life insurance is relatively new to Saudi Arabia and has connotations to it that we need to overcome through the sharia committees to ensure its compliance with the sharia. We consciously did not get involved in compulsory lines of business. We saw that market as saturated and did not believe we could add value in that area. Therefore, many of the losses are in the medical and motor segments of the business, which we are not involved in.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">For every new experience, time is needed to develop. I believe that the Saudi insurance market has yet to mature as regulation only began in 2003. It was in 2006 that the post-licensing era began. The Saudi insurance market is still at the start of its life and there is a learning curve, although it will eventually settle down. Experience will improve the market, and we will arrive at a more mature stage within perhaps five years time. What Saudi Arabia achieved in that time within the insurance sector is impressive given the difficulty involved; the overall experience was highly positive. In terms of size, we can talk about an unorganized market that was greatly underdeveloped, and lacking a legal framework. Yet today, we observe a market that is correctly regulated, and where the business landscape is clearly set.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">According to 2012 reports, penetration is extremely low. The prospective for growth and the potential is huge. We think that many products should be mandatory. Currently, the compulsory products for the public are medical and motor products. Since there is a lack of awareness in the society, we see that we must increase the number of compulsory products. If we increased compulsory product penetration then the growth would be phenomenal. We conduct lectures and workshops in universities and some public sectors—it is a personal effort by our colleagues here. We have also started discussions with academics at King Saud University (KSU) on how to improve awareness among their students and what can be done. They were interested, and we offered to come and give some lectures and workshops to the students and even to prepare a Bachelor’s program for the insurance sector.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are lucky enough to have an institutional legacy that we have developed with the Kingdom that dates back 80 years. It starts with the founding of the Kingdom and with the inception of the oil industry in Saudi Arabia. JP Morgan was the intermediary bank that arranged the first payment for the concession agreement between Standard Oil of California and the Saudi Kingdom. That is where it started. The relationship was further strengthened over the years through partnerships with local institutions. JP Morgan still owns 7.4% of the Saudi Investment Bank through a legacy ownership from long ago. This is what I think distinguished JP Morgan in a major way; it is not simply that we are serving clients or servicing a country in exchange of a fee. It is entrenching ourselves in the country through everything we do.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private-sector arm of the World Bank Group, conducted a regulatory review of the Saudi non-banking financial services market and recommended the government allow the establishment of specialized lease finance companies, the rationale being that they will expand and extend the credit deliver mechanism, hence increasing intermediation in the financial services market, which would enhance SME sector access to credit for productive assets. IFC invited us to be part of the joint venture to set up the first specialized leasing company in Saudi Arabia. ORIX Group has had a relationship with the IFC going back to 1977. We have set up pioneer leasing companies in many countries, such as South Korea, Thailand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Oman, and Egypt. We were the first non-bank financial company in Saudi Arabia approved by the Saudi Arabian Monitory Agency (SAMA).</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">As the Saudi government continues to spend domestically on various healthcare, education, and infrastructure programs, we expect this investment to trickle down and have a positive effect on the economy as a whole, as the demand for various goods and services will continue to increase. This will also be positive for the country’s SME sector and will encourage more people to set up a business in Saudi Arabia and capitalize on the expected growth. Providing support to SMEs has always been the central focus of Gulf Installments Company (GIC) and Gulf Finance Corporation (GFC). We will continue to do this by providing swift, tailor-made financing solutions and advice to SMEs in Saudi Arabia.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">SKME is a joint venture between Suido Kiko of Japan and Saudi Brothers Commercial Group of Saudi Arabia. We came to this market back in 2006 with the intention of bringing novel technologies to the water treatment sector. We are proud to have introduced the Membrane Bio Reactive (MBR) technology to sewage treatment projects in partnership with the Saudi government. We were the first company to introduce this and to have MBR technology used in government schemes. We started with the first project in Najran, and today MBR technology is found Kingdom-wide. This technology will treat wastewater, both municipal and industrial, allowing it to be recycled. In practical terms, what was once conceived of as a waste stream is now a value stream that can be reused in irrigation and numerous other processes.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">3M has had different forms of presence in Saudi Arabia for over 25 years now, but our physical presence has almost always been limited to Riyadh. Yet, we were able to reach other geographies within Saudi Arabia thanks to the team in place. In terms of 3M as a brand, if you talk to people in different sectors, you will find that the strength varies depending on the level of interaction and the importance of 3M products and solutions in that particular market segment. 3M is well known in medical and traffic safety systems. We have also a strong presence in the electrical market segment. It does vary, but whenever we are introducing 3M solutions to a specific market segment, we definitely leverage the strength of the 3M brand. The brand has been built over 112 years on quality and strong legal and ethical business conduct. Therefore, it is very well respected and received in a country like Saudi Arabia. Lately, 3M has started focusing more on the Saudi Arabian market and we have increased our investment and elevated our presence. The country presents many opportunities across a range of market segments, and 3M is active in 39 to 40 different segments of the economy. Naturally, one cannot do everything at once, and prioritization is the key to our success in the Kingdom.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Real estate and investment have always been some of our main activities, and will continue to be in the future. The group started moving into other sectors, such manufacturing, and we established factories for cement products, Poly Sacks, pallets, and feed. Hence, whenever there is an opportunity, we invest and get behind it. When it comes to the commercial business, we are the sole agent in the GCC for Yale products, and that brand has been with us for 25-30 years. We are expanding slowly; however, we are keen to select where to expand. Our founders had excellent connections within the Kingdom and globally, as well as a great knowledge of economics. They realized in the old days that Saudi Arabia would follow developed countries simply because of its high demand, which will eventually improve the Saudi economy.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our board is committed to the principles of good governance and regard corporate accountability and transparency as key pillars of business success. The management in turn is relentlessly striving to adopt best global practices and standards in dealing with all business matters, no matter how small or complex, in order to promote the success of our businesses to the benefit of all our stakeholders. Additionally, since becoming a closed joint-stock company in 2010, we have implemented more rigorous policies and standards for engaging and directing our employees and other stakeholders in complying with local and international regulations and relevant laws; we have created an environment of greater transparency and accountability across the organization; and we have set clear guidelines for day-to-day decision-making and behavior based on the culture and values of our organization. This has not only helped formalize and reinforce the direction, principles, and values that were already held within the organization, but has also positively impacted our operational efficiency, profitability, and long-term value growth.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">If regulations, terms, and conditions applying to developers are not changed, we will face difficulties. Fortunately, the government is working to accommodate the need for legislative amendments. And while approval takes a certain amount of time—a key factor in construction—I believe we are on the right track to rendering the sector attractive for investors. The new mortgage law that recently came into effect should also revitalize the market. Yet meanwhile, the labor law has a tendency to change, and this has not been good for contractors. The government is definitely attempting to source quality contractors from the private sector, and we are hoping it will prove realistic in terms of its contracts. The larger-scale contracts affect the private sector in terms of requiring additional regulation. The labor law will affect many SMEs lacking the expertise to understand and apply it. And since accounting for around 70% of the total they comprise the most important part of the economy, and this situation needs urgent addressing. We should engage in this process gradually, however, as the regulations have the potential to benefit the move toward Saudization.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">With our dynamic portfolio of subsidiaries and various engagements in multiple sectors, we strongly believe that we are diversifying our business activities. As for the hydrocarbons sector, we are seriously assessing new joint ventures with leading oil-related market players in the region. Human resources are key to our success, as our core business intensively depends on manpower. Talent, training, and the motivation of our employees will always continue to have a constructive impact on Zahran, and this is one of our ultimate objectives. In the coming years, we are looking forward to maintaining our leadership in our core businesses and maximizing our revenues and market share with distinctive and satisfied experience for our clients. We are always finding new ways and opportunities to set our group apart by entering into new joint ventures in new sectors in Saudi Arabia and the wider region.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Alkhair Capital is regulated by the Capital Market Authority (CMA) in Saudi Arabia and has been operating since 2009. We have licenses for brokerage, asset management, and corporate finance. In terms of asset management, we have equity funds, fixed income funds, as well as money market funds. Our current portfolio includes the Saudi equity fund, murabaha fund, in addition to the sukuk fund. We are currently planning to launch a new IPO fund that will focus on new IPOs of companies that have a strong track record in the market, and will comprise of Saudi and MENA companies. We have three public funds. One of them is the Saudi Equity Fund, which is purely Saudi. The strategy of the fund is to invest in the Saudi stock market, Tadawul. The fund has been performing well since its inception compared to the benchmark and its peers. We have launched two more funds recently: the Murabaha and Sukuk Fund. The Sukuk Fund was launched on the June 1, 2014, and the Murabaha Fund was launched earlier this year.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">GDP growth for Saudi Arabia is going to be in the 4.5%-5% range for 2014. This is good for us. Over the last five years, the Saudi banks have experienced double-digit growth in their balance sheets, meaning the banks are growing faster than GDP, which is a good indication. Government spending, GDP growth, and oil prices are going to be in this range, so that is a good indicator that the market will be positive for the banking industry. We have two major government institutions, GOSI, and the Public Pension Agency. We also have several foreign shareholders such as JP Morgan and Mizuho Bank of Japan. However, they are not represented on the board. This is a completely Saudi company. I think the measurement of an institution depends on the size and quality of returns for shareholders. For the finance industry, it is the return on an average assets (ROAA). We want to maintain one of the highest returns on average equity (ROAE) and ROAA levels. We can achieve that with a good capital adequacy ratio (CAR). We also want to maintain our efficiency ratio to be a good percentage. We want to be an efficient bank. If we achieve these aims, there are many other initiatives that should lead to success. We are always taking the necessary risks to ensure our success.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">One of the weak points of our stock market is its lack of major names. Saudi Bin Laden Group holds perhaps around 60%-70% of all infrastructure projects, but this is not reflected in the stock market, as it is a private company. The same applies to the retail sector; we have a large retail market, but the big names are not listed. This is also the case for the food sector, where about 80% of the market is in the hands of small convenience stores. The stock market effectively does not reflect the economy of Saudi Arabia, except for the petrochemical and oil sector, and this is essentially due to legal regulations. Even one of the biggest banks is not present on the stock market. As a result, news on infrastructure investment is not mirrored by changes on the stock market. Most involved companies are, in any case, foreign entities. This effectively means that in order to gain exposure to infrastructure projects, one must first identify a publicly traded company that stands to benefit indirectly from infrastructure investment. Failing to do so makes exposure to infrastructure projects very difficult.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I think it would be very positive if the CMA further opened the capital markets to foreign investment, for the country, the economy, and definitely the capital markets. It creates stability, which is something we definitely need. I think the regulator’s vision does not include foreign individual investors, but that stage will come. The main aim for it is to open the market up to the majority of institutional investors. That is what we need; long-term institutional investors that come in with more of an emphasis on corporate governance, and those that look to create diversity in investments. For sure, that would be positive and help grow the business, and create new products that we can target toward institutional investors. I think it is one of the more attractive markets. There are large amounts available that would have an immense impact on the open market. Having said that, I don’t think investors will invest large amounts and throw money the market the day it opens. I think investors will take their time to know the market better first. Will it be a good source of income? Yes. However, will it change the face of the capital markets in Saudi Arabia in a day? No. I think it will take years before it gets to that stage. But, that is healthy. You don’t want everything to get shaken up all at once.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have been preparing for the arrival of foreign investment for quite some time. We are properly positioned for whatever changes may come, especially through our brokerage business since allowing foreign investors to participate and invest in the Saudi market will definitely increase both market efficiency and liquidity. We at Alinma Investment Company are sure that our developed and sophisticated dealing platform will attract most of the foreign investors, which will improve and increase our local brokerage market share. Foreign investors also might increase volatility and risk in the market, thus increasing the correlation between the Tadawul and world indices. I believe SAMA could play an important role in any opening of the market by monitoring and regulating capital flows into and out of the country as it may participate in preventive action for “hot money,“ and coordinate with the Ministry of Finance, CMA, and the Tadawul to find solutions and put regulations that increase efficiency and mitigate side effects of foreigners entering the market.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">There is a transformation from paper to paperless and from delayed responses to instant. The days where people write to you and expect a response in a week is gone. You can’t have someone call you and tell them you’ll get back to them in a week; people want instant responses. Therefore, as a company, we have to cater for our Cardmember needs. That is why we need to improve our mobile technology, interactive technology, and online services to make sure Cardmember gets instant service. The access to information real time and the immediacy factor means that Cardmembers want more control over what they see and how and when they see it. And to this avail, we have changed our strategy to cater for these growing needs. With over 180% mobile penetration and as one of the highest consumers of digital media, the Saudi market offers a contrasting image whereby you still have a generation that requires paper-based transactions, while they also want to deal with people not platforms and require personalized services.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">There are three drivers that contribute to the growth of the banking and payment sector in Saudi Arabia.  First, the Kingdom has a large population of just under 30 million, a large portion of which is unbanked, creating significant growth potential.  Second, the Kingdom has improved infrastructure in areas like internet communications and banking, and that is an important engine of growth for us. Third, there is room for improvement in terms of acceptance by individual merchants. We currently have around 100,000 POS terminals around the country, where cardholders can pay for goods and services. Still, according to the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), we can expect to reach 500,000 in the next three years.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The future of payments is mobile. By encouraging coordination between the country’s financial sector and the telecommunications industry, Saudi Arabia could bolster the strength of its current offerings and make mobile payments a larger part of the payments ecosystem, which will bring the country significant savings of nearly 1.2% to 1.5% of GDP. Saudi Arabia is a key focus for MasterCard in the Middle East and Africa region, as the country is witnessing a significant growth in the adoption of electronic payment solutions. In fact, with 5 million annual visitors, Riyadh ranks 19th globally and second in the Middle East and Africa by expected International Overnight Visitors in 2013 by MasterCard’s Global Destination Index, which analyzes a global network of 132 cities, their connectivity through cross-border air travel, and associated expenditures.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Colombia's regulatory framework is highly favorable for multinational pharmaceutical companies. It is in fact rather economical to develop R&amp;D activities. The environment has led to many of these large companies developing some of their primary multinational clinical research in our country. Colombia is at a crossroads and has to decide in which direction it wants to develop its pharmaceutical sector. Brazil, India, and Israel, some 20 years ago, decided to strengthen the production of generic drugs, each developing highly robust industries. Only now have these countries turned to research and innovation within the industry to take a step forward. Colombia lacks innovation and the country's industry is currently undergoing a transitional period in which an important decision must be taken regarding this deficit. The pharmaceutical market represents around 17% of the health industry in Colombia in spending terms. I think these figures also show rather low spending on medication; for example, the annual per capita health expenditure in Spain is $2,400, and at $4,000 in Italy. The figure in Colombia currently stands at $500, meaning that we have solid growth potential.</span><br></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>One of the greatest achievements in health in Colombia has been the correct identification of the sector’s problems and the work done by the last few governments to prioritize and implement key projects. Also, today every municipality, region and department has governing bodies to assure the correct development of the sector. I think the country has taken very positive steps in many specific fields of the health tourism industry. Plastic surgery is an excellent example. The overall number of foreign patients in Colombia grows annually on the back of the high-quality treatments and surgeries we offer, our competitive costs, and the follow-up care our hospitals provide. In this context, the industry now delivers several pre- and post-operation packages to foreign patients, which allows us to better target patients abroad. The clinic has enjoyed high and regular levels of success throughout its entire history and now that I lead the Center, the key challenge is maintaining these levels of growth both among local and foreign tourist segments. One of my other main goals is further research and development of new and improved procedures for our patients.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In Medellí­n, around 2,400 companies work in the health industry, of which some 140 engage with the provision of services for our cluster. Of those, 25, which are mostly clinics and hospitals, take part directly in the management of our cluster, being its backbone today. Our main focus since day one has been foreign patients, and our strategy and work is a part of a wider effort from the city to internationalize Medellí­n and strengthen its position in the global market in which the city has the capability to efficiently compete. This was the strategy during the early years of our cluster, and we recently revised the strategic lines of our future development, having concluded that we now have sufficient maturity, knowledge, and experience to offer more comprehensive products and services, with greater added value, to those international markets. We are currently working on further specializing our health tourism offering by encouraging the export of biotechnology products and services, as well as applied knowledge for the healthcare industry.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are trying to become increasingly involved in the MICE business. We have appointed a destination management company for the Cartagena Boat Show, which took place on March 22-24, 2014. Aviatur also has an organization for business and corporate passengers attending exhibitions and fairs. The business that is growing the fastest, but never fast enough, is aviatur.com, our online business. The website offers airline tickets with most of the airlines here, as well as tours and hotels. That is the optimum means of maintaining contact with young people who make up the web generation. Colombia is a brand that could be adapted to anything. And while it offers all types of tourist attractions, our future is definitely ecological, green, and highly specialized. The Pacific Coast of Colombia is amazing, and it could be interesting to develop more responsible projects in this part of the country. And what's more, lasting peace in the country would help to develop the tourism segment hugely.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">There are essentially two types of foreign tourists visiting Colombia today, namely business visitors and vacationers. About 85% of tourists come to Colombia for business, mostly going to Bogotá, since it is both the political and business capital of Colombia. The vacationers mostly come for beach tourism, which is primarily located on the Atlantic coastline, with the main destinations being Cartagena and Santa Marta. When it comes to Colombian nationals, about 70% are business tourists, and 30% are vacationers. The most popular destinations for Colombian businessmen are Medellí­n, Barranquilla, and Cali, and they mostly come from Bogotá. There is also a considerable degree of religious tourism, mainly during Holy Week, known in Spanish as “Semana Santa." The most important work we do is promotional campaigns, and we work through the Pacific Alliance, which integrates a series of important countries such as Peru, Chile, and Mexico. The citizens of Pacific Alliance countries can now travel without a visa to all other countries in the alliance zone, which has simplified our job, and we are intensifying our promotional campaigns to take advantage of this.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;">Santa Marta has many touristic attractions; from heavenly beaches, such as the ones in the Tayrona National Park, to the many historic spots across the city. Santa Marta was the first city to be founded in South America, on July 29, 1525, by Spanish explorer Rodrigo de Bastidas.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); padding-bottom: 20px;">The city is undergoing a cultural revival, and is developing a new museum in the historic center of the city, which will strengthen the network of cultural institutions in Santa Marta. Prices in cities on the Caribbean coast have risen sharply in recent years due to greater demand for second homes; this combined with the fact that they had maintained the lowest price levels in the region, despite being tourism destinations. I believe the city still has considerable potential in terms of construction; however, we must respect history and culture, as well as current legislation, because the city has yet to reach its full potential. In this context, tourism and construction have to go hand-in-hand to better meet the future growth potential of the city.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The government is generating opportunities and increasing our coverage across the industry. The access to technology helps improve the quality of life in poorer nations, addressing key issues such as unemployment, poverty, and connectivity, and it is a major differentiator for the economy. We aim to help the population to be connected to opportunities and boost their livelihoods. We are growing across the consumer business, SME, and large corporate business segments, where each makes a positive contribution to our numbers. On the other hand, we have our tablet business. Samsung, Apple, and Lenovo lead the market. Currently, there are many players and unbranded products, but these are the top three players. Meanwhile, we now also offer cell phones, although at this point, we are not as large a player as we would like to be. Colombia was in fact the first country in Latin America offering Lenovo smartphones. We need to drive our business to the next generation, taking into consideration how we address our efficiencies and speed. We are growing our business contribution to the networking of smaller cities.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The growth of the IT industry has gone hand in hand with the expansion of the national economy. We should highlight the role of national authorities, and in particular of the Ministry of Telecommunications, as there has been a clear understanding of the sector's potential. We believe that by technologically educating society, we contribute to increased employability. We also have a strong focus on SMEs, which are one of the core economic engines for Colombia, and we provide the technical support they need for development and expansion. According to the latest official data on market share, Hewlett-Packard (HP) holds a 30% market share of the PC segment, being the leading company; whereas in the printers and server segments we hold around a 60% market share. Looking to the future, we see cloud services, big data, mobility, and security as being the key strategic elements of the industry. For this reason, we will focus on developing services and products within these four segments.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">As demand grows across Colombia, new technologies will emerge to meet it in a more efficient manner. 5G will mean more capacity, better use of the resources (spectrum), better quality and more bandwidth for the end user. At the same time end-users will want more capacity and have more requirements. Machine-to-Machine will be one of the main drivers for those network requirements. For example, if you analyze the connections people require currently, you have a telephone, iPad, PC, TV, car, and home security, amongst other things. One of the government's main targets during the last three years was to close the gap we have between the different levels of society. And, the steps Colombia has taken over the past two or three years have produced positive results. During the last three years, the government has been working on its Vive Digital plan. Basically, the project was aimed at installing a broadband connection into all small villages across the country. The government's target was to have at least 1,000 small villages connected by August 2014, and it has reached, or is at least close to, that target already.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The ICT sector is a significant part of the Colombian economy. From a government perspective, it serves two roles: it helps to remove all possible barriers and makes it easy for the private sector and the government to acquire cutting-edge technology at affordable prices, which plays an important role in encouraging industry. We ended 2013 as Intel's only growth market in Latin America, and even more interesting was the growth in our leading-edge categories, for example Ultrabooks, 2-in-1 devices, and tablets—we lead the region by far. Ultrabooks are the technology of this decade. Right now, tablet computers and cellphones are our next step. There has been a delay in emerging markets in general, and in Colombia in particular, from the time we launched the new technology internationally. Once the barriers have disappeared, it was an invitation to invest more. We have been able to not only close that gap, but encourage the growth of cutting-edge technology in Colombia. In many cases, we have cheaper computers in Colombia than in the benchmark market, which is North America.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The CCIT is the association that groups together and represents the largest players in the Colombian ICT sector. Among our associates we have operators, telecom providers, as well as large IT companies. It is interesting to see that the mobile device market, as in other parts of the world, is experiencing a steep upward trend. Thanks to efforts made by the Colombian government in previous years to bring down import tariffs, as well as VAT on personal computers, Colombia has the cheapest PCs in the region. However, this is still not the case for smartphones. The business software alliance calculates that in Colombia, 53% of the software is pirated, which is something we take seriously at CCIT, and we are working very closely with the government to resolve this. It is not only an IPR issue, but also one of lost tax revenues. The Colombian government is leaving a lot of money on the table by not legalizing each percentage point of the usage of that software. The growth potential is enormous and eventually we are going to be talking about software solutions for the mobile market as well.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The government of Colombia has implemented ambitious initiatives within the IT sector, such as democratizing internet access across the country and setting up an optic fiber network in its main cities and municipalities. The authorities are transforming the internet into a tool capable of improving the lives of Colombians. The only area in which we are lagging behind is content. SIESA was established over 30 years ago on the back of the innovative attitudes of its founders. We have a long and well-established tradition and relationship with other businesses in the Cauca Valley. SIESA became a leading company in the region due to its provision of software solutions for local businesses, especially large enterprises. After that, we grew both nationally and internationally; today we have over 10,000 clients in Colombia and over 100 abroad in eight countries in the region. Our main objectives are to consolidate our leading position in the national market; simultaneously, we want to further consolidate our activity abroad. Despite the fact that it took us some time, we finally offer a cloud product. It has been a process of teaching business the benefits of the cloud model, and at the moment we already have several clients using SIESA cloud services. We also have our mobile product which when first developed had a strong focus on the commercial side of companies; supplies, deliveries, money management, and related services.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We carry out a fully comprehensive and integrated process whereby we provide specialists in economics, communications, and marketing, among other areas. However, we base our entire activity on new technologies. In the beginning, the company used to sell software, and then we started to install networks and offer services. We also have our software production center. We like to call ourselves a shared service center that provides fully integrated solutions to businesses by generating value-added for companies by contributing to the efficiency of the processes. ADA provides a unique technological platform for over 4,000 educational centers by grouping them together under 480 educational funds, and we provide the required platform for these centers to better administrate and control their activity and development. From our early stages of developing the company, we started providing software solutions and packages to government authorities and institutions. Since then, we have understood the possibilities of that market niche, considering that most of the players have traditionally focused on the private sector. In this context, we understand that we can easily become a strong player if we focus more resources and efforts on providing services to the public sector.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">There is a development plan for the national transportation sector, but there is no long-term growth structure. One of the main problems in Colombia, and not just in this industry, is the tendency for short- to medium-term planning. This means that once a project is in execution, it is already at maximum capacity. Sparta noticed that in Colombia 80% of transportation is informal; trucks are owned by and passed down through families. There are no real logistics involved, but merely the provision of a temporary solution to someone in need of transportation. We therefore have the potential to become a logistics consultant providing solutions and expertise on the trucking industry worldwide. Sparta provides the structure to fully understand the transportation industry, because without such a structure, work is inefficient. Sparta promotes being fully involved in all aspects of the business, including structural planning. There are several other companies that can offer this service, but they are too large for this market. Large consultancies are not helpful for small or medium-sized companies, but are, in contrast, our target demographic.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The key factor is having Colombian human resources focused on transportation. We started in the main cities of Cali and Bogotá, looking for ways to run international functions, such as analytics, and service provision to citizens using Colombian tools and resources. Secondly, some years ago we started to integrate ITS solutions, sourced from North America, Australia, Brazil, and Spain, among others. We aligned those tools to Colombian software and resources to develop local solutions. Our key offer is that we replicate and improve products we see in the market at competitive prices specifically tailored to local solutions. Our market has some unfortunate differences from Spain, as for example, road conditions, lack of infrastructure and even security, whereby we have to adapt. Colombia, for every 100 people, has around eight cars, whereas Brazil and Mexico have closer to between 20 to 25. Over the past decade, the prices of motorcycles has halved to $500 due to the importation of Chinese models. The same has happened with motor vehicles, the range of which has increased over the past five years. And of course our own sector builds on this. It is a question of digitalizing multiple transactions, such as those performed during the ownership of a vehicle, from the purchase and taxation, right through to any fines incurred during ownership, and finally the sale of the vehicle.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Over the years, we have expanded our portfolio of services. We started with the consolidation of logistics services to and from the ports, supporting the activity of exporters. Our company was established in, and is headquartered in, Medellí­n and is fully committed to the city. At the moment, we have a network of 32 sales points across the country. Transportes Botero Soto also offers logistics solutions for companies, which means we develop and deliver internal logistics plans for them to become more efficient. Also, we fully address the logistics demands of companies 24/7 with our own resources, and are not dependent upon third parties. Right now, our company handles an average of 70,000 cargo transport movements every year. In terms of our future plans, we are set to introduce Oracle Transportation Management (OTM) services, enabling us to bring goods and cargo from anywhere in the world to Colombia, and we are continually upgrading our systems and capabilities to continue offering a unique service.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">TINSA has developed its own strategy, which has been widely awarded in Europe. For example, the real estate exhibition in Madrid and the Bank of Spain awarded our in-house developed methodologies. We have in-depth knowledge of the real estate sector and the products that are selling in the countries in which we operate. We aim to further the professionalization of the sector. Currently, it lacks regulation and formal structure, and is open to all types of competitor. TINSA is working to introduce certain regulatory barriers and professionalism in methodology and business practices. In this context, we have received positive feedback from banking institutions, which are pleased with our methodology and the quality of the results. Today, Banco de Bogotá and BBVA are our two main clients in terms of volume, and we are also increasing our take in smaller banks, in the hope that in the future our participation in the market will grow substantially. We plan to expand our activities in the public sector, as we have highly specific products that would suit its needs.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our company is focused on the corporate real estate business; the major movement in our sector comes from the amount of international companies that are arriving in Colombia. In the past five years, we have seen at least 3,000 multinationals arrive looking for offices, retail, or logistical space. Obviously, every single one of these arriving businesses has an impact on the residential market as well. We target high-end residential properties, known here as strata 5 and 6, mostly in large cities like Bogotá, Baranquilla, Medellí­n, and Cali, and this market has also been very dynamic in the past couple of years. Basically, there is a great deal of trust in the country on the part of investors. The fact that Colombia, in a certain way, was closed to the world meant that it was not part of the growth strategy of most of the retail companies and big multinationals. The crisis in Europe and the US has made Colombia attractive, and this market is one of the most favorable prospects for these companies for the next five years.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Bubbles are driven by oversupply and excessive debt, but I do not really see a bubble here. Instead, I see a scarcity of land due to the absence of urban renewal legislation, mainly in Bogotá. It is very difficult to find areas larger than 2,500 sqm to build interesting developments that make urban sense, and which could include complementary, mixed-use spaces. My perception is that we are making updates very rapidly, that land prices aren't in keeping with construction capacity according to the norm (residual value), and that the city needs to grow denser, vertically, rather than expanding horizontally. CREA's objective is to structure successful commercial projects, thus filling a gap in the market. We have very good builders and large funds with great provision of capital, but none is ready to develop an asset and take the commercial risk. Investors consider long-term viability and rental potential based on what they pay per square meter. In my experience, from an investor's perspective in Colombia, it's not easy to find someone to advise on such transactions. And CREA's mission is to be the best advisor in the technical, commercial, and financial segments.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The housing segment is clearly experiencing a boom in all echelons of society, especially in Colombia's so called strata 5 and 6, where prices are growing very rapidly. Regarding the lower strata, government-led programs are also driving housing market development. Meanwhile, the situation in the office, industrial, and logistics segments is essentially the same; the construction of infrastructure and new units in these segments is currently seeing excellent growth. For example, the stock of office space in Bogotá—1.6 million sqm—is twice what it was back in 2008, and we predict that it will grow by more than 50% over the next five years, reaching 2.5 million sqm. Bogotá needs office blocks with a single owner, as this structure is almost non-existent here. Multinational companies require an average of 700 sqm of quality office space, and Bogotá cannot meet this demand today because most buildings are condo-type properties with many different owners owning smaller office suites. Ideally, these offices should be located in strata 6, as this area represents more than 70% of the city's current quality office stock.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I believe that a period of price stabilization is close at hand. I do not expect there to be a housing bubble because interest rates are low and because all the assets that have been constructed are not backed by much credit. The buyers are not in leveraged positions and the interest rates are not high. I recommend that investors find opportunities in the middle class housing sector, in social strata three and four. High-end housing, from strata 5 to 6, is too small and unrepresentative. We manage and administer assets for investment funds and carry out facility management for about 66% of Bogotá's corporate buildings. The ideal way for small investors to proceed is through real estate funds, and for institutional clients we can analyze investment alternatives in Bogotá. The returns institutional clients can earn through investing in the development of projects along with local construction companies range from the 8% level with a revaluation figure of 5% to reach a target of 13% to 14%.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are involved in business process outsourcing (BPO), including the outsourcing of logistic, administrative, retail, and commercial outsourcing processes. Another large area for us is BPO Voice, which basically involves a call center or contract center. We have two other areas of work, one of which is represented by our Avanza Institute. Here, we provide training for companies, including leadership coaching and specialized training for various clients. We also offer outsourcing services in the health sector, including in-call care for the elderly. We are set to end the year on ‚¬10 million in revenues. We already have 20% of the global employees here in Colombia. In our first year, we sold ‚¬200,000 and now we are going on for ‚¬10 million. In 2015 the figure should reach ‚¬50 million.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Thanks to government strategy, investments, and innovation in its systems, cities and education programs have demonstrated to other nations the potential and stability this country offers. In Colombia, more than 80% of new businesses disappear during the first five years and an average of 90% will not survive more than 10 years. This data clearly highlights a weakness in business management. We come in by offering products to help local businesses grow, while also fortifying our users' marketing efforts. We do this though events, courses, and content exclusive to all MyLocal users. We don't want to just sell, but also to guide and help sustain local businesses. We currently have over 75 employees worldwide, with monthly growth of around 10%. Talent is our most important consideration, right after our clients' needs.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We believe that our business model and development perfectly fit the ideas of innovation and creativity that the city heavily promotes. We have developed the e-office concept and through it, as well as our long list of alliances and partnerships, we have helped local companies to open premises in other areas, such as Europe, creating direct connections with almost 70 countries. We have clients from many different sectors: health, services, new technologies, and small entrepreneurs. We currently offer office spaces that go from 10 sqm to over 110 sqm, as well as all the services a company needs to start operating, even with an employee to undertake administrative tasks. We first started out with analog telephony services, delivered through IP systems, and have grown to have over 60 clients in our portfolio, including IBM and Accenture.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are looking to develop connectivity through different modes of transport. The policy of this government is to improve all existing transport options, from air connections to roads. Air is the most expensive way to transport cargo or passengers, so it is important to be aware of the subsectors. Perishable goods need to be moved efficiently and quickly. In Colombia, the transport of refrigerated fresh flowers, as well as tropical fruit, is a major area of business. In addition, urgent items delivered through companies such as DHL or UPS are also crucial, particularly for items such as newspapers and magazines and other items for next-day delivery. There is also the luxury category, which requires items to be moved with minimal risk of damage during transit. I believe that Colombia, Barranquilla, and this airport can become the breadbasket for all of the Caribbean islands. That is the way forward, and it is also the reason we need to establish both an agricultural and logistics center here, in order to both produce and, ultimately, deliver.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In 2013, the company managed to grow at a rate of around 12% in the domestic market and 35% in the international market. LAN currently operates from 20 destinations, with 22 routes in Colombia alone. We believe that one of our best achievements has to do with our leadership in terms of on time performance over 2012 and 2013, with domestic flights achieving 88% on time performance rates. Furthermore, we increased capacity by more than 30% on several international flights, such as São Paulo and Miami, thanks to the fact that we started operating Boeing 767 double-aisle aircraft. The most important routes are those that generate the highest volume, such as Cali, Medellí­n, Cartagena, and Barranquilla. LAN Colombia represents around 5% of LATAM´s overall traffic and should continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Colombia is also the second largest cargo market in South America after Brazil, which spells considerable opportunities for us.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In Colombia, we are doing the same as in the rest of Latin America, and concentrating on underserved markets; in other words those cities where connectivity remains below average. We pioneered international service in Bucaramanga and Cúcuta, providing a convenient one-stop service to the Caribbean, and North, Central, and South America, which nobody else is flying to. We have the shortest connecting times in many of our flights through our Hub de las Americas making it arguably the most efficient hub in Latin America today. Basically, there is no big secret behind our success; it is a case of serving with an efficient and convenient product the underserved cities of the continent. Over the past two and a half years, we have grown by almost 55%. On top of that we are due to receive eight aircraft in 2014, all 737s with the latest Boeing generation sky interiors, and, therefore, expect to grow by around 11%. We should highlight that this is a greatly significant pace when compared with industry growth rates and we feel extremely positive about 2014.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Overall, 2013 has proven to be, once again, a difficult year for the shipping industry. There has been a significant lack of growth in the container industry throughout the world since 2008. We are now beginning to understand that this is the new reality of the volume growth of the shipping business. Prior to 2008, the container industry grew at 10% per year. Since 2008, we have been seeing a different kind of trend. There are a number of reasons for this reduced growth, but principally it is due to the fact that China's global sourcing of goods has stagnated, and consequently stagnating container volumes. The FTA with Mexico, as well as those with the US and Chile, has shown that, within five years, there will be a doubling or tripling in the interchange of goods. The US is quicker at reacting and bringing in more imports, but it usually ends up that the exporters are the big winners. About 40% of global consumption is in the US, and I'm sure that Colombia is going to find some way to get a slice of that. Colombia used to export to 70 destinations in the US, but since the FTA this figure has increased to around 500.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Colombia has a range of multi-purpose port facilities. The draft capacity at our ports is greater, and can handle containers, grain, and coal all at one place. All port activities were privatized between 1992 and 1993. Barranquilla is labeled as the capital of the US-Colombia Free Trade Agreement (FTA), and has done an extremely good job, not only in terms of public investment, but also in bridging the gulf between the public and private sectors. The fact is that the market has changed quite considerably for us, and until 10 years ago we were basically the only port in Barranquilla. That is not the case anymore, and we have 25 concessions, eight of which are operational, while three have yet to become efficient enough to run well. The Port of Barranquilla changed hands in late 2012, and the new administration activated major investments in equipment and infrastructure, which are ongoing. We have an investment plan of $180 million, of which we have already invested $85 million.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Colombia has been dreaming of a new navigable river for the past 80 years, although it is clear that the country has prioritized the development of road transportation. Bearing this in mind, we have achieved much over the past two years; we have pursued studies at an international level and are now in partnership with several companies and institutions to open the tender process in 2014. Recovering the Magdalena River for navigation purposes is a huge undertaking in terms of investment and infrastructure. It will help the country to divert road traffic to the water, reducing traffic and accidents on some of the country's main roads. However, the main advantage of this project will be the rise in the competitiveness of local products, as they will be able to reach maritime ports at lower costs, in direct contrast to the high cost of transporting goods from the center of the country to Colombia's Caribbean ports for export. We will have reached our target of 908 navigable kilometers by 2019, with depth and width navigation conditions that will enable us to guarantee the year-round navigation of barge convoys of 7,200 tons.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">By 2013, Colombia had 183 shopping centers of over 5,000 sqm of GLA (gross leasable area). We believe that the smaller cities have the most potential. Historically, in Colombia the shopping center industry has grown in the five main cities: Bogotá, Barranquilla, Cali, Medellí­n, and Cartagena. However, over the past three to four years, the real growth in the industry has been in the mid-sized cities. Approximately five years ago, a shopping center in Colombia would usually only have been constructed in a city with a minimum population of 500,000. Today, however, that threshold has dropped to 100,000 people. For this reason, we have shopping centers in 44 cities in Colombia currently. Palmira, Jamundí­, and Yumbo, all near Cali, offer a number of opportunities for investors. People from Cali, which has a population of 2.3 million, are now relocating to these other cities. In the same way, people from these cities usually work in Cali, and  enjoy a healthy consumption capacity. This condition, increases household income and total spending. In Buga and Tulua, middle class consumption is growing, making them interesting markets to invest in too.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">From my Chilean perspective, Colombia is a bigger market. Chile's population of about 17 million starkly contrasts to Colombia's of 45 million people. Furthermore, Chile has one city, namely Santiago, which alone accounts for around 70% of GDP. In Colombia there are different cities over which GDP is more evenly spread. Bogotá for example represents about 30%-35% of national GDP, and other centers also have significant representation in the country. Medellí­n has about three and a half million people, Cali has about 3 million people, while Barranquilla has about 1.5 million inhabitants. Additionally, there are more than fifteen cities with over three hundred thousand inhabitants. These are all highly interesting markets for a Chilean company. Moreover, the rising purchasing power of Colombia's middle class is another magnet for investment. Traditionally, in Colombia, the developer sells the stores. In contrast, our model involves keeping and maintaining 100% of the property, and managing it, along with the tenant mix. If you are an investor, you only care about who pays you the most. There are even examples in Colombia of shopping malls that feature adult entertainment or casinos, which is not an appropriate family ambience. Such venues simply target revenues, whereas we are interested in the nature of the venue itself.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Income levels in Barranquilla are lower than the national average, though the city has a lot of land available. Although development has been increasing, the land remains inexpensive compared to other Colombian cities. Still, there has been a level of speculation as the city has been booming over the past three or four years. However, there is a lot on offer, and perhaps we have seen demand decline in the luxury market. I believe the city is seeing strength in the office segment, though there are many projects being realized. There is also a lot on offer in the warehousing segment. I surmise that prices will stabilize over the short to medium term. Constructora Rumié is involved with developing PriceSmart's wholesale infrastructure in Colombia, and is looking to complete at least some of its local facilities. I am also collaborating with industrial groups from Bogotá. TLC Industrial Park in Cartagena is another project we are working on. Finally, we have a few residential projects that we are looking to launch, though are trying to put together a package that will appeal to investors.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our company started off as a family business 21 years ago. Since then,  we have specialized mainly in upscale office and residential construction projects in the northeastern part of Bogotá. This specialized focus over the past two decades has earned us a reputation for excellent quality and design in the projects we carry out. We want to diversify our business and move more toward institutional and office projects. Our biggest ongoing projects right now are office schemes, because there is significant demand for office space considering the foreign players that have been entering the Colombian market in recent years. Construction financing in Colombia is very well structured. The economic crisis in 1998 created a robust fiduciary system that enables investors, developers, and end-buyers to operate in a much safer, more secure, and less risky market. Previously, a constructor had to build a whole building and sell it off like that, but the fiduciary system today enables both the buyer and the project promoter to base the financing and completion of the building on a guaranteed volume of sales, supported by mortgages, so they don't begin construction until those guarantees are in place.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Thanks to the growth trends the country enjoys, the sector foresees a similar expansion over the next few years to that it experienced in the past three to five years. We could divide the main driving forces in the sector into two; the housing segment and the public infrastructure segment. I think the four power generation projects will capitalize on the growth of the sector in the near future, especially within the framework of the free trade agreements (FTAs) signed with the US and South Korea, for example. Regarding the real estate segment, we have recently seen fluctuations that are normal in the sector, and I expect these growth trends to continue for quite some time. There is still great potential for development in the entire country—since we are located on the coast, there is great potential in the second house market. As the purchasing power of society continues growing, I expect this particular segment to also expand in the near future.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Construction is definitely the key instrument of economic growth, and the government's social policy builds 280,000 homes a year. President Santos' government has established a set of economic drivers, the most productive of which, especially since his second year, has been construction. According to the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), construction has two branches, namely civil works and infrastructure, and buildings. Put together, these categories account for 7% of GDP. But if you added to that all industrial and services activities related to construction, the number could reach 20%. That is why construction is so important as a generator of employment and economic growth. So how do we arrive at the 20% figure? Whenever a bar of steel, a brick, an item of furniture, or a piece of pottery is made in Colombia, it is added to the industrial sector category in calculating GDP. And when a mortgage or insurance policy is provided, or when the wages on a trust are paid, it is added to the financial services subsector. Were you to take everything related to construction and real estate from the services, industrial, and commercial sector categories and add them to the construction activities category, you could easily reach 18% or 20% of GDP. That is why this sector is so important, not least as a massive generator of employment.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">By our calculations, around 40 million hectares are available for agricultural activities nationwide. Yet currently, production is notably below the potential yield due in part to extensive livestock activity, which offers low returns. Regarding the eastern plains, I think that any government efforts to boost agricultural activity in that area require a logistics infrastructure plan. For example, river navigability and railway connections are crucial, as is a comprehensive land improvement program with special emphasis on irrigation and drainage. These issues are difficult to tackle for the private sector alone, which is why the government must implement a public sector-led, strategic plan to contribute to the development of the area. We started producing bio-diesel eight years ago, and today we have an installed capacity of 500,000 tons per year. There are two types of oil extracted from palm trees, and over the past two decades the country has positioned itself as a leading regional exporter of these two oils. We also produce palm kernel cake, a high-fiber, medium-grade protein feed that is best suited for ruminants.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Colombia is currently the largest palm-oil producer in Latin America. In 2013, we produced 1 million tons of crude palm oil. Producing such quantities requires palm plantations, which is a highly labor-intensive business. A hectare of palm should yield about four tons of crude palm oil, and should require about one worker per seven hectares. Therefore, to produce one million tons would require 300,000 hectares of cultivated palm land. Refineries are then required to process the product into palm oil. This is also labor-intensive work because it is not a heavily automated process. Specifically in Magdalena, we are responsible for 150,000 hectares of plantations, which directly generate around 25,000 jobs in the palm oil sector. The oleochemical industry is a sub-activity within the palm plantation involving palm kernel oil, a sub-product of crude palm oil (CPO). The crude palm kernel oil (CPKO) derived is an excellent raw oil component of the palm oil industry. It is used throughout the personal health and care (PHC) industries. Companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson and Proctor &amp; Gamble are researching its applications, and it is the main raw product of surfactants.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Unipalma was founded by the Unilever group between 1981 and 1982. Growing in this region is difficult, demanding a creative approach. After the period of President Uribe, investment in the rural sector caused the price of land to increase, such that today it is prohibitively expensive to grow palms profitably. Today, we have 4,500 hectares, and are processing more. If we compare our business to 15 years ago, certain structural and economic differences should be taken into consideration. We are doing the same as 15 years ago, but 30% of our costs are accounted for by labor, which has more than doubled over that time, while the price we get for the oil is essentially unchanged. Thus, margins are shrinking due to various factors, such as the microeconomics of dollar fluctuation, and Colombia's lack of infrastructure.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe began operating in 1970, but its history dates back to 1946, when the ANDI Foundation signed an act establishing a hospital that would later bear this name. In 1954, Don Pablo Tobón Uribe, a well-known philanthropist from the city of Medellí­n, upon his death, left as a legacy the construction of the hospital, which would merge with the ANDI Foundation in 1957. We have become a leading healthcare institution in terms of quality, services, and innovation, particularly in highly complex treatments. We have also become a leading institution in terms of administrative practices, and host many visits every year from people interested in better understanding our operational activities. Today, we are the 10th best Latin American health center, and we are the first in Antioquia. This has been made possible by our incredible staff and the professional team we have formed over the years; we also invest around $2 million every year in advanced training for our employees. Moreover, our facility has the latest technology in the industry and our high-quality services are nationally certified and recognized.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Colombia has one of the most progressive health systems in the world, meaning that all Colombians who have enough financial resources cover the health costs for those with no financial power through a budgeted national system. This is done through tax charges on salaries that go directly to fund access to the health system for those who cannot afford care. Private clinics within the sector have the latest and most advanced technologies available as well as highly qualified doctors and specialists who obtained their qualifications abroad. On top of that, demand has been increasing over the past few years, and this has brought prices down considerably. Bucaramanga has become one of the prime movers in the industry. There are also some other high-quality centers in Bogotá and Medellí­n. Barranquilla had no clinic meeting high international health standards before the incorporation of Clí­nica Portoazul. The city had qualified and skilled human resources in the sector, but no center that offered services at the highest international standards. Doctors, insurers, local and regional authorities, and some other agents came together to make this project a reality. The government was also a key player, and that's why we now enjoy the legal status of an FTZ.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have reached universal healthcare through social insurance, and I would say that people in Colombia have learned to claim and demand health as one of their social rights. One of the most important achievements has been the fact that health access has become an essential right. One of the latest advancements in this field has to do with the monoclonal antibodies treatment, which is also included within the system. The latest radiotherapy surgery is also available within the Colombian health system, which overall operates to international standards. One of the main strengths of the health system is that despite the current per capita payment level, we provide a full range of services; we have developed a highly efficient health system from an economic perspective. The hospital was established through a common effort from the Pontifica Universidad Javeriana and a number of private sector doctors back in 1942. Over the years, the center maintained its university character and today employs 2,250 staff. We work 24/7 and 365 days a year, while the average number of patients treated per day currently stands at 2,000.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Colombia's higher education system has many institutions offering high quality courses. The country has the potential to become a leading player in the regional education field and the world, because the sector today is undergoing a transformation, of which innovation and research are the main two drivers. Colombia offers many interesting programs within business management and administration. It is a country of contrasts, creative and unique, meaning that while studying these programs, students have the opportunity to complement their studies, as well as benefit from unique work experience. One of the main concerns in the sector today is the extremely high dropout level of around 50%. Our dropout rate is at 18%. We have promoted a progressive message about the benefits of debating social and public issues to the advantage of the country. We have built a unique brand over the years, one based on pluralism, austerity, and ethics.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The university system in Colombia has been developing over the past decade and a half. This has brought about a huge effort on the part of the government and a good number of universities to improve the quality of teaching and education. This has taken precedence over improving the quality and volume of research. That has been a bottleneck for growth, and has particularly hurt the status of Colombian universities in the international rankings, which are usually only measured in terms of research and perceptions of the country. The vision of the founders of ICESI was to create an excellent business school in Cali. It was in fact founded by local industry and is still supported by it. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, we transformed the mission of the institution to become a fully-fledged university on condition that the business school remained a highly competitive, excellent institution. We now offer social sciences, natural sciences, engineering, law, design, medicine, pharmacy, and other disciplines.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Colombia has a centuries-old tradition of education. However, while there are around 300 universities or institutions in Colombia, only 30 are accredited by the Ministry of Education, and of those 30 only 10 have been accredited for just under a decade. Although in actuality infrastructure in Colombia is short of what it could be, the study of design and engineering is solid. There is extensive research into biodiversity as well, as a result of the country's naturally diverse environment. Our degrees are well received in both the private and public sectors. There is also high demand from other countries in Latin America, and we have students in Europe, Asia, Japan, and India. There is a difference between political science and government, and ours was the first school that groomed the professionals who would go on to govern the various institutions of Colombia and other nations, as opposed to being confined to providing an education in political theory. We also offered studies in economy, business management, and international relations.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Over the past few years, we have seen increased cooperation between the public and private segments of the industry to raise the level of higher education in the country. We still need to improve the output and quality of our research activity as a sector. Many highly recognized public personalities graduated from our university and I have to say that, in particular, the School of Law has been one of the most reputable institutions of its kind in the country for the quality of our graduates and highly recognized lawyers. The university plans to achieve the so-called multisite accreditation; if we get it, then we will be able to establish university extensions and courses in any part of the country without specific certification. We are also in the process of obtaining international accreditation as a university to expand our profile overseas.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">INALDE is a business school established by a group of businessmen in 1985. Since ours are all executive-oriented programs, it is difficult to have foreign students. However, we do offer the possibility for our students to visit Mexico, the US, or China. Our first program, Advanced Management Program (PADE) had around 50 participants. A year later, we developed our second program, the PDD (Management Development Program). These programs aim at providing the right tools to understand the needs of large companies from the perspectives of HR, management, training, and more. Our Executive MBA program has over 22 years of experience; it is a very well structured program. Today, we have 16 full-time professors and every semester we invite around 25 professors from abroad. Educational institutions and authorities have lately strengthened research, making it compulsory at many levels, and we allocate 10% of our income to R&amp;D.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have been the leader in the development of residential and sports infrastructure projects in the area. It is my observation that the local area, due to its proximity to Bogotá and the lack of space in the capital, has become a regional point for capitalizing on the development of such projects. We formally set up the project in June 1996 through real estate developer Potosí­ La Pradera SA. However, some of the security issues that the country faced back then delayed the realization of the project. At the moment, we have around 660 members. The main concept behind our project is to provide entertaining alternatives for families. We have a type of membership called our “diplomatic visitor" package, and also offer temporary membership plans for foreign visitors. After all these years, we have seen a highly dynamic development of the area—at the moment, there are 65 urban development projects in the zones neighboring La Pradera, and they have matched our high standards to develop their projects.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Colombia has many golf players today, and with such events we support the development of professional golf players in our country. We have a golf course for senior players and another one for children. There is also a practice golf course for training purposes. One of our strong points is that we combine facilities for both professional and amateur practitioners, meaning everybody can enjoy their sport regardless of their level and purpose. Undoubtedly, the biggest change in our history was relocating the club headquarters from the grounds of the La Colina to the grounds of Los Arrayanes, which was made possible thanks to the acquisition of the latter in 1972 under the direction of Pedro Gomez Barrero. We are open to expanding our international profile in the near future, as we know the importance of such agreements in offering added value to our members when traveling abroad.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our association's management know-how significantly contributes to our growing golfing sector. You can find golf courses in locations of warmer weather, and other courses along the coast. All of the best courses in Colombia have been laid out by world-renowned designers. And what's more, it is relatively inexpensive to play golf at San Andrés Golf Club when compared with other top courses around the world, including Latin America. Until recently the club directors only thought about golf. However, they noticed an important change; not only did older people want to play golf, but also their children and grandchildren enjoyed the game as well. Member families have grown, and we have to give them the scope to do other activities. We needed to develop children's facilities, a pool, a nursery, and a complete infrastructure that provides activities and care to the children who don't play golf. The philosophy of the club is be committed to the community; we have a social responsibility for the Funza region, and purchase produce from it.</span></p>]]></sections21>

The industry over the past two or three quarters has grown by 17%. It is a highly concentrated market; in fact, the second most concentrated in the world. And while there are challenges, I think that, over time, we will succeed in bringing in more competition. We will achieve this through a greater focus on the customer. During the past year, customers have made it clear that they want better services. Data traffic accounts for about 60%-70% of our revenue, and I think that it has to be the focus for the future. However, we need to bring more affordable smart phones to the market. I expect the sector to grow by between 5% and 8% in 2014.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">ETB has 129 years of history and has always been a highly innovative company—we have been evolving ever since our first day, and the best example of our success in such a competitive industry is that we are one of the leading companies in Colombia. We should keep in mind the importance of Bogotá for Colombia; it represents 25% of GDP. As part of our strategic plan for the next five years, we are pushing innovation and investment to the forefront and plan to replace all our lines in Bogotá with fiber-optic infrastructure. Today, more than 200,000 households in Bogotá already benefit. And by the end of the year, we will have covered between 800,000 and 1 million households. We have received awards both nationally and internationally, which I believe boosts our already established credentials. However, the greatest accolade we have received is the current condition of our company; whereas two years ago it was up for sale and virtually at its end, today we proudly observe its solid development. This is a company that pioneers technologies and we see a bright future ahead of us.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We launched a 4G LTE network where we have about a 70% market share of LTE users in Latin America. We have also increased our ranking in brand awareness from fourth in the market to second. Were we to describe Colombian customers, we would first take into account disposable income; it's much lower than in many other countries. I believe that Colombia still has a problem in the telecommunications sector, which is concentrated in the mobile voice sector. Ultimately, telecommunications will split into two different sectors. On one hand you have one massive segment, the residential market, where growth is limited by GDP and the adoption of technology, which cannot have very high growth rates. And on the other you have the corporate segment in which the modernization of the state and private industry is lagging compared to other countries.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our FTZ belongs to Funza and Cota, two towns located in the Metropolitan Area of Bogotá in the Western Savanna Province, in respective ratios of 10% and 90%. In this context, we can rate the development of our FTZ in parallel to the development of Funza and Cota themselves, which has been both active and positive. Over the past few years, we have seen an increase in the activity of both local and foreign companies. We should keep in mind that Bogotá represents around 65% of the local market and that FTZs are usually established around the main logistics and consumption regions. We have also seen a decrease in the importance of agriculture in local economies, resulting from the fact that Bogotá has already absorbed us as it expands. FTZs have brought great dynamism to Colombia and its economy, especially after the amendment to Law 7 back in 2005, which brought a new regulatory framework to FTZs, making them much more attractive and efficient.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Four years ago, Mosquera had barely 100,000 inhabitants and lacked efficient drainage and water infrastructure. The Zona Franca de Occidente, along with a number of private companies, has provided over 50% of the funds to build the infrastructure. We also built the drinking water storage infrastructure—now the city has a 1,000 cubic meter infrastructure, when before it could only store 80 cubic meters. Furthermore, over the next couple of years, we will be building two further storage facilities and developing local infrastructure further. Our goal is to secure the drinking water supply for the entire population of Mosquera. Our arrival in the city has also transformed it into a driving economic force, and we have seen the establishment of other FTZs nearby. We are also part of several projects to develop as many as 18,000 housing units, because the population of Mosquera has considerably increased over the past couple of years. We have around 240,000 sqm available for future developments. So far, we have built infrastructure on around 40% of the area and we expect to close 2014 with that figure reaching 60%. Our aim is to continue offering integral services for those companies that want to establish operations in our FTZ. Since the beginning of our operations, we aimed at attracting companies with a very low environmental impact, meaning the absence of heavy industry.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I believe that construction, and free trade zones (FTZs) will grow in importance in Bogotá. The city represents around 30% of total GDP, and there alone lies a reason for a presence here. Colombia, historically, has had a centralized economy, which is why so many companies want to stay in Bogotá, or develop their businesses from here. We are directing our strategy toward the business process outsourcing (BPO), knowledge process outsourcing (KPO), and IT outsourcing (ITO) sectors, as these have seen annual growth of around 15%. To date, 65,000 jobs have been created by the FTZs in Colombia. Worldwide, an average of 1% of a country's population works in FTZs, meaning a global total of around 70 million people. Today, approximately 38 million sqm have been approved as FTZs, and over two-thirds of that space is available for use. We expect that by 2018 or 2020, around 1,700 companies will be established as residents of Colombia FTZs. We also foresee between 300,000 and 400,000 people working in FTZs.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Private management of this free trade zone (FTZ) began in 1994, although it had already been operative within another framework prior to that. All companies that set up operations in our FTZ enjoy a variety of commercial advantages, including numerous tax benefits. Furthermore, because the FTZ has been a leading force in the development of Cali for over two decades, we can provide a comprehensive range of services that a company needs to expand its activities. One main advantage is our location, as we are close to the Buenaventura Maritime Terminal and Port. The region has a dynamic and demanding internal market, which makes our FTZ extremely attractive too. We handle around $3 billion per annum in terms of foreign markets. According to official data, we are the third largest in Colombia in terms of foreign trade volume. And we handled around 20% of the country's foreign trade as at 2013.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our free trade zone, the Zona Franca Brisa, was approved in August 2010, and has a port and an FTZ for the mining and oil and gas sector. Its primary focuses are the petrochemical industry, the coal industry, and power generation. It is a free zone with a well-defined market, which is boosted by the port and its location 74 kilometers from Riohacha and 94 kilometers from Santa Marta at the Caribbean coast. In the south of the Guajira, we have a deepwater port that can service deep-draft vessels that few ports in Colombia can currently service. The benefits are mostly tax related, as a company in the zone pays no more than 15% income tax, whereas were it not in the free zone it would pay 36%. In customs terms, it is an extraterritorial area and thus not part of Colombia.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">One of Colombia's most attractive features for investors is the development of the internal market, where many are improving their social conditions in a climate of greater social security. This said, there are some areas where Colombia still needs to register improvement, such as the ease of opening a new business and/or bank accounts, as well as its tax regime and general bureaucracy. Our Latin American headquarters are located in Colombia, and we see Bogotá as the perfect location to manage our operations in the region. We know Bogotá as a major driver of Colombia's economy; however, we see a great potential in cities like Medellí­n, Cartagena, Cali, and Barranquilla. We fully anticipate infrastructure and other building projects in those cities. Our project, Cargo City Bogotá, is located on 19 hectares of land and features 75,000 sqm of modern air cargo warehousing and office facilities. Currently, occupancy rates are at 99%, and we are pleased at how it has evolved over time, bearing in mind that we have been present since 2010.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Abacus Real Estate's founding principle was that if you want to be a player in Colombia by owning a building or real estate development, you have to build it yourself. The nature of the country's ownership structure means that the potential for developing funds capable of acquiring existing properties was limited. There were few possibilities for consolidating good properties due to fragmentation and the use of strata-title. We recently closed our first fund—the OXO-Sustainable Properties Fund. Currently, we work with Skandia, Colfondos, Fondo Inversor, and Mundial de Seguros as our institutional capital providers. We are in the process of launching our next fund, which will be primarily focused on logistics and industrial properties. This fund will, hopefully, be in the $200 to $300 million range. Our first project is in the pipeline is in Barranquilla and should be closed within the next four or five months. A follow on project will be targeting the Pacific coast.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Private equity plays a minor role amongst the various investment alternatives in the market. Investments in private equity funds have reached around $1.5 billion, with commitments to reach approximately $3.4 billion. Colombian pension funds have approximately $70 billion under management. Approximately half of the assets under management (AUM) are in fixed-income instruments, whilst the remainder is divided between assets such as real estate or equities. US treasury bills have been at historically low levels, as have Colombian fixed-deposit rates, which means that investors have to design new strategies in order to compensate for the lack of return they had been obtaining from their traditional investments. Equities have been highly volatile both in emerging and developed markets. If infrastructure developments are executed correctly in Colombia, I believe we could grow by around 6% as the country has sufficiently strong internal demand to fuel such growth. In addition, Colombia has been developing a very interesting productive sector that may underpin future growth.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Terranum was born of the idea of creating an integrated real estate platform based on what we had seen abroad in the US and Europe. We opted for the real estate investment trust (REIT) model. Pension funds were starting to grow and we had begun to look at alternatives to fixed-income instruments. Corporates had, until then, owned major real estate holdings and were starting to compete on a more global basis, which naturally required capital. The legal framework took us a couple of years to put in place, but since then we have seen that an integrated platform for the development of corporate real estate services encompassing the investment dimension has allowed us to offer clients a one-stop shop. We have Ps1.5 billion under management, and are currently present in Bogotá, Medellí­n, Cali, Barranquilla, and Manizales. Roughly 63% of the portfolio is located in the capital. Terranum Capital is our low-income housing initiative. The fund was closed in June of 2013 with $235 million through a wide pool of investors. The target has been the housing deficit that we have in the region, which amounts to 20 million homes.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Exact was founded in 2005 by a Danish investment banker to provide capital for real estate projects, originally in Denmark. However, in 2007, due to market conditions in Europe, we decided to relocate to Latin America. Specifically, we saw in Colombia what we had seen in Brazil seven years before, namely the growing middle class, access to finance for property buyers, and a growing retail market. We want to be present in medium-sized cities to create a foothold and presence there, positioning us as a leader for the next two decades. Developers have traditionally financed projects by pre-selling units, just as they do in the residential sector. The fiduciary system creates the opportunity for developers to construct and sell relatively large projects with relatively little equity. That then generates the smaller stratified offices, and now because there is a lack of larger office space, funds are going in and financing projects to meet that need.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The main insurance opportunities are in the various infrastructure developments. Demand is rising and consequently the growth of the middle class impacts that of the economy, and naturally our sector expands. Of course, if unemployment declines, and more people find jobs, that means more sales for us. The competition in the consumer segment of the market is totally different and that is where we see real growth. In the past two years, we have increased the penetration rate up to 2.7% of GNP, which is positive because have grown from 2% in previous years, so we can say that we have penetrated a little bit more into the economy, although there is still room to grow. We need to keep moving in that direction. We have done everything to be ready for the coming years. In terms of premiums, in 2013 we closed on a figure close to ‚¬431 million.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The insurance sector is experiencing a boom. The economy itself has been doing well over the past 3 to 4 years. This has prompted many international players and some local ones to note the potential for growth of the insurance sector in emerging markets. Colombia, compared to its neighboring countries, has the lowest insurance penetration. Recently a major European insurer acquired 51% of Colpatria, which is one of the largest insurance financial groups in Colombia. Other European insurers are looking to buy or establish local companies, and we have seen American companies establishing here. We have seen smaller groups buying niche companies, specifically for bonds, for example. There is considerable appetite for new business and prices are declining in what has become a highly competitive market. Chubb is generating more than $12 billion in written premiums; the international zones alone represent 25% of the business.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">It has been a sound year for the insurance industry in Colombia. This was mainly due to the fact that the life insurance segment of the business saw strong growth supported by a pension commutation carried out by a government-owned company, Positiva, and a utilities company client, ETB, allowing for life insurance growth of 20% in 2013. When you look at the industry as a whole, it grew by about 14%. In the property and casualty segments, we grew 7%. As of year-end 2013, we are still at 2.3% penetration of GDP. QBE entered the Colombian market in 2005 when it acquired Compañí­a Central de Seguros, a local company that was bought at that time. Since this acquisition in 2005, almost 10 years on, QBE's presence in the country has been effectively passive. Since 2012, we have a new group CEO in place and are now working as a fully integrated, synergized multinational company.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The national insurance sector is growing, but I think the general population needs to be better educated about the benefits of insurance coverage. Insurance needs to be promoted from a quality-of-life perspective. If society were more unified and people worked together more, then I think they would naturally prepare for earthquakes, floods, fires, accidents, and death. Automobile insurance, while traditionally the most important segment, only has a 30% to 35% penetration rate in the market. Approximately 60% to 65% of our business is generated by business clients and about 35% to 40% comes from the consumer segment. Property insurance will contribute to our growth. We attend to over 3,400 commercial or business clients and over 200,000 consumer clients and users of our infrastructure.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In 2014, we will increase the capacity of our pipelines to over 140,000 barrels per day, which will make Ecopetrol more competitive and reduce costs. Secondly, we had a profitable operation with an integrated EBITDA of over Ps2 trillion in the first nine months of 2013. And thirdly, we are a secure vehicle for future investments. We have excellent results, but also pursue advances, especially in project development. Today, we have a transportation capacity of 110,000 barrels of oil per day (bbl/d) through the Bicentenario pipeline from the plains to the coast. Cenit's project portfolio is looking at $4 billion for the next four years. For 2014, we are talking about as much as a $1.5 billion investment focused on four large areas. The first area is the extension of OCENSA from 600,000 to 770,000 barrels, which represents around $1 billion between 2014 and 2015; the environmental license is already in place, allowing engineering and construction to commence. This project is highly important for being the one that will make transportation entirely viable.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Colombia has become a strong example for the production of clean energies and the implementation of schemes for their consumption at the retail level. However, we have to keep in mind that current production figures aim to cover current market demand, and no more. The government needs to expedite the process of adopting a new regulatory framework for offshore and shale gas (the two main areas the authorities are keen to develop), in order to boost investment in these areas. In sum, we need more dynamism in the industry to boost its development, and subsequently national consumption trends. The country's goal is to continue producing at least 1 million bbl/d. This poses a challenge in itself, as there are social, economic, and security aspects associated with sustaining production figures. Government changes also affect the production rhythm, and the presidential elections just passed. I personally expect 2014 to close on growth of between 4.5% and 6%. Current reserves are good for 6.8 years and the government has already stated its intention to raise this number to 10 years.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have also been expanding our coverage; we are leaders in aviation with a 68% market share. We also hold 46% of GMV, which supplies natural gas for vehicles, as well as 44% in liquid fuels. Meanwhile, we hold a 38% stake in diesel and gasoline for industrial use, and 21% of the lubricants market, the only area where we are not the market leaders. Our operations feature 29 storage plants and over 2,000 gas stations located beyond cities. Our main shareholders are made up of the third largest company in Chile, Empresas Copec, which has more than a 60% local market share. We are committed to being in alliance not just with the government, but also with the country at large. Everything we do must have social significance, and sustainability is our watchword. The foundations of life are crucial because we believe that education can bring about meaningful change for the country. For the future we need an educated population aware of how to manage Colombia's natural resources.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Today there is a conflict in the industry between operators, service companies, and national oil companies regarding who is who and who does what. To my thinking, operators need to be the owners of reserves. When I say the operators, the national oil companies are mostly the owners of reserves, and a glance at local history reveals that operators transfer technological know-how to the service companies, but still have concessions on the reserves when used by national oil companies. Today, these firms are unwilling to relinquish these reserves, whereby the operators, which are not service companies, but the Exxons and the Shells of the world, wonder what precisely they are left with. Meanwhile, the national oil companies have tried to impose service contracts on operators, which is economically flawed. Baker Hughes wants to become the technology partner of the reserve owner, and provide the technological assistance needed to develop reserves and maximize their economical utilization, without seeking ownership of the reserves or operating them, but rather by focusing squarely on the core activities that we do best.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Colombia is an interesting success story, having reached peak production in 1999 after the momentous discovery of Cusiana. When the country realized that it could lose its self-sufficiency, the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) was created in 2003. In fact, this attracted all of the investment to have entered the oil and gas sector between 2003 and 2007, leading to a production increase of 500,000 to 1 million bbl/d. Colombia's oil production statistics rank in around the top 20 countries in the world. Colombia would require oil discoveries of approximately 360 million bbl/d to maintain the current annual production rate. Determining where it is going to come from is where Colombia's prospects come into play. Certain key regulatory changes coming emerging in 2014 are set to be critical for the country, influencing short-term and medium-term production. We have yet to run upstream services in Colombia, although we do have a lubricant business that has been active for around 75 years, which remains quite attractive.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Port of Buenaventura requires social development and logistics infrastructure. It also needs an excellent airport to facilitate increased arrivals of people wishing to benefit from Cali's health cluster. Cali conducts 3% of all plastic surgery in the world, which is clearly potential to be exploited. Meanwhile, the Port of Buenaventura, situated on the Pacific coast, and facing Asia, has incredible potential. With improved port, road, and airport infrastructure, we could become the most successful region in the country. The geographical location provides access to various markets: North America, Central America, and on the Atlantic coast Europe and Africa. It allows us, with two cities of such great importance as Buenaventura and Barranquilla, to be the point of entry and exit for Colombian production to the world. We are not actually producers, but rather, we commercialize elements of medical technology. We have important world-class representation, and our success lies in having quality products, great service, and an excellent work ethic.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Survival requires us to be competitive and innovative, to work with the talent present in the Cauca Valley region, and to train human capital in different corporate aspects for the development of our suppliers. Without good suppliers, it is impossible to make a good product. The major companies in the Cauca Valley are competitive and have the will to survive. Moreover, they are keen to become international players and move beyond the frontier, first to South America and thence beyond. Approximately 600 people work with us, and our intention is to retain them for the long term to be trained and transformed into a highly skilled workforce. By law, we are obliged to train people from universities. In this region we boast major names: Johnson &amp; Johnson has a manufacturing plant here, as do Palmolive and Unilever, which have a huge factory near the airport and a brand new facility. We have the best culture in the country for cosmetics because we host the main alcohol producers in the valley in the sugar cane industry, and are also the major carton-packaging producer.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Since the 1950s and 1960s, this region has been characterized by its many entrepreneurs looking to develop industry. The city then experienced a boom, which lasted until the early 1970s, when Cali was transformed into the foremost entrepreneurial and industrial zone of Colombia, due to its closeness to the Pacific and to the Port of Buenaventura. In the 1970s and 1980s, many multinational companies settled in the valley. We experienced stagnation during the 1990s, but for the past four to five years this has been changing and becoming yet more dynamic. Foreign investment, and that from other regions of the country, is always well received here, as local businesses see that they can form part of larger productive chains. Between 10 and 15 years ago, we were a regional company, but after commencing a national expansion process, we now have distribution centers in 10 cities across the country. In 2013 we had turnover of over $50 million, with utility of around $2 million. Production is confined to the Cauca Valley. Yet, through these distribution centers I believe we can reach around 170 to 200 municipalities.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Cauca Valley is an excellent platform on which the nation can recover its leadership and attract FDI and foreign companies. We must bear one thing in mind, however, which is that this region is not rich in the typical investment operations, such as mining and oil. It is more attractive in terms of opportunities to invest in industry, due to its well-trained labor force. Growing the company allows us to grant opportunities to the people around us, which will result in a higher standard of living and more opportunities for people. We have doubled production for the last five years on over 10% annual growth. And that is because of the relationship between the cost of manufacturing excellence, and how we deal with customers and international expansion. In the region, we are the largest company, and are working on growing more into this part of the region. The technological differences between our company and our competitors in the area are significant. Today, we operate with state-of-the-art technology compared to regional manufacturers.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I believe that the most important infrastructure development the Cauca Valley needs in order to become more competitive is the completion of the dual carriageway to the Pacific port of Buenaventura, which has long been under construction, while we also need to increase the depth of the access canal to the port of Buenaventura to receive the larger ships that will be passing through the new Panama Canal when completed. Although the geographical conditions are difficult, it would also be an ideal complement to the port's airport to have a longer landing strip to accommodate large cargo aircraft. Besides, of great importance is the construction of the La Lí­nea highway tunnel, which will cross beneath the central range of the Andes Mountains, easing traffic on one of Colombia's most important east-west connections. Unfortunately, it is being built in only one direction, for export cargo only, and ideally it should operate in both directions.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Nowadays, we cover 36 municipalities and 130 towns in the Cauca Valley. In other words, our penetration level reaches 95% in terms of services. We also have around 40,000 users connected through Buenaventura Maritime Port, infrastructure that does not have supplying gas pipes—we transport the gas by trucks. Apart from that, we have also developed other products during this period of time, such as Brilla, a non-banking product to finance bills, and we can proudly say that more than 190,000 families in the region have already benefited from this product. We have almost a 100% rate in terms of clients keeping abreast of bill payment. That means that we have high levels of liquidity as a company. Additionally, our tariffs are competitive and all types of client, regardless of their social status, can afford them. Our Brilla business model was highlighted by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) as an attractive non-bank financing option that helps reduce poverty. The program has been regionally praised for being a highly inclusive initiative; nowadays, over 300,000 families benefit from our services thanks to the scheme. It is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of our main successes as a company; we provided credit lines to those clients who purchased their gas installations from us, and those were clients that other companies often did not want to grant such credit lines to. It is a way to reward our clients' trust by providing them with financing opportunities to acquire other equipment for their households. A recent study showed that families from the Brilla program saved up to 6% more on a year-to-year basis than other families.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Barranquilla has experienced positive and dynamic urban, social, economic, and industrial development over the past few years. We can feel this development through the electric energy consumption patterns, not only in the city, but in the region in general, as Electricaribe distributes electric energy to the seven coastal departments. For example, electric consumption in Colombia grows at an average rate of 2% to 3% per annum, whereas on the coast the figure reaches almost 7%. The signature of free trade agreements (FTAs) in the past couple of years has boosted the role of the area in the national economy, and its economic and industrial development. This alone is already a key driver in the increased consumption of electric energy. Cities like Santa Marta, Barranquilla, and Cartagena have developed remarkably over the past few years. In this context, certain economic sectors have taken the lead in this growth; in Santa Marta and Cartagena, port and logistics services have been the drivers of expansion; also, there has been an increase in urban infrastructure projects led by the development of the tourism industry. Industrial and tourism developments are driving up the consumption of electric energy, and at the same time we have seen an increasing number of people accessing the electricity network thanks to their social and economic development. Over 2013 we carried out some capacity expanding projects at power stations in order to meet the increasing demand for electric energy. These projects will contribute to the industrial and economic development of the remote areas we cover within the seven coastal departments of Colombia. Currently, we have around 2.4 million clients and 80% of them come from strata 1 and 2, as well as the above-mentioned settlements and special zones. The main objectives of our company are to reduce losses, achieve better bill payment, help our clients become regular and solid payers, and improve service quality. We managed to curtail losses in 2013 by up to 17%, we reduced service blackouts, and we managed to meet the increasing energy demands of the market.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">EMCALI is an energy provider and distributor, and one of the major energy providers in the country. We aim to add innovation to our energy operations as well, and also to move into renewables. We aim for every house to be able to contribute to their own energy needs through solar power; we want our citizens to be energy generators, and to achieve this within three years. Our vision is for every roof in Cali to be generating energy, with EMCALI paying households for surplus energy. Cali has one of the foremost infrastructure networks in Colombia. And in our telecommunications company, we aim to bring value-added to our internet services and connectivity offering, becoming a comprehensive, high-quality platform. We want to improve our follow-up and after-sales services, and place technology, innovation, and quality in the hands of the community. We're also inaugurating entrepreneurship centers for young people, to encourage the development of apps. EMCALI works closely with Empresa de Energia del Pacifico (EPSA). We are both shareholders and clients of the company, and carry out innovation projects for clients together with EPSA. We're set to become partners in the Solar Decathlon; the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon is an international competition that challenges 20 college teams to design, build, and operate the most effective, and energy-efficient solar-powered house. We have a diversity of plants and a well-developed infrastructure that offers many opportunities for foreign companies wanting to invest in Cali and in the energy sector in particular.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have been in the market since 1997, and over the past few years have prioritized winning public confidence. We were the first company in the country to trade energy. We aim to continue strengthening trust and reliability through qualitative services, competitive prices, post-sales services, and professional and well-qualified human resources. We currently work on new energy generation opportunities, as well as broadening our service portfolio. For example, we believe we can develop interesting projects within the solar energy field. However, we are still dependent on official approval of the new law for renewable energy. The government would do well to subsidize several fields in the industry, specifically those related to solar energy. Our tariffs are today one of our most competitive advantages. This is possible thanks to the current tariff structures. We have larger and more concentrated clients than most other companies, which allows us to offer more competitive prices. We also offer more personalized services. One of our strongest features is that we have a long-term strategy and purchase energy well in advance. For example, three years ago we bought supplies to cover 2015, which comes at a cheaper cost. Meanwhile, our commitment to the environment is represented through our increasing efforts to educate society on how to conserve energy, preserve river basins, and other important considerations.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Since the Association was established, the sector's growth has been exponential. By June 2013, the sector managed assets worth Ps250 billion, representing 37% of GDP. The Financial Superintendency of Colombia (SFC) grants two types of licenses to the trust sector: trust management licenses and collective investment fund licenses. The 27 trust companies currently operating in Colombia manage 126 types of funds amounting to Ps30 billion. In terms of regulation, Colombia has made important advances in different areas. Over the past few years, changes in the tax framework and strict control over the sector by the SFC have enabled it to strengthen. Moreover, in June 2013, the government introduced a new regulatory framework, adjusting the collective investment funds industry to international standards. Trust companies possess extensive knowledge of the country and its regulatory framework, as well as experience in how to conduct business in a flexible and transparent way. This allows foreign investors to minimize risks and have an easier approach to a new market.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The sector has enjoyed continued growth and expansion at all levels; we closed the year with around Ps275 trillion in assets under management. Overall, the trust industry continues to be an attractive option for the management of state assets and resources, along with real estate developments and family-related issues, and 2013 was a good year not only in terms of managed assets, but also in the total number of trusts. The industry generates much added value, as it manages resources from the state by pushing transparency to the forefront, and by generating more efficient processes when it comes to the management of these resources. Regarding real estate developments, we are a sector that provides security to all segments, ensuring the sound management of family assets and resources. We currently manage around 180 trusts, $300 million in assets, and a mutual fund that has an estimated value of $80 million and with average growth rates of around 400% across all segments.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have risen fourfold from Ps500,000 million in 2009 to where we are today, at almost Ps2 billion. We had operated in four key segments: retail, companies, institutional, and the corporate segment. Yet in 2013, we entered a new segment; what we call the Premium Segment (private banking), which caters to our top clients, including personal and premium banking services. Our portfolio in investment funds is heavily concentrated in fixed income, both short and medium term. About 98% of our portfolio is fixed income; the rest is variable income (stocks). The average Colombian investor is quite conservative when it comes to risk. In general, the allocation in the fund industry in Colombia is 95% fixed-income and 5% variable-income; therefore, there is a long way to go in our market in terms of innovation. Assets given to the industry for management, by June 2013, represent approximately 35% of GDP. If we add in assets under the management of investment funds, the figure is at around 40%. This indicates that the perception is good and the numbers are increasing.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">When one uses assets under management (AUM) to assess the development of the sector, one must understand that it is possible to have a high volume of AUM with a very low turnover. For this reason, it is better to talk about commissions, the number of operations you manage, and the volume. The trustee sector experienced an interesting trend in 2013; the volume of operations rose, but at the same time income volume fell. That was due to a loss in the net asset value (NAV) of funds experienced last March, after which many people retrieved their investments. The asset management industry is mainly a fixed-income market, as the country has historically suffered from high levels of inflation. At the same time, other markets, such as derivatives, are only in their infancy. The evolution of this industry will be linked to large investors.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Fiduciaries can engage in any branch of business. In our case, we deal with asset management and custodial services. Also, we support our bank with trust structures that help to strengthen relationships with existing customers in the bank. On the other hand, for the market perspective, we believe that the role of fiduciary institutions at the present time is more related to deepening the capital markets. In this sense, we have taken the initiative to find the best scenarios for growth in the asset management business and custodial services. The asset management business line is the mutual fund business and discretionary portfolios, and the main service is global custody whose principle clients are foreign. In mutual funds and asset management, our clients are retailers, small businesses, and universities, which consider our fund to be a good alternative for investing and generating savings. Also, we have corporate clients that consider it to be a good option for cash management and mutual funds.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Colombia is a large Latin American country, in which we are not yet present, but look forward to having operations in soon. It is a country of enormous potential in terms of population and economic growth, and also one with huge infrastructure needs. The current expansion in power production should be sufficient to provide energy to Panama and Central America and increase flows to Ecuador and Venezuela, and possibly even further south to Peru and Chile. Given its wealth of resources, Colombia is better off looking into hydro (which is renewable), but not the more unconventional sources. I think solar, thermal, and wind power have a long way to go before they can prove economically efficient in the country. We also believe LNG to be a promising opportunity, for the country as a whole, and for our company. It will give a new shape to the energy matrix and make it more competitive, solving some of the problems the country has today, such as the El Niño effect.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The decision to enter Colombia was made three years ago; however, it was not until the beginning of 2013 with prequalification in the 4G-concession program that the group plan started to get off the ground. Currently, the focus is on continued participate in the 4G program, plus at some point, the development of an alliance with a company in Colombia. Our targets are infrastructure projects in which we can invest, as well as construct, and operate. Our other focus is on entering the oil and gas industry. We are active in Peru, where we operate small fields, pipelines, storage facilities, and gas facilities. We are looking at the oil and gas sector as a sector to invest in construction or operation, or else are considering operation services for the major E&amp;P companies. Graña has had a clear strategy for entering new markets shunning entry as a new player. In Chile, the company entered as a local outfit pursuing acquisitions. Our strategy here is the same, namely to identify the right partner to work with.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have generally seen growth in Colombia across a broad range of economic sectors, including agriculture, healthcare, and education. However, if you compare our growth over the past two or three years in the ICT industry with that of GDP, you note that the ICT sector has grown at least four percentage points more than GDP, and in 2013 the figure was around six percentage points more. During the past three years, the government has been working on its Vive Digital plan. Basically, that project was aimed at installing a broadband connection into all the small villages in the country. The government's target was to have at least 1,000 small villages connected by August 2014, and they have reached, or are at least close to, that target already. The next step is deciding what kind of applications we will have, in order to maximize the use of the cables. Education is first, then e-government, agriculture, minerals, and then all the industries.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have been extremely active in the adoption of international standards from the UK and the US. We have taken more control over quality and have implemented strict production processes for Colombian industry. This has led to an increase in total exports for demanding markets. These exports comprise not only goods and products, but also engineering, technology, design, and consultation. Currently, the country is facing some problems in terms of its level of industrial competitiveness; we have problems regarding infrastructure and logistics costs, so it is still expensive to move cargo and goods within the country. However, we have seen many construction-related companies expand their operations to other Latin American countries. At PAVCO, we expect to close 2014 on growth of 10% in our activity and 40% growth in exports, keeping in step with sector development.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We must build closer links between the agricultural and industrial sectors, so we can shift from exporting commodities to exporting finished products of greater value. Grupo Nutresa recently acquired Chilean company Tresmontes Luchetti, the second largest food outfit in that country. We utilize Tresmontes Luchetti's activity and infrastructure in Mexico to expand our activities there, as well as introduce its products in Peru and our products in Chile, and benefit from the free trade agreements (FTAs) Chile has with a number of Asian countries, which Colombia currently lacks. All in all, our current business activity focuses on the Andean community of countries, Central America and the Caribbean, and the US. We have also signed an agreement with the Mitsubishi Corporation, which has a food division that can open up the coffee market in Asia to Colombian coffee. We foresee further future acquisitions as well, as this will be one of our main growth strategies in the region.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Nowadays, our direct export activity is focused on seats and chairs for cinemas and auditoria destined for four continents. We constantly innovate in partnership with the film industry, which is our major client. In addition, we work on new ideas for furniture design. Cali has an interesting future ahead of it, revolving around its proximity to the Pacific coast. Much of the economic future of the world is focused on the Pacific, and we in the Cauca Valley are Colombia's gateway to that region. The truth is that for the Pacific Alliance to generate benefits in the industrial sector, the national government in particular, and to a lesser extent the regional governments, must consolidate their industrial policy, which is one of the aspects that a foreign investor interested in the industrial sector looks for.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Cauca Valley is the best location in Colombia. We are in a privileged geographical location, close to the Port of Buenaventura and the country's main cities. Besides that, we can easily import and export from here. FOGEL Andina can produce up to 5,000 units a month. For 2014, we are set to export 60% to 65% of our production to South American countries like Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay, and Bolivia. We are located close to the Port of Buenaventura, from where we can export back to countries like Ecuador and Peru. From here, we can also ship our goods to all cities in Colombia. Moreover, the labor force in Cali is skilled and we have good people trained for the mechanical industry. The industry is still not growing as we would like, but as Cali is a good place to live in and offers competitive prices, the next boom in Colombia is destined to happen here.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The word INDUMIL is a portmanteau of the Spanish words Industria Militar, which means Military Industry. Today, the bulk of our business activity comes from the mining industry; we provide the sector nationwide with the explosives it needs to operate. Additionally, we provide weaponry and ammunition to our armed forces, as well as to the police, security bodies, and similar institutions. We also have several agreements with other companies for know-how and technology exchange, as well as import capacities for our defense industry. Colombia enjoys a privileged geographical position and sits in the middle of a very dynamic continent. In addition to that, we are close to the Panama Canal, and have access to two oceans. In this context, we believe there is a huge potential for us to import equipment and technology. We also have the production capabilities to become a leading exporter in the region.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The mining sector is highly important and has much potential in Colombia. The government is trying to develop the sector with all the right incentives in order to realize this potential. The government should try to expedite permits and authorizations, while facilitating the development of projects, as long as these are undertaken in full legality, and as long as they are to the benefit to the country. The lack of infrastructure is a problem for small and medium-sized companies. In partnership with other coal companies, we are the owners of FENOCO, the railroad concession company. We have essentially completed the construction of the double line, with the exception of a stretch of 45 kilometers. Once this is completed, the capacity of the railroad will be huge, at around 80 million tons per year. Right now we are focusing on the expansion of the port, which is an investment of nearly $350 million. We are expecting a production level of 30 to 32 million tons for 2014.</span></p>]]></sections01>

Esmeracol has over 40 years of experience in the industry and we currently have an exploration and extraction area of 40 hectares. The mines we operate were previously state-owned, and we exclusively carry out underground mining activities, out of environmental concerns. Illegal mining in our country still represents a high percentage of the industry's activity, however, people operating illegal mines do not have the resources to better exploit them and generally are subsistence operations. In this context, public policies have been aimed at formalizing activity in the sector. Current studies show that today just 10% of the available mines in Colombia are operative. Several foreign companies have conducted studies here and established that Colombian mines remain in a virgin state. The great biodiversity and geographic landscape of Colombia hides many minerals underground, and to reach them we need the most advanced technologies in the mining industry, only available to industry giants.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">My most important aim in 2012-2013 was to continue enhancing the Muzo name and emerald mining throughout the world. We have had the opportunity to meet different companies that engage in mining on a broader scale worldwide. For example, Gemfields manages 20% of the colored stones in the world and has the largest emerald mine in the world today in Zambia. The Muzo Mine is legendary and has been around for a couple of centuries, since the colonial era. The emeralds traded around the world were thought to come from Mexico and other countries, but in actual fact all originate from Muzo, and were smuggled out of Colombia and sold in other countries. We need greater investment and more mining companies employing diverse exploration methods and leading edge technologies to discover more emeralds. While the emerald belt is huge, the actual exploitation of the mines is small in scale. If you put Coexminas and Santa Rosa together we only operate on 200 hectares, even though the emerald belt runs to over 100,000 hectares.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Colombia is in a period of such considerable economic growth that plenty of work is being generated for the local population. Colombia welcomes professionals who are leaving their home countries, and we recognize that these people are extremely educated and possess vast professional experience. The increasing number of multinationals coming to Colombia has boosted the demand for fluently bilingual people, which has contributed to an influx of people from Spain and other neighboring countries. Colombia has a long road ahead, and peace would expedite its development. I hope the peace talks bring the country closer to stability, as I am convinced that it would boost the arrival of private investment and position Colombia's economy at the same level as that of Mexico.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Companies have to assume a leading role. When the peace agreement is signed, this will only be the beginning. Many people will be “unemployed" as a result, and in general will adopt a lifestyle more formalized that the one they had known while at arms, and that is where the private sector comes into its own. Naturally, this has to be accompanied by government policies, and there has to be some incentive for businesses, as they may be cautious about the implications of taking on former combatants. We will have to create jobs that match their experience and knowledge and will also have to teach and train them to be competitive. Construction companies can offer unskilled labor to people entering the workforce for the first time, as an industry of many knowledge levels. This offers the prospect of career advancement for those keen to advance themselves.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The first thing to remember is that this is not the first peace process that we have undertaken. I think the business community was at first wholly skeptical. Yet we have been having these conversations for a year now, and feel this is the moment for peace. Then again, many people prepared for the post-conflict era question whether they are prepared to employ ex-combatants. We have been working with the reintegration agency because this is a long-term project. And it is not just a question of signing a peace treaty, as there need to be alternatives for all people. This process is estimated to require at least six years; hence, we have much to learn in the period ahead. At the Chamber of Commerce, we have been working with the Colombian Reintegration Agency and hiring ex-combatants in subsidiaries, such as at Corferias, or at our university. So far, we have generated around 73 positions.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Colombian Agency for Reintegration (ACR) is part of the Presidency of the Republic of Colombia and is integrating into civil society people who have demobilized from illegal armed groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), the paramilitary umbrella group AUC, and other smaller groups. This process takes, on average, seven years per person. During that time, we offer them psychological attention, academic and vocational training. We also help people in transitioning back into legal economic activities with the purpose of fully integrating them into society. Currently, there are over 30,000 ex-combatants participating in the reintegration process nationwide.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Depending on each area, we pursue a different type of strategy in order to get Colombian products to the international market, and to attract tourists and investment into Colombia. As a private company, we have the flexibility to change strategies when we need to, and this allows us to be more proactive and efficient for our exporters. We are proud to have been able to attract over 25 countries to invest in Colombia, generating more than 60,000 jobs, and bringing 197 projects to 20 departments. That is one of Proexport's greatest achievements. We have increased the base of exporters that are going to the US by 41%. There are 1,609 new companies exporting to the US today. Proexport's success is partly due to the fact that, if you are coming to Colombia to invest, we provide you with all the information you require, organize meetings, and help you with other investment requirements here. We help to solve the problems investors encounter along the way. The cost for this service is zero—it is confidential and free.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our role includes involving social and private agents in boosting investment in the city, while maintaining a methodology that allows us to establish the strategic value-added sectors for the development of the city. Sectors evolve and Bogotá is currently seeking its true vocation as a city; we put much emphasis on the services industry, which, along with commerce, represents 75% of the city's GDP—without commerce the percentage is about 62%. Bogotá has the largest number of higher education institutions (115) in Colombia, and approximately 100,000 people become part of the qualified workforce every year in this city. Additionally, 55% of the country's PhDs are earned in Bogotá, and 30% of those 100,000 people graduate here. Therefore, Bogotá is a highly attractive city for new companies in any sector that requires qualified employees. Bogotá is a clear example of how the country evolves; there are an increasing number of tourists arriving, investment in the hospitality sector is growing, and the number of SMEs is rapidly expanding (today, there are above 300,000 companies in the city), as is that of multinationals with a presence in Bogotá (1,500).</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The current positive economic trends Colombia is experiencing, coupled with the idea of seeing them continuing over coming years, brought us to the conclusion that we needed to set up a common communication strategy to help the world learn about Colombia as an attractive destination that can meet the prerequisites that many investors and tourists seek. We changed the visual identity of the brand. Before, we had hearts as the main trademark of Colombia; as we were appealing to the emotions such an image seemed essential. When rethinking our campaign and strategies, we came to understand that we needed another visual identity for the brand; our main aim was to create an image that would adapt to the different campaigns we launch every year. There is one major difference; when selling the image of a product, you are usually in total control of that product, meaning you can modify it. However, when dealing with a country, we are dealing with an active and dynamic subject; therefore, the challenge has to do with our capability to be flexible and to grab those opportunities to better promote it.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Today, we can proudly say that 75% of the passenger trains sold in Mexico during the last 21 years are CAF trains. Our main goal after becoming the leading player in the sector is to maintain this position, because the competition is tough. I would say that innovation and flexibility have been the key elements in our success, and we always try to understand the needs and circumstances of our clients at all levels, including the financial ones. CAF exported its first full passenger train to Mexico in the early 1990s, therefore it became the first country to which CAF started to fully export production. CAF has developed full projects in Mexico, meaning production, export, operation, and maintenance. CAF has found stability and security in Mexico, including security in our investments; we believe the government of Mexico is highly committed to foreign investors.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Kansas City Southern of Mexico (KCSM) is committed to the country, and has been present here for 17 years. This year we will be investing $143 million in Mexico in infrastructure and the maintenance of our network, as well as the acquisition of new equipment. We foresee a highly positive future for Mexico and growing volumes for our business. In intermodal freight transport anything can be moved by container. We have 4,200 kilometers of tracks in Mexico out of a total of around 20,000 kilometers, so that's around 25% of the total. That doesn't mean we have 25% of the market, however. I would say we're moving about 30% of the market on our trains. Almost all our freight either starts or ends at the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas. Most of the materials we transport either come through Lázaro Cárdenas or go through there. The port of Tampico and the port of Veracruz are also very important for us. In Nuevo Laredo we're now building what we call a secure corridor, and we're also changing the whole track from Nuevo Laredo to Monterrey, converting it into a high-speed track that can also transport a greater volume of freight, or at least more weight.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Normally 46% of our operations comprise whatever the railroads deliver, while 30% is intermodal and 24% is local freight. That means that 54% of the business of Ferrovalle is promoted by us, though we expect a ratio of 50:50 in the near future. There has been exceptional growth of warehousing in 2014, which has increased the percentage of income generated by Ferrovalle. As an industry, we are a technologically advanced modern freight railroad. Our market share today is at around 26%, vs. truck transportation, but should exceed 30% over the coming five or six years as we offer a safe, clean, long-distance, and cost-effective service. Also, we contribute to a reduction of congestion on the roads. Even though we are constricted with space in central Mexico City, we are developing additional space to offer better services. We have already built a yard for empty containers where we do not charge storage fees, up to a certain volume of containers, but were able to grow through the increased handling of empties. Most of our customers with containers are shipping companies.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Since the privatization of railway transportation 15 years ago, we have improved the country's infrastructure significantly. Ferromex in particular has been active in this area. Though there were some corridors with good infrastructure, there were others that were not in good condition because of the volumes and the weight of the cars. Ferromex has been investing heavily in state-of-the-art locomotives with more horsepower and the capacity to reduce fuel consumption, and on the infrastructure side, we have been renewing many of the lines, the ties, and the rail infrastructure and improving and enlarging the sidings. The longest trains demand sidings. If two trains want to cross on the same line, one has to pull over. Currently we can accommodate trains of more than 2.5 kilometers in length in such situations, and in general we are striving to increase our capacity and performance. About 81% of all the Mexican foreign trade is with the US, and the US economy is growing; it has overcome its recession.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are innovating in terms of services, for instance we are launching here in Mexico our services based on satellite images (Predial, infrastructure image services for the oil and gas and telecomm industries), but we are also innovating to improve delivery. We are keen to innovate with revenue sharing models, for example, where we assist clients in reducing their IT-related operational costs. We are a company that takes risks and usually do so jointly with our clients. We help them to implement new ways of saving, which enables us to access new markets through the revenue-sharing selling model. We operate in many different ways, and opt for the one-on-one approach with our customers; our executives meet and talk about new ways of innovating and selling, and demonstrate how we can help our retailer, bank, or telecommunications company to innovate. For example, we help telecommunications companies provide new services for smart phones. We have developed several new ideas abroad, which we subsequently exported. Meanwhile, our alliances and partnerships also determine the market.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">As our world and industry change, we must keep up with the times. Our offering of solutions and services is constantly evolving and driving the marketplace forward. For example, before the advent of mobile telephony, we were primarily a telephone card manufacturer. When mobile technology emerged, Gemalto realized the enormous opportunity and evolved to become the leader in SIM card production, a completely different venture with numerous additional solutions and value added services. As the market for SIM cards becomes saturated, we are again moving into exciting new directions. Today, most people around the world have a mobile telephone, which opens the door to offering a new realm of services. For example, six years ago, we were among the first to offer secure mobile banking services; now we are offering secure mobile payment and mobile wallet solutions. Innovation underpins our business at every turn. As a global technology leader, we are able to leverage our success abroad and be the first to bring leading edge solutions and services into the country.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Retail is really exploding in Mexico. Even though the economy is not moving as fast as we would like, stores are still opening every day. If you look around, many chains from the US are arriving in Mexico. The energy sector is also going to grow within the next three to five years once reforms are passed and laws are published. Many telecoms companies are also coming to Mexico to develop that sector. We need more competition in telecoms, and I expect it within the next two to three years. Mexico is divided into two parts: one is where the economy is growing and modernized. The other part is where mid-sized companies are not as competitive, lacking access to technology; this is where companies like AVNET can really make an impact. With solutions such as the cloud, we can provide technology inexpensively. Bandwidth is still expensive in Mexico, but once the competition starts to take place and bandwidth prices start to fall, companies are really going to have to buy the pipelines and the services behind them, which is going to be cheap to do.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">BMC's solutions reduce costs, strengthen security, increase efficiency, and improve service delivery, while addressing federal IT policies. Mexico's culture is different in many ways to other parts in the world. Our customers have specific needs, but sometimes there is complexity on how they organize their IT departments. Creative solutions to problems are part of our culture, and many IT organizations adopt best practices and seek other frameworks/tools to use. Some are early adopters and others like the idea of a expert vendor that guides them. We, as a high-tech company, try to innovate and bring to our customers the better technology and professional services to solve their problems, always adapting our technology to their needs and guide them on best practices. Our focus is on reducing customer costs, generating value with our solutions, and providing technical support for our products. We expect the government to start investing in dependency management for major projects. It was announced that in 2014 Mexico will allocate the largest budget for an infrastructure project in its entire history.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Mexican market is crucial for Apotex; it marked the company's first excursion abroad, and today we are the second largest subsidiary outside of the Canadian market. Apotex Mexico is the headquarters for Latin America, and from here we supply the rest of Latin America with both Mexican-made and Canadian products. We package them here in different formats for the Central American market, and in the very near future also for the Argentinian market. Currently, we have operations in four countries in Latin America, and distributors in Guatemala, Honduras, and Ecuador. We make 35% of our net sales to government institutions. Of our local production, 70% is destined for the state sector due to the high unit volume involved. Our competitive advantages are primarily quality, and secondly price. We are not a low-price company, as we need to maintain the quality proposition that underpins our reputation in the sector.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Boehringer Mexico has grown strongly and rapidly because it has a powerful pipeline, the trust of the medical community and patients, and a stronger market position than any other affiliate in the Boehringer Ingelheim universe. In Mexico, we are the sixth largest company in the pharmaceutical sector, and rank at around 17th in the world. Doctors in Mexico believe in our products' quality, efficacy and safety, and are confident in the business ethics of Boehringer Ingelheim. We have been in operation for almost 130 years, and have been present in Mexico for over 65. While other companies are losing patents in key product lines, we have close to 10 products set for launch in the market between 2010 and 2017 in our strongly innovative pipeline. Mexico has now been nominated to manufacture diabetes products for the rest of the world, including the Americas, and soon to the US if the FDA confirms our strategy. Independently from the diabetes products, we currently manufacture cardiovascular products for the US and are set to manufacture over the counter products for the rest of the world, which will result in a much larger local facility.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Cí­rculo de la Salud is one of Nadro's strategic programs as the content it carries provides a mechanism of professionalizing independent retailers, thereby enhancing their ability to compete with the larger pharmacy chains. Cí­rculo de la Salud deals effectively with the ethical issues involved in prescription substitution, supporting the doctor-patient relationship, while at the same time promoting the development of over 7,000 Nadro clients that are currently benefiting from this program. There is a second stage to this ecosystem called Cí­rculo de la Salud Oro, where retailers are effectively connected to our CRM (or Customer Relationship Management) platform, giving patients access to a number of loyalty programs provided by the pharmaceutical industry. While we now have over 450 retailers using our CRM, we expect this number to increase significantly in the short term. The National Institute of Genome Medicine is generating breakthroughs, and is one of the most important scientific institutions in Mexico. This area of medicine is a slow-burn endeavor as we are still very much learning the genetics of pathology.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Mexico represents the main business in Latin America. We started in Mexico in 2011, thanks to regulatory changes. Historically we have seen a regulated market, and the increased regulatory environment has rebuilt confidence in the country and in our line of business. Mexico is the reference country for certain Latin American markets, such as Colombia, Peru, and Chile. For us, Mexico is strategically the head of the business for the rest of Latin America and our presence here will grow year by year. We have reached ambitious targets thanks to new market regulations. This market offers many opportunities to companies such as ours that are vertically integrated. We have invested $150 million, and the main impact of this will be in bio-similarities, and are launching a line of products focused on HIV too. We aim to nurture an environment in which this research is respected by the authorities. I think ours is one of the few companies to have invested in clinical trials here in Mexico, and we are planning to set up a production plant as well.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are working very closely with the Federal Secretary of Tourism and FONATUR to boost support for Hidalgo. They are now working on four projects that are going to impact the position of Hidalgo State as a tourism destination. One of them is the project of the archeological zone of Tula, one of the most important cultures of ancient Mexico. The other is a convention center that we are planning to build that we hope to call “The City of Knowledge and Culture." It will be in the city of Pachuca. This project will help to improve the economy. Companies come to Hidalgo because it is more cost effective than other destinations, as well as the sensational food that is on offer here. There is a third project concerning a new center for festivals and events, with the San Francisco Fair being the most popular and important, which is held in October. The final project has to do with central downtown Pachuca. There is a plan to create a cultural center for music, dance, and performance artists, not just from Hidalgo, but for the entire nation and other countries, too. That is one of the goals of Governor Francisco Olvera Ruiz. However, we still need support from the federal government to make it possible.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Jalisco is Mexico, because all the climates and geographies that our country offers are also present in the state. In Jalisco, we have mountain resorts, colonial cities, magical towns, beautiful beaches, archaeological sites, and important religious destinations of national and international significance, not to mention our indigenous cultures, such as the Nahuas and Huichol, southern and northern, respectively, of our federal entity. We host the Guadalajara metropolitan area, one of the main destinations for MICE tourism nationwide, which has experienced a notable increase in the number of visitors arriving by air and by land. Elsewhere, Puerto Vallarta and Costalegre, where important beach destinations such as Barra de Navidad, Melaque, La Manzanilla, and Punta Pérula are located, among others, are some of the gems that nature gifted Jalisco along its 300 kilometers of coastline on the Pacific Ocean. Jalisco also offers a wealth of paths and landscapes for ecotourism, with extensive forested areas. It has the Nevado Volcano, and most of the Colima Volcano extension is located within its territory. There is also a strong gastronomic tradition and variety, due in part to the extensive territory and diverse habits and customs of the citizens that populate the state's 125 municipalities. To talk about Jalisco is to talk about Mexican culture, specifically mariachi and tequila, which are two internationally renowned symbols of our country. These are gifts from Jalisco to Mexico, and to the entire world.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We focus on the diversification of the sector, as that will help us improve our product and diversify the source of income in the industry, too. At the moment, every tourist spends an average of Ps700 when staying in Sinaloa and we compete against other destinations like Cancun, where tourists spend between $200 and $300 in one day. That has to be our focus too; target the quality of the visitor rather than the quantity. Therefore, we need the quality of service in order to be able to better sell the product. In addition, we need to further work on showing the world the many wonderful locations and elements we have in our state; we have around 1 million hectares of agricultural crops and the national sector moves around 200 million visitors per year. However, a small portion of it reaches us, and we have to build infrastructure to attract more of this type of tourism. On top of that, we have many natural spaces in the state, for example the northern ravines, which receives very few visitors, and this is something we have to change. I think, for example, hunting and fishing are two of the tourism segments we can better exploit in the near future, too.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">One of our main strengths is the combination of business and entertainment, and we have been considerably successful in this field. Guanajuato's tourism industry has experienced stronger growth than other regions of the same size. In addition, it has benefited from increasing investment not only in the tourism industry, but also in other economic sectors such as the automotive industry. Over the past few years, several assembly and production plants have established operations in our state, which has enabled us to become a Mexican automotive cluster. This development attracted interesting growth in the corporate segment of the tourism industry in Guanajuato and that has also helped us to achieve a high level of specialization and diversification in our tourism industry compared with other states. This has impacted the improvement of other segments such as gastronomy and adventure tourism. Guanajuato also had the two fastest growing cities in the country in terms of population in 2013. Such development has boosted confidence among private sector investors, and today, for example, we are looking at the construction of 22 new hotels in the state. No other state can boast such a large number of ongoing construction projects. In 2014, we have seen a significant rise in the number of visitors and their expenditure per visit.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Medical tourism is a huge opportunity for Baja California. The quality of our staff and medical professionals is top notch. Most of our doctors are bilingual, and many are bicultural, holding degrees from universities in the US. Aside from that, the film industry has great potential, and we could bring a competitive edge to California through companies filming in Baja California, where, incidentally, we also have a film school. We have a great history in film, and the number of awards that local cinema has received is evidence of this. San Diego just closed its film commission, and I believe we could work together to rejuvenate it. We are also developing the rest of the state to feature renewable energy, and have a self-sustaining development 68 kilometers south of San Felipe. Tourism is another area of great potential, and we have just recently signed new contracts with cruise lines. Ensenada will be the second most-visited port in Mexico in 2014, and we are poised to build a new port between Ensenada and Los Cabos, which should help the cruise industry in the near future. We are working hard at these projects to make Baja California a world-class destination.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Real estate is a capital-intensive business. Without equity capital and debt, you cannot grow your business. Equity Capital is most important. We started in Mexico in 1996 investing capital provided by friends and family, and built a respectable platform to attract Prudential to establish its first co-investment program in Latin America. We started with one build-to-suit with Mattel in Northern Mexico City, and over five years we developed and managed around 77 buildings, ground-up speculative construction with Prudential, which sourced capital and organized various syndicated loans to maximize and leverage our capital for maximum returns. Today, the Mexican real estate market is quite mature as International funds, domestic pension funds, publicly traded global funds REITs, and domestic publicly traded funds FIBRAS provide a deep source of capital for speculative development and acquisitions that has compressed capitalization rates and values in line risk adjusted values. Around 30% of our activity is in the northern Mexico City region, 40% in the central region, 27% in Bají­o, 17% in the northeast region, and 16% in the northwest region. Recently, we won a national bidding process to develop Audi's Just-in-Time, Just-in-Sequence Supplier Park in Puebla. It is a two-phase $110 million project. Going forward most of our development will be in the central region and Bají­o with value-add acquisitions in the north.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have been growing, not only geographically, but also in terms of service lines. We still perform considerable brokerage, but now offer more specialized services. We offer more than just a transaction, and advise our clients on the best real estate decisions for their business. We also provide real estate management services that feature property management, facility management, lease administration, and project management. We have a strong valuation and advisory division. We have also opened another division related to capital flow and investors. Finally, we also offer full-service corporate solutions to multinational companies interested in real estate. This business line has been highly successful because the number of Multilatinas has been growing, and they feel comfortable working with an international brand that has the local knowledge and flavor of the Latin people. Capital flows toward the real estate markets in Mexico are increasing because of the economy and low country risk. Additionally, the legal framework has evolved to create special ways to invest like the FIBRAS. After putting this instrument in the Mexican legislation, the market is capturing a tremendous amount of investment for real estate.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">CBRE is following what is happening in the Mexican market. The Mexican market has become institutionalized, meaning that companies, funds, and banks predominantly own real estate, rather than families and individuals having ownership. As the market has changed and transformed, CBRE has grown and added more facets to the company's operations, adjusting to what is now an institutionalized global market. The market is different in that it is a young and energetic, and we are experiencing a boom. Of course, that feeds a great deal of energy into what we are doing, and adds to the growth CBRE is already experiencing due to global expansion. We are already seeing many energy players coming into market and looking for new space, or extra space, generating additional business. One of several hub cities for energy around the world is Houston, Texas, and we work closely with our office there to assist our clients and investors advising them about what they need to do before they come to Mexico. Having those relationships, and being part of a larger network, works well in this regard. The fact is that what we are doing is trending toward the practices that you see more in the US and in parts of Europe. That is the natural evolution of the business.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">This building materials group was formed four or five years ago, and the company's shareholders decided to go into one of the primary materials in construction, namely cement. We started with an investment of $315 million in a plant in Hidalgo State. Mexico is a good market for cement as there is still considerable infrastructure and housing to build. At the same time, all of the world's major cement players are present here, with CEMEX being the giant. It controls an approximate 45% market share, having once controlled two-thirds. Holcim is another major player in this industry, and has been operating in Mexico for many years. Mexico sells more concrete in bags than in bulk, which is a significant difference compared to the US or Europe where most sales are carried out in bulk. In Mexico, most sales are of 50-kilogram bags, most frequently bought by small-scale builders. We currently operate with an installed capacity of 1 million tons. Demand in Mexico is as high as 36 million tons, however, and so we represent just one 36th of the market. Lafarge entered Mexico in 2002 with a white cement plant in Hidalgo, and then built another small plant adjacent to this installation with a capacity of 700,000 tons.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have one production plant for tiles and two for toilets. In 2013, we managed to produce six million square meters of tiles. We have five warehouses located in Tijuana, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Mexico City, and in Cancun, which are our distribution centers, and we are located in strategic points of the country. Our main market is retail; however, we also have a division that caters to major projects in the construction. Customers appear to favor Italian style. In the mid-to- high-end price range, they prefer larger sizes of 80x80 cm or 60x120 cm. The preference for larger tile sizes is growing, as these have the effect of making spaces appear larger. We also offer eco-products that sell around 20,000 units per month. This kind of product consumes less than five liters per flush, and we even feature a dual flush of five or three liters. We have estimated that a single eco-toilet can save as much as half a million liters in its lifetime. Our company ended 2013 with a 12% rise in growth, despite the broader economy not echoing this performance. Our strategy relies on the ability to make quick changes, and on adaptability. Around four years ago, 45% of our sales were made on economic tiles; however, today that segment represents just 15% of our sales.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">ARZYZ was founded in 1980 to produce materials such as aluminum and zinc. In 1991, we became distributors for Grupo Mexico, and began to significantly increase our production, revolutionizing the market with induction furnaces. From there, we started to grow and export. In 1998, we associated ourselves with Union Minere, our first international association. It is a world leader in the treatment of special metals. In 2010, the company began its transformation. After painstaking analysis we identified an opportunity in the aluminum industry. Mexico did not produce aluminum at that time, and so we started a strategy to take advantage of the potential in recycling in terms of sustainability and the legal framework. Currently, we are in the process of finishing our strategic plan covering the 2014 to 2020 period to create an integrated organization that gathers, produces, transports, and sells scrap. This is a business model that we learned from the Spanish, Germans, and French, who are world leaders in the aluminum sector. Now, we are consolidating the organization, which is already an institution. Technology is vital, too, and we have state-of-the-art equipment of the most sophisticated technology. Over the next few years, we hope to increase our production to 500,000 tons per year from its current 250,000 tons. We want to be the best at what we do; the most ecological and sustainable, and the best quality providers.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">If you consider insurance in general, I would say that the products are rather international in nature, but that personal lines can differ notably from country to country. There is a difference in terms of the products you have for auto or home when you compare the Latin American market to its US or European counterparts. In auto insurance, for example, one has to adapt products to the specific regulations of the country even though in broad brushstrokes the concept behind the products does not vary. In the Mexican market, we try to differentiate our products and de-commoditize them. The first point of concern was for the adjuster to arrive at the scene of an accident in as short a time as possible. The second consideration was the availability of a replacement vehicle during the repair period, which is a pioneering move we introduced. Now, according to independent surveys, we are seen in the market as the best service company in the country.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">AIG LAC has a presence in 15 countries in the region, of which Mexico boasts within the two largest top and bottom lines. As part of AIG's strategic business expansion initiatives, nine countries have been selected globally, and Mexico is one of them. AIG is the world's largest insurance organization with more than 64,000 employees across the globe. We serve more than 88 million customers in more than 130 countries. We are extremely enthusiastic about the near future, and I am confident that Mexico's time is here. The new reforms have triggered substantial demand. We have already seen the infrastructure plan, and billions of dollars are set to enter the broader economy. I'm positive that the economy will grow probably by a fraction more than estimated, and this will largely depend on secondary laws. We boast robust macroeconomic data, strong government, and private sector initiative. There is a substantial volume of money entering the country, and we lack a fiscal deficit. And so with general improvement foreseen, the insurance sector, too, stands to benefit.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I think we have good products and a strong understanding of our market. We also benefit from being part of the BBVA group. We try to complement the bank's product and services, offering insurance products that are aligned to client needs. In most countries, the major insurance companies have a strong presence, but in Mexico there are strong local players too, which are very competitive and efficient. In any country, each player has its own history. Some of the companies that now belong to international groups were originally local companies. International groups have the acquisition power that a local player probably does not. But in the end, the success of the company lies in the people in the organization and the methodologies they have operating in Mexico. There are benefits from being part of an international group, but I would not say that Mexican companies are at a disadvantage; they know the market, they have talented people and good processes, and they are efficient.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are the second strongest company in Mexico, and financially speaking, our goal is to become the strongest. New York Life is a mutuality, meaning we have a need for financial strength, rather than for earnings. New York Life purchased us 14 years ago and in those years, our revenue never went to the US as 100% of the money generated in Mexico remained in our country to bolster and enlarge the company. Also our earnings are reinvested annually in Mexico to create more jobs and strengthen the economy. Over the next five years, we aiming for double-digit growth; this requires an effective structure and strategy to be achievable. We need the best sales force, the best employees, the best partners, and the best brokers in Mexico. Seguros Monterrey New York Life is comfortable growing in line with, or in excess of national growth. In fact, we have been growing at five or six times Mexico's annual GDP growth 13% during 2013. And we are set to hire 2,000 new agents in 2014.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I think the Mexican insurance sector offers the highest opportunity in Latin America and perhaps the world in terms of progression. Only 25% of drivers have car insurance, and only 5% of citizens have home insurance. What's more, less than 10% of companies have insurances out of the 5 million SMEs that exist in Mexico. Just 8 million Mexicans have insurance coverage. If you look at the dimensions of our business for the long term, this marks a great opportunity because the middle class in Mexico will grow and the average age of Mexicans will rise, and both of these are trends that make people wealthier. If you look at the long-term perspective, the fundamentals are good and the regulations are going the right way. It is a healthy country in terms of financials. It will grow over time. We need a bit of help from the government. Third-party liability is important for the country. We hope that, as in many other countries, the government uses insurance to safeguard its economy and citizens.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We employ 11,000 people in the country. Our contribution to private security in the country has been the specialized human resources that we have introduced at different levels. Our employees are specialized in high defense systems (HDS). Our personnel are able to handle crisis situations under different circumstances. Their training involves learning how to handle stress situations and act on instinct. Then, when they face a real situation, such as a kidnapping, they are able to handle it. Our employees can also use firearms, as authorized by the Secretary of Defense. They are able to use them in a quick and effective way in order to protect the workers and goods of different companies. However, all of this human capital would be useless if we didn't use the proper technology. In 1999, we implemented a new division, MSI 2000, and we have an international emergency center that works 24 hours, seven days a week. We have 52 offices in the country so, if any client has an emergency, the alarm rings and we send support within five minutes.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Ours is a difficult market because there are no barriers to entry. Anyone can create a company, legal or illegal. There are perhaps 10,000 companies, but many are not legal or registered. They do not even have official permits or certificates to provide security services. Perhaps less than 200 of those 10,000 companies satisfy international certifications like ISO, or certifications like ASIS, BASC, and C-TPAT, all of which we have. When people and companies come to us, they know they can rely on us. Therefore, we decided to develop a technological platform to connect more efficiently and effectively with the federal police, sending our information instantly and simultaneously to officers close to the incident at hand. After all, we do not have the authority to carry out security measures, as that authority rests with the state, the police and the other security forces. Therefore, we have to work closely and effectively with the government to provide the security that our clients need. On this new technological platform, we can coordinate these efforts at optimum capacity.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our consultancy work focuses on three areas of risk management: political risk, security risk, and integrity risk. We seek to work with our clients to evaluate and assess these risks as they relate to their geographical location and industry; and then work with them to manage and mitigate those risks. The security risk element attracts more attention, in large part due to domestic and international media attention. However, our perspective has always been that companies that are prepared to invest in assessing and managing these risks are able to operate very successfully here. From a political perspective, we categorize Mexico as medium risk, but if you put that in the context of what is happening in other markets in the region, such as Venezuela, Mexico is significantly more stable at the macro level. One of the risks that often gets highlighted is the security situation, and that is a core part of our business; analyzing those risks and how they could potentially impact or affect a company that is already operating here or a company that is looking to move into this market.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Over the past two years, the energy sector has seen a great turnaround in terms of security, thanks to collaboration among many companies initiated by the Labor Secretariat. The idea was to increase the level of risk assessment of work places and to provide a way to ascertain the optimum solution to mitigate that risk. In order to enforce compliance with standards, a number of inspectors were trained in what to look for and how to look for it. Kidde was invited to assist with training in relation to these new safety regulations. The new standard calls for equipment to suppress fires without human intervention, and also increased fire alarm use. We continue to offer a portfolio of products addressing very specific risks. For instance, we have many open mines in this country that require strong, heavy and large trucks—during mining operations their tires face risk of burning. We offer specific solutions designed to protect the tires, which in turn will reduce the risk to the driver.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The energy sector reform will allow the Mexican State to retain full ownership of hydrocarbon reserves and of the former state monopolies, PEMEX and the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE).  The government will charge royalties for the exploitation of these reserves, and a sovereign Mexican oil fund will be incorporated in order to create transparency in the management of the economic rent generated by their exploitation. The main component foresees PEMEX and CFE transforming from a monopoly to a dominant state-owned entity. They will become productive enterprises competing on equal terms with private companies, but still as state-owned entities. There will be at least four organizations regulating the oil and gas industry. Oil service companies, whom I represent through AMESPAC, are counting on PEMEX becoming a dominant player and trusting in its strength to face the new competition. Some of the companies that belong to AMESPAC have most of the capabilities required to become independent operators of oil and gas fields. We are counting on some of these Mexican-owned corporations being able to transform themselves from oil service entities into fully independent operators in new areas, such as shale gas and oil, and developing mature oil fields that in many cases PEMEX has abandoned.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Group is divided into four main business niches. The first one is Blue Marine Cargo, with which we ship clean and dirty products, mainly for PEMEX, on the west and east coasts. We offer this service with mid-range tankers of around 47,000 deadweight tons (dwt). The demand from PEMEX has been very stable for the past 20 years. We also provide for the transportation of people and materials to offshore fields. The oil companies require a lot of logistical support, and if a company is expanding its fields and promoting more activity, their need for transporting people, equipment, and goods is sustainable. I believe that this market will grow with the reforms because more companies are going to arrive in the coming years to carry out exploration and then develop fields. Our second niche is Blue Marine Oil and Gas. In this regard, we provide technological solutions for offshore oil well situations. These activities help oil companies to monetize their production earlier, which means a direct impact on their profitability. The third business unit is Blue Marine Offshore, which provides services related to maintenance and construction vessels. We accommodate about 200-250 people on board, and they perform maintenance and construction activities on the platforms. We currently have four vessels operating in the Gulf of Mexico.</span></p>]]></sections11>

With Navix's funding, our clients have tripled their revenues and doubled their equity. Navix will also offer syndicated loans where our funding capacity is exceeded, capital raisings when our clients require equity rather than debt, and strategic advisory when our clients demand either bringing in a strategic partner or would like to consolidate their sector. Currently, our loan portfolio is concentrated in Pemex contractors. Close to 95% of our loan book is in this sector and it resembles the mix that Pemex has in terms of what type of goods and services it demands: close to 60% of our clients are constructors, 30% of them provide a wide range of services and the remaining procure goods for Pemex. We are amending our business model as a result of changes to the sector itself, and will be set to provide other services where clients demanding loans that exceed our balance sheet capacity would be facilitated through syndicated loans. We have tested the idea with both local and international investors, and as long as Navix is involved in the process, they are eager to participate in the risk for such loans.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our project, Etileno XXI, will be very important for the economy and for the petrochemical industry of Mexico. The project is going to replace most of the imports of polyethylene; meaning around 70% of the existing market will be supplied by local production. We believe that our participation in the Mexican market is going to add a lot of innovation to the polyethylene market in the country. Based on our existing experience, we believe that we have innovative products. We will make a lot of differentiation in the services we offer, as well as in innovation and technology. All these things together add value to our Mexican customers and to the local economy. It is the largest industrial project in Mexico, and it has been the largest investment in petrochemicals in the Americas. The whole investment for the project is worth some $4.5 billion. International lenders have a 70% participation rate in the project, with the IFC being one of the most important lenders. Its participation is based on the belief that it is a very important project for the Mexican economy and for the relationship between Mexico and Brazil.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our company produces a wide range of car batteries including lithium-ion batteries, for electric and hybrid cars, and AGM batteries for start-stop vehicles. We are global leaders in lead-acid batteries supported by our facilities in Mexico. There is also potential growth in sectors such as construction and real estate. In 2012, the construction sector did not experience significant growth; nonetheless, since 2013, we have been observing a considerable growth in the construction of large scale buildings. Our air conditioning and automation systems are widely used in Mexico. Wherever you see a new building, there is a high possibility that we have supplied them with air conditioning, controls, and energy saving systems. In Mexico, we are generating close to $5.5 billion out of a $42 billion total in global operations; it represents around 13% of the company's total revenue. Mexico has the benefits of proximity to the US, cost effectiveness, high-quality production, and the availability of good human capital.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Mexican market is key to the company both in terms of sales and manufacturing. We have a solid presence here, over 9,000 collaborators, 10 manufacturing facilities, one R&amp;D Center and over 25 commercial offices, plus the corporate offices, and we only expect our footprint to increase. Just like in any other economy, we target specific segments based on their growth expectation and investment levels, some of the ones we are leading are utilities &amp; infrastructure, industries &amp; machines manufacturers, non-residential buildings, data centers &amp; networks and the residential market, and this has allowed us to strengthen our position as a leading energy management firm. We have invested $65 million in our new R&amp;D center in Monterrey, and plan to establish new manufacturing and generation plants in the country. We expect the market demand to rise due to the announced investments in infrastructure, and Mexico has been a good manufacturing base for the company since NAFTA was signed. We expect a significant growth in the oil and gas, and utilities market, not just for Schneider Electric, but also for the entire sector, as a result of the energy reform.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Asociación Mexicana Energí­a Eólica (AMDEE) was established in 2005 by seven businessmen who had the common goal of establishing a new industry in Mexico. The Association aims at promoting and developing projects within the wind energy industry in Mexico, as well as representing the interests of the companies in the industry before the authorities and other economic sectors in the country. The first large wind energy project that we implemented in Mexico took place in 2007. And since then, we have seen the installation of 2,000 MW in capacity. At the moment, the Association has 52 members and among them there are developers, constructors, manufacturers, and consulting and service-related companies. They represent all the most relevant segments within the wind energy industry. The sector offers plenty of attractive opportunities with great future returns to investors; therefore, I do not see the need to set up a subsidy scheme to boost the development of projects in the sector. Wind energy is competitive enough not to depend on subsidies.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our projects overall will generate around 366 MW, which is actually equivalent to 22.2% of the installed capacity. The first phase is at around 65 MW and will be located in the state of Puebla. We have strong support not only from the International Energy Commission, but also from the government of Puebla, as this will put the state at the forefront in eolic energy. Puebla has wind, land, and infrastructure. We are investing close to $130 million for the first park and are keen to leverage as many companies and as much manpower as possible from Puebla. Mexico has already signed various international agreements with other organizations in order to accomplish certain renewable energy goals. The energy reform will improve the work environment for wind energy companies in Mexico. In this context, we expect to grow by over 3% in 2014. Our exports are growing not only because the US is growing, but also because Mexico is the country with the most free trade agreements in the world.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We started working in Mexico in 2005, providing consultancy and assistance to private wind developers. In 2008 we opened our first office in Monterrey, relocating to Querétaro in 2010. In 2009, Garrad Hassan became part of GL, I joined the company in the final stage of this process, and most recently in 2012 GL merged with DNV, creating DNV GL which is our current name. DNV GL Renewables Advisory provides consultancy project services to banks, developers, investment funds, NGOs, and government without owning assets. There is already a lot of money invested in the wind sector, but there will probably be more following the energy reform. An Asociación Mexicana de Energí­a Eólica study into the potential of wind energy in Mexico points to a conservative potential of 12 GW of installed capacity by 2020. Mexico is the second largest wind energy market in Latin America after Brazil, and will probably remain so. I envisage Mexico adding between 700 MW and 900 MW per year in the near future.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Currently, the energy division is the main activity of Acciona in Mexico, because we have 556 MW of installed capacity through four operating projects. One of these projects supports self-sufficiency, and the remaining three are associated with the CFE as an independent power producer (IPP). Additionally, we have two projects totaling 300 MW under construction. At the end of 2014, we will have 900 MW of installed capacity. Therefore, Acciona Energí­a is the main area of activity of Acciona in Mexico and even in the Mesoamerican region. Acciona Energí­a in Mexico is focusing on two technologies: wind and solar. Technology transfer will occur when industrial plans are linked to the development of renewable energies, something that currently does not exist. Meeting the goal of 35% clean energy is another boost for renewables. Finally, the energy reform will open investment to the private sector, while the tax reform will bring in the new carbon tax, which penalizes fossil generation and indirectly benefits the renewable energy segment, too.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The role of the Mexican team is crucial as it sustains the bulk of the business. Manufacturing-wise, about 60% of our revenues are from products that are physically produced here. The core business is predominantly performed in Tijuana, where logistics center is also located. The orders placed by NASA are produced in Tijuana. We also produce here all hardware for tower controls, our call center, and any project that requires wireless products. We were also able to relocate critical operations to Mexico, and our technical assistance operation is located in Tijuana. We have a team of over 60 people fielding calls from all over the world and resolving technical issues. Meanwhile, our science center today employs 120 people engaged in product development. Plantronics Mexico, therefore, contributes diversely to the success of Plantronics International. I think that Tijuana will remain a very important player for the electronics sector. I also foresee the company entering new sectors, especially healthcare.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Mexico ranks among our top 10 countries. This means that we give it a high priority for investment. And as we enlarge our production capacity we also expand our R&amp;D facility. Mexico is one of the 10 main hubs worldwide and is an emerging market, which is precisely where the company is looking. There are not that many differences from other markets in terms of demand. The difference is of course that Mexico is an emerging market and Henkel, which fits the profile of its focus of attention. In our strategy for 2016, we intend to realize 50% of our sales in emerging and 50% in developed markets. Already, 55% of our employees are located in emerging markets and Mexico is a big part of this; it is now consolidating itself as one of the largest production hubs in Latin America. Many of the companies operating here have confirmed investments in the country. We have covered all the industrial components that have been developing over recent years.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">At PepsiCo, performance with purpose is our philosophy. We have to deliver the numbers, but we also have to make sure the company is sustainable for the future. We are hopeful and our outlook for Mexico remains good. This market caters to a highly demanding consumer who has been used to these products for many years. For Mexicans, tortillas have been consumed since the time of the Aztecs, so to satisfy the consumer we have to offer the best tortilla products. The Mexican consumer loves repertoire, meaning they want to change from one product to another and eat many different brands. Also, the Mexican consumer is very sensitive to price points, which means they want to buy a product by size and weight, and they want options. The Mexican consumer is much more sensitive to certain tastes than other markets; therefore, we have a process to determine the shelf life of the product and make daily taste quality checks.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I remain excited by everything I observe in Mexico. We have close to 7,000 employees in Mexico. We expect the next five years to be much more like the five years leading up to 2013, and foresee double-digit growth. Wherever we are present our objective is always to outperform the economy, which is precisely what we did in 2013, although in effect the economy was not particularly strong. In 2012, we posted double-digit sales growth, which led to growth of more then $50 million. Looking at the next five years, there is no doubt that we will be able to double those sales figures. And over the next three to five years, we are planning to continue investing in commercialization, marketing, and presence. We also plan to double our investment in R&amp;D over the next five years.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Mexico is roughly the 15th largest operation we have around the world. The figure varies considerably due to exchange rate fluctuations, but it is in that ballpark, and hence a significant operation. We have a strong commitment with Mexico. In 2011, for example we opened our most advanced aerosols plant, which was designed to include the most advanced energy consumption and environmental protection technologies. This site has its own solar energy production, as well as water collection and recycling systems. We see it as a model of sustainable practices for future plants built elsewhere. We opened a new manufacturing plant in 2011 on a ‚¬60 million investment, and it is one of the most advanced we operate in the world. We have also committed to capital expenditure of $500 million until 2015 in new capacity, new plants, and new equipment, with a substantial volume being dedicated to the Mexican market. We want to be a part of Mexican growth.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Air Liquide is in 80 countries around the world. Mexico is one of the world's largest economies, and it was always a challenge to enter because the market had been dominated by other major players. Other competitors have tried to come into the country before and failed. We made a strong entrance into Mexico, with a strategy of building a solid foundation with a long-term approach. Our relationship with Altos Hornos de México has been a key example of this.  In April 2013, we inaugurated the largest Air Separation Plant in the country, which produces more than 1,600 metric tons of oxygen per day.  We supply large volumes of oxygen, nitrogen, and argon from this plant, but in addition, we produce significant quantities of liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon to sell to other customers in Mexico. Since entering the Mexican market in 2011, Air Liquide has invested over $250 million dollars into production facilities, distribution assets and other supply chain infrastructure in Mexico.  We are always looking for new growth opportunities and would be excited to have the potential to continue investing in Mexico as we have been able to do thus far.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We started in Mexico in 1964, creating products for the local market. At the time, we were focusing on the textile, leather, paper and construction markets. We had been growing and also acquiring businesses up until the start of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 20 years ago, when we had to face a new challenge. Mexico was opening to the global market, so we also had to compete with external market; there were a lot of opportunities for us. With the trade agreement at that time it was necessary to restructure because if you are competing with the rest of the world you need to make your productive sites much more efficient. Since then, we have continued to acquire companies. BASF LAN is now a company with a $2.5 billion turnover and more than 2,000 local employees. In the past 20 years, demand has been growing by around 7% a year. This growth was due to global production, and was mainly import driven. The new energy reform will offer the opportunity to address this situation. The contribution of the chemical industry to GDP is 1.5%, and in a country like Mexico with oil and gas in the market, it should be between 3% and 5%.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">For Lanxess, the Mexican market is key because it is a growing market with a strategic position related to the four macro trends that we are involved in. We are focused on mobility, urbanization, agriculture, and water, and our largest markets are the automotive and construction sectors. We offer high-performance plastics, and many synthetic types of rubber. Mexico is the eighth largest producer of cars in the world, and the fourth largest exporter. Our products are oriented to the manufacturers and assemblers of cars in Mexico, especially in relation to the materials needed to produce green tires, which means tires with better rolling enforcement that reduce CO2 emissions. We aim to reduce fuel consumption and we offer high-performance plastics in order to produce lighter vehicles. The industry in the country is facing big challenges because, in some aspects, we are linked to the past. Mexico, now, imports almost 70% of the raw materials that are consumed. For this reason, the chemical sector in Mexico has decreased its contribution to GDP over the last 10 years from 10% in 1987 to 1.2% in the last year. This is the real challenge for the chemical sector in Mexico; we need to improve production in order to fulfill demand.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Given that Mexico is a young country and has an evolving economy, the oil and gas industries are future markets for us. We were selected by Shell as its preferred instrument provider worldwide. We also work with PEMEX, where our instruments and solutions are used in a number of different processes from exploration and production, to refinery and terminal management. We are focused, too, on key industries such as food and beverages, chemicals, life sciences, water and wastewater, and mining, and each of these has bright prospects in Mexico. The Swiss are normally associated with precision and reliability; however, it is also a very global country. We want our global customers to feel at home everywhere by giving them reliable and global solutions. We sell safety, reliability, environmental compatibility, and cost efficiency. When measuring flow in a pipe, the level of a storage tank, pressure in a steam generator, or temperature in a reactor, our customers know that they can trust E + H. Companies need to be more efficient, and have better measurements in their processes.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our main strength is development, which is based in the skilled and qualified staff we have here. We also have the most advanced technologies. TC Technologies is committed to providing its customers with quality services. We take care of the design, development, production, and commercialization processes of many products. TC Technologies is the leading company in integral technological development. We provide fully integrated IT solutions for a wide range of clients from all the economic sectors. We also have our own interfaces and products. However, we also purchase technologies from other countries. This combination puts us at the forefront of the industry and we have, as one of our main missions, to make technology available to everybody. We have an electric car project with a long-term vision, which we are developing with a Spanish partner and a national university. We envisage a vehicle with batteries of 56 kW and have plans to finish that first model by July 2015. We have already developed an electric motorbike, and it is already out and available.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>T<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">he range of products that we bottle in Mexico is crucial for company growth. The company's strategy that took shape in the early 2000s gravitated toward global customers active in Mexico. We started serving the main brands, such as Coca-Cola, Danone, and Nestlé as some of the focus customers that we serve globally. Yet we subsequently came to appreciate the huge opportunity to serve local customers who operated within the huge economy of Mexico itself. We have three business divisions: food and beverages, household and personal care products, and a third division dedicated to specific products for the food industry. Graham produces products for a specific niche, which differentiates us from our competitors. It is certainly clear that Mexico has a technology shortfall, and is heavily reliant on imports. It is also weak in sectors such as plastics. Therefore, I perceive huge opportunity for the country to support such markets not only in terms of plastic bottles, but also regarding the technology that could be developed locally. We develop through cooperation with the government.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">ERICO has been present in Mexico since 1970 having focused on a set of products, the oldest of which is CADWELD, which is used in grounding systems, and permanent electrical connections. We began developing operations for ERICO Latin America in Mexico, investigated open markets and opportunities for products, but also made sure to emphasize that ERICO was a provider of solutions. Our largest market is Mexico followed by Brazil, but we are currently developing our presence in Colombia. We pursue different strategies in each country, given the specifics of government entities, prevailing laws, and tender specifications, which ultimately requires us to adapt on a case-by-case basis. In Mexico we employ approximately 20 people, yet we compete with large players. We are in fact their benchmark mainly because of the manner by which we approach the market and our knowledge base. ERICO, for example, developed exothermic welding technology, designed by Dr. Cadwell, hence the name CADWELD. No one else has been as successful in rail work as we have.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We export them our engines separately, as they are mainly used in our trucks, specifically the V6 and V8 engines. We export to our assembly plants in the US and Canada. We have two engine plants here, one producing the 3.6-liter V-6 Pentastar Engine and another producing the 5.7-liter, 6.4-liter V-8 HEMI® Engine. It is a high-performance engine, which is used in certain trucks. Additionally, we are adding a production line to assemble the TigerShark engine. Right now, we produce one engine every 17 seconds, and we are aiming at making that one every 12 seconds, or five per minute. Mexico is becoming a major production hub for Chrysler. From my perspective, Mexico is a market with a great potential, but we need to make that potential happen. We have always thought that Mexico should be a $2 billion vehicle market. We talk with different governments and administrations on what we can do to take Mexico to that level, but we haven't found the solution yet. In 2013, it was almost $1.1 billion, so still $900 million short.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have been present in Mexico for close to 90 years, and have become one of its largest exporters. I would describe the performance of Ford in Mexico as outstanding. Naturally, that has much to do with the massive investments made over the course of recent years, such as the expansion of the production plant in Hermosillo, which grew from 56 vehicles per hour to 62 vehicles per hour—that means an annual capacity of 380,000 units. We have also invested in the launch of the new Fusion model, the opening of a new engine plant in Chihuahua, and the refurbishment of the Cuautitlán assembly plant for the launch of the new model Fiesta. We have been growing our engineering capacity in Mexico by expanding the Product Development Center headcount from 50 to almost 1,000 engineers by the end of 2013. The new investments provided such scale that, in 2013, we became the country's second largest exporter. We remain committed to Mexico, and therefore plan to sustain our prominent role in the sector within export and local markets.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have an overall sales volume of 7,000 units right now in a market reaching 1 million units. This means we hold around 0.7% of the market. We should keep in mind that here we are in the first stages of business development. Right now, our main priority is to build a robust image of the Peugeot brand in Mexico; we retain our European brand persona unlike certain other firms in this market, as Mexico is an open country with influences from the US as well as important European traditions. The market today is at a complex juncture; the country has set up the process to introduce key reforms, but many have yet to come into force. On top of that, many people remain unsure as to which path the country will take. This is generating a lack of confidence among consumers, and society in general. This climate leads many people to postpone new vehicle purchases. Also, I think there are too many bureaucratic steps involved in purchasing new vehicles. Our priority is to revise the old stereotype of “European car, fragile vehicle."</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I was born in Mexicali, and studied engineering in the US, specializing in the automotive business, which proved greatly influential for me. When I graduated I started working in the automotive sector for the family business. It took us six years to shed the fallout of the crisis in the early 1980s. At that time, Michelin bought Uniroyal and entered the Mexican market. This was a huge opportunity for us as the company offered us the opportunity to start the business in Sonora, where there was no competition from the US. It took us 10 years to succeed in Baja California, and three years to achieve success in Sonora, where I send all of my employees who had braved the tough days of the company. This was our best formula for success, because our people absolutely loved their jobs. The other key to our success involved key changes to our showrooms 30 years ago when I made them appealing to both sexes, employing both male and female staff, where it had been traditional to employ men in our business. These changes have made us into what we are today.</span></p>]]></sections01>

The NAFTA market has been one of the great opportunities for the company. When we made the decision to build another plant to serve the NAFTA region, we selected Mexico for a number of reasons. Geographically, it is very well situated to serve markets to the north and south. At our plant in Silao, we have a research and development group of 22 engineers, 20 of whom are Mexican, and we continue to provide our compatriots with employment in their home country. At this plant, we made an initial investment of $200 million, and we are now in the process of investing an identical sum. This is a large plant of 135,000 sqm under one roof. In 2017, when it becomes fully operational, it will employ 1,400 direct and 400 indirect employees with a total of 1,800 jobs created. Our managerial staff comprises expatriates and Mexicans, although our goal is to be managed only by Mexicans.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Rassini continues to drive top and bottom line growth and focus on leveraging opportunities in the US, Mexico, and Brazil. Our consistent focus on technology and engineering development has enabled us to secure new contracts; more than 40 new platforms since 2012. More specifically, North America represents 71% of our sales, so we are very optimistic about this market. The vehicle production projections for 2014 in the region are above 16.8 million units, which is an increase of 8% over 2013. Mexico is increasing its production in an accelerated manner, and we are poised to leverage this growth as our headquarters, production plants, and operations facilities are strategically located throughout Mexico. Rassini has a close relationship with the University of Ontario, the University of Michigan, and the UNAM, among others, and we are continuously working with the academic centers in the US and Mexico, such as the Tecnológico de Monterrey, which produces excellent engineers. Mexico is producing better people with greater skills every year.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">New generations of entrepreneurs will face different challenges to those we faced in our early days; globalization and new technologies have definitely changed the way we do business. If we want to be competitive, we have to adapt international standards and working practices. Therefore, the level of readiness has to be higher than the one we had, because the market is now the whole world, rather than just one country. They have the right tools to make sure they become competitive players in their sectors. Buses are one of the primary modes of transport in Mexico, and I am sure this will continue to be the case over the medium term. We are committed to continue developing the sector, while also assessing business opportunities abroad. We are seeing foreign brands coming into Mexico, and that is a strong signal to everybody that the market holds opportunity and potential. The increasing arrival of foreign brands will increase competition, further encouraging us to achieve international standards to become more competitive and achieve a leading position in the market. We must be flexible enough to adapt ourselves to market changes.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The market in Mexico is controlled by large players. What we have developed for them is a “fit for use" concept, and in-house implementation, such as in-sourcing to service the buses, which is completely tailor made. Today, we are managing more than 35 customer workshops. In those cases, we are doing everything for their fleets, including multi-branding. It has been a great advantage for us because, as the concept was so successful, our clients have subsequently asked us to take care of their other brands. So we are inside, charging per kilometer. If the buses are running, we charge, and if they do not run, we do not charge anything. It is a win-win situation, and we are true partners with those companies. With input from our customers, Scania has changed the bus transport philosophy in Mexico. Scania has a market share of well over half of the long-distance coach market in Mexico—there is no other country in the world where Scania has this level of market share participation.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Kenworth Mexicana has about 2,000 employees. This includes manufacturing facilities as well as the commercial and financing arm of the company. We used to produce 62 tractors per day at this plant, but we now have a figure of 50 per day as a result of a slowdown in some of the export markets that we serve, specifically Colombia. Right now the tractor market is undergoing several changes in terms of the regulations and requirements for the registration of a new tractor. The result of these changes has been a slowdown of vehicle imports. We have been experiencing high demand for heavy-duty trucks. The demand for those was 24,000 in 2012; that is close to the historic best year for Mexico. We were shooting for 12% growth in demand in 2013, but that did not happen. We are cautious about 2014, and projections are set at a 1% or 2% increase. We think that 2015 will be really interesting and that it will start to see the impact of the reforms. We hope that 2016 and onward will be all-time record breakers, with about 27,000 units sold.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We view Kazakhstan as a growth market for our company based on its geographic positioning between the two superpowers of China and Russia. It's an emerging market with rich natural resources, mainly oil and gas, and also an attractive mining sector. That's on the energy side of our business. Meanwhile, on our supply chain side, we view Kazakhstan and the greater Central Asia region as a whole as a growth sector for us supporting our government business in Afghanistan. In order to shorten the supply chain and provide best value sourcing and delivery options to our customers, we source a wide range or product categories out of Central Asia for our customers in Afghanistan. Over the years, we have seen quite a dynamic range of products, including steel, power cables, generators, consumables supplies, construction supplies, and also various ship food products for the US in Afghanistan.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">To date, the vast majority of our investment has been in Atyrau as the majority of our revenues are generated by our assets there. Recently, we have been focused very much on improving the quality of our assets and the lives of our guests and tenants in Atyrau and by doing so the lives of people living there in general. With our current development plans for quality apartments, leisure, and recreational facilities I think we will more than accomplish our goals there. In Aktau, our business today is not significantly related the oil and gas business. We do, however, believe that Aktau will experience significant growth once the offshore oil industry does begin to expand and those that are properly invested locally will reap the benefits of that investment.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Training, recruitment, out staffing, and consulting are our standard services, like all other companies that work in the field of human resource consulting. We offer standard training programs, such as soft skills, technical oil and gas training, and programs in the uranium-processing industry. We also came across certain trainers who wanted to implement a new product in the market, with whom we now cooperate. They develop a certain program that we in turn offer to our clients. This is something new for the Kazakhstani market. Education is problematic and is undergoing a transformation in Kazakhstan. College and university graduates often do not meet companies' requirements. This is why our agency's services are still in demand; the fact is that we offer tailored training services.</span></p>]]></sections21>

Safety is our number one priority—we are committed to creating inherently safer workplaces and sustainability in our operations. In our 16-year operation in Kazakhstan, we have consistently achieved a world-class safety record. And over the past three years, we have worked almost 6.5 million man-hours, with just four recordable injuries, achieving a total recordable case frequency rate of just 0.12 per 200,000 hours. However, our vision is zero harm to people, assets, and the environment.</span><br></p>]]></sections31>

Our intention here was the same as it is in every other market, namely to help our clients manage their technical and operational risks by using our global regulatory knowledge, technical expertise, and ability to create bespoke, innovative solutions. In Kazakhstan, we provide independent verification services. In addition, we deliver independent technical assurance services to the drilling and manufacturing sectors. Our clients in Kazakhstan are typically quality focused; they are companies that understand that you cannot compromise or cut corners when investing in safety, environmental stewardship, and the operational efficiency of high-value assets.</span><br></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The weakness of the Kazakhstani banking system is that it has been in crisis for too long, for various reasons. The banking sector has also lagged behind the general Kazakhstani economy, which has long recovered and is now due to expand. The good news is that the government has taken the right steps by privatizing three nationalized banks, namely Alliance, BTA, and Temirbank, which is a sign that the banking system is entering recovery. After all, the economy cannot really recover; there is much less growth without a well functioning banking system. I foresee the recovery beginning in 2014.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are trying to build one of the most client-orientated banks in the country. To do this, we focus on improving all processes within the bank to make sure our clients receive the highest-quality services swiftly and efficiently. We focus on fostering close relations with our clients, as in many former-Soviet countries there is at best a limited notion of service-orientation. As we work with the SME segment, many of the products we provide are highly custom-built to cater to its needs, such as the “Forte NoLimit" product we launched in 2013. Our approach is to offer solid, well-priced products, of the best quality, and delivered with the best service.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">To help solve the problem with non-performing loans (NPLs), we need to give banks the opportunity to earn more. After all, the higher a bank's profit, the easier it is to form the necessary provisions. And the greater the level of provisions, the easier it is for a bank to make a decision to write off debts. However, any restriction on a bank's activities, which, at first glance, means reducing risks, ultimately reduces profit and postpones any decision on writing off debts. Secondly, the government might consider changing tax payment terms for collection companies. Currently, the corporate income tax (20%) is due once discounted debts are transferred to the collection companies. In my opinion, these companies should not be paying taxes upfront, but only after receiving profits.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our main aim is to be a successful Islamic commercial bank. The second is to find opportunities for UAE-based investors to invest in Kazakhstan and to thereby promote diversification, as well as see if there are Kazakh investors who can find opportunities in the UAE. An equally important objective is to raise the profile of Islamic finance in Kazakhstan and CIS countries. We held a session for about 150 imams from the Almaty area as part of a new strategy of educating communities. It is highly important that we explain that Islamic finance does not mean free banking. It is true that we do not charge interest in the true sense of the word, but there is a cost involved in any type of financing, of course.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Public confidence in Russian banks is high in the Kazakh market. Our main advantage in working with the corporate sector is being able to serve Kazakh business entities, which could not be served by local banks during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. There were reduced limits on Kazakhstan's banks from the Western partners, which impacted trade and financial services. We represent a universal bank, engaged in investment transactions and corporate business. We are interested both in small- and medium-sized businesses and in working with retail clients, providing a comprehensive range of services.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The necessity for the development of draft legislation for obligatory insurance of real estate against catastrophic risks brewed long ago. For example, Kazakhstan is a sufficiently large territory in a zone of seismic activity. Currently, the state bears responsibility for the cover of losses; however, in a large accident it can become an intolerable burden for the state. In this case, it is necessary to form a special fund of insurance against catastrophic risks. Therein, Kazakhstan could use the experience of Turkey as an example. The introduction of this type of insurance will be the impulse for the development of voluntary insurance. People will realize the risks associated with loss or damage to real estate. The establishment of such a fund is not possible without the participation of the state; however, insurers should not be excluded from the insurance process. They shall act not only as agents, but also as operators, professional participants in risk pooling, influencing the successful functioning of the fund and the development of this class of insurance. In addition, there is currently an interest in the introduction of obligatory medical insurance in Kazakhstan.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The insurance market is challenging and requires a comprehensive approach. First of all, it is necessary to design the market development strategy. Second, we should apply good practices and international experience in the sector. As global practice suggests, an insurance market regulator should be a separate entity, unlike in Kazakhstan, where the regulator is the National Bank. This may result in positive changes to the industry. As for the financial culture, there is no silver bullet, and it will take time to build trust in the insurance sector. Perceptions of the need for insurance and purchasing habits will change with the emergence of a new generation. Premiums need to be paid promptly and the market needs to deal with the risks. It is impossible to underestimate the importance of a regulator in the developments. Therefore, GAK is not meant to intensify the competition in the industry. We represent an experimental platform and a bridge between the state and citizens. Given that GAK is a public company with 100% of its shares owned by the state, we are very conservative when estimating risks, and are a role model for the insurance industry.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Success is really about the delivery of a quality service. For example, we already have all our client's documents, which are required in case of loss, in our database and do not bother clients for new copies. Our company policy is not to penalize our employees if they make omissions in their work, rather we make sure they know their problems and have instruments to address them. This importantly allows our staff to feel their own responsibility and grow professionally. Ours is a very interesting and rather unique operation system. Generally, our staff don't consult top management unless they need to know how to tackle a particularly sensitive situation. Another reality of the London-Almaty workplace is that happy and confident employees being proud of their work transfer this feeling to the clients. Many employers in Kazakhstan simply fail to grasp this. The state regulation of the insurance industry is very efficient in Kazakhstan, and we are well ahead of the other CIS markets. For example, an insurance agent is not allowed to take cash from clients; this eliminates a scope of risk for the client and the insurer. Insurance companies have, therefore, taken greater precautions with their agents.</span></p>]]></sections21>
