		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give us some background on your history and how you moved from Edmonton to opening a hotel in Puerto Escondido?</h4><p>I devoted a large part of my early life to sports. I was an ice hockey player and committed a great deal of effort to developing a professional career. When that concluded, I decided to start traveling to experience more of the world. Upon completing university, I traveled through Latin America for 10 months and fell in love with it. It became my dream to one day open a boutique hotel. Years later I was in a position to acquire a vacation home in Oaxaca. I had not been before, but had heard so much about it. Immediately after visiting for the first time I fell in love with the town and its people and shortly after I found a place and acquired it. Since then, Hotel Casa de Olas has grown into what it is today.</p><h4>When you decided to open the place, what main added value did you want to offer Puerto Escondido?</h4><p>Years ago, I was a backpacker, and it was such a wonderful way to meet people. In building Casa de Olas, I wanted to find a great balance of still being able to connect with other travelers but have more comfort and amenities. We also introduced a health and wellness element. The goal was to offer an alternative to big resort vacations where visitors often return home following over consumption and a lot of sun; and instead provide an experience leaving people revitalized and rejuvenated whilst being educated about a culture and learning a new language.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the future of the tourism industry in Puerto Escondido?</h4><p>We have already seen it change and grow significantly, however there is still a keen desire by locals and expats alike to maintain the charm, culture and magical feeling that makes Puerto Escondido so special.</p><h4>What are your long-term plans for the hotel? Do you plan to expand to other locations in Mexico?</h4><p>It has been a wonderful journey, and I am grateful to have established many lifelong friendships and partnerships with great people in Mexico. This has been a passion project that I want to continue growing. The goal is to continue finding ways to offer professional development for our staff and continually find ways to be giving community members to Puerto Escondido. One of our pillars is to give back to the community that gives to us so dearly. For now, we will grow our business in Puerto Escondido and continue to expand our team.</p><h4>What has been your experience as a foreigner opening a hotel in this area?</h4><p>It has been extremely positive. There has been a great deal of learning and valued education in the process. We understand that things may be done differently from one place to the next, so being open minded and nimble as an organization has been important for our growth. It is just a matter of adapting and communicating well. We have a great team that has been crucial to ensuring everything works properly. I am extremely grateful and have become extremely passionate about this project. Puerto Escondido has become a home away from home for me, and I learn more and more about the beautiful culture every time I come back.</p><h4>How would you describe the current state of the tourism industry in Puerto Escondido?</h4><p>In the early days of the global pandemic, the future of the tourism industry looked uncertain. However, now we see it flourishing with people from all over Mexico and the rest of the world coming to find purpose and happiness. It has been surprising how Puerto Escondido has surged in these challenging times and the state of tourism will likely remain healthy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a Mexican spirits company, what has your experience entering international markets been like?</h4><p>Mezcal Mitre was born as an international project meant for exportation. I did not like how national alcoholic beverages were being exported, so I wanted to develop a product that shared my view of Mexico. We developed a bottle that is shaped like a jaguar's head to represent a fusion between the traditional and modern side of Mexico in an elegant manner. The first years were spent on positioning the brand in the domestic market. We realized we could position ourselves strongly in Mexico and also enter other markets. We have the market position we sought before the pandemic. We were signing contracts that were not affected by the pandemic, and that opened gates for us. We have also started to find opportunities abroad, in the US. We have been making some headway. It has not been the ideal year that we thought, but we are maintaining our international contracts.</p><h4>What strategies did you use to differentiate yourself in the Mexican market?</h4><p>In terms of wines and liqueur, a company can position itself in the segment for alcohol consumed in cafeterias, bars, or restaurants. This is on trade. Or, one can position themselves in off trade, which is when you purchase the product in a store to consume it elsewhere. Normally, you would develop a 360-degree strategy. Thankfully, we have a product that is disruptive in terms of image, and that helped us to get the doors open for us. Our image has always been extremely impactful and stands out. However, image alone is not enough. We had a team behind us that specialized in tasting events and promotion. I realized the importance of marketing for organizations after I read a book on the person who founded Nike. This was at the end of 2019. We wanted to be strong in marketing, so we hired an individual for public relations, a strategist on digital segmentation, video, and content. Today, huge campaigns can be conducted on social networks, and we invest heavily on digital content and advertising. We love being an artistic brand and take great care of our image. We try to do things right; there is a great deal of competition, and the difference between success and being irrelevant is not doing things well. We have two bottles with jaguar heads, but we also have a cheaper brand called Origen. Even though it is cheaper, it is still artistic and of excellent quality</p><h4>How important is online marketing with e-commerce?</h4><p>We started on Amazon in 2019, but we are not that heavily focused on that. We have three labels on Amazon. We also have the three labels in Mercado Libre. My father lives in Spain, and the pandemic hit there first, and he warned me in advance of what was to come to Mexico. I thus focused our efforts on e-commerce. We have excellent reviews on Amazon; there are more than 300 mezcal labels on Amazon, and we have one in top 10 and other in top 20.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2021?</h4><p>I am very focused on the off-trade side, meaning stores. I am focused on selling at a national level. We expect to grow by 100%. We also want to have a presence in 100 relevant restaurants and bars in the gastronomic business. Mexico City is extremely important because if you are well established here, you can go to other cities on the outskirts. We also want to have a solid contract in the US next year. We have more than 1,000 selling points at a national level. In 2021, we will focus on consumption centers, namely restaurants, among other businesses. At an international level, the priority is the US market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What initiatives and strategies are you using at CNET to ease the situation in the tourism sector?</h4><p>In Mexico, tourism previously accounted for 8.7% of GDP and employed 4.5 million people, mainly young adults and women. We have created several strategies in terms of the private sector. One was the legislative proposals we made to the government to convert legislative initiatives into law. One such law was the Foreign Investment Regulation because in Mexico, the foreign owners of beach lines are through seizures, and this makes it more expensive. We want to remove this restriction in order to allow foreigners to become owners, thus stimulating investment. We also mentioned foreign investment in airlines, the regulation of the provision of digital platform services, labor benefits, tax incentives, and the deductibility of consumption in restaurants. In addition, we promoted the Emerging National Alliance for Tourism, which several important private stakeholders in Mexico have since joined. We wanted to get out ahead of this new way of looking at tourism through health protection. Mexico's hotels have a great reputation, and we should have more and improved facilities regarding security, focus on biosecurity, and processes to prevent infection. We aim to take advantage of technology in order to harness competitiveness in destinations, connectivity, and all the processes related to facilitating entry into the country, since the airline industry is currently suffering, and we cannot conceive of tourism without connectivity, never mind mobility. We also need to look into the issue of promotion, because it has been lost, and by this, I mean not only having a strategy to strengthen the Mexico brand, but also a theme of crisis management and containment as well as public relations. The alliance includes this within the 15 legislative proposals that we have created.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of tourism? What will be the result of this transformation that Mexico's tourism sector is undergoing?</h4><p>With so many fewer tourists, we have to accept that the industry must change, and this has put us on alert. This year it will be difficult to create expectations because we do not know what will happen tomorrow, we do not know which countries will open their borders, or which ones will institute quarantines. International visitor revenues will be 45% lower than the 2019 figure, while our internal tourism figures will be 26% lower. It is complicated to talk about tourism in one country when it is changing all over the world. 2021 will also be bad for Mexico, but our country has such an important tourist vocation, natural attributes, diversity, and geographic location.</p><h4>CNET proposed to use its hotel and infrastructure facilities as vaccination centers. What follow-up has been given to this proposal?</h4><p>The industry can support this effort, such as with vaccines, and the facilities of the entire tourism industry should be available for vaccination drives. The government's vaccination drive is going slowly. If our main markets, which are the US and Canada, do not come, it will be a difficult situation. We should learn from those countries that are well ahead in terms of the vaccination process.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the sector?</h4><p>This industry is extremely important, and we cannot afford to lose our way, as it is an engine for the Mexican economy, and we are experiencing rough times. At the end of the day, we will need two or three years to recover. We have put forward a series of points to help the industry recover, including ensuring air connectivity and putting industrial workers at the top of the vaccination list. This has caused something of a stir, but it is an industry in which we cannot afford to lose more.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Tren Maya project evolved over the last year?</h4><p>The train is a strategic infrastructure project for the southwest. We have many studies ongoing in many aspects that have yet to be defined. The number of stations has increased to 20 from 15 in 2019. The market is also requesting “paradores," or stations where trains only stop twice a day. It would depend on the needs of each municipality. We have also been in talks with the communities and have conducted many public surveys. The project has a high acceptance rate by the communities, typically above 80%. We have also implemented many communication strategies to publicize the project and help more citizens understand the program and clear up some of the prejudices around the project. There will be three services for this train: local passengers, foreign passengers, and cargo operations. Tourism services is expected to be a huge business. We have been in talks with international investors as well as tour sites operators around the world, and they have given us many tips and suggestions. The tourism sector seeks different services and is willing to pay more for better services. There is a broad range of economic possibilities. There is a possibility of developing a new airport in Tulum or shifting the current Mérida airport to a different location. We are evaluating all possibilities. We also have a long-term project related to the agro-industrial sector. We are discussing storage facilities in strategic locations where we can revitalize local economies with specialized products such as organic food that can reach other markets in the region. Storage facilities can also help us export some of the local crops and products, generating important infrastructure that is part of the logistics chain. The entire profile of the region will change as a result of all this. The economies of tourism-oriented cities like Cancún could diversify because there will be a more relevant industrial presence. It will be paramount as well to provide the best health and education services for the local population.</p><h4>What have been the main challenges facing the project?</h4><p>The largest challenge is that we had to do many things at the same time. Many developed countries take 10 years to develop these projects, but we had to do it in four because this change is needed. We had to invest heavily in planning managers and construction plans. Mexico has a 50-year delay in its railway infrastructure, and we are changing that by bringing in some of the best companies in the railway industry, including Spanish, Germany, and British companies. We also seek to have the best technology available. We have reached agreements with education institutions in the world in the railway industry to have trained workers. In less than 10 years, the project will create 1 million jobs.</p><h4>What strategies are you implementing to attract private investment?</h4><p>With such infrastructure, private investment arrives. We will have stations along the line, which will result in passenger traffic and greater opportunities for commercial businesses. The airport has a huge need for fuel that is currently being met via trucks. With the train, fuel needs can be covered via railway, bringing down fuel prices. Many logistic projects will also grow alongside the railway system. Hotels will offer services along the railway, and we also expect to have clinics at every station, hospitals at most stations, and educational institutions at some of the stops. This will be extremely beneficial for the population. These projects will be extremely attractive for private investors. At the same time, it is important to us for every project being developed that the environment is being protected. We want growth that does not affect the region's archeological heritage or rivers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The tourism sector has been heavily affected by the pandemic. What measures have you taken in the State of Baja California Sur to support the sector?</h4><p>The most economically affected sector is tourism, not only in Baja California Sur, but also the entire country and the world. The most important sector in Baja California Sur is the tourism sector; two-thirds of the GDP is related to the tourism industry. The impact was massive. We estimated an impact of MXN30 billion and job losses of around 22,000. During the total lockdown, which was implemented in late April, May, and June, we worked closely with businesses to develop action protocols so that we could respond when the restrictions were lifted. We had great support from the private sector and worked on those protocols. There is currently no activity within the tourism industry that does not have a protocol to operate safely. In addition, we worked to certify companies. The certifications were not mandatory, so we worked with the federal government to obtain some certifications on clear environment. We have more than 1,250 certifications in that area, so that demonstrates our big focus on this area. The World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (WTTC) granted us a seal of safe travel due to all these actions. We were the first destination in the Pacific to receive this seal from the WTTC. That helps us because most of the tourists that we receive are foreigners, and the seal inspires trust and confidence. </p><h4>You opened new flight routes that operate from the municipalities of Loreto and La Paz. How are you promoting these destinations in the US?</h4><p>Even though these are challenging times, we have the advantage that sun and holiday destinations have resumed flight operations. We are very close to the US, and that proximity helps us launch new flights. Now that working from home is a trend, an executive can work from his hotel room while looking at the beach. With that in mind, we are opening new routes in La Paz, Los Cabos, and Loreto while other destinations are struggling. The recovery in Baja California is going extremely well. Now, the goal is to be extremely careful to avoid having more restrictions. We will soon see are flights from Dallas and Phoenix to Loreto as well as other flights from Dallas and Phoenix to La Paz. This is a milestone because it has been 10 years since La Paz received its last international flight. These give us high hopes for the coming months. The news around the vaccine are extremely positive, so we expect we will gradually recover what we lost.</p><h4>What other tourism infrastructure investments are a priority for 2021?</h4><p>We recently announced our historical towns. In Baja California Sur, we have two municipalities under the Pueblos Magicos program: Todos Santos and Loreto. We have created our own brand of historical town, and we have named seven villages of Baja California Sur that are beautiful, including Santiago, El Triunfo, San Javier, Santa Rosalí­a, and San Ignacio. We want to show that we have more than just beautiful beaches, so we are proud of this program to increase the tourist offerings. We also just inaugurated a maritime route from Guaymas to Santa Rosalí­a that will be beneficial for the northern area. Travelers are now seeking rural areas and isolated environments. It is a luxury to be in isolated areas, and the population density in Baja California Sur is among the lowest in Mexico. The most important hotel brands in the world are located in Baja California Sur. We have the best hotels here, and they are more exclusive and unique. We want to have boutique hotels with few rooms for high-end customers. We also want to conduct all these activities while protecting the environment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the initiatives and programs the state launched to support the tourism ecosystem and facilitate its reopening?</h4><p>The pandemic has lasted over one year now and has had a massive impact on businesses. Since day one, our governor was clear in saying that the priority in Guanajuato is to keep us in good health, and our tourism sector has followed all the measures implemented by the Ministry of Health. As a support measure, SECTUR developed a good practices manual that was delivered virtually, a free training course, and certification to minimize the spread of the virus. Over 3,000 individuals or enterprises related to tourism have implemented those measures within their working areas. This training was also the foundation for getting the WTTC Safe Travel certificate, and Guanajuato became the first state without a beach in Mexico to receive it. In June and July 2020, we set the message for every visitor and tourist coming to Guanajuato where health continues to be the state's priority, and the tourism sector is prepared to host them. We did this by saying we have held off as long as possible under the right conditions so we can provide a safe atmosphere for tourists to visit us in Guanajuato.</p><h4>What are the objectives behind the advisory board for tourism?</h4><p>In 2012, the congress of Guanajuato approved the tourism law, which includes the installation of an advisory board formed by the public and private sector. Our governor holds the presidency seat, and state ministries closely related to tourism also have a seat: environmental and sustainability, cultural, economic development, and innovation. On the private-sector side, there are successful people who have been developing different segments in tourism and have played a leading role in our state such as romance, ecotourism and adventure, gastronomy, and MICE to name some, all of which are segments that Guanajuato has become a leader in. They would share their knowledge and vision, and through that advisory board we will be able to dictate the routes to follow so that we can make the most of the assets in Guanajuato, such as our World Heritage cities as well as business tourism that we have developed through Highway 45 with the automobile industry. We also have the agro foods industry, which is one of the leading exporters in our state.</p><h4>What do you envision as the future of tourism, and what role do you want Guanajuato to have in this?</h4><p>People who are in the front row of tourism are heavily committed to service so we are well known for our hospitality. SECTUR must provide better conditions for visitors and providers to profit from our segments. I have been in office since May 1, so I have been in the pandemic during my entire term so far, and this has been my reality. We have to go segment by segment and integrate suppliers, train them, and do this benchmark so that the large and strong value chain of tourism in Guanajuato will allow us to take care of our assets, accommodate them to the interests of the new way tourists want to travel, and reinforce or create new experiences. Guanajuato is the only state in Mexico with a tourism observatory that has been strengthened and upgraded. We want to make sure the segments that are leading tourism impact the value chain in providing the services so that they are taken care of. We are focusing our overall strategy on a key component on reaching larger audiences, namely a strong social media and digital related tools. During the early stages of the pandemic, we launched live broadcasting and did webinars, and we have reached a broader range of audiences and more people. Local tourism is also the key to get the economy moving. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What main areas of opportunity did you identify in the sector that motivated you to create a model for telemedicine?</h4><p>Telemedicine became mainstream in 2021 because of COVID-19. 2020 was a great change worldwide for telemedicine; it demonstrated that you can obtain health services through different platforms. In our case in Mexico, telemedicine also became popular since people did not want to go to a hospital because of the risk of contagion. It was definitely a huge transformation for our industry.</p><h4>What will be the future of telemedicine considering that 2020 was a key year in creating greater acceptance for the sector?</h4><p>We have to take into account the different healthcare providers. The main change will be that more specialists will agree to provide consultations via telemedicine, and that is a game changer right now. They now realize the future of telemedicine is such that a successful specialist's area of influence may not be the city that they live in but perhaps the region. They could have patients from all over the world and share their expertise. Another thing will be the democratization of healthcare, as people in rural areas can now consult with a top cardiologist in Mexico City. The best thing about this is that, generally, people do not get diagnosed early; for example, a patient can live with diabetes and not be diagnosed for five years, and this delays their treatment for five years. We can help people get diagnosed earlier with telemedicine and provide better medical attention.</p><h4>What are your plans to help Previta take advantage of this boom in telemedicine?</h4><p>Telemedicine is just another tool in the healthcare area of services. For Previta, it was a huge change to see telemedicine become part of the traditional healthcare system. We have developed a concept called Home Hospital, because telemedicine is just one way of reaching out to patients; you need to see the patient as well. We need to give them their medication and do blood work or lab tests. In the last 16 years, we have been gathering extensive experience in holding campaigns and health fairs and providing services at home. COVID-19 just made us act quickly to provide these services for people that could not or do not want to go to a hospital for a lab test. We provide many tests, for example, at home check-ups, X-rays, ultrasound, and other different diagnosis services. Previta provides this integrated service called Home Hospital with pharmacy, lab tests, telemedicine, and home visits all together. For COVID-19, we have attended to some 5,000 patients with COVID-19, where we provide oxygen concentrators, different monitoring devices, home visits, lab tests, and medication. We have helped patients avoid going to hospitals and prevent further complications. It has been great to see how we can attend to not only COVID-19 in this fashion but also other different diseases such as heart failure, kidney failure, or complicated diabetes.</p><h4>Do you have a segment for individuals or companies and also with insurance companies? What segment are you focusing on this year for growth?</h4><p>We have to focus on both of them so not only private insurance but also public, namely the government. We are focusing on providing these services to people who need services on their own as individuals. We will also provide them in our web service on our webpage.</p><h4>What strategies are you using to make your brand more known?</h4><p>2020 was an active year for us in the marketing area. We have been extremely busy and decided to invest heavily in social media. We hired great agencies and made a lot of noise so people would be aware of services such as telemedicine and Home Hospital.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies did you implement to cope with the effects of the pandemic?</h4><p>We have three business lines: the hotel; the vineyards as a tourist destination; and the commercialization of wine bottles. The tourism industry was one of the most affected sectors in Mexico and around the world. Fortunately, we had advanced our e-commerce strategy and are developing our website and logistics for deliveries. As a result, between March and August 2020 we focused on strengthening our online presence through social networks and e-commerce. We have grown significantly in the commercial area as we struck an agreement with Amazon to strengthen our commercial presence. We also updated our protocols and internal documentation to prepare our workers to reopen the vineyards in August. In addition to wearing masks and using hand sanitizers, we focused on providing a more personalized service to smaller groups. The flow of people has not returned to earlier levels, but our revenue collection capacity has improved. Among other services, we launched a wine club that gives regular customers points for discounts, which helped strengthen our e-commerce offering. We also held webinars on wine tasting and hosted digital wine tasting events. Some of the events have been interesting. In November, we had a digital tasting event in which a wine expert from Spain participated. We have advanced significantly in our digital presence.</p><h4>What challenges are you facing, and how are you working to position Mexican wines abroad?</h4><p>I am not particularly focused at the moment on the international market. It is extremely complex, and it is difficult some markets due to nationalistic issues, or because we do not have the logistics channel for distribution. We are interested in southern California because we were receiving 200,000 tourists a year before the pandemic, and about 30% come from Orange County, Los Angeles, and San Diego. We are preparing to distribute in the US in the mid-term, though our current interest is just southern California and the Mexican market. There is great potential in Mexico, and the wine segment has still significant room to grow in the domestic market. Wine consumption is on the rise in Mexico. There are some possibilities of exporting wine to Guatemala, Colombia, and certain Mexican restaurants in China. Many international customers do not identify Mexico as a wine-producing country. Mexico is better known for tequila and mezcal. We require many years to position ourselves in the international market, which is why the most potential is in the domestic market and southern California.</p><h4>What characteristics does the Mexican wine market have compared to others?</h4><p>There is a middle class that is growing in Mexico, a market of young adults. The second-largest segment that consumes the most amount of wine is between 25 and 35 years old. This is not generally seen in other countries, and the market of young adults has great potential. Meanwhile, Mexico is a big beer consumer. The biggest segment for consumption is between 35 and 45 years old, then 25-35, and then individuals over 50. In terms of gender, more women visit our website than men.</p><h4>What are your main targets for the year ahead?</h4><p>The first goal is to continue to operate and stay afloat. We do not know what will happen. We must ensure our business is operational. Difficult times are ahead. We have seen a fall in the number of visits by tourists and consumption. Many restaurants have closed. However, retail consumption is performing well because people are drinking wine in their homes. We expect moderate growth for this year. We want to retain jobs and maintain our operations intact. We should continue to invest in technology. Meanwhile, the harvest has been excellent this year. Production has been lower, but the quality has been outstanding. We are also focusing heavily on generating online content to approach our potential customers because trends are changing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main achievements of Salud Digna in 2020?</h4><p>We managed to effectively and successfully adapt ourselves to the new reality that we face in Mexico as a society, finding our own path to add up to overcome the COVID-19 challenge. Our main achievement is that we have turned into the largest network in Mexico for COVID-19 diagnosis.</p><h4>What changes did you implement in your operational model to adapt to the challenges posed by the new normality, and are you being able to meet the demand for COVID-19 testing?</h4><p>There were many changes, some of the most important include security processes for our collaborators and patients who required an important update to our protocols. Among other things, for example, these measures enabled them to send 700 collaborators to their homes to protect their health. We managed to administer new healthcare providers amid a global context of scarcity of supplies and technology to process COVID-19 studies. Another change was reducing costs and maximizing efficiency without hurting our quality, within a context of drop in the demand for important studies in areas such as mammography, ultrasound, and pap smear tests to meet our goals, which since the start of the pandemic was that not a single member of our team lost their job or stopped receiving their payments due to COVID-19.</p><h4>Have you identified any area of opportunity to achieve additional growth?</h4><p>Molecular biology is a modality that we did not have as an institution. In a few weeks, we managed to have the two most modern laboratories in that specialty in the country and with the largest production capacity because of its size and high technology.</p><h4>Is there a product or service that the company is planning to launch in the short and medium term, in addition to your current portfolio?</h4><p>We are working on several projects that we expect to launch before the month of September, and we feel that they are going to be beneficial for many Mexicans in need that at this moment are not completely satisfied.</p><h4>In your view, what's the added value that Salud Digna brings into the market against your competitors?</h4><p>We are an organization that adds up to society. We think the public and private players in this industry are supporting the health of Mexicans, and because of that we see all the market participants who share our vision as allies and not competitors. Every day we seek to improve our value proposition for the customer through technology, better standards of quality and service, national and international certifications, and more. That translates into a better quality and reliability, better prices, and shorter waiting times. The 65,000 patients who use our services daily clearly value this effort and their results.</p><h4>What are the objectives and priorities of the organization for 2021?</h4><p>We want to continue growing, though above all we want to offer our services and ensure that this is a safe, reliable, and comfortable experience for our patients. Our priority will continue to be to contribute to the prevention and early detection of diseases in Mexico is not just a wish, but a reality for all Mexicans independently of their low economic resources, and how that helps to reduce many tragedies as it is happening today, and every day, because of worsen health conditions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the pandemic accelerate or impact demand for both your physical stores and e-commerce platform?</h4><p>We have been working with e-commerce in the last four to five years, but in the last 12-16 months we put in more effort and made more investments in the platform and also the structure of talent. This past year demand has grown over 4,000% compared to 2019. The base was low to start with, but with COVID-19 we learned that we can do many things such as cooking, wine tasting, and mixology via Zoom and other platforms. People have noticed they can be at home with quality products but pay less than in restaurants. We have been seeing this trend for about 18 months, and we believe it is here to stay. Fortunately, we do not encounter issues like card cloning, although it is a common problem in Mexico in e-commerce. We have adapted quickly so our clients can have an omnichannel option; they can buy online, they can go to our stores, or they can place orders with our stores via WhatsApp, and we can deliver in less than an hour. With all the technology converging together, such as IoT, virtual reality, and e-commerce, we are trying to be on the top of the wave in that sense.</p><h4>How will this shift your priorities in terms of physical stores and your online business?</h4><p>We are a 100% family-owned business, which helps us be more patient in terms of the capital that is invested. We strive to think of our investments in the long run, so we definitely made a shift in strategic investments and allocations for this year. Instead of opening five stores, we will open three and allocated more capital to e-commerce, both the technological tools and the talent, which is extremely important for this tool to be successful.</p><h4>Do you see stores becoming more of a showcase, a place for consumers to look at the bottles and products before they order online?</h4><p>Our stores are made to be an experience for the customer. When we had the curfew, it was an issue because our customers like to visit our stores. They like to talk to our salespeople, ask for product recommendations, or examine the bottles. Brick-and-mortar stores will not disappear, because in the end we all like to go out; however, it is clear that omnichannel is the future of retail. We are learning to better enhance the experience for consumers, even if they buy online. We want to give them access to the same portfolio, prices, and promotions.</p><h4>What are the challenges of competing in the spirits market online considering that you are competing with Mercadolibre, Amazon, and other big e-commerce platforms?</h4><p>For the brick-and-mortar store, one of our advantages is proximity and convenience. In addition, we are constantly training our staff, who we call wine advisors. Now, it is more complicated to do, but we typically send them to wineries in France, the US, and around Mexico, because practical knowledge is important. Our layout is different from supermarkets; we are based on table wine and spirits, and we also have a deli. We also have nice packaging for gifts. We have a more extensive portfolio from these categories. Supermarkets have five or six brands, while we have more than 70. We also have exclusive brands from Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, Argentina, Chile, US, and some in Mexico. In e-commerce, it is similar; we have a wider portfolio and more quality products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on your latest challenges in 2020 and your achievements last year?</h4><p>The pandemic modified the way in which we conduct our research protocols. We had to develop a project in stages during April, May, and June depending on how the pandemic evolved. We also started a process to deliver medication directly to the homes of patients in partnership with our sponsors. We used the couriers that we used to send tests to the US to provide these delivery services for patients instead. We implemented a home office working scheme for our employees and offered some online courses on vaccines, for example. It was a huge challenge. We are heavily focused on recruiting patients as soon as we receive the green light for clinical trials. We have recruited 70 patients, and 57 remain for one obesity treatment. That was done in one and a half months. There were also some modifications in terms of how doctor visits were conducted. Telehealth is a service that will only continue to grow, though it will not replace traditional in-person medicine.</p><h4>What do you expect for the next year?</h4><p>We expect to receive authorization from the regulator COFEPRIS and are waiting for it to authorize the protocols. We have a protocol for a study on asthma in adults, another in asthma for children, another one on lupus, another in rheumatoid arthritis, and many others. We do not have an estimate on when these studies could be reopened. Currently, COFEPRIS prioritizes COVID-19 protocols, and pharma companies are reorganizing their priorities, though not all of them can focus on COVID-19. Otherwise, we will neglect other diseases such as cancer.</p><h4>Will there is going to be a delay in the development of medicine in 2021?</h4><p>Yes, there were some timelines for the development of new drugs, but that has been delayed currently. Meanwhile, there are some amendments to protocols because COVID-19 has to be included in them. However, there are many people suffering from diseases that will experience a delay in the development of their medication. There will be an impact in the middle term. The amendments of the protocols bring changes that have to be approved by the regulator, COFEPRIS. In January 2021, we received the first patient for a trial of a product that is being sponsored by Regeneron for COVID-19. This was a month in which the number of infected people increased in the country, but we experienced some issues with customs to receive the medicine we will be conducting trials for. Our goal is to have 40 people for this trial. In Mexico, we want to have around 200 patients for the study.</p><h4>What is your strategy for the first half of the year?</h4><p>We want to work on COVID-19 trials and vaccines and also start our second trial in obesity. We also have a study for ophthalmology. We received an award in 2020 in healthcare, and we conducted an in-person event in Querétaro.</p><h4>Are you planning to add new services?</h4><p>Yes, we are considering diversifying and would like to add a part of academia. We would like to train other researchers, so we want to develop some alliances with universities. We want to offer courses focused on clinical investigation for doctors, patients, and others. In addition, we are working on a book to share some of the experiences of the participants in different studies. We have several written success stories, so we would like to share them in a book. We have some patients who have lost 17kg through an injection that we provide in a clinical trial. It interacts with the insulin system, and the drug helps them lose weight. We have many programs, but we have to define our priorities. In that regard, the academia part is key.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies did you use to adapt IPS' business model to the changes in the market?</h4><p>The company was determined to keep jobs going and continue to pay its employees on time, though we needed everyone's commitment to manage resources and take all the necessary precautions. Fortunately, we closed 2020 well, with solid liquidity, profit, black numbers, and growth of 8%, although we initially predicted to grow by 15%. 2021 meant growing in some strategic sectors, such as finance, where we are strategically positioned with the largest banks in Mexico, insurance companies, and more. We considered 2020 a good year despite the pandemic. One of the challenges for 2021 is to not only maintain growth, but also measure the market and costs well. Our sector is tricky since much of it is sold in the informal market. We are now seeking new ways to combat this. One is to continue through this part of the administrative efficiency and the other is to look for new services. Here, we rely on technology and tiLatina, which has a platform where all electronic security systems are integrated. We designed a service where we can monitor a place without having a physical security guard onsite. We install the technology, cameras, and access control system, and everything is then managed from a monitoring center. This service allows a single guard to monitor up to five facilities, which lowers costs without sacrificing facility security. Another part of the business process that we are automating is monitoring, which involves vehicles that cause traffic and pollution as well as staff. Using the same principles of technology, we plan to install a video linked to a center where a central supervisor will monitor everything that takes place. This will make us more efficient in terms of staff, vehicles, and fuel costs. In 2021, we want to opt for technology and innovation, which can help us significantly improve services in this current crisis.</p><h4>You have many multinational clients. How have they reacted to this revolution in terms of the services you offer?</h4><p>We are in the early stages of marketing and making our clients aware of them. We have only just started advertising them. So far, the comments have been incredibly positive; customers are convinced this is the way forward, and we have been looking to change up the services we provide for some time now. We hope that through these services, we will soon be able to replace people with technology, although the process will be gradual.</p><h4>What kind of trends did you observe in the market that led you to create this type of solution?</h4><p>The Security Groups United for a Stable Mexico (ASUME) is made up of 32 associations, and one of our main areas of progress has been our relationship and communication with public security and the business sector. This has helped us be understood by our clients and vice versa. We got private security classified as an essential service at the outset of the pandemic. At both the federal and state level, we managed to hold a number of conversations with states to communicate well with them, which was previously more difficult since public security often viewed us as competition. It meant understanding that private security plays a fundamental role given that we protect all strategic companies and sectors such as the value transfer, airports, and so on. In short, the private security sector positioned itself well in 2020. At ASUME, we will also ensure that security staff receive the vaccine since they come into contact with people all the time and are therefore at risk.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways have you changed your business model as an AV provider to adapt to the new administration in 2018 and the pandemic?</h4><p>2019 was not a good year because of the new administration. Our company has been in business for 38 years, but up to 10 years ago, about 80% of our work was with the government. In the last eight years, we have had to switch to the private sector, and it is currently about 70% private sector and 30% public, which is less risky and completely different. The projects are smaller, and our competitors are smaller, so we have to reduce margins. We have had to hire more people, including English-speaking sales people and more millennials. Everything has changed. One of the ways we accomplished this transformation is through international associations. In 2018, we joined the Professional Services Network International (PSNI), which is based in Oklahoma. PSNI conducted a due diligence of our company and examined our finances. It has a presence in over 50 countries across the world and connect global companies to its network in each city. In 2020, we did a project in Mexico City for a company headquartered in Brazil as well as a project in Mexico City and Guadalajara for a Spanish company. We are a Mexican company with headquarters in Mexico City and offices in Miami, though we do business all over Latin America.</p><h4>What strategies do you use to win projects from international companies?</h4><p>PSNI has been a key strategy. We have travelled with PSNI to Philadelphia, Barcelona, and other cities where it holds conventions. We do networking and promote our companies, and we standardize how we want to do things globally.<br>How do you choose which products to incorporate in your portfolio?<br>That is another thing that we have had to change. In the past, we were selling our preferred brands that give us greater margins and are well recognized. However, we are no longer doing that because of the amount of competitors and the Chinese sales model. Now, we go to a company and ask if there is a particular brand they would like. If they have always worked with Samsung, for example, and are comfortable with it, then we sell them Samsung products. If customers prefer a particular brand that is difficult to bring into Mexico, we can handle that and import the items, though they will have to wait a little longer. We like to advise our customers, and when they begin trusting us, we are able to advise on the preferred brands that do not fail. We will be servicing what we install, so we do not want to promote a product that fails.</p><h4>What will be your main priorities for the next two years?</h4><p>We want to continue to focus on global projects and get to the people who make the decisions. If we want to do the videoconferencing rooms for Ford Motor Company or Mercado Libre, we have to go to the US or to Argentina to find the person making the decisions. The main challenge right now remains our sales strategy and continuing to communicate digitally by doing home offices through unified communications.</p><h4>What is your suggestion as the next step in video conferencing?</h4><p>You have to think about how many people will be behind that call. For example, for six people you want a camera that provides the best angles and can track the person who is speaking and zooms in and out. The same applies to the microphone; you want an audio processor that recognizes voices and tracks them as well. The entire system includes the camera, audio system, and the touch panel. If the users want to interact and draw something, you might need a touch wall or touch panel. These are only the basics, as there are many other things that you can put into a room, including speakers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has Médica achieved in the last year?</h4><p>It was certainly a chaotic time, but every crisis offers an opportunity and in this case it was to save and improve lives. In March 2020, when the pandemic hit Mexico, patients avoided going to the hospital for fear of catching the virus. We decided to dedicate ourselves to redesigning the hospital, adapting it, and expanding it in order to be prepared for the new needs of our patients and physicians. We also worked to get PCR plans approved as a company and indeed we were one of the first institutions to be approved by Cofepris and INDRE. We created a separate emergency area for COVID-19 patients and worked on reinforcing the hospital's isolation measures. We were pioneers in implementing auto-express PCR tests with excellent results. We made changes to the protocols that we thought were necessary. We adjusted the hospital, laboratories, facilities, and information for people, so that when patients arrived we were prepared. Financially for the company, the business profile has improved as well, though it is important not to lose sight of the human side and the number of lives that have been lost.</p><h4>The company achieved 20% growth despite challenges in the first half of 2020. To what extent will digital innovations continue to be used beyond COVID-19?</h4><p>In 2020, we also launched a digital platform to keep in touch with patients and bring them closer to physicians. This advance also allowed us to generate data and share it, bringing services from the hospital into the home. Of course, there will always be services that need to be carried out in a hospital, such as surgery. We are trying to get the hospital to handle 100% of the data digitally every day. One part is the delivery of results and another is the delivery of imaging studies such as X-ray results.</p><h4>To develop your digital care, did you purchase a start-up or is it an app that you had already developed?</h4><p>This platform was developed together with a company called Adicare. We developed this platform based on our specific requirements. We implemented the monitoring of patients in wards with their doctors and their observations. Another development of ours was a robot that can go into the rooms and provide interaction between physicians and patients. This robot is already being used in our hospital and has an iPad to monitor and track the progress of each patient, thus reducing human contact.</p><h4>What will be your main goals for the rest of 2021?</h4><p>We aim to continue our efforts in terms of the digital strategy, keep up on COVID-19 care, as well as all regular services we provide with the same high-quality clinical standards, divest non-strategic real estate properties, and on diagnostics We are currently conduct testing at 12 airports operated by GAP which will process 50,000 tests per month..</p><h4>What is the differentiating aspect of Médica Sur?</h4><p>We are the only hospital in Mexico that publishes its medical or clinical indicators, such as the rates of mortality, incidence, and so on. These indicators are public. A patient goes to a hospital based on a recommendation, but they do not know whether the hospital meets the necessary requirements to treat them. Therefore, since 2014 we have been certified by a US agency in an attempt to provide greater patient safety. It recently awarded us our third recertification. Newsweek recently published a list of the world's best hospitals, and among the 54 Mexican hotels, both public and private, we were first. This demonstrates all our efforts to improve patient safety over our 40-year history. Now, our responsibility is to remain in such an esteemed position. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What did you achieve in 2020?</h4><p>2020 was by no means a normal year; however, our results were good due to both the private and public sectors, each with their distinct dynamics. The private sector remains appealing for Mexico because of its free prices that can be adapted according to market developments. With respect to governmental business, the industry suffered in terms of both time and difficulties to adapt to changes that took place in a short span of time. Companies had to adapt in order to present their own products. However, positive results were achieved until the end of 2020. There are many areas we need to improve on, especially regarding the tender process, bureaucracy, and the collection process.</p><h4>What factors were responsible for the success of the sector?</h4><p>The size of SMEs provides flexibility to act quickly and adapt to the new normal. This small and flexible factor is indispensable for all companies that want to adapt to change. It is also necessary to renew the organization because there are roles that no longer exist, and we must adapt to this new reality. Finally, we have to implement a great deal of technology, which is one of the challenges 2020 has brought us.</p><h4>Chiesi has products specialized in the respiratory field. Has this proven to be an advantage?</h4><p>Although they are not COVID-19-related products, we have indirectly estimated a benefit, especially in the post-COVID area, as an after-care treatment of the disease.</p><h4>As the person in charge of launching Chiesi, what challenges did you face in the Mexican market?</h4><p>In comparison to the European market, where I had the opportunity to work, there are substantial differences. The major difference in the private market is that there is no reimbursement for the product that patients buy from the pharmacy, which is fairly common in Europe. This means there are dynamics between prices and demands that are typical of the 100% autonomous market. We must find a way to streamline the patient in the purchasing process via a collaboration with pharmacy chains to offer the product conveniently, streamlining the use of the product correctly. We have to work hard to achieve this, and via collaboration we can see its maximum expression. This does not happen in Europe because the product is reimbursed by the national health system. On the government side, one factor is the savings that every government in the world seeks for its country. However, what still can be improved on is the desperation to save on the purchase of a drug, as older products are purchased for this purpose, and the more innovative ones do not reach patients. This does not reach public sector patients either. Mexico has to understand what the total cost of treatment is. The most innovative drugs may cost more to purchase, but bring about savings in treatment costs in the long term. This is particularly true for highly specialized products.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2021?</h4><p>We have an ambitious goal for this year, which is to reach the government with our entire respiratory line. 2021 will be the first year in which Chiesi Mexico will enter and launch its first respiratory line. We bring innovative products manufactured in Italy that will likely change the course of asthma and COPD treatments. On the specific side, we are launching the first triple extra-fine fixed combination for the treatment of COPD. This will be our main focus, and we are convinced it will be a success. Unfortunately, the entire company is working remotely due to the situation, but we are counting on being able to travel as soon as possible. Therefore, the launch of this respiratory line will be carried out via a large virtual event that will involve a number of physicians.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on your six-year plan, Play to Win, and the role Mexico plays in it?</h4><p>This is a new strategy of the Sanofi group at a global level. We implemented it over the last year, and it changes the main pillars of the group and establishes some new strategic goals. With this plan, we are heavily focused on some key elements of our group. We have four business units, including one for vaccines: Sanofi-Pasteur. There are also three other business areas: general medicines, Sanofi Genzyme, for high specialty healthcare; and CHC, for over-the-counter products. In terms of our role in the global strategy, Mexico is among the 10 most important countries in for Sanofi worldwide. In Mexico, we can collaborate with the health sector on many different levels. We have a presence in the units for general medicine and Genzyme, which is focused on highly specialized products. We also have a presence with the consumer division. Meanwhile, we are making investments in the country. We already have two plants in Mexico: one in Ocoyoacac for pharma products and healthcare goods; and another exclusively for vaccines. Right now, we are building our third plant in Mexico, our second plant for vaccines. We also have products for chronic diabetes, which is the largest threat to health in Mexico. Our participation in that segment is important because we have a portfolio of products with different alternatives for patients with diabetes type one or two. We also brought to the country the first monoclonal antibody for patients with severe atopic dermatitis and asthma. We also offer several medicines for rare diseases and some types of cancer.</p><h4>You have a program called Proyecto Azteca with the Ministry of Health. Can you explain some of the developments of this project?</h4><p>We have been present in Mexico for more than 90 years, almost a century. Before we talk about Proyecto Azteca, it is important to understand the country, its needs, and its permanent challenges. Proyecto Azteca is a partnership with the Ministry of Health that has been ongoing for 10 years. First, this agreement is an industrial alliance. We have invested almost EUR130 million to develop a plant in Cuautitlán, where we will manufacture the flu vaccine. We expect to produce a 100% Mexican vaccine against influenza, which will translate into having a more affordable product that can be developed quicker and help protect the population. The project includes the construction of the plant and the transfer of the technology to develop the vaccine in Mexico. The contract includes a commercial agreement to provide part of the vaccines. The government will ensure some of the lowest prices in the world for the flu vaccine. We are extremely proud of this project, and we are moving faster than expected. We built the plant in 2019, and it has more than 10,000sqm. In 2020, we installed the machinery, electronics, and other equipment, and we expect to start developing the vaccine so we can submit it for the usual regulatory approval. Once the authorities approve it, we will start manufacturing the vaccine.</p><h4>Why did you decide to make such an important investment in Mexico?</h4><p>We worked hard to develop this plant in Mexico. There were many countries that wanted this investment, and not only in Latin America. However, Mexico is one of the most important countries in the world for vaccines. Not only it is in the top 10 most important countries for Sanofi, but it is in the top three for Sanofi Pasteur. We have a deep relationship with Mexico, and there is great confidence in the Mexican market. There are many things to consider when deciding to make such an investment. We have decades of experience working in the country, so we had great trust in the country. That profound relationship was an important factor when deciding to invest in Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you consider to have been Pfizer's main achievements of 2020 in the Mexican market?</h4><p>At Pfizer, our purpose is clear: breakthroughs that change patients' lives. We strive every day and in every country where we have a presence to set the highest standards of quality, safety and value in the discovery, development and manufacture of innovative therapies. This, of course, applies to the Mexican market and is the guide that keeps us year after years as a leader in the sector. Over the last year, our greatest achievements at Pfizer has been the unprecedented research to develop, in partnership with BioNTech, a vaccine against COVID-19. This, together with the successful collaboration with the Mexican government, has allowed our vaccine to be the first to arrive and be applied in Latin America. Our achievements, however, are not limited to such a breakthrough. We continue to work hard on innovative therapies that improve people's lives and to ensure that science and innovation continue to transform the course of the country. Additionally, we are extremely excited because we are celebrating our 70th anniversary in Mexico, which will make us redouble our efforts and work for Mexican people.</p><h4>In what way is Pfizer collaborating with the public sector and other players in the private sector to accelerate the vaccination program in the country?</h4><p>The COVID-19 vaccination campaign strategy in Mexico is being headed by the government of Mexico. Since last October 2020, Pfizer reached an agreement to supply 34.4 million doses of our vaccine. Our role is to bring our vaccine as fast as possible to Mexico and continue collaborating with the government to distribute the vaccine to the point of use designated by them. This excites us and commits us to be a key player for more Mexicans to be immunized as soon as possible and, of course, we will continue to work hand in hand with the Mexican government to achieve this goal together.</p><h4>What changes did you implement in your business model to adapt to the challenges of the new normal and ensure supply of your products during the pandemic?</h4><p>The public health emergency we have been facing for more than a year has forced us to make adaptations in some parts of our operations. Since March 2020, Pfizer's headquarters have been under the home office model, while the Pfizer plant in Toluca, being an elementary activity, has implemented high-level safety and health protocols to protect the health of our employees. Fortunately, Pfizer's nature is one of innovation and adaptation. One of our key pillars since a couple of years ago is to win the digital race in pharma to expedite the drug discovery and development process and to enhance patient experiences and outcomes. This indeed had allowed us to accelerate the digital transformation to better serve our stakeholders and to ensure the supply of our products, thanks to the commitment and effort of all our employees and partners.</p><h4>What new products are you incorporating into your pipeline in Mexico?</h4><p>Pfizer's innovative DNA commits us to continue bringing life-changing therapies to people. That is why our aspiration is to bring 15 new medicines by 2022. Of these, 13 will be available in Mexico in therapeutic areas such as oncology, inflammation, and internal medicine. Just last year, Pfizer Mexico launched four innovations: three of them for our oncology category and one in inflammation. However, in 2021 we expect to introduce nine breakthroughs for our patients. We are committed to bring the most innovative therapies for all the categories we operate, including: vaccines, internal medicine, rare diseases, inflammation, oncology, and anti-infectives.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for 2021?</h4><p>In the company's 171-year history and seven decades of presence in Mexico, we are more excited than ever to continue bringing innovative therapies that improve patients' lives. We want to bring better therapies and breakthroughs that change patients' lives. We will continue working with the authorities to mitigate the health emergency.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the most important achievements of ISSSTE in 2020?</h4><p>Our greatest achievement was to ensure COVID-19 patients had access to healthcare. We reported the actions that were being carried out in every state, and we brought this information together to create a nationwide overview. This meant that the situation across the whole country was made available: how many beds, ventilators, and so on. In addition, the greatest innovation was that all of the federal government's health services worked in coordination in order to ensure everyone had access to the institutions. This gave us greater control during the pandemic. The president himself instructed the Ministry of Defense to support us with facilities that had to be set up, as was the case in Mexico City. In some states, we also had hospitals ready to open under the PPP scheme. The Ministry of National Defense ran the hospital in Tepic, and we ran Tláhuac Hospital with the aid of the Cuban government. Cuban medical specialists were hired because the pandemic made it clear that Mexico was short. In addition, we coordinated teams to organize the rollout of the vaccine.</p><h4>Previously, ISSSTE was investing in technology in order to make use of the information generated in the institution. What exactly have you been investing in?</h4><p>We have several specialties. We treat diseases we call orphan diseases because their origin is not clear. We have even formed agreements with pharmaceutical companies and laboratories to follow up on the treatment of these patients. We aim to give our physicians greater research and development opportunities, greater access to information and technology, and more agreements with the private sector. All of this was interrupted by the pandemic, but it is to be resumed. The pandemic has demonstrated the importance of a country's ability to cope with a virus like this. It is possible that a different virus may emerge in the future, and we must be prepared. For this reason, governments and countries must recognize the need to invest more in research, health, human capital, equipment, and infrastructure. In Mexico, we must invest in training the coming generations in terms of technology, equipment, opening up spaces in schools and hospitals, hiring more personnel, and addressing mental health, which is the common denominator. In short, we must commit to prevention as one of the cornerstones of this administration. We must stop being a country that treats and become a country that prevents. We must teach the new generations to take better care of themselves so that they fall ill less through good nutrition, exercise, and healthy living. The adult population mainly has illnesses derived from being overweight. We also intend to decentralize research so that it can be carried out throughout Mexico and young people can thrive without having to leave their states. This is all to be carried out when we have the necessary funds, higher involvement in laboratories and pharmaceutical companies, and more people interested in research.</p><h4>Has ISSSTE set aside a budget for investment in technology in 2021?</h4><p>COVID-19 has swallowed up a large part of our budget. We dedicated all medical units for the pandemic, and we could not afford to treat non-COVID patients, which has been a problem. ISSSTE stopped investing in infrastructure a long time ago, and today we have no choice but to invest in the expansion and improvement of healthcare facilities. Above all, we have to make sure that the facilities are fully staffed. We are keen to invest in equipment, but this is not the year, as it is necessary to invest in the right facilities in order to buy equipment, and we are still very much dealing with COVID-19. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>There have been many changes in the market. What are some of the largest changes that you have identified?</h4><p>We have seen many changes in the market, for instance the change in digital marketing and the services provided through the internet. Commercial and business marketing has become a virtual business marketing for an online reality. The situation has changed dramatically, and that will affect the real estate market. All these huge shopping centers and malls will experience a transformation and a redesign. Stores will become smaller, and customers will be able to go, see products, order them, and have them delivered to their homes. Home deliveries have increased, and many people are now used to buying things online. This will change the quality and location of spaces. Right now, retailers are working with distribution centers and areas to deliver their products to their customers better and faster.</p><h4>What real estate options are in your portfolio, and are your readjusting?</h4><p>Commercial real estate is not just retail alone; it also includes office, industrial, and hospitality. When talking about commercial real estate, we are referring to those properties that generate rent. That being said, retail is definitely changing. Many stores will not survive this period. Many restaurants are also closing their doors, so we will no doubt also see a downturn in that business. We are also in the office, retail, industrial, and hospitality sectors. Another big are that is changing rapidly is the office sector, which is experiencing a redistribution and a new way of working. The trend now is more technology but fewer offices. In the next two years, we will experience a downturn in terms of demand, which will translate into softer prices, and companies will plan offices with less space for less people. On the other hand, others are seeking to redefine their spaces into larger spaces per person. We were reaching an average of 10m per employee, and in the future we will have 13-15m.</p><h4>What would you identify as the main investment opportunities?</h4><p>We see several opportunities. Those that have the funds right now have excellent opportunities in the market. Many are trying to diversify the risk. We have some groups selling a portion of their portfolios and are extremely aggressive in terms of pricing. Never before have I seen so many group properties being sold in the market. Now is the time to get high-quality properties on sale. However, the owners of assets want to sell as them at the highest possible price, while buyers want the opposite. In the next six months, I expect to see these two groups meet somewhere in between.</p><h4>What added value do you bring to the market?</h4><p>Cushman and Wakefield constantly tries to differentiate itself from the competition. The goal is to be a tactical advisory firm. We do not want to go directly to the client and say, “we can help you sell your property." We want to see their options and evaluate the different ways to reuse or change the use of a specific property. We want to give them the best advice in terms of timing. We want them to identify the ideal momentum to maximize the value of their properties. We strive for a holistic approach, not only for brokerage, but also for appraisal, advisory, and capital markets. We try to give our clients as much information as possible so they can make the best, most accurate, and beneficial decision for their group. We are sellers, but we seek the best advisory approach for our clients in every area, including project management, capital markets, financial, appraisals, and other services. This can help owners better understand the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main areas of opportunity in storage and distribution in Mexico at the moment?</h4><p>Our business is not only for small companies, but also medium ones, and the next goal for 2021 is getting this new model for even smaller businesses. The goal is to save money for those companies; having a warehouse is an expense for anyone, though a company can save up to 37% per month with our business. We once had an airplane in our warehouse that we disassembled and distributed as airplane parts. We even have plastic injection machinery that is the biggest in Mexico. We have been receiving many products and companies, including machinery for Toyota and TAR.</p><h4>Why did you choose Querétaro and Mérida as locations?</h4><p>Querétaro is currently growing, with the automotive and aerospace industries and many other companies in other industries. Querétaro is surrounded by cities that are the main manufacturing sites for cars, so it has great potential. We chose Mérida because it is cheaper and is close to the Caribbean, meaning we can cover the southeast of Mexico. It is fairly cheap right now, though Mérida is growing rapidly.</p><h4>What motivated you to open your new aero charter routes?</h4><p>We started this project over a year ago with the best fares in Querétaro. Companies had told us they have airplanes but did not know what to do with them as no one is flying. I always seek opportunity in everything, so I suggested that since Querétaro has logistics and warehouses with an industry that is growing rapidly, we should do a joint venture and start a charter business not only in Querétaro but all of Mexico. The business targets companies like Bombardier so they can transport small pieces quicker. It is slightly cheaper and more accessible than the competition, as we do not carry the entire cargo. The business is specialized for industry, so it is cheap and quick. We can make two trips per day, and companies get their deliveries in three hours. Right now, our clients are small agriculture companies, auto parts, and cellphones but we have many companies interested in this business, including automotive and aerospace for emergency parts and even plastics.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your alliance with GIZ in Germany?</h4><p>I found GIZ through our association called Association of Mexican and German Business association (EMAAC), as I was first a client and member. After many years of working with it, I was offered the position of vice president. I went to Germany for a course in 2016 and was taught how to do business with German companies. It was amazing, and I got to better understand how to do business with Europe. This is how I got to know GSF. I have excellent relations with the director in Germany as well as the team in Mexico.</p><h4>What products would you be prioritizing?</h4><p>We will prioritize Mexican products. Germany needs many products like milk, food, sugar, honey, and fruit, which are all available in Mexico. We also have high-quality avocados and have the potential to export that to many countries including Germany and even South America; no one sees that as they always focus on the US. There is potential in Europe, South America, and the UK.</p><h4>What are your main goals in Mexico for 2021?</h4><p>The next step is opening a new warehouse in Mérida, which we are currently building. The step after that is to open a new warehouse near Querétaro Airport close to our project for logistics charters. In 2019, we had some excellent results, though with the pandemic, things have paused. We have so many clients and never stopped working. We are currently growing and forming new relations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges have you been facing in Mexico when it comes to continuing to provide services and solutions?</h4><p>The pandemic has been challenging for everyone from an individual and organizational perspective. We have focused on the safety of our people and our customers above all else. We also have industrial sites that have been recognized as an essential activity during the crisis in Mexico so we have been allowed to stay open with an emphasis on strong health and safety protocols to safeguard our employees. In that respect, we were recently recognized by the Secretary of Work and Social Provision in Mexico for the quality of our implementation. We are taking care of our customers in the processes of delivery of tires and contact with our salesforce and have been supporting communities by handing out a great deal of materials, support, and masks. Our salesforce has been conducting virtual visits and holding virtual conferences with our customers to keep them informed of updates. The online business has surged during the crisis, so we have been supporting customers in their transition to new business models. Michelin is a leader in not only the traditional distribution network but also a leader online and are really investing a great deal of energy to maintain this.</p><h4>What does Michelin do in terms of services beyond tires and restaurants?</h4><p>Our purpose is to provide people with a better way forward and provide the world with better mobility. Our business goes far beyond tires, as we have four business models. Our core business model, from which we still get most of our revenue, is making tires for everything that moves, from cars and trucks to motorbikes and all B2B mobility such as construction, mining, and aviation. We have been investing to consolidate our tire business and have gained the number-one position worldwide this year through that business. Here, especially in Central America, we are trying to consolidate our business around three brands: Michelin, BFGoodrich; and Uniroyal, which are our three main brands. Across all our lines of business, we are growing fast. Around this we have developed three extensions where our growth is faster. The first one is services, as we do not want to only provide tires to our B2B customer but also the service that goes around it as well as service around mobility. That can be GPS tracking of cargo to prevent theft, cameras on trucks to follow driver behavior and reduce the risk of accidents, or the construction of trucks to be more efficient. We are providing these solutions in Central America through a company called Michelin Connected Fleets that provide our tire knowledge with a complete solution for mobility of truck vehicle fleets.</p><h4>Which segment of your business is growing fastest in Mexico?</h4><p>Services are growing rapidly. For example, in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, we have been growing due to the activity of services. The third activity is experience, as Michelin has historically provided an experience of mobility to the consumer. Since the beginning of the 20th century, we started to help drivers to service stations and restaurants. That activity worldwide is being developed, and we are expanding the network of the Michelin Guide for restaurants and the Green Guide for travel. We are also expanding our activity in the gastronomy field and have activities like the Robert Parker Guide for wine. The last part of the Michelin business model is high-tech material to develop the technology we use for work applications for other purposes, such as the medical field, for example, where we are using it. We are a leader in applications such as 3D printing and plan to expand our activity beyond tires in the field of mobility or high-tech material in the next 10 years to ensure we also prepare the future and that Michelin continues to contribute to the development of humanity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The multimodal corridor is one of the priority projects of the government; what advancements have been made so far?</h4><p>This project was already in existence but was halted. This project was inaugurated in 1907, but when the Panama Canal entered into operation, the corridor in the isthmus lost importance. We will use the existing infrastructure from the isthmus of Tehuantepec to make the crossing from the Atlantic to the Pacific. We launched a bidding process for the railways, and some companies are already working on the project and rebuilding the railroads. We expect to complete the first stage to revamp the rail tracks in September 2021. Meanwhile, we are working on investing in the ports so that they are ready once the railroad is prepared. This port infrastructure will help to unload containers from vessels and onto trains. At the same time, we are working on the acquisition of plots of land where 10 industrial parks will be part of a development hub for wellbeing and social welfare projects. We will set up 10 industrial marks in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and already have seven. Once everything is done, we will launch a bidding process for four of them that are located on government land. The other plots are under an Ejido communal land framework, so it takes longer to close the process to launch a public tender for the industrial projects.</p><h4>What have been some of the biggest challenges you have faced?</h4><p>We are working in an area that is extremely poor, and when we arrived the people in the area sought our cooperation to resolve some of their problems. We listened their concerns and reached some good agreements with them. The entire population of the isthmus supports this project, though it is requiring us to pay attention to some of the current social disadvantages and fulfill some of the promises made to them in the past. We have met with the locals, and they are extremely supportive of our initiative. We have the social support of many of these communities, which is essential for us. We also put the project to a public vote, and the indigenous communities endorsed the initiative. That is extremely important for us.</p><h4>What has the reception to the project been from the business community?</h4><p>We have worked with the chambers and business associations of the country, and they are extremely interested in the project. Many want to see and learn from the project and determine if they can participate. We also have publicized the project at several international public forums, and some international players have expressed an interest. We have issued several bidding processes for industrial parks across the country, and developers are interested in participating. The US embassy has been extremely supportive as well. Once we have the plots of land, we will conduct a more intensive campaign to attract companies to the isthmus. With the entire process, we expect to receive MXN300 billion in investment as a whole. That includes private and public investment. Once the parks are well established, then additional investments could arrive.</p><h4>What is the long-term vision of the project?</h4><p>We are not just investing in the industrial development of the isthmus. This infrastructure and parks go hand in hand with the development of other activities on the isthmus. We want fishing, SMEs, agriculture, and cooperatives, among many other sectors, to develop. We want to develop this region, which has been left behind. We are developing some social development plans to support education for citizens, as well as the existing health infrastructure. We want this development to be balanced. The main project is the infrastructure to bring vessels, then industries, and then focus on the other activities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What added value do you offer the online education market?</h4><p>At Platzi, we create effective online education, and that comes from the foundations of the company. There are three factors that make online education effective, and that is what we do at Platzi. First, we believe in a paying model because it makes you commit. We have scholarships, and we work with governments and many agencies. However, in the end, there should be a small financial transaction where one is actually committing to the formula. Second, students have to assign time to learn, and this is harder with online education. Third, online learning has to compete with all the other things happening online. To succeed, we have to create a business model for online education, ensure people have time to learn online, and create an ecosystem and community to facilitate this process.</p><h4>What do you foresee as the future of online education now?</h4><p>I am fairly sure 2021 will be a challenging year because every other institution that was doing education is now an online education platform as well, and that demand will remain. The biggest challenge is that we will also have to combine this with community. The third layer of focus for Platzi comes from our community. We are community based, so first we create cohorts where people with similar interests learn together. For example, if you want to become a back-end developer, or the types of developer who builds all the tools behind websites, we will create a community of peers around you who are at the same level. However, in the case of community, we cannot replace the real world, so Platzi has a big auditorium in Mexico City. In the future, when the crisis is over, we will likely open more auditoriums and facilities in other cities in Mexico where students can hang out and study together. We will also have mentors. The difference between a teacher and a mentor is that the teacher creates a digital library of content that students can take at their own pace. A mentor or coach, meanwhile, is the one who helps you unlock levels of learning—like in a video game. Learning should be seen more as a competitive sport where you create a routine and habit and you work toward a goal.</p><h4>Initially, Platzi targeted consumers as its clients, but now it is looking to collaborate more with companies. How is Platzi's B2B segment growing?</h4><p>We never really built a business plan where Platzi would be a B2C platform. What we created was a community, and this had many consumers who wanted to learn. We created our platform from there. Then suddenly, these consumers started requesting business strategies and products. Some of our main students built companies and engaged employees, and they wanted to pay Platzi for them. Other students told their friends at work about Platzi, and they were all paying individually. Then, they told their boss who wanted to start paying for the staff, so we had to work out how to organize this. We realized our students were already using Platzi as a corporate service, so we started talking to their bosses and asking what they needed. It was interesting because management wanted their staff to continue being motivated to learn, but they also wanted a dashboard to see who was performing well and who was not making use of the courses the business was paying for. The first thing we did instead of creating a new product or service was to create a dashboard that tells clients who their best students are and what courses they have done. Then, you can use this as part of your company culture. Some of our customers are now using Platzi for promotions. If you want to get a promotion, you have to complete particular courses. We are creating many small courses that really help and complement the development of one's career.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you consider to be some of Signify's biggest achievements in Mexico in 2020?</h4><p>Globally, 2020 was a difficult year for many industries; however, Signify had extraordinary results, making it possible to surpass its expectations for 2020. We have over 38,000 employees around the world in more than 70 countries. We were able to achieve EUR6.5 billion in sales with an improved profitability and EBITA results as well as cash for the company. Signify made successful inroads not only in terms of energy efficiency projects but also many of the sustainability efforts it has made in the last few years. Mexico is one of the most important countries across the Americas considering our footprint. We have eight facilities in Mexico and more than 5,000 employees directly in our plants that serve not only Mexico but also North America in general terms. In 2020, Mexico had the best performance across Latin America, so we were fortunate that we did not have to lay off our employees. We were able to maintain our strength, continue our operations, and serve our customers across the region. We took the opportunity during the year to also provide a new generation of lighting products and solutions into the market. Through Signify, we have migrated not only to LED but also our connected products. In the connected space, we serve many markets including residential. Most of our popular products like Philips Hue and WiZ, two of our main brands, had significant growth from previous years because people now spend much more time at home as a result of COVID-19. Hue and WiZ products have been growing significantly in usage in Mexico and across the entire region.</p><h4>What factors helped Mexico to achieve the best performance in Latam?</h4><p>Some of our projects, such as facades on an important building in Paseo de la Reforma and similar city beautification projects, played a major role in achieving our commitments. On the city beautification side, we were able to implement many important projects with several municipalities across Mexico to switch all lighting to new LED products with energy savings that can also be controlled automatically. One of our main advantages is the ability to provide greater added value. For example, during COVID-19, we have special lighting applications like ultraviolet lighting for disinfecting. There was a big boom in opportunities and requests for special UV-C lighting applications.</p><h4>What cities are you prioritizing in 2021 when it comes to creating emblematic projects, and what projects are in the pipeline?</h4><p>There have been many projects across the region, and we have been in many of the main cities around the world. For example, we did the lighting for the Empire State building in New York and the London Eye. In Mexico City, most of Paseo de la Reforma was lit by Philips lighting; now, it is done by Signify. There are also cities like Guadalajara, in which we did the lighting for Teatro Degollado with lighting application systems. In Mérida, as well, we lit the cathedral with interconnected products. In the future, we will continue to use such types of lighting in emblematic areas in the main cities in Mexico. Mexico City will always be the focus because it has the largest population, but we are also looking at the interior of the country.</p><h4>What services will you prioritize?</h4><p>2021 will be more focused on the public space because the infrastructure has been neglected for a long time and needs to be changed. We will look into not only street lighting but also city beautification. Public spaces will definitely be one of the priorities in 2021 implementing future-proof technology and embracing open standards and collaborative technology development to accelerate the introduction of connected products into systems.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Mexico play within the company's international business strategy?</h4><p>We are an international company and a leader in cybersecurity. We are dedicated only to cybersecurity end-to-end. Security and networking are collapsing and integrating, so we are today a cybersecurity and networking company. Globally, we have a market cap of about USD20 billion, about eight times of what we sell annually, which is approximately USD2.6 billion. I have been with seven private companies in the high-tech area before this one, and this is the first company where Latin America represents a solid percentage. We represent 12-13% of global revenue, so Latin America is an extremely important region. In Latin America, we have been leading some of the changes in the company. We have even been an example and a role model for other regions. We have implemented new strategies, ventures, and initiatives that the world has adopted.</p><h4>Can you give some examples of recent things you have innovated?</h4><p>One of our key strengths as a company is our patents. We have a little more than 700 patents in the cybersecurity space, some of them are extremely important patents in Latin America. To help our people thrive, we reward the patent mindset. Latin America is the only region in the world where we are number one in the cybersecurity market. Worldwide, we are fighting for second and third sport. Everyone today says they are doing something about cybersecurity, which is inaccurate. There are cybersecurity companies dedicated only to security, but most only have a specific program or solution for one need. We try to have multiple solutions for any need and integrate with other vendors to make the lives of companies simpler. If a company has to manage seven or eight solutions from different vendors, that would be a mess.</p><h4>What opportunities did you see to change the company in Mexico?</h4><p>I wanted to be the number-one cybersecurity company in Mexico. Five years ago, we were the third or fourth in Mexico in terms of revenue, but not in terms of units sold. In units, we have been the leader for seven or eight consecutive years, and today in Latin America and Mexico we have close to 50% of the market. One out of every two security devices in the market are Fortinet. In revenue, we were always lower for different reasons, but we have made it our strategy to be number one in every aspect. It took us a little less than three years, but since 2018 we have been number one and we were close to the second until the pandemic. Based on the last IDC results of the first three quarters of 2020, we were the only cybersecurity company that grew in Mexico and Latin America.</p><h4>What did you do differently from other cybersecurity companies during the pandemic to ensure growth?</h4><p>We have been doing different things since before the pandemic. Mexico today represents 25% of Latin America, so we have not only become number one in the market, but also number one within the region. My focus is to continue being number one inside and outside of Mexico, which is the reason for us taking on the Great Place to Work initiative. We began with this initiative four years ago and did everything necessary to be certified as a Great Place to Work. We are one of the top-50 companies with less than 5,000 employees and in the tech sector we are in the top 10. During the pandemic, we were certified again. We were the first subsidiary in the world to be a Great Place to Work, and the HR team and I have received calls from Europe, Asia, the US, and Canada from companies that also want to do it. Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil are now certified, and Argentina and Chile are also taking steps to be a Great Place to Work.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main achievements of Salesforce in Mexico in the past year?</h4><p>Our biggest achievement was our people, namely keeping them engaged, motivated, healthy, and living our customer success values, innovation, trust, and equality during the pandemic. Since March 2020, we have worked remotely. Fortunately, as a tech company, it was easy to have the elements to start working remotely, though the first change was an important shift in our mindsets. The concern at the beginning was that customers would not be available to connect with us; however, after a few months, customers were more open to having conversations remotely, and for us, that was an achievement. Salesforce had a great plan from the top executives worldwide. The main focus was to secure regular communication with all employees to understand the next steps and give certainty to us all. Along the way, the company responded quickly to customers' proposals to maintain that connection. In parallel, we started preparing a solution called Work.com that allows a company to plan its return to the office in a hybrid way. Another achievement was that we were able to demonstrate Salesforce's values of customer success and trust. We took care of our customers by reviewing their conditions and renegotiating new ones to allow them to meet their commitments with us. In general, the culture and value proposition in the market were consistent with our core values.</p><h4>How have you adapted your services to become more accessible for smaller companies?</h4><p>In reality, we attend to all customers. We are the promoter and creator of the cloud, which was revolutionary 21 years ago, and with this, we have democratized the technology. New advances and launches of technology are available to both large customer enterprises and tiny entrepreneurs. We are the leader in the CRM market and all solutions related to customer relationships. Salesforce's mission is to help companies build a close relationship with their customers using the best technology available such as social media, AI, mobile, and the cloud.</p><h4>Can you tell us how the Vaccine Cloud will be used in Mexico?</h4><p>It was launched worldwide recently, and it can also help Mexico, so we are committed to helping institutions make an impact. We are on track to see how we can make a joint effort with our commitment to society. Our CEO is leading a movement worldwide in the economic forum about inclusive capitalism where companies are responsible for helping societies and not only shareholders. We are committed to working together with society and the government to control and trace users and programs. We launched the communication in February, and there has been a positive response as it is critical and relevant. I hope in the coming months we can see how this program is advancing, as every country has its own strategy to follow; however, we are open to being involved in this and other programs. In terms of philanthropy, we perform voluntary work and are heavily committed to equality for women. The Human Rights organization recognized us as a certified company in quality and is inclusive in terms of gender preference.</p><h4>What will be your main goals and priorities for 2021?</h4><p>The pandemic has accelerated the digitalization process for companies, so we want to continue to help these companies retain their customers and address more markets in a digital format. The main shift is that today most companies have silos of information that are not integrated, which is one of the capabilities that Salesforce provides: one single source of information for customers to provide consistent and personalized experiences. We want to help companies better connect with their customers that are personalized and accessible by all employees on a single screen. The main goal is to help the customers connect and solve the gaps they have internally with all the channels they have with the customer to take advantage of the customer's information.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges did Linio face being one of the first e-commerce platforms in Mexico?</h4><p>We created Linio in 2012 and were the first large-scale venture in e-commerce in Latin America; we went from being a local player in Mexico to a Latin American player with operations in more than five countries in the largest markets in Latin America. Our focus was initially on Spanish-speaking Latam so we had operations in Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Panama, and Ecuador as well as offices in China and the US. Mexico as an e-commerce market is the largest in Latin America next to Brazil, but companies have to take into account the fact that it has not been touched by any sort of digitalization. Latin America is far behind in terms of e-commerce, with Chile and Argentina being slightly ahead and Brazil ahead of Mexico. When we entered in 2012, the biggest challenge was that there was absolutely no setup ready for e-commerce and no e-commerce business operating B2C on a large scale. Another challenge is finding products in Mexico. The big cities are fairly good at offering access to many products but this is not the case in other parts of the country. With the growth in e-commerce and tech-based solutions in a digital world, many companies are also fighting for a limited pool of talent, and we sometimes have to look for global solutions. Some challenges still remain even though we have solved most of them. One challenge was online payment and fraud, which is still a significant challenge and specific to Mexico. The second piece, which is more alarming, is that there are still higher than average online losses through fraud. That is a significant Mexican issue where we need to find a better solution, as it has to do with how banks deal with risk and how we keep putting the weight of the loss of the risk on the retailer.</p><h4>What are your main priorities to stand out from other competitors in the market?</h4><p>We have seen a strong increase in e-commerce; today e-commerce comprises 6-7% of total retail in Mexico compared to around 16% in the US, 30% in the UK, and 25% in China. E-commerce has been growing between 30 and 40%, and it is expected that Mexico will see a decline of GDP of around 10%; however, e-commerce is booming as people have started buying online. We are still at the nascent stage of the industry, and there are still many opportunities for different players. Linio is the first real B2C marketplace in the region. We offer companies the ability to sell products online where we charge a commission for what they are selling. We put them in touch with the customers we are driving to our website, so the marketplace model is different from the retail model, where a retailer sells their own products. We are actually a formal marketplace; we do not just let any company sell their products on Linio and select them according to our criteria. If the customer is not satisfied, they can return their product for free; we are the first in the country to offer this to our customers. One of the main obstacles to e-commerce is trust, as we want to be sure that what customers are seeing on the website is what they will get. That is why we select the companies to ensure that they can guarantee the best product possible.</p><h4>Are you focused on selling more Latin American or international brands?</h4><p>It is a mix of both and depends on the category, as many still depend on foreign brands. However, there are many emerging local brands, especially in health, beauty, and fashion, that are using e-commerce channels to increase their sales and presence. We are extremely open and do not limit the marketplace to only local or foreign players.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Mexico play within the international business strategy of Accenture?</h4><p>Accenture is a global company, but has a specific division that takes care of growth markets because it is one of the spaces where the opportunities are bigger. Mexico is one of the important growth markets for Accenture in Latin America. Within the strategy and the growth perspective, we help many of our global clients enter the market and roll out not just projects but also important innovations. Many times, growth markets such as Mexico are places where things get tested so it works both ways. That is why Mexico is quite strategic for us.</p><h4>What pilot programs are you seeing more in Mexico that we might start to see more in other emerging markets?</h4><p>We are seeing payments. Since the pandemic hit, many tendencies have accelerated. The first one is the cloud service market, which is extremely important in Mexico. The country is a great place for companies to create pilot programs that can be implemented globally. Another trend is payments, because sometimes in Mexico we are making great strides to adopting a new technology. Payments is one example, as well as digital marketing, e-commerce, and AI, which we call applied intelligence because it is a mix of AI and analytics. Accenture is great for Mexican companies that need a global presence and that are probably still small in many other places. The other one is customer experience, designing customer experiences, and how one uses e-commerce to move the market. Mexico is a place where all these are happening.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges facing Mexican companies when it comes to digitally transforming their products and services?</h4><p>Many companies have a large technological debt, which means they have not invested as they should have for the long term or they have invested but have not really used their investments. It is time to really accelerate the process and use that technology that was supplied before but has not been scaled to the place that it should be; the cloud is an example of that. In December, we conducted a study around the world. In Latin America, especially in Mexico and Brazil, at least 21% of companies have not capitalized on their investments in the cloud so now is time to do it.</p><h4>What main added value does Accenture offer in comparison to other competitors in Mexico?</h4><p>In late 2020, we put out our new purpose: to use the capabilities that technology presents and mix that with human engineering. That is what we do. We are not really about high tech; we are more about innovation and innovation at scale. One can innovate in a lab, but what we really do is help our clients innovate and scale.</p><h4>What are your main priorities for 2021?</h4><p>We will focus on four things. We have a product called Cloud First, and we told the market we are making a USD3-billion investment in the cloud. This is something we are truly going forward with, and Mexico is no exception. The other one is customer experience, and this experienced economy is helping us engage and connect better with clients through whatever channel they are using. The brand experience continues to be solid and homogeneous. The third one is cybersecurity; we need to help our clients protect their assets, investments, and IP. The fourth one goes around the supply chain, because it is modifying tremendously. There is a great deal of conversation about not only the last mile but also about 4.0, how automation and supply chain can happen, and how supply chains can be smarter and more flexible, and that is all through technology. That is really where we are at. There will be many things such as virtual reality, unique experiences, and machine learning that will be really critical to make decisions on the supply chain. These are all the areas that we will focus on.</p>]]></richbody0content>

How has GAM evolved, and what are some of its main milestones?</h4><p>GAM was founded in 2003 within a disintegrated sector in Spain. It made sense to create a larger, more global project, influenced by the construction sector. We went public to raise more capital and shareholders, and in 2008, we began our international expansion. Starting from 2014, the company began to offer new services for a far more industrialized world, with longer-term and predictable contracts, but with more complex services. This is the way things were moving until 2018, when we experienced an important change with the entry of Francisco Riberas. The growth stage we were going through was an important value proposal for customers, and we wanted to have a strong and healthy balance sheet to be able to face this stage.</p><h4>What are GAM's main solutions?</h4><p>Supply is one of our most important solutions. Regarding machines, we offer rentals. We have some 20,000 machines around the world, plus another 5,000 managed by customers, so we can provide a service. We also have a particularly important training department. First, we train staff to operate the machinery as well as how to maintain them. This is crucial because we have 25,000 of our own machines and many technical staff. We have a buying and selling portal for machinery for when our customers need to dispose of machines or need machines from us, as we have many customers in purchasing. Many brands have entrusted us with their distribution. We have a robotics project that makes driverless machines, in which we have drones that we use for work carried out at a height. We have departments specialized in industrial ecology, energy generation, events, and so on.</p><h4>The pandemic has pushed industrial and construction sector toward digitalization. How important is digitalization for GAM?</h4><p>In 2021, our aim has been to digitalize all our processes, and for that we need better data quality and better practices in order to manage it. We want a company that makes its own management decisions and does things digitally, more efficiently, and with fewer errors. We want to make data an asset. This is undoubtedly the biggest challenge for us if we want to become a more sustainable company.</p><h4>How has the pandemic affected GAM? What strategies did you employ?</h4><p>We have shown ourselves to be a resilient company, as the industry never stopped moving. If you have a problem, you look for efficiency; this is what GAM does. During the pandemic, we performed well. We have made our costs and structures more flexible. We knew customers were going to suffer, and our strategy was to be more aware of them every day and let them know we were there to help them with whatever they needed. On top of this, we provided flexibility and relief regarding payments and collections and so on. We stayed close to our customers and tried to interpret what they needed at all times.</p><h4>Which are your main markets?</h4><p>Geographically, we are divided into two large areas. One is Europe, where we are present in Spain, Portugal, and Morocco. We use the same machinery in all three countries, and they account for 70% of our activities. The remaining 30% is Latin America. We will grow in all countries in the coming years, although Latin American countries will likely grow slightly more in percentage terms. This is a major challenge in Latin America's macroeconomy. We are present in countries that are highly dependent on raw materials, such as Peru and Chile, and this could work well in the short term. In Portugal, we work independently. Portugal is one of the most interesting countries for us and is a big commitment for us this year. There, we have focused specifically on the automotive business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges did you face when entering the Mexican market, which is not known as a big market for recycling?</h4><p>Our headquarters are in Houston, Texas, and we operate in 10 countries. We have been operating in Mexico since 2004, and our biggest challenge when we entered the market was to formalize the informal market that we had in the past on the recycling side, especially in the private sector, which is where we are most focused on. We are strong in the retail sector, and today in Mexico we have 75% of the retail sector. We started with our operations back in 2004 and then we started growing the business model to three things: formalizing and monetizing recyclables; helping companies to a zero waste-to-landfill program; and a circular economy proposal, where once we have the recyclables, we either sell it to our client or give it added value. Those are the three main things we have been working on ever since we started and still remain a major focus for us when we work with our environmental partners or bring in new environmental partners into our program. We work on implementing turnkey solutions for multinationals in Mexico and helping them create a zero waste to landfill program. We have also gone into other services; we manage organics now and also the hazardous waste that they generate in their operations. We target recyclables, hazardous waste, and the organics. Our objective is for every company that we work with not to throw anything into landfills We have obviously grown on all the logistics as well as on the implementation of software in order to control all the volumes that we manage. Our R&amp;D department has come together, and we have implemented intelligent equipment that is based on cloud called Sustayn. We can generate reports 24/7 anywhere on our operations with our environmental partners. A key part of our success is making sure we continue to educate our environmental partners on what we are trying to do and making sure we have a clear control of everything regarding recyclables, organics, and hazardous waste.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the future of the recycling industry in Mexico? What are you doing to prepare for the expected demand?</h4><p>We are now today one of the biggest purchasers and volume movers for stretch film. It is a well-known plastic in our industry, and we are one of the biggest purchasers and consumers of that. Because of the volume that we manage, we have invested in a plant in Houston where we give it added value and turn it into post-consumer resin (PCR). We then sell that resin back to big companies. For the first time, these companies that were always using virgin resin for products are now using PCR. It is 100% recyclable, and many of their clients want that resin in order to close the circular economy loop. That is one of the biggest issues we will work on as well. We will invest in another plant to cater to the Mexican market as well in 2021. We will produce that PCR resin in Mexico in 2021, and that will be our main focus on that end. The market in Mexico on the recyclable side has done an incredible job to really become one of the leaders globally in terms of the programs they are implementing. Mexico is perhaps on the same level as the US, sometimes it has even better programs implemented because of the operational costs in Mexico compared to the US or Canada. In Mexico, we have a golden opportunity to truly be part of something interesting on the environmental part of it and also help huge corporations implement programs that everyone talks about but not many people are doing. The opportunities here are massive, and we look forward to 2021 and the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the company play in the Mexican economy?</h4><p>Central de Abasto supplies to Ciudad de Mexico and the greater metropolitan area. It is the biggest wholesale market in Mexico and the second largest worldwide. We supply agriculture products and meat, though the meat business is significantly smaller. We receive products from all parts of the republic and from abroad. We generate approximately USD450 million per year. Most commercial transactions are realized in cash, so these sums are based on estimates. We commercialize 30% of the gross national agriculture production, and our activity represents 1.2% of GDP. We have 90,000 people working here, and almost 0.5 million people entering every single day, through vehicles, vans, trucks, and trailers, among others. We supply large retail stores, supermarkets, and even smaller stores. We play an important role in the country's food supply chain, and during the pandemic this market could not shut down its operations. We worked 24/7, though there is more activity in the market in the early morning. We developed a public health strategy that covers the entire market in order to minimize potential infections. We made use of disinfectant gels and made face masks mandatory. We also attempted to maintain as much social distancing as possible. The community of the Central de Abasto has accepted these changes and has been open to them, which has been extremely helpful.</p><h4>What are your plans to improve the infrastructure of the market?</h4><p>The government of Mexico City invested USD50 million to revamp the infrastructure. In the past, the market used to get muddy when it rained, and there were other challenges because the infrastructure was old. We have also launched other initiatives, including a food bank in an attempt to reduce food waste through agreements to deliver supplies to charities. Some 800 meals a day are served at the sole community dining room within the Central de Abasto. We also have other projects, such as a biodiesel plant and bio-reactor plant. We want Central de Abasto to be sustainable, which does not exist in Latin America. There is no Central de Abasto on the continent that follows a circular economy model, and we are working toward that goal. Meanwhile, we are implementing other policies to protect the environment and create more environmentally friendly operations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What added value do you offer, and what differentiates you from your competition?</h4><p>There is an extremely important value, which is the human factor. We are extremely concerned about our workers and take care of them. Many companies similar to ours are concerned about their revenues and do not even know their workers' names. Our employees differentiate us, and that makes us different to others in the human resources sector. Our motto is: “Human resources more human." We precisely attempt to reach that approach with the person behind every employee. Many times, companies fail to address the human concerns of their employees; however, our focus is precisely on that.</p><h4>How did you help your workers adapt to the remote working experience?</h4><p>The pandemic has restructured the coming years and the labor structure. This was discussed before the pandemic, but today working from home is the new normal. This situation has motivated us to continue working on software that implements remote working. Through this application, our workers have to check in when they start work and check in again when they stop. This system registers their location and the time when they start and stop work.</p><h4>How essential is HR as a service?</h4><p>Few people understand this job position and cannot comprehend the importance that this job will have. Data analysis is essential to prevent unexpected situations. Prevention saves many concerns. Correcting a mistake is more expensive than preventing it. Through our system, we can identify those workers that miss work the most, or those with health issues. Many things can be covered through data processing. We want the Mexican industrial sector to understand the potential that it has, and education has therefore become paramount for us.</p><h4>How are the outsourcing regulations changing, and how are you adapting to new challenges?</h4><p>It is a challenge because there are some bad businesses that seek to evade their tax obligations. We do not work with such businesses. It is a complex issue because, in a sense, it is rooted in Mexico culture that one needs to cheat to advance. There is a saying in Mexico: “el que no tranza no avanza," which means the one who does not cheat does not advance. However, hiring an employee via shady processes to avoid tax payments can eventually become more expensive. That is the core of the issue. We need a change in mentality and for people to realize that avoiding tax payments can bring higher costs. We do not support such dishonest practices. Outsourcing is not negative in itself; the negative thing is those who use this mechanism to evade their tax payments.</p><h4>How would you rate the company's ability to attract talent from the competition?</h4><p>Young people, including millennials, are very talented, and it is challenging to attract them to your business because they are less committed. It is easier for them to quit a job than someone who is 50 years old. They change jobs constantly. We need to increase productivity and add other benefits in order to make it more attractive for them. This pandemic has been a blow for many businesses to understand how things will be from now on.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your software investment and the new services that you will launch?</h4><p>The platform is part of our innovations. We are heavily committed to bringing new services to clients. We started with a project a year ago with our own developers, and that later evolved into something different from what we had originally planned. We thought the system could only process salary payments but soon realized the capacity we could cover through this system. We are about to launch a commercial offering for this product. Now is the best time to bring this service into the market. The product is well developed and will be interesting.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities did you identify in the market that motivated you to start this consulting firm?</h4><p>F&amp;C Consulting Group started with a global vision to elevate the culture of people to transform the business world. That requires a great deal of effort, teamwork, and conviction to do it the right way. The top management of companies and the government must also be convinced that fairness and integrity can truly transform their reputation and bring them into the next era of integrity. Talking about compliance and investigations is our passion. We want to make sure we leave a global legacy and ensure this firm, which was established in Latin America, is a global firm. This does not require hundreds of people but a few who can see the value of adding and transforming the business world. If you believe in it, anything is possible.</p><h4>How important is it to diversify and maintain compliance?</h4><p>The group currently operates in eight territories: Mexico, Asia, the US, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, and Europe. Our offices and partners around the world have several concerns about how companies do business overseas. For example, we have a client from Brazil that wants to export products to Mexico and the US, but does not have a compliance program. It must implement one to ensure it has a competitive advantage and reduce the risks of doing business with the company since it follows the local regulations. This will be a requirement, and it needs a commitment from top management and a risk evaluation. From an insurance and compliance perspective, you need to know how you will do business, who your vendors will be, and that the right protocols will be in place. This all comes from a risk assessment that ensures a company not only protects its brand, products, and assets but also its reputation.</p><h4>What strategies do you use to enter new markets?</h4><p>We enter those markets based on companies' needs, the regulations, what the companies are seeking to invest in, and where they are seeking to invest. Companies are eager to export their goods and services and work with the best partner, not only from a pricing and product perspective but also a risk-reputation one. Price and quality will always be a key driver, though in the new integrity era reputation is also important. Companies must put in place the due diligence and a solid protocol to oversee what others are doing on their behalf or when they transact with the company. They need to make sure they are compliant with the local international regulations and best practices. Another example and great project that I coordinated globally was the ISO37001 communication task committee, an anti-bribery management system that would apply to all types of organizations, from SMEs to multinationals. We want to make sure everyone speaks the same anti-bribery language. When a company or public institution adopts this standard, with the appropriate scope and commitment from top management, it ensures we have the right controls in place to mitigate and identify bribery risks then investigate the issues.</p><h4>What will be your main goals for 2021?</h4><p>We want to make sure people truly have the right approach when doing business within Mexico and globally, which is why we have opened offices around the world. We want to consolidate our offices and continue working with our clients around the world to make sure they have covered all the main critical issues regarding compliance. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on your strategies to adapt your business model to the new context of the Mexican economy?</h4><p>In 2020, the law of infrastructure, which is the one that regulates us, was updated. The government has established new criteria in Mexico because we did not have strong enforcement of the regulation in the past. Previously, there was a great deal of corruption. For example, many things are imported from China, and sometimes these products do not meet a certification that we award. Right now, the law has changed, and there are more regulations. There are more limits, and that is both positive and negative. It is negative because we have more jobs as an organization and it also blocks the development of SMEs because it has become more expensive for them to introduce a product into the market. We have some large clients, including some of the largest malls in the country, and the strategy we are proposing is not to increase prices in an attempt to support their businesses. My strategy has always been to focus on volume, because that generates win-win relations. There are many monopolies in Mexico in different sectors. The verification units are those that authorize us to participate in the market.</p><h4>How many verification units are there?</h4><p>There are 90 units. There are many things yet to be regulated. Prices are not regulated, nor are the markets' strategies. We award a license that authorizes the introduction of different products into Mexico. When we started, we were the fourth organization to provide these services in Mexico. This has been a difficult period; many businesses closed down. Another significant challenge is finding the right employees; people want high salaries without making a huge effort. In addition, Mexico lacks general awareness that people must buy safe and certified products, which is extremely important. Sometimes people buy cheaper goods that are not certified, and that has challenges. We mainly work with the sectors of metal mechanics, electric, valves, gas tanks, and many others. We have more than 50% of the chocolate sector. Mexico is 10 years behind in terms of regulations in this sector when compared to Europe or the US. We have to continue working to ensure that products are safe; that is the end goal. That is the main objective of having an organization that ensures those products that come into the country are safe. We require the mentality of Mexicans to change in order to achieve success. We want to contribute to a better Mexico through our business.</p><h4>What are your main goals for the rest of the year?</h4><p>We currently have agreements with the government to see how we can work together. The first thing we are doing is looking into how the government can help us drive the country forward. Imports and exports have to be reactivated. Products manufactured in Mexico have to be exported. It will take time to identify a strategy to ensure the new FTA for North America positively affects the market. We have to reinvest in ourselves. We will maintain prices and seek alliances with new companies. We also have to reach agreements with businesses by giving them an opportunity to continue operating. We want to participate in the public debate to raise awareness of our work and the importance of regulation. We will participate in public events and conferences in an attempt to bring more attention into the business. The country requires a trade plan for all businesses. It should not be a plan per sector, but a comprehensive commercial plan for all companies. Also, the country needs to better regulate large businesses as these should be an example for smaller companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What market opportunities encouraged you to bring JAC, a Chinese brand, to Mexico?</h4><p>Some 15 years ago, we realized we had to set up a Mexican assembly plant that would allow us to establish ourselves here. The first Mexican assembly plant was opened in 2006 with a long-term business plan in place and was considered an important asset and investment in Mexico. The risk was first assembling the entire plant and then getting the permits to operate it. The complex covers 100,000sqm, with the assembly area alone measuring 55,000sqm. It is an exceptionally large plant. The second decision was to select commercial vehicles, since it is a rational purchase in terms of load, weight, consumption, traveling from point to point, and maintenance, while the purchase of cars is typically emotional. The third decision was to partner with the other established elements, specifically distributors' networks that today are the experts in managing their markets locally as well as with distributors channels with experience in the automotive and trucking area. This also meant we had to set up partnerships with banks and insurance companies that were already well established. In these years, we began to develop our distribution network, we learnt about assembly, we came to understood persistent issues, and we observed China's rise in the automotive industry. We understood the importance of Mexican assembly and the great challenge that working out of Mexico involves in terms of its roads, temperatures, humidity, the way of handling things, and so on, and that having a product imported from any country and bringing it here is uncommon. It has to be assembled here.</p><h4>Why did GML decide to strengthen its digital services and establish one of the first digital showrooms in the automotive industry in Mexico?</h4><p>In 2019, we decided to capitalize on our experience with the already formed business of vehicle assembly and manufacturing with the alliance with Molex. This vehicle is 100% electric and is directly manufactured by us. Today, it already has a fleet of more than 1,200 electric vehicles. In 2019, we decided to bring a complete line of electric vehicles to JAC with a whole digital structure, and we launched five vehicle models in November 2019. JAC is a strategic partner of a Chinese company and Volkswagen in electric vehicles, so it already had experience in this sector and in the largest sale of electric vehicles in China, which forced us to look for a digital platform more robust than the competition. We needed the support of a daily and personal monitoring with the user of one of these vehicles. This is where the investment that allows our platfaorm to be the most robust in the market comes from. It is a digital platform that supports all activities, such as sales, test driving, visualization of products in 3D, and so on. It involves microsites for each of the dealers and their operations; absolutely everything goes through the platform. In January 2020, we digitalized the company, a process that should have taken one or two years. In Mexico we are the number-one brand in sales of EV, and we plan on continuing to implement new models into our portfolio for both passengers and commercial vehicles.</p><h4>How would you summarize 2020 for the company?</h4><p>At a company level, in the current circumstances, the most important thing is moving forward and looking for alternatives. We suffered during the pandemic, though we were one of the brands with the least effect on sales; they only fell by 9%. In 4Q2020, there was 20% growth compared to 4Q2019. We launched three new models in 2020, and today they will be the important basis for 2021. No distributors left our network, but three more came onboard and opened two more stores. We grew in terms of distributors and sales. The platform provided greater brand awareness and recognition.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways is the Mexican automotive industry the most interesting sector at the moment?</h4><p>It is a growing industry. We did not have a great year in 2020, though under the circumstances it was not that bad, as the Mexican auto industry exports almost 89% of what it produces to North and South America, Asia, and Europe. It also brings in a large amount of foreign exchange into Mexico in terms of trade balance surplus and is a large provider of well-paid jobs. Through the auto industry, one can get in touch with almost all other industries.</p><h4>Considering the relevance of the relationship between Mexico and the US for the automotive industry, what is your outlook for the new administration in the US and its impact on the sector?</h4><p>There may be more impetus on certain technologies, like green technologies. I expect the US to promote more clean technologies, an issue that is already well developed in the auto industry. We produce hybrid and electric cars in Mexico, and there could be growth in that area. We also expect the US to promote clean fuels. That is also important because new technology vehicles with combustion engines require clean fuels to mitigate environmental pollution and decrease greenhouse emissions. The other area that is important is the labor side of the industry. The USMCA Agreement included labor matters that demand certain conditions, and I am sure the Biden administration will pay special attention to Mexico's compliance with those commitments.</p><h4>What is the sector planning to boost sales and demand, and what strategies are you using to ensure better outcomes for 2021?</h4><p>Auto production was halted in Mexico for two months in 2020. Then, the industry was deemed an essential activity, and we were allowed to continue manufacturing. Generally speaking, vehicle exports were down 20% in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2021, we expect an increase in production of around 9 to 12%. We see a positive trend in the American economy, and that will help exports. We also hope that by working with the authorities, we can increase domestic sales of new cars in the local Mexican market. It is important; we need a quicker recovery of the Mexican economy that will also be reflected in new car sales.</p><h4>Will the industry also focus on becoming more digital in the coming year?</h4><p>Due to the pandemic in 2020, more vehicle sales were made digitally. Plus, systems in cars are more digital now, and they will continue to develop along that same trend. We expect the auto industry to have more modern technology digitally, and we are also pushing for incentives for electric cars. That is the most modern technology that the auto industry is now improving and pushing forward.</p><h4>What projects is AMIA developing in 2021 to better position the automotive industry?</h4><p>First, I am proposing a change to part of AMIA's organization infrastructure. If our members approve this, we will make some changes internally to better position AMIA not only with the media and government, but also with our own members. This will give us an organization that better represents and reflects the size and importance of the auto industry. That is something we need to do as an association and is part of my mandate. I am working on making these changes in AMIA to ensure the organization becomes the true representative of the automotive industry and reflects its importance to Mexico. There are a variety of proposed changes such as revamping our infrastructure, how we communicate with the government and the media, and how we coordinate and deal with other chambers and associations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main achievements of Deacero Power in 2020?</h4><p>After much hard work, we managed to achieve a major milestone by migrating one of our biggest loads to the wholesale electricity market. The current requirements for this are significant in terms of investment, regulation, and compliance as well as in the procurement and installation of the necessary infrastructure, especially related with metering and communications. The procurement of this equipment is a major challenge, since it is currently very scarce in Mexico. It was especially challenging to comply with all the migration requirements established by the National Center for Energy Control (CENACE), the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), and all the authorities and regulators in the middle of a pandemic. As of today, we have almost half of our energy consumption through the wholesale electrical market, which allows us to be more efficient and agile in terms of our energy procurement in Deacero as a whole.</p><h4>What challenges did you face in closing your first electric power contract with Iberdrola? How many more do you hope to close in 2021?</h4><p>Deacero became the first and only end user to represent itself as a qualified market participant. This is extremely new for the market, since no other company has done such a feat, which involves managing our own loads directly with CENACE with no middleman such as a qualified supplier in between. This required an enormous amount of effort in terms of building important human capital capacities, as well as systems, technologies, and tools that allow us to have the capacity to seamlessly participate directly in the wholesale market with CENACE. Before signing our agreement as a market participant with CENACE, we needed to demonstrate that we had the experience and knowledge to become a market participant. Having done so, we signed the contract with Iberdrola, the first of its kind in Mexico signed between a generator and a final end user. This contract is a long-term PPA from an efficient natural gas combined cycle power plant, which is in the northern part of the country, very close to our load center, allowing us to be very efficient by avoiding congestion. Moving away from the typical regulatory structure of consuming from CFE and now consuming directly from this power plant has allowed us to work 24/7. We consider this a major achievement, not only specifically for Deacero but for everyone in the steel industry in Mexico. This has shown that the Mexican industry can be extremely competitive.</p><h4>How were you able to achieve effective communication and participate in the wholesale market with a team working remotely?</h4><p>It was definitely a big challenge, especially considering that we are a relatively new team. We just had two years working together as a proper team, although we had the opportunity to prepare ourselves to get the skills needed and receive training in terms of managing these complicated and sophisticated systems. In spite of working remotely, we managed to find a great dynamic as a proper team, which allowed us to focus on our day-to-day goals as well as clearly defining our medium-term goals. It was a challenge, especially when trying to communicate with the regulators. It took us some time to establish effective communication with regulators, which is necessary especially when discussing technical requirements. There is still room for improvement in criteria standardization in terms of the equipment needed for different types of loads depending on the specifics and features of each load. We needed to work closely with CENACE specifically to ensure our investments in equipment were the right ones required for loads like ours. That was a great challenge, however we are pleased with the end result. We have nearly 170MW on the market so far. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the main changes Énestas has made to adapt to the context of the market?</h4><p>Énestas started serving LNG to companies that are outside the pipeline grid. No matter how big or small the companies, we always try to serve those customers and develop those areas that do not have access to natural gas. Énestas continued to grow its business and started a trading office to serve customers who are connected to the pipeline. Furthermore, we have expanded our portfolio of solutions and can now build and operate fuel and raw material terminals.</p><h4>Énestas is also advising industrial parks in different parts of Mexico on creating better gas infrastructure. Can you elaborate on this segment of your business?</h4><p>It is one of these chicken-and-egg situations. An industrial park opens in a new place and starts looking for customers, but it is limited in the businesses it can attract to the park if it does not have access to natural gas. We work with them to build the internal natural gas pipeline infrastructure for the park and supply them LNG. That way, the industrial parks can start acquiring customers that need that resource from day one. Once they achieve a critical mass or a certain size, they can connect directly to the pipeline and get that cheaper option.</p><h4>Énestas also built the first terminal in Mexico that serves both liquid ethane and LNG. What opportunities did you see in the market that led you to create this project?</h4><p>It is an interesting project for us. We call them temporary terminals, which are small-scale terminals that are complementary to whatever volumes you might be receiving through the pipeline or where you cannot justify a longer term 20-year commitment to having a terminal. We build small-scale temporary terminals that are intended for a four- or five-year term. We completed this terminal in 2020, and it has already received more than 18 different vessels. It is the first terminal of its kind, and it has been a safe operation. We operate 24/7, and it has helped our customer continue to maintain its production efficiency by complementing their raw material input through this terminal. The terminal is on the Gulf Coast in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. Right now, it is just being used for liquid ethane, but it is ready work in LNG.</p><h4>Énestas has an ambitious goal of developing the biggest network of natural gas in Mexico and becoming one of the biggest providers in North America. What investments and steps are you taking in 2021 to achieve this?</h4><p>We want to emphasize each of our business models. Because Énestas can use pipelines, road, and maritime transportation, we a greater reach compared to other gas distribution companies. However, there is investment needed to be done on small-scale LNG, pipeline natural gas, and terminals. So, we are broadening our scope and offering solutions that people just did not know existed. We want to supply customers with LNG on a small scale, build short-term terminals, and then move that equipment and installation to other places where we can reach them again with the same business model. We want to continue to grow in each of those segments.</p><h4>What has been Énestas' experience as a Mexican company distributing natural gas in the US, and what are the challenges of supplying cities like Houston?</h4><p>It is always challenging because as a newcomer you have to understand where the market stands, who the key players are, and what they are offering. In the US, there are some big companies offering a wide range of services. Therefore, our focus is to find niche areas that have not been served yet. We are growing cautiously because the US is so big that we do not want to grow too fast and end up unable to serve our customers in the right way.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your 2021 outlook for the Mexican oil and gas market?</h4><p><span></span>HERMES AGUIRRE Oil and gas is a key sector of the Mexican economy, and we are focused on supporting both local and international companies achieve their strategic objectives throughout 2021. In this regard, we expect our business to grow with the activity taking place. Pemex publicly announced it is working to increase barrels per day production. We collaborate to play a key role in supporting this objective, as well as adding new reserves. The outlook is extremely positive in terms of the activity. We are working together—providers, service companies, operators and government—to solve possible disruption concerns and implement best practices to maintain our operations safely. The price of oil in 2021 has been improving, this should drive for more stability and support more campaigns to be executed.</p><p><span></span>GRACIELA ALVAREZ According to the director of Pemex in October 2020, the average estimated production for December 31 is of 1.908 million bpd, which is higher that the initial estimate for 2020, which was 1.174 million bpd. That means we expect production to pick up in 2021. We expect more than 1.944 million bpd, which is what Pemex expects to achieve. The National Hydrocarbon Commission has authorized upstream activities of four additional oilfields, so many of our clients are focusing on that area. 2021 could be a year in which everything that was done during the energy reform will be consolidated. Much of that was in exploratory activities, so we expect they will become production activities. There is a reconfiguration of the downstream sector and large investment in this sector. Everyone is looking forward to everything returning to normal.</p><h4>What role does your company plan to play in the sector?</h4><p><span></span>HA With the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry, we have experienced different ups and downs. We are taking advantage of what we have learned to be more efficient. One opportunity is that we have increased our speed of technology adoption in all different aspects for increasing customer asset value. We have implemented technologies to increase efficiency and support the operations. When we collaborate, I am confident we will overcome whatever challenges we face and enter the new era of the industry with improved conditions. Another area that we will keep working on is unifying our efforts with customers to give back to local communities—supporting the communities where we live and work is imperative, and we will continue to implement programs to share the benefits of the industry.</p><p><span></span>GA We have several oil fields. We are working with some large companies that have already been producing for the last two years. How do we support them? I manage the sector for risk management. The fall in the stock exchanges has affected the premiums paid for oil hedges. Many companies that offered oil hedges have withdrawn from the sector, which means one now has to work twice as hard. The insurance sector for the oil industry has been heavily affected. These energy insurances are extremely specialized and are affected by the situation of financial markets. Our country has some risks associated with it because of the credit downgrade of Pemex. However, we have done everything well for many years. We are well-known in the market, which has helped us significantly.</p><h4>How important is Mexico to Halliburton's international business strategy?</h4><p><span></span>HA Halliburton has more than 100-year history and have been in Mexico for more than 80 years. We plan to be here for many more to come. We have developed Mexican talent and allocated resources to our facilities, which is where we have been growing our footprint. We have strengthened our operations around the country, including the Tampico facilities that we started two years ago and in Dos Bocas. These facilities have increased their capacity to accommodate local and international requirements for the new in-country business. We maintain a strong presence in Mexico.</p><h4>What are your predictions for the sector?</h4><p><span></span>GA Fortunately, our government is allowing public-private investment, and I am convinced that it is necessary to develop PPPs in the oil and infrastructure sectors. The position of the government is well defined, and it is seeking to establish alliances. I expect to see foreign investors arriving in Mexico. If our government maintains its current policy, PPPs can be the turning point in reactivating the economy. We all want to work at the end of the day. There is great potential in the sector, and in 2021 everyone is prepared to work hard as soon as the vaccine is ready.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what way did Valero adapt its business model to changes in the market?</h4><p>Valero is a company fully committed to contributing to the energy security and storage capacity in the markets where we operate around the globe with a long-term vision. Mexico is not the exemption. The Mexican energy market has experienced more of an evolution than a transition, since the Energy Reform was enacted, and has continued to mature. Our business model is focused on the long term and the projects we are supporting in Mexico, together with strategic business partners, are part of that long-term plan for Mexico. Changes over the short term have not affected our business model and goals for the Mexican market.</p><h4>How fundamental is the New Port of Veracruz project to your supply network?</h4><p>The Veracruz Terminal is relevant for our strategy in Mexico. We look to contribute to the reliability of fuel supply and storage capacity with a robust logistics system in Mexico for our distributors and consumers. It is a key sign of our long-term commitment and trust in the Mexican market. This facility is one of eight projects we are supporting to have the necessary storage infrastructure and logistic footprint in the market. In the case of the Veracruz terminal, we partnered with IEnova, a strategic business partner for us. The New Port of Veracruz project will be fundamental for us in changing our supply system. While today we bring product in via rail directly from our refineries in Texas, we will move that supply chain now through the Port of Veracruz, which will become the entry point for several terminals being developed, two by IEnova in Puebla and the State of Mexico, a third one in Guadalajara, and a fourth terminal in Aguascalientes that we recently announced and will come online in late 2022. The Port of Veracruz terminal will have a capacity of 2 million barrels for gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel. Even if it is not the largest terminal we are involved with, considering we operate all over the world, it is one of the most sophisticated as we have applied a great deal of the knowledge, technology, and experience that has been developed over the years by our team and IEnova's. We are extremely excited about initiating operations at this location.</p><h4>What is your perspective on the future of the energy sector in Mexico?</h4><p>We are a refiner, a company that supplies world-class transportation fuel products to its clients and business partners in the Mexican market and contributes to the energy security and supply in the country. We believe there will always be a role for imported fuel in the country and we want to play in that space to contribute to the efforts of the government to increase the reliability and efficiency of supply to serve the different sectors of the Mexican economy. That efficiency in turn brings more competitive pricing, and that is where we are focused and how our efforts will contribute to increasing reliability and energy security in the country.</p><h4>What sets Valero apart in this market and worldwide?</h4><p>Valero is the largest independent refiner in the world. We produce 3.2 billion barrels of transportation fuels and we are heavily committed to running the most efficient and clean operations at our refineries. We have developed a refinery that produces a renewable diesel based on biomass, using animal fats and grease to produce it. We will triple or quadruple the capacity of that operation to help with the transitions into renewable fuels. Our focus and effort in Mexico, a priority market for us, is for the long term and to be able to contribute to Mexico's energy security. We are heavily focused on providing a reliable supply of world-class fuels at a competitive price.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of your milestones in 2020?</h4><p>2020 was a complex year for everyone, and COVID-19 has affected many people and businesses. We knew it was essential for us to care for our people, while also collaborating with Mexico to understand the problem we were facing and trying to be part of the solution. In addition, we saw a decline in global oil prices in 2020. However, we have a long-term strategy and understand that the economy goes in cycles. BP's main achievement was implementing a change in its strategy. We launched the strategy change in February, and the top management changed; a new CEO was appointed. In August 2020, we announced a second organizational change. The goal of all this organizational revamp was to address this crisis with a leadership that would be an example, while defining the pillars of our strategy for 2021.</p><h4>Some industry leaders request more regulatory certainty in Mexico, while some want more clarity from the government. What is your take?</h4><p>The government has been in office for the last two years. Our strategy is from 2020 to 2050. We have some objectives that are extremely clear for the coming decades. We see the entry of new technologies that will replace the hydrocarbons industry. As a result, all our projections through to 2050 is that oil will decline, while gas will be a transitory kind of fuel. That being said, we propose a transformational change for the next 30 years. In that time period, we will focus on the very long-term fundamentals. We want to transform as an energy company, and we are building all the capacities to be ready to cope with future changes. There is a change in the entire oil and gas business. Most of our investments through 2050 will be in renewable energy projects. We will carry out those investments in the most certain and stable regulatory environments, where there are strong and autonomous regulatory bodies. We respect what the Mexican government is doing; we are observing the conditions in the market to take the best decisions. So far we have seen a lot of respect from the Mexican authorities for our investments.</p><h4>What role will Mexico play in BP's plans for the future?</h4><p>Mexico will be part of our exploration activities. We have three offshore fields: two in deep-water and one in shallow water. We also have an alliance with Panamerican, the second-largest company in Mexico producing hydrocarbons after ENI. We are extremely proud of what Panamerican is doing. We operate through non-operating JVs as well as operating JVs. We have a highly relevant presence in upstream. As for the midstream sector, we are also important players in the gas industry; we transport 25% in the industrial gas market. We are market leaders, and we are an important company that works alongside CENAGAS. Castrol is an important company in which we are present, which has 12% participation in the market. In downstream, we are leaders in every major, and we will continue in this business. We are clearly in every layer of the value chain in Mexico. At a global level, we will increase our low-carbon investments by eight times for 2025 and by 10 times through 2030. The next goal is to establish alliances with cities and key industries to reach their goals of zero emissions. The next objective is to have daily transactions with 20 million customers, which is more than twice what we currently have. Another goal is to develop around 50GW of net generation capacity from renewable energy including green hydrogen, solar, and wind power generation units. That's 20-times more than our current levels. We also want to have 70,000 stations for electric vehicles in comparison to the 6,000 that we currently have. All this will be gradually implemented in Latin America. Meanwhile, we want to reduce our operative emissions by 30% and 50%. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you share some of the achievements from Pemex last year?</h4><p>The main achievement of the company was to halt the fall in oil production that had been persistent for 16 years. Production was stabilized around 1.56 million bpd, taking into account the reduction required by OPEC. The company recorded two achievements: increasing oil production and a reorganization of the company's assets and collaboration with service providers to unify the purposes of the country's president. The goal of the president is to produce 2.2 million bpd. Of that amount, 1 million barrels will be for exports, and 1.2 million will be refined in Mexican refineries.</p><h4>How are you seeking to diversify the services you offer?</h4><p>The board of Pemex has 10 members and is headed by the Secretary of Energy. There are five members who are government representatives, and the other five are independent. The role of the independent members is to direct the committees that support the board. There are four committees: strategy and investments; auditing; rent; and acquisitions, human resources, and remunerations. Pemex is extremely important to the Mexican government; it provides around MXN600 billion in total to the government, which is about 10% of government revenues. Pemex is the most important taxpayer in the country. The challenge, on the one hand, is that the tax burden of Pemex has to be reduced in order to make it into a competitive company. On the other, it is important to ensure it continues to contribute to the country's budget. The goal of the president is to rescue Pemex, because during the previous regime the goal was to dismantle it and transfer the exploration and production activities into private hands.</p><h4>How is the board seeking to support the financial restructuring of the company?</h4><p>Pemex is the most indebted oil company in the world. It is not easy because it has many taxes. Pemex pays taxes for extracting oil, and not after selling oil and obtaining earnings. In order to make it competitive at a global level, it should have an adequate tax regime. The debt of Pemex, some USD100 billion, is 10 times the budget of Mexico City. Thus, it is important to have a sustainable debt that is aligned to the worldwide reality. Pemex is a viable company, in operative terms. It has an important level of free cash flow. The EBITDA of Pemex is always positive; the problem is the high interest that it pays for its US-denominated debt and its tax burden.</p><h4>Is it viable to have a government-owned oil company, and should Pemex be a private company instead?</h4><p>Pemex is a well-managed company; it has a positive cash flow right now. Before, there were other interests and a great deal of corruption. However, this government is committed to rescuing Pemex, and I support that because it would give Mexico back its energy sovereignty. The country will then depend less on foreign markets. The reality is that there is a big effort to rescue the company. We want to bring a more nationalistic view to the company.</p><h4>What are the challenges for 2021?</h4><p>We want to revamp the system of refineries in the country, particularly in the industrial activities of transformation. In addition, we want to increase oil production of 1.56 million to 1.8 million bpd. We want to continue exploring and producing oil to create economies of scale to reduce the extraction costs. We want to reduce oil production costs because it allows the company to allocate resources for other areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways are you planning to transform your presence in Mexico?</h4><p>We are in the process of strengthening our presence in Mexico. We currently have a significant footprint on combined cycles, around 2.7GW, as well as participation in wind and solar projects, but our growth strategy is moving downstream and towards renewable energy projects. One of our areas of interest is distributed power generation for commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) customers so that we can build projects on site, which can be of a different nature. These could go from small engines to solar projects with our sister company Forefront Power. We could add storage and do several other things on the distributed area. We are also in the process of starting business activity as a Qualified Supplier to supply power with attractive conditions for C&amp;I customers. We want to present ourselves to our clients as an integrated utility provider, by offering not only a wide range of solutions on the power side including energy management services but also water treatment through our other sister company Atlatec.</p><h4>Why do you expect a boom in demand for distributed power generation in Mexico?</h4><p>There are two reasons: cost and reliability. Typically, big combined cycles have been considered more efficient than small power generation units due to scale cost, which translates into lower cost of investment, maintenance and gas consumption. That cost gap between large and smaller projects is now becoming narrower. In addition, we expect the cost of natural gas to remain low, which makes the efficiency not that critical. Then OPEX, or the operation and maintenance cost, is also becoming more efficient thanks to the technology of not only the hardware but also the digital tools. The ability to manage power plants remotely and predict failures all lower maintenance costs. The other reason is resiliency and the ability of the consumer to become isolated from the grid if there are problems of supply. If we add solar power or storage, then today there are more possibilities to adapt to the needs of clients through these solutions. Today in the US, the most common buzzwords in the power sector are resiliency and microgrids.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were your milestones in Mexico last year?</h4><p>The milestone was to maintain operations; that was the main achievement. We could not conduct new projects for obvious reasons. These are the effects of the pandemic and the regulatory changes to the energy industry. Our main achievement was that we continued working, and we did not have any layoffs. We want to continue to advance in Mexico. This year, we will celebrate 20 years, and we strive to continue in Mexico for many more.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your projects in Mexico?</h4><p>We completed a project in Sonora in 2019, which was for 119MW of photovoltaic generation. The project is called Bluemex Power and is operating well, and we are supplying its entire electricity. We encountered hurdles connecting our generation unit to the grid and to the government-owned utility, though we persevered and were able to overcome the challenges and connect our project to the grid successfully.</p><h4>Are you planning to start new projects in 2021 or 2022?</h4><p>We have a project that we have been trying to develop in Oaxaca since 2017. It is called Eolica de Oaxaca (EDO) and is a 300-MW wind power project, which has a power-purchase agreement (PPA) of 252MW. The energy that will be produced was sold in Mexico's second long-term auction for energy and clean energy certificates supply and purchase contracts with the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), Mexico's state utility. We faced many obstacles when completing construction. First, we suffered the effects of the 2017 earthquake, which slowed down our progress. A large of part of our projects were in the cities of Juchitan and Union Hidalgo, which were greatly affected by the earthquake. We made donations to the Red Cross and supported the local population, delaying the project for a year. It was difficult at the time to resume construction works of the plant, because people needed to rebuild their homes. We resumed our efforts with the new administration of the Mexican government, which brought many changes in the processes. At this time, we are waiting to conclude the public consultation, which is done by the Secretariat of Energy. It was going to be completed in March 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic started. We have USD350 million in investment that is currently on hold. We are waiting to see what happens this year and continue to push forward, although it is very challenging because processes remain halted due to COVID restrictions. It is difficult to gather people to discuss and resolve these matters. We have a pipeline of projects of more than 1,000MW that we want to build and are in the development stage. In some cases, the project sites are located on greenfield, and in others, they are brownfield. We want to advance the projects that we can advance. We are carefully analyzing our investments. We plan to tread carefully until the conditions are given, in terms of the rules of the game. </p><h4>What are your main goals for 2021?</h4><p>At some point this year, we would like to start construction of our 300-MW project (EDO) and initiate another project in the northern region of the country. The situation in the north is different to that of the project of Oaxaca. The Oaxaca project already has a PPA sold. For this project, we will offer it to the market. We do not have a company that will directly purchase the energy generated. The energy will be directly sold in the stock exchange market, so there will be companies that can purchase the electricity for one or two years and then find a different supplier. That is the foreseeable future for projects because the Mexican government is changing industry requirements continuously.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook of the energy market in the country, and what are the main opportunities when it comes to power infrastructure?</h4><p>Every crisis comes with lessons to learn and opportunities. The power crisis in Texas taught Mexico many lessons as our country is closely linked to the US. The first lesson is that it is extremely important to have a diversified energy base. Mexico is fortunate to have access to abundant and cheap natural gas from the US, but we need to diversify our energy matrix. That can be achieved primarily by developing Mexico's renewable resources. We should continue to develop Mexico's wind and solar resources which will also strengthen Mexico's energy security. Second, continuing to strengthen Mexico's power transmission infrastructure is also critical to avoid future interruptions. Third, we need to think about storage, primarily natural gas. Mexico has three large LNG facilities, but those tanks are not intended to provide storage. Mexico needs to develop underground natural gas storage for much needed backup. Diversifying the energy base, investing in transmission, and developing underground natural gas storage are the three lessons learned from the situation in Texas. Although each of these opportunities is different, there is always room for private investment to play into these different opportunities.</p><h4>What challenges did you face when developing the large terminal project of Puerto de Veracruz?</h4><p>It is an exciting project because it is our first refined fuels terminal in Mexico, and we can store about 2 million barrels of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and MTBE. This will be the largest private terminal in the Gulf coast of Mexico with immediate access to the production of the US Gulf coast refineries, with less than two days of shipping into Veracruz. This terminal has many advantages and provides efficiencies, including the fact that it provides access by rail to Mexico City and Puebla; hence, we are also about to begin operations of two additional terminals in Mexico City and Puebla. We will bring the product in rail cars in order to discharge it into trucks that go to the final distribution facilities. It is a wonderful opportunity; it has been challenging because it is one of the first private refined products terminals in Mexico. I am pleased to say that throughout the project development there was great cooperation from the port authorities, Veracruz API in particular, the state and federal governments. We have an important customer, Valero, the largest independent refiner in the US, that is committed to long-term fuel supply in Mexico.</p><h4>What does the project mean for energy security?</h4><p>Mexico is a net importer of fuels, particularly gasoline. Some 70-80% of its gasoline consumption is imported. We have access to competitive gasoline being produced in the US, and this facility enhances Mexico's energy security by not only supplying a new port of entry into Mexico but also providing storage and inventories.</p><h4>What have been the main advancements in the Costa Azul project?</h4><p>This is our most important project under development in Mexico today. The Energí­a Costa Azul project was originally developed as an import and regasification facility, and now due to the change in the market, where North America is a large exporter of natural gas, we decided to convert that facility, which was operating for over 10 years, into an export facility. We will take gas from the US, liquefy it, and export it primarily to Asian markets. We spent several years developing the project, and last November we took a final investment decision, obtaining all the necessary approvals to launch the construction. The total investment is USD2 billion, which we will undertake with our partners Sempra and Total. Additionally, we will invest USD350 million in a new gas pipeline to bring natural gas from the US into the facility.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities have you identified within the electrical system development program?</h4><p>What we expect from the electrical system development program are reinforcements to the distribution and transmission lines, the main asset owned by the National Interconnected System. Although some power plants that were planned to be removed in 2022 will now be removed until 2024, we still expect to see the market incorporating new power plants, including renewables, that can make best use of the space available. Such power plants will be instrumental in reducing congestion as we would expect them to be distributed in areas where there is more demand. It is important to take advantage of areas that are not heavily populated and have solar resources to bring this energy to areas where there is increased demand. </p><h4>Petroleum prices dropped in 2020, and there were energy developments that were not expected until much later. How will you take advantage of this moment?</h4><p>Although the energy transition has been a trend in several countries in the last few years, 2020 definitively accelerated such process. In that regard, we hope Mexico is not left behind as the industry demands this energy transition. There is an appetite in the consumers for competition. They want to choose their own energy supplier and the type of energy being consumed as they are conscious about emissions. For Mexican consumers (qualified users) there are currently three options—energy efficiency, on-site generation, and the wholesale electricity market—for energy supply. With the possibility of choosing one's own supplier, there is a wide spectrum of options for consumers, and energy suppliers along with power generators are forced to become more competitive, increase savings for consumers, and move forward the energy transition agenda.</p><h4>What challenges have you faced in the Mexican market?</h4><p>We have two main challenges. One is to break the fear barrier that we have seen in other markets, such as the Spanish market and in emerging markets. Consumers wonder, if I change my supply provider, what happens if the power goes out? And how can you guarantee that the power will not go out? These fears come from a lack of knowledge of the energy reform. All electricity users, who are connected to the National Interconnected System, have the constitutional right to the energy supply distributed and transmitted through the electrical grid managed by the Federal Electricity Commission. Having electricity is a constitutional right, regardless of the supply provider. Therefore, the risk of the quality of the supply guarantee does not exist. The second challenge we face is the red tape and administrative and bureaucratic procedures that are slowing down the energy transition. These bureaucratic and administrative procedures that users have to go through to switch energy suppliers can take anything from four months to a year. However, in mature markets such as Spain, changing providers takes just days. These barriers mean there is no liquid market that promotes new developments, new investments, more participation, and a more competitive market.</p><h4>What main opportunities do you see in the market, and why are you still committed to Mexico?</h4><p>The opportunities in Mexico are endless. Of the qualified users we have identified, only 500 are registered. So, we still see great potential in the Mexican market. It is a wonderful journey on which we anticipate that about 100,000 or more potential qualified users can migrate to the wholesale electricity market. Mexico is an electro-intensive country that depends heavily on its input and energy costs to be competitive. 2020 affected every industry, and being able implement cost reduction measures and increase efficiency has become more important than ever to boost economic recovery. All business must look for ways to reduce costs as much as possible, and we as qualified suppliers can make a real difference in terms of costs. We consider ourselves an energy solutions provider.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of the biggest achievements of AMAFORE in 2020?</h4><p>Our main challenge was that by mid-2020, some legislators started to propose that the retirement fund system be nationalized and not necessarily by private pension funds like retirement funds administrators (AFORE). That was a significant challenge and a great setback for markets and protection to pension funds. Fortunately, after a great deal of discussions, we worked on creating a proposal to enhance the system and adjust its original parameters along with the Business Coordinating Council (CCE). We had started working on it since September 2019 and had an open dialogue with the new administration, President López, and the Finance Minister to enhance the system. Finally, in September 2020, the president sent a bill to congress to reform our private pension funds management law. The private sector offered to gradually increase the amount of savings they contribute on behalf of the workers; in exchange, the government was willing to strengthen the system and reduce the minimum time required to work formally to attain a minimum guaranteed pension. The second challenge has to do with the pandemic and its effects on the pension system in Mexico, which was two-fold. The first one has to do with partial withdrawals from AFOREs. Those funds have been extremely useful for those workers that have lost their jobs, and 1.2 million people made a partial withdrawal in 2020 because Mexico does not have unemployment insurance. The other effort the sector made was going 100% digital. After a complicated year, we are currently facing a new phase right now for 2021 and the coming years. Nevertheless, in this volatile environment, the pension funds achieved an amazing record return on funds in favor of workers for this crisis year. On top of this, the reform places Mexico's system in a better position than all other countries in Latin America. Right now, after the reform, 90% of workers will have a pension, and that pension will be enough for a decent retirement, at least according to OECD averages. We have an important future in managing the pensions and funds of workers in Mexico.</p><h4>Could you tell us about the digital transformation being incentivized in AFORES and how it plans to help make this transition go smoothly?</h4><p>This change is extremely relevant, not only because we are making it easier for workers to access AFOREs from their mobile phones, but also because in this sector most of the expenditures we incur are related to commercial costs from people trying to convince workers to move their savings from one AFORE to another one. This app gives workers the power to decide which AFORE they want to keep their savings in and helps them change their funds manager with little effort via the app. AMAFORE has a close relationship with the regulators and supervisors in order to represent the interests of AFOREs and workers. We had many discussions with CONSAR on how this app should work and the elements needed to validate that it is the worker who is seeking a change of manager and not necessarily the commercial forces that sometimes create distortions in this market.</p><h4>In what ways are pension plans preparing for the upcoming changing demographic considering the average age of the population is 29 years?</h4><p>Right now, with the reform we have strengthened the system, and we can assure all Mexicans, particularly younger ones, that everyone will have a sufficient pension according to international standards. That puts Mexico ahead of many countries. We have had excellent results in terms of interest rates on behalf of the workers. The average returns in Mexico are around 11% annually and more than 5% in real terms. And with voluntary savings, anyone can get those returns with as little as MXN1 investment in their AFOREs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide an overview of Banregio's main achievements in 2020?</h4><p>Without a doubt, the main achievement was keeping people safe. The second achievement was that we were able to accompany the clients along this process that was extremely complex and continues to be complex. We obtained solid results because we have been working with clients of the highest quality for many years. These clients have a good financial performance. In that sense, we do not only work with large companies, but also small and medium businesses too. Our loans for SMEs recorded double-digit growth, for example. We saw an increase in engagement with our digital products, which was positive. And last, but not least, another positive outcome was an increase in customer liquidity of over 20%.</p><h4>In your last quarterly report, the company talked about the importance of customer relations and customer loyalty. Can you elaborate on that?</h4><p>In terms of large companies, customer relations can be extremely similar to other banks. What sets us apart is our understanding of the local market. In the segment of SMEs, we continue to offer a model based on relationships, while other banks provide those services through their commercial offices. They serve all their segments from the same place. In that sense, we are different. We have a person serving these clients and accompanying them through their daily needs. We also have teams specializing in different sectors, like agro-industry for example.</p><h4>What is your vision for digital banking in the country, and what role would you like to play?</h4><p>We have two brands: Banregio and Hey Banco. Banregio is for companies and families with a certain level of net worth. We call that group the preferential segment. In that segment, I am sure we are the market leaders. We have an extraordinary service and an innovative model. We want to address all our customers' needs, including banking, business, and investment. All those needs are covered by a single person, and these services are done remotely, so our clients do not need to come into our offices. We want to provide our customers with a 100% digital service. The Banregio offices work as a flagship to foster the brand's name. Then, we have Hey Banco, which brings a completely different offering to clients. This bank does not have physical offices, so the savings here translate into better yields for our clients. In the last four months, we have grown at a rate of 9,000 new clients per week. We have added a great deal of value into our products, which is one of the reasons for those successful rates. We are about to launch a new package of products that will add more value to the application of Hey Banco, so we expect to continue adding new clients. Right now, our main challenge is that with COVID-19, it is difficult to maintain a fully operative call center.</p><h4>Banregio recently changed its branding. Can you outline some of the reasons behind the change?</h4><p>The previous logo and bank image was outdated. We made a comprehensive change to the brand's image as well as to how the offices were managed to increase their efficiency. All our offices are connected to Salesforce. I also have a team for sales intelligence, which is constantly coming up with innovative solutions. I also have a team for risk intelligence and a platform that allows us to understand the situation in terms of customer service. We want to always serve our customers. We also created a culture to constantly improve the model, and this year we will improve the model again. This model is oriented to attending to our customers at any time. We call it Concierge 360 because it includes services for our customers' businesses, families, and personal net worth. No other company offers this service, which is provided by Banregio.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are a young executive; how did you enter the insurance market?</h4><p>I started my career as an entrepreneur when I was 29. I wanted to do something for someone else or the country. When I was in secondary school, I went to help people in a remote area in the state of Veracruz. I was there for a week and fell in love with the people; I realized I wanted to do something that benefited people. I saw an opportunity to be an insurance broker and was able to offer my brand and invite other people to contribute for the benefit of society. I then found a job that allowed me to help people and establish a business. There are two perspectives: the business and helping people. When I generate business, I also help my collaborators and partners to generate jobs, so I continue to help. The insurance sector is a great business. Previously, I was an employee of an important pharmaceutical company, and I realized businessmen need to take risks. When starting my business, my bosses, directors, relatives, and friends told me I was making the wrong decision. They questioned how I could become an entrepreneur in insurance, a sector that is in bad shape. Most people do not have insurance or purchase insurance because they do not fully understand the product. They might have home or vehicle insurance but do not consider other insurance possibilities.</p><h4>Asesores Senior has a presence in five cities. What are your expansion plans?</h4><p>When we developed our website, we said we had to be present in five cities within five years. We are currently in nine cities as of end-2020. The intention is not to limit ourselves to just to a circle or just Mexico City. There are many people who need help. If I meet an individual who wants to open in Xalapa, I will say go ahead, and we will try to start operations there. Right now, the real strategy for the next year, in addition to opening new cities, is to have a presence in 15 cities within the next two years.</p><h4>What business changes did you implement because of the pandemic?</h4><p>In the first week when the restrictions were announced, I was shocked. Our business is done face to face, and even face to face, it is difficult to sell insurance. It is a huge challenge, but we invested in technology. We developed a virtual advisory service to generate trust among our clients. It was an important investment and is not an app, but a website. We try to serve people from their homes. We have created a user-friendly website for our users. Our challenge was not only convincing prospective clients, but also our partners as well that it could be done.</p><h4>What growth do you expect for 2020 compared to 2019?</h4><p>At the close of October, we have grown by 30% compared to 2019, and we expect to grow by 60% by the end of 2020. We have partly achieved that not only due to our digital investment at the beginning of the year, but also due to the shift in mentality. We managed to motivate our investors and made them believe this could be done. In the last two years, we have achieved double-digit growth. Our first year we achieved triple-digit growth. Perseverance is the key to this success.</p><h4>What is your vision for 2021?</h4><p>Our vision will not be the same as it was in 2019. In 2021, we will continue to invest in technology, and we will combine what we did in 2020 and 2019 to achieve greater growth. We now have a more efficient system thanks to our investment in technology and our interest in consuming less paper and using digital resources. There is now less paperwork in our processes, and that saves time and is better for the environment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which were the most important achievements of Grupo KC in 2020?</h4><p>The most important achievement was our digital transformation. Many companies went from being traditional businesses to digital ones overnight. We learned how to conduct virtual meetings, hold training sessions online, and serve clients from an alternative perspective. One of our biggest challenges was the process of adaptation itself because no one expected the pandemic to occur. In 2020, we focused on the transformation the mindset of our employees in that regard.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the technology investments you implemented?</h4><p>What we were going to implement over three years we did in just a few months. We use data analytics to payment processes with our clients, AI, and bots to chat with clients. We recruit staff with AI, which analyzes profiles on social media and invites them to work with us according to the profiles we have in the company. People who are interested in working with us enter the AI system, and a bot interviews them via videos. Depending on their answers, prerecorded videos will appear. What a person can do in a year, AI does in a day. This opened our eyes to greater growth at a national level; now, in just four months, we are already present in 23 states, and we will open two more physical offices in 2021. We will grow at a national level over the course of 2021.</p><h4>What trends in the market led you to invest in a countercyclical manner?</h4><p>If there is a crisis, there is also an opportunity. You have to find a way to make your business grow. We currently have one of the biggest projects to help induce strong growth called Expansión de Individual Privado. You have to try drastic things in times of crises, but always looking after the budget. We have also been responsible in terms of our human capital; we have not fired anyone or reduced salaries. Our commitment to protecting ourselves as though we were a family means we also take care of our resources, goals, and projects and thus obtain results. This is something we have learned in 2020. With Expansión de Individual Privado, we are opening franchises nationwide where we place a sales manager, and all this technology helps them recruit a sales team, improve collection, find clients, and more. We are also helping new franchise partners grow through this project. The competition has been more concerned with how to reach the clients or keep their business going. We are growing so fast, that even the competition is asking us to partner with them.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for Grupo KC?</h4><p>At a national level, we want to continue growing and recover our market position via growth with business partners and experienced people. We will also continue to recruit sale employees and focus on the customer through various technological means in order to provide a better, easier, cheaper, and more complete service. Long term, we seek an exponential and medium-term growth at the Latin American level. Currently, at the national level, our agency has the highest number of insurance brokers. We have more than 1,100 brokers certified by the National Insurance and Bonding Commission. In other insurance business, we have another 200 brokers. I am the executive director of the GAMA International Association of Promoters, which provides forecasts at the Latin American level, and we are beginning to share our practices and knowledge in Costa Rica, Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for the Mexican economy in 2021?</h4><p>The speed of digital transformation in Mexico is extremely rapid; there is no country in the world that is accelerating that quickly. To some degree, the omni-channel was an option before, but today it is a necessity. In Mexico, the largest retailers and department stores were not adequately prepared for this change; however, this is the new reality of the Mexican economy. Second, regarding COVID-19, what differentiates Mexico from other regions is that there have not been programs to support these dramatic situations. There were no fiscal, labor, or financing programs to support this change. Certain industries have been resilient and have managed to withstand the effects of the pandemic. Some of these companies are somewhat connected to US and Canadian demand, and Canadian and US businesses have managed to withstand the impact of the pandemic more than Mexican companies. That is partly because there are support programs for firms in Canada and the US. Those companies that are closely connected to the FTA in North America have been extremely resilient. The healthcare industry has been resilient, as have logistics. The technology industry has not faced any problems. However, tourism and restaurants are some of the sectors that were more affected. Meanwhile, less people were able to meet the requirements to access credit due to the economic recession, impacting consumption.</p><h4>Do you expect demand for offices and commercial real estate to pick up?</h4><p>Working methods have changed. Many things can be done via Teams or Zoom, but some face-to-face interactions are still necessary, especially in Latin culture. As for commercial real estate, there is an oversupply of commercial real estate space. The Mexican economy declined in 2020 and is expected to record some growth in 2021. However, that growth in 2021 will still not lift us above the GDP of 2019. That means we still are in a recession. Second, and this is essential for me, a great deal of this activity requires liquidity. Many companies need access to financing, and Mexico is drying out in terms of financing. Businesses need liquidity to operate in a recession, but financing options in Mexico are limited. Mexican businesses are heavily dependent on the banking sector because there is not a well-developed stock market. That is why it is important to continue to promote this market, and particularly the new BIVA stock exchange, that has several programs for smaller issuers as well as advisory. The lack of financing options is one of the main handicaps that we face in Mexico.</p><h4>Your track record is fairly unique in Latin America. What characteristics do you seek before adding a company in your funds?</h4><p>Our main goal is to first maintain, and then increase the value of our investment. We are a growth-style fund, so we are also scouting opportunities in the market. We are extremely selective in terms of industries. Second, we seek to invest in companies that have the strengths to become stronger in their industries. We want companies that are unique in their sector. Third, we want them to have high growth potential; Genomma Lab is an example. It had certain products, so we provided Genomma with a business model financially sound, but focused on growth. In addition, a strong managerial team was, and is, extremely important for us. We are either majority or minority investors; what we seek is a strong business operator in their area.</p><h4>Are you interested in any entering other Latin American countries?</h4><p>Through the companies in which we are invested, we have a presence in eight countries. We do not invest in Brazil; it is a protectionist country. We are not looking at Argentina for the time being. Then, we have Colombia, Peru, and Central America. Central America has a great deal of potential. Chile has a similar situation to Brazil.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main areas of opportunity for investment in Mexico?</h4><p>The most important opportunities are at a personal level; it is an opportunity for many people to reinvent themselves. At a sectoral level, the world will likely consume less for three reasons: we have learned that things like this can happen, and, therefore, we have become more risk adverse. We have learned that there are many things that we can live without, and we have become greener and want to protect the earth. For these reasons, we will consume better and healthier food and will be more sophisticated in that particular area, which is a huge market. In all, Mexico is rich in creativity and resourcefulness but lacks basic education to be entrepreneurs.</p><h4>What main areas of opportunity have you identified to meet the needs of the unbanked Mexican population?</h4><p>There has been a silent revolution since we established the so-called non-banked banks. When we negotiated the NAFTA agreement, the main push from US entrepreneurs was for Mexico to allow non-banked banks, as they do not take deposits but disburse loans. These legal bodies are extremely creative and free from regulations besides certifications against money laundering. Therefore, I would love to have the time, as there are many specialized SOFOMs in SMEs, which is a great portfolio.</p><h4>What is your experience in financially aiding and advising the SME sector in Mexico?</h4><p>My first attempt to aid the SME sector was in Banorte, when I was advisor to the president. My second attempt was when I told the director there is a real glass ceiling, and I decided to start my own company. Like all entrepreneurs, I failed at first, and the main lesson I learned was to specialize. If you want to do things big in the SME sector, you have to go sector by sector. I started with something familiar to me and focused on modernizing the public-sector transportation sector in Mexico. I first promoted the use of natural gas vehicles, as the costs of fuel are halved. From there I had to put gas stations in place and then GPS systems to prevent theft. I am now the main purchaser of Nissan vans that use natural gas in Mexico. COVID-19 caused a boom in the transportation sector, as everyone wants a van to distribute products. We also offer financial services to the unbanked population that cannot afford the costs of a traditional bank. The focus of Financiera Sustentable is for everyone to have a share in the value created. My entrepreneurs, employees, and loan owners all have a share. The business I am inventing now is to lower the rates based on inflation and market trends, but I will accept all the money that customers want to save with me and find ways to grow in terms of loans. I am now trying to purchase bunches of loans so that the administrator of the loan comes with the loan, and I give them incentives to continue developing the same product. That is the way to manage this demand for savings with supply. I started in April 2020 with MXN15 million in savings demands, and it grew to MXN200 million in savings per month. It has been a tremendously busy year, and capital is growing rapidly. In 2021, we will reach the minimum level of capital that the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) requires from a small bank.</p><h4>What new business segment are you venturing into?</h4><p>I am now going out with dignified and green housing, as I anticipate a huge demand for such a product throughout Mexico. Everything I do is for the bottom of the pyramid. If we give this economic group value, they work hard to repay their loans, even if we have to restructure them sometimes, as it is their house, car, or education. I do not see any other bank truly working for the bottom of the pyramid. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is 2021 a crucial year for the economic recovery of Mexico?</h4><p>This year will be crucial for the economic recovery of Mexico and the world. The actions taken by governments now to encourage dynamism and reactivation will be decisive in achieving this goal. Although the end of the pandemic and its global effects are not yet in sight, we are confident that the progress in the vaccination of the population will generate an environment of greater certainty, which will be reflected in a progressive economic reactivation, job recovery and greater market activity. In the case of Mexico, in addition to external factors impacting the economy, several analysts have expressed concern about certain government policy decisions. Therefore, it is essential that the authorities and the private sector work together to create a strategy focused on generating greater certainty and security, strengthening the image of our country abroad and increasing Mexico's investment potential. The macroeconomic and investment landscape has seen significant changes since the pandemic. All indications are that the Bank of Mexico will continue to lower or maintain low interest rates, reaching ranges of between 3.5% and 4.0%, in an attempt to reactivate the economy. For this reason, fixed-income instruments will have low rates that may not cover inflation. In this environment, investors will seek to diversify their portfolios by including equity instruments so that their money does not lose purchasing power over time. For the coming and following years, the most attractive sectors are expected to be those with the most disruptive technology. The sectors I am specifically referring to are healthcare technology, green or sustainable technology, fintech, and the 5G network. This challenges us and gives us the opportunity to list more companies in these sectors on the stock exchange. It is essential to send the right messages so that foreign investors bet more on Mexico. We have competitive conditions that place us in an advantageous position with respect to other markets. As part of this effort required to stimulate the market, BIVA has been very active. We have been working continuously to encourage the growth and development of the market, approaching local and international investors and providing them with relevant information about the advantages of the Mexican market, the country's competitive conditions, and the opportunities to make investments.</p><h4>What kind of investments has BIVA continued to make toward its digitalization?</h4><p>This year we plan to continue innovating as we have done since we started operations. As a clear example of this, in 2021 we launched BIVA Cloud, an innovative platform for the distribution of financial and stock market information. It includes valuable topics such as digital marketing, investment and financing trends, economic data, market share and data, or characteristics of the different instruments, among others. We live in an ecosystem that is constantly being updated, which is why BIVA Cloud supports the digital transformation necessary to survive and adapt to the coming years, driving the development and growth of Mexican business and the economy as a whole. As its name suggests, it works using data in the cloud, making information available worldwide. The data is available through APIs, which benefits the integration of information from various sources and provides greater speed in the implementation of the information for the applications that use it. It is an accessible and robust platform, capable of supporting real-time information distribution. It helps eliminate barriers to entry for new entrants and reduce costs for existing ones. With BIVA Cloud, we seek to evolve, generating better product offerings for intermediaries, investors, and issuing companies. We aim to attract a greater number of participants and thus foster the growth and modernization of the securities market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision for Banco del Bienestar as its newly named Director General?</h4><p>My vision is to position Banco del Bienestar as Mexico's main development bank. We will bring financial services to the most remote villages in the country and reach those Mexicans who have historically lacked access to financial products, services, and education. The bank will promote financial inclusion through a large network of more than 2,700 branches and offer tailor-made products designed to address the needs of our target market. Eventually, that financial inclusion will lead to financial development, and our clients will have access to the financial tools required to develop both personal financial health and business ventures.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges of offering services to Mexico's poorest communities located in isolated areas of the country?</h4><p>The first challenge is that there are no banks or ATMs in these remote areas. This is why Banco del Bienestar has an expansion project, because first we have to create the banking infrastructure. We need to bring internet connectivity to these areas; otherwise, we cannot operate or develop special programs. We need some of our people in the territory so they can help locals and offer financial education because the members of these communities have never had bank accounts or a relationship with a bank. It is a truly significant challenge for us.</p><h4>How do you adapt your banking services to people who are being paid in cash and do not have any formal income history?</h4><p>One of our most important projects is the social assistance we provide. Currently, some of these aids are through debit cards, but others still relate to cash. We have to change this and give cash in fewer situations. We are trying to make formal banking a reality. This is what we have in the planning stage now. For example, we are developing digital files and helping people learn how to use digital banking services, such as debit cards and ATMs, which some older people are afraid to use. We have to show them the way and educate them.</p><h4>What are some of the other projects Banco del Bienestar is currently developing?</h4><p>The extension of our network with 2,700 new branches is currently the most challenging project I am leading. In addition to the construction of the branches, we need to review and upgrade our entire commercial operations, including products, communications, software, hardware, HR, and suppliers, among others. Our most important government project is to manage all the social aid programs through Banco del Bienestar. This requires a large effort to open debit accounts for all clients in social aid programs who currently receive social aid in cash or through other banks. Importantly, many of these social aid programs are now protected as human rights under our federal constitution. Banco del Bienestar has a social commitment to foster financial inclusion among all Mexican citizens by offering a broad portfolio of financial tools focused on our current and potential clients' needs. The bank also provides financial education to help Mexicans value the benefits of developing a financial plan, avoid debt, and form a savings strategy.</p><h4>Will Banco del Bienestar collaborate with fintechs on its new technological infrastructure?</h4><p>We are currently evaluating what we need for this big expansion. There are 23-25 million people receiving social aid, plus other potential new clients, so we will significantly increase our capacity. We need specialized technology for this, and other experts are helping us evaluate this along with Banjercito. Once these decisions are made, we will form alliances with private companies that have the specialist banking technology we require. It will also be good to develop some products and services that will help us better serve our target market such as personal loans, comparative loans, insurance, social aid programs, investments, and specific services for Mexicans living abroad.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What main areas of opportunity have you identified in the insurance sector?</h4><p>The main challenge or change that we witnessed after the pandemic is, first, to be flexible in terms of knowing a client's needs. We have to have flexibility and act promptly in terms of response time. We have to respond quickly to the customer's needs. We also have to improve the technology in the sector. That is a gap where there is a great deal of work yet to be done.</p><h4>What investments have you implemented in technology?</h4><p>We have invested to improve our CRM systems. CRM is extremely important to follow up with our clients, and we have also invested in improving our social media presence. Social media helps us be closer to our clients and reach out to new clients. We also invested in experts who help us administer those social networks in an attempt to remain closer to our prospective and current clients.</p><h4>What strategies are you implementing to broaden your potential client base?</h4><p>Mexico has an extremely low penetration rate compared to other countries, which offers the advantage of increasing market penetration and providing a better financial education to our clients. We are investing in every single platform. We constantly share articles such as how to instill in children a culture of saving. We always strive to offer a value proposition. We do not want customers to just visit our website and read about us; we also want them to learn things that can help them in their lives. We seek to reach out to more individuals through this route because that can help us close the insurance penetration gap. There is a huge challenge in that area, which is an opportunity at the same time.</p><h4>What differentiates you from the competition?</h4><p>Our close relationships with our clients and our analysis on the financial needs that we perform on every single client set us apart. We are talking about a tailor-made product. We also remain close to our clients. Someone who is 30 does not have the same needs as someone who is 60. We first conduct a personal interview with the potential client to identify his needs and offer an outstanding value proposition. We offer something that is extremely personalized. The clients remain extremely satisfied with this service because they see this personal touch in our services. We try to meet with our clients twice a year so that we can determine if their needs have changed. Clients see this service as something different, and that has made us stand out.</p><h4>What is your customer profile, and which segments are the most attractive?</h4><p>Insurance allows us to address many sectors. People think accessing a product like this is extremely expensive, but in fact it is not. It varies depending on the characteristics of each client. We have different products that can be sorted by gender, net worth, or where the client lives. We try to cover the largest number of clients possible. We try to have as many clients as possible. Mexico does not have a good health coverage system, so insurance can provide a better service. The same is true with pensions for retirees; we can provide a larger coverage for citizens. We do not focus on any particular client because it can be targeted at both boomers and millennials.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2021?</h4><p>The main priority, without a doubt, is generating jobs to expedite our growth. Creating new job opportunities will help us grow. The economic recession has affected us all. One of our priorities is to create jobs that will help us advance the economy as a whole. We want to attend to the necessities of all our clients. Some were left unemployed, whereas others performed extremely well this year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what way has your business in criminal law overall in Mexico been impacted by the pandemic and all the changes in 2020?</h4><p>It has been 180-degree turn due to the fact that for the latter part of the year we have not been able to go out and engage with the authorities for our cases. Second, for the latter part of the year, the juries and hearings are not as good because the judges get desperate with the online platforms they are using, and the resources are limited. That does not play only to the judicial part of the system but also to attorneys and as well to the AG's office, be it state attorneys or district attorneys because we were not ready for this pandemic in every sense. In a system such as ours and a system that we are trying to achieve, even though the government does not let that happen often, there is a need for a back and forth between the judge and the defendant, and there has to be a rapport between all parties involved in the case. A platform like Zoom prevents that from happening.</p><h4>Has your law firm had to educate clients on why it is important to choose a law firm that has certifications?</h4><p>In Mexico, criminal law has always been some sort of a commodity. Criminal law was used as a market to reach certain goals, be it political or commercial. Our current administration made the situation even worse because it is the worst-ever attorney general that we have ever seen, at least since I started working. It has literally corrupted the way that the whole law system is supposed to work, and we have seen this in political cases and regular cases. We changed systems to ensure it is more respectful of human rights and of the process as well as the victims. But now, for example, ex-party meetings are handled without any kind of supervision, which is completely prohibited. There is nothing that we can do, so they are literally creating a bigger problem that is wider and deeper than what it was with the previous administration. Criminal attorneys who have fought so much for the institution of the overall tribunal are now dealing with a mild neglect to the previous system. This is a serious indicator of where we are with criminal law in Mexico.</p><h4>What opportunities did you identify in the Mexican legal markets that inspired the creation of Bufete?</h4><p>We saw a need for a good criminal law firm that handled cases differently to what was being done in Mexico at the time. We sought to establish our benchmark under the image of big criminal law firms within the US and the UK where we add a partner to every case. There is a junior partner on and two associates on every case. That way, we dedicate a limited number of resources but the client is always protected, and they always feel engaged with the clients. You present a united front and show them the good and bad, which sometimes tend to be bad for business. Most law firms do not meet international criteria for compliance, but we are 100% compliant. It takes some time to educate most of the authorities when it comes to anti-corruption matters and anti-favor matters because that is the way it has always been in Mexico, at least in criminal law. During the pandemic, the situation with corruption has grown worse exponentially, and with the current administration corruption and criminal law has been terrible since its inception. With the pandemic, it became like The Hunger Games because there was a great deal of chaos, no work, and salary reductions, and everyone just wanted to get their share so corruption got significantly worse.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you hope to achieve in Mexico?</h4><p>Our vision and mission is to help transform cities into smarter, more friendly, and more habitable places. We participate in several of the key elements that help a smart city evolve. One of them is communication, namely media communication. We began as an out-of-home traditional company with billboards, and now we are fully digital. Some 95% of our business in Mexico comprises digital billboards and digital street furniture. That gives companies greater flexibility in communicating their messages. If one wants to post a message, advertisement, or even a social emergency communication from a local government, we can upload that onto our screens within hours. We are contributing to communication, and as we head toward greater digitalization of this communication, it becomes more flexible, user friendly, and relevant in terms of the geographic location, time of day, or time of year. One can develop a concept on digital media and digital content marketing, whether it on cellular phones or laptops, and that is what we would call a contextual market. That is an incredible advance in the way one communicates, markets, and send messages to the citizens of the city. The second one is what we promote openness and flexibility in helping cities with their street furniture such as bus shelters. In other cities around the world, we provide public intelligent bathrooms and intelligent waste deposits. The third factor, which is perhaps the most relevant for Mexico City, is that we own and operate ECOBICI, the public bike sharing system. Clear Channel was a pioneer, and we started the project not as a business but a service that we provide. We asked the city to let us operate the bicycle system in exchange for additional street furniture and out-of-home advertising. We also work with cities to share, analyze, and understand big data and mobility data. Big data is a major player in what we do in cities. In addition to cities, we also work with private enterprise, shopping malls, stadiums, airports, and bus stations, where we can also provide advertising. Our vision is to go 100% digital; we are no longer into classical or traditional areas. Digital is not only the future but the present, as almost 100% of our business is now digital. Mexico City for us is 100% digital. We only sell digital out-of-home, and that provides us with great flexibility.</p><h4>Is there an opportunity for billboards because people are over saturated by online advertising?</h4><p>It is not cannibalization; it is a complement, as they work well together. About a year and a half ago, Facebook did a study that found social media and out-of-home work extremely well. We have run interactive campaigns and time-related campaigns that have been extremely relevant, with a hashtag and real-time news. At the end of the day, we aim to have the same flexibility as a cellphone. Now, with ad blocking apps, the number of people who block ads is extremely high, and this motivates us to work with advertisers, marketing teams, and creatives to develop truly impactful, relevant, and attractive messages to the consumer. We have more than 500 advertisers. Going digital gives us the ability to show around eight to 10 advertisers at the same time in one hour.</p><h4>What will be your main priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>Growth and growth. It is extremely important, because the pandemic has hit us. For Mexico, it has been the worst decline in economic growth in almost 90 years since 1932. We need to reinvent the way we sell and merchandise ourselves. There is a logical opportunity to either merge or acquire smaller players. Such crises give companies the opportunity to quickly consolidate, and that is what we need to utilize. For example, right now we have been selectively acquiring digital billboards and digital locations in Mexico City and other cities during the pandemic. We focus on the top-10 cities of the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

China used technology because technology was already a part of people's lives. For example, both Alibaba and Tencent, the two biggest companies in China, combined their QR code systems for contact tracing. This is something that should be implemented in Latin America because we have the technology.</p><h4>Has demand for your services accelerated in the last few months?</h4><p>I work extensively with local governments in Mexico, and everyone worries if companies are ready; the answer is no. We had to go through in six months a transformation that we thought we had 10 years left for. We were not ready to digitalize work, work remotely, or work with the systems in companies. Many of us were still using WhatsApp for communication between colleagues, and just using Zoom or Slack was a real struggle for most companies. In the past few months, the idea of smart digital transformation has become more relevant and important. Now, it is not only life and death for companies. In addition to going through a digital transformation, they are worried about whether they will survive the next year. In Mexico, we have a problem of always thinking short term, and now it is even worse. It has been a challenge just to go through that, as people want quick answers right now.</p><h4>What are your main goals for the short term?</h4><p>In terms of helping other companies go through a digital transformation process, we have training systems. We have different training strategies for companies to help them go through this process of strategic decision-making when it comes to taking advantage of digital platforms and exponential technologies to make better decisions. We are joining forces with some great Mexican companies, and together with GIN Group, we will conduct trainings for companies in terms of strategies for digital transformation. We will also work on our social project, Digital Villages. In 2019, we started two digital villages in the state of Guanajuato. We are pleased with the mid-term results, as the communities that we had been working with went from 31% digital maturity in February 2019 to 52% in May 2019. In October, we begin the third segment of the training, which involves students and university teachers training micro businesses in the community. We expect to reach 70% digital maturity by the end of 2020. That has led us to start training more digital villages in Jalisco, Sonora, Puebla, Chiapas, and Querétaro. Then, we will start promoting two main platforms from Alibaba. We are not here to compete with the local platforms selling products in Mexico; we are here to help expand the options for Mexicans. Alibaba.com is our first platform; it is the biggest B2B marketplace in the world, and most of our buyers on Alibaba.com are in the US. It is a great opportunity for Mexican companies that do not know this platform to reach buyers from not only the US but also Russia, Malaysia, and Chile. We operate in over 190 countries and have about 20 million buyers going to our website every time looking for products. We want to give Mexican producers that opportunity to put their products on the platform and start selling to the world. We take care of not only their onboarding service but also creating their mini site. The last one is helping Mexican companies use e-commerce to tap into the Chinese consumer market. 2020 was the first time China surpassed the US and officially became the largest consumer market in the world. Alibaba.com has four cross-border e-commerce platforms that are B2C, straight to consumers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main opportunities for trade between the US and Mexico currently?</h4><p>In 2020, the USMCA agreement entered into effect, strengthening the capacity of Mexican companies to export. Thanks to this new agreement, certain activities and industries will be reinforced, and the agreement will improve the capacities and capabilities of companies and positively benefit the workforce. All that brought excellent results in 3Q and 4Q2020 and continued in 2021. The proximity of Mexico to the US and Canadian markets will help our exports and the economy to recover; however, such recovery will depend on the evolution of the pandemic.</p><h4>What stance do you expect Joe Biden to have when it comes to manufacturing in Mexico?</h4><p>The Biden administration has a clear idea of what to do in this situation. It wants large corporations and organizations to expand US trade not only to Mexico and Canada but everywhere. It needs to bring in parts that are produced and imported from other countries, and given the relevant position of Mexico geographically, large corporations understand that the best location for investment and new manufacturing plants for spare parts is Mexico. Here, on the border we have the ability to develop small cities that can produce such products, and that is beneficial to the US, as it means lower manufacturing costs, so it will not lose its trading opportunities.</p><h4>What do you consider to be your biggest achievements in 2020?</h4><p>We were part of different events with other chambers, since we are closely related to all of them in Mexico. We were a part of the discussion groups in different sectors of the economy and helped our members understand the emerging difficulties that the pandemic brought and the initial alternative solutions or actions that were taken.</p><h4>What main opportunities for trade do you see between the US and Mexico?</h4><p>For some years now, we have been working to help small and medium-sized Mexican companies to partner with US companies. In Washington, I learned that the US government has been working on supporting minorities for many years such as Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanics, Europeans, and Asian Americans. The distribution and structuring of the labor force in the US is relevant because many Latin Americans, particularly Mexicans, live in the US. There are more than 40 million Hispanic, with Mexicans comprising over 30 million, the largest minority group there. The US government has created programs to support Hispanic companies to grow, pay taxes, and develop their companies. It provides special treatment to small companies that supply the federal and state governments, as well as large corporations, activity that is extremely relevant given the important participation reached by Hispanics and their companies in the US GDP.</p><h4>Do you see a big opportunity for SMEs in Mexico to enter the US market and find government support?</h4><p>We need to differentiate Mexican SMEs that are already in export markets such as auto parts, aerospace, and other industries. Those companies have been doing a great job given the relationship and confidence of US, Canadian, and other countries. The complementarity and manufacturing responsibility of their activities is extremely relevant for the success of such companies, representing added value in the integration chain of different industries and products. Referring to the niche of smaller trading companies, we have seen many young entrepreneurs trying to enter the US to develop partnerships with companies there to take advantage of such new opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main projects that the state is currently developing?</h4><p>The most important aspect is infrastructure projects, as today we have more than 100 infrastructure projects in the state for MXN3,500 million and around MXN10,000 million in government infrastructure projects, especially the Inter Oceanic corridor and three highways: one that connects Oaxaca to the coast; one that connects Oaxaca to the east; and one that connects both oceans. We are also building public goods infrastructure like a new transport system for the city of Oaxaca in the metropolitan area. Also, regionally speaking, we are building important regional highways on the coast and renovating markets. We have been able to renovate more than 31 and are moving forward with new markets. Also, we are doing projects in public services like water, sewage, and electricity, which are all extremely important for our state. This is now the fourth year of growth that we have been able to sustain. In 2020 this is especially important as the economy is projected to contract by perhaps 10%, meaning there are only six states growing this year. One of them is Oaxaca because of all this infrastructure we are generating. Now that our policies on the pandemic are more controlled, the second part of the plan is our tourism sector, which is extremely sensitive to changes in the economy. Now that we have a yellow rating for the pandemic, we were able to generate a 60% occupancy rate in our hotels during the last Day of the Dead. We hope to maintain this level of growth. Moving forward, Oaxaca will be able to be extremely strong in tourism. Two important media operators focused on tourism and recognized Oaxaca as the best place in the world to visit for travel and leisure, which gives us excellent momentum. We have been able to push forward some great media coverage through important brand names such as Netflix and others to develop a worldwide Oaxaca brand.</p><h4>What challenges did you face positioning the state of Oaxaca as a magnet for investment?</h4><p>We lacked a platform to maintain a level of growth in the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors and subsequently established an action plan to strengthen those three areas. For example, in the primary sector, which is agriculture, this year we will complete our first agro park and consolidate two new plants to export different foods like limes, milk, and mangoes, where Mexico is the top producer but was not generating added value. We are now generating the added value so that we will be able to export. In the secondary sector, which is the most important for us right now, the Inter Oceanic corridor will not only change Oaxaca and the south of Mexico but will be a world player; it is more than a canal. Many try to compare this project to the Panama Canal, but that is only one line of business. The most important part is that we will have a value-added industrial corridor, which is its most important competitive and comparative advantage compared to other corridors in this hemisphere. Other advantages include connectivity, which is why we are building these two highways, and we also have two airports in the region. Then, there is energy; the most important element here is that natural gas has arrived. Another big element is the special economic zones, which are areas of around more than 100ha that will have fiscal and regulatory benefits. If we include Mexico's 11 international treaties, then we clearly have the right stuff to have an advantage, commercially speaking, in addition to the fiscal and regulatory advantages.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have helped to increase the trade balance between Israel and Mexico to USD700 million?</h4><p>There has been a diplomatic relationship between Israel and Mexico since 1952, and this year we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the signing of a FTA between Israel and Mexico. The FTA not only resolves some regulatory issues, but also lowers customs tariffs for specific products between Israel and Mexico. This is the reason why, in 2019, there was USD781 million in trade between Israel and Mexico. Mexico mainly exports electronic machinery, chemicals, rubber, and plastic to Israel and imports mostly machinery, optics, and medical equipment from it. Although USD781 million is a fairly high figure, there is still huge potential to increase it further. We can easily cross the USD800-million limit even though COVID-19 has been fairly rough for both countries.</p><h4>What strategies and initiatives are you employing as the head of this mission to incentivize more trade between the two countries?</h4><p>The Israel commercial mission to Mexico is divided into different sectors. We are focusing not only on traditional sectors such as agriculture or water, but also on more advanced sectors such as cyber, retail, and homeland security. At the commercial office, we have four trade officers, each one focused on different sectors. Our main goal is to connect Israeli and Mexican companies commercially. We bring delegations to and from Mexico and facilitate B2B meetings in different conferences, not only in Mexico but also worldwide. For example, in October, we participated in the Agroalimentaria EXPO in Zacatecas. In 2021, we plan to focus not only on traditional sectors such as mining, agriculture, and water, but also on more advanced sectors.</p><h4>What are Israel's economic strengths when it comes to collaborating with Mexico?</h4><p>There are a few Israeli companies operating in Mexico and vice versa, for example, ODIS in Baja California, Rivolis in Sinaloa, NETAFIM in Jalisco, MER in CDMX, and so on. One of the main advantages that Israel has is in the high-tech field. For example, cybersecurity is a booming sector in Israel, as is fintech. A high number of Mexican companies, from different sectors are reaching out to us so on a regular basis, so we will scout the relevant technologies for them. For example, there is definitely huge potential in cyber. Mexico suffers from a high number of cyber attacks, and Israeli technology can be of great help.</p><h4>How are you adapting your mission objectives as head of this mission considering that 2020 was a challenging year?</h4><p>Our main objective is to show Israeli companies that Mexico is not only a place where one can come for a holiday. Mexico City specifically is one of the biggest hubs that is open to the whole world. There is so much potential and talent here. Our other objective is to expand the different sectors that we are dealing with to feature not only traditional ones, but also the more advanced ones. So far, my team and I are doing a great job because we are fully connected to all the biggest companies and conglomerates that operate in Mexico. We also cooperate well with the federal government and different state governments. What makes Mexico so unique is not only its geographical location between South and North America, but also the different needs of each state within Mexico. For example, in the north there is a need for water solutions while in the south there is a need for agricultural solutions. Mexico City requires more fintech solutions. Each state has a different need, and we are trying to provide those types of solutions or collaborations as much as possible.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the secretary adapted to having to teach classes virtually?</h4><p>The state made the decision to suspend activities in March 2020 as a result of COVID-19. We had two to three days to prepare ourselves and start working in this modality. The entire educational community does not have access to virtual platforms and online work, and we have different groups working on different platforms. Some, particularly in basic and upper secondary education, work through television as a support. A small part of the population does not have access to platforms and television, and we had to generate printed materials for them that was sent to the communities where our students live. Our first point was understanding how we would organize ourselves to serve the 11,000-plus schools that make up our educational system at these levels. The second action was generating a guide on how to carry out activities in our operation as an organization, as well as in our educational work. We then developed a close partnership with Microsoft and Google, which provided us with great support. In general, it has been a great effort from institutions, teachers, and parents. However, we have not fully switched to a digital model yet, as less than half of our student and teacher population have the conditions to work this way. We are working in a mixed system, which is why we call it distance learning.</p><h4>What are your priorities for the short term?</h4><p>For the coming months, in which we assume we will remain in social isolation, we will continue with these mechanisms. One of them, for example, was the creation of booklets for children without access to technology. These booklets offer one-week work projects in which different subjects and areas are integrated in such a way that children visualize learning in a holistic way. After the end of the previous academic year, given the excellent response, we are producing similar booklets for students, and we will add interactive elements. We are updating them so they can also be used by those students with access to ICT as well. We will also continue to strengthen our relationship with both large companies and small ones to obtain materials that allow us to strengthen education. We will seek to achieve the best possible learning, but with an orientation that differentiates essential learning. We are selecting tried-and-tested learning to be taught so that students can continue advancing on their academic journeys.</p><h4>What type of companies are you looking to collaborate with?</h4><p>We are currently working with companies that provide us with platforms or training for teachers on some topics, but using existing platforms. We remain open to the possibility of educational materials for teachers and students. In this period, in the particular case of higher education, there was already a virtual classroom in which some subjects were fully developed. Another aspect to highlight during this period is that we concentrated in what we call the “common core of training" of all those institutions that impart engineering knowledge, in such a way that we have material that will be useful for many careers. Through these digital subjects, all engineering students can start their “common core of training" studies 100% online. This gives them an advantage in several ways. First, they already have access to their class materials and have no reason to slow down their learning. Second, it conditions them to work autonomously and that requires significant development of self-control skills. They also learn to take advantage of the digital materials available to them around the world. We also surveyed the feedback of community members, which makes it possible to significantly condition our achievements. Thus, we realized the platforms we developed and the material we delivered were highly received, especially by teachers. On the traditional scale of one to 10, they received scores between eight and 10, with 76% for the printed booklets, 66% for the academic guidance guides, and 44% for the learning-at-home strategy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What actions and strategies have you been implementing to reactivate Guatemala's economy and minimize the impact of the pandemic?</h4><p>Guatemala's central government and congress have given us money via central bank bonds to reactivate the economy during the pandemic. Some were for loans for SMEs, and others were to help people with their electricity bills and other basic needs to get through the pandemic. The Ministry of Economy was in charge of disbursing GTQ2 billion (USD256 million) to people with regulated jobs in the market, and we already finished allocating that money.</p><h4>What initiatives is the government implementing to strengthen Guatemala's commercial relationship with Mexico?</h4><p>The double taxation law is one of them. Guatemala and Mexico have been partners for such a long time that we want more products from Mexico than from any other Central American country. Four out of every 10 products imported from Mexico in the region are purchased in Guatemala. Our country also serves as a transit point for Mexican products, meaning our economies are intertwined to a level where we can both benefit. Furthermore, Guatemala can supply raw materials as well as finished products to Mexico faster than any other country in the region. We offer products that have been well accepted in the Mexican market, such as palm oil, natural rubber, frozen shrimp, and sugar confectioneries, among other goods. Our government is also aware we need to improve logistics and infrastructure. This is why we are taking the above measures.</p><h4>What would be your advice to Mexican companies looking to enter the Guatemalan market and/or use the country as the gateway to the Central American region?</h4><p>There are opportunities for both Mexican and Guatemalan companies. Medical supplies and the pharmaceuticals sector represent a great opportunity to explore. According to Euromonitor International, fresh food as an industry will see higher growth this year. It is, therefore, important that both countries explore the opportunities for companies in the food sector. There is also interest in the construction sector, because Mexican companies are larger than Guatemalan ones and have more experience in building the infrastructure that Mexico has had for many years.</p><h4>In 2013, an FTA was signed between Central America and Mexico. What have been the main achievements of this agreement so far in terms of Guatemala and Mexico?</h4><p>Both our governments need to make slightly more effort under this agreement to be consistent, given this relates to the economies of neighboring countries. The south of Mexico can benefit heavily alongside Guatemala because we not only have a common border, but the people are also similar. Mexico being a federation, we can go directly to the governments of southern Mexican states to create commerce between the state governments and the Guatemalan government. This is one of the ideas—we want to develop our country as well as those southern Mexican states that have not been developed, unlike Mexico's northern states. We want to be part of that development trend set out by the Mexican president.</p><h4>Are there opportunities to create integrated supply chains between Mexico and Guatemala?</h4><p>Guatemalan President Giammattei has been clear that he wants to promote a “prosperity wall"—if our countries are prosperous, and people can find a job and build a house, they will want to stay. We want to create that prosperity on the southern Mexican-northern Guatemalan border. That will likely not happen in the short term; however, for the medium term, that is the joint plan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In February 2021, and after 25 years at Xerox, you took office as president of Xerox Spain. What have been the main initiatives carried out since you became president?</h4><p>When the company put me forward for the position, I was incredibly proud because I started off as a salesperson and had finally made it to the top. The pandemic has served as an additional motivation for me, because it is a challenge. Moreover, Spain is full of opportunities, and that is something that Spaniards have to believe in. I have three main objectives as president. The first is to grow the company in Spain. I want to continue doing what we have always done, but, at the same time, innovate. We have a powerful digitalization and content management offer, and not many customers know about it. The second objective is diversity and inclusion. Our first CEO, Anne Mulcahy, brought about tremendous change to our company culture and the way we work. The program is not only focused on gender inclusion, but also all forms of diversity, including religious and cultural. Finally, we have the sustainability issue, which is a matter of social responsibility. During the pandemic, many companies did not know how to act, but the need to help soon arose. We started to manufacture respirators and masks. We started this because of the pandemic, but we also wanted to assist developing countries.</p><h4>What do you think your customer base in Spain does not know about your digitalization services?</h4><p>We have an extensive product portfolio, and we try to communicate all this to the market. We have brought digital transformation to our clients. When, overnight, the lockdown started, and we had to stay at home, CEOs realized this digital transformation was imperative. That is where we have seen a full acceleration. In fact, things that we have invented for ourselves have been purchased by our customers.</p><h4>Xerox is known for its printing systems, though it has other business areas such as Xerox Financial Services, Xerox Business Solutions, cloud, and more. Throughout the pandemic, the company decided to further diversify the business. Can you elaborate more on this?</h4><p>We have three main lines that are part of what I call innovation. The first is software. We already had software, but when you come from a traditional company that sells services, it is hard to develop it. The company has decided to acquire CareAR, an augmented reality platform. Another of these lines is the financial services company, which has been a great advantage for us. At first, it was only for Xerox products, but now we have seen a business opportunity to finance third-party products. It may not seem that innovative, though compared to other companies in the industry, it is. The last line is PARC, which we have always been with. It stopped for a while, but now it has been reactivated.</p><h4>One of Xerox Spain's objective is to increase its market share in the office segment from 5% to 7% and launch the commercialization of the company's 3D printers, which to date were not in Europe. What strategy will you follow to bridge that 2% gap?</h4><p>For me, an important indicator is market share, because it is objective data. With all the data we have, a worldwide survey was done with companies of all sizes. In all cases, with a percentage of 80%, the CEOs of these companies say we will not return to working in an office like we used to. There will be a hybrid way of working, and, from our point of view, it is here to stay. Therefore, the security issue is key, and we have all the equipment and services we are offering in the cloud. This provides the flexibility of being able to access that information from anywhere, at any time, and with security. The same goes for the issue of apps. We are doing all this because we understand that moving forward the workplace will be hybrid.</p><h4>We have talked a lot about the Next Generation funds and digitalizing the Spanish economy. How do you evaluate these European funds as an opportunity for you?</h4><p>We know the graphic arts sector, and we are noticing it more there. Our customers in this sector are moving away from traditional offset printing to digital printing, and that is where European subsidies are being invested. I have not seen it yet in offices, though it does not mean it will not happen. In the insurance sector, we are very well positioned, and it is a sector that is undergoing a significant transformation process. Before, we did all the printing of insurances and policies. Now, there is a digital transformation movement, and we are also doing that. We are not only in the physical part but also in the digital part. We create a series of tickets for customers. The customer experience when buying insurance is especially important, so we do that part of onboarding in a digital way as well. Furthermore, many of the major insurance companies work with us.</p><h4>What are Xerox's main objectives for 2022?</h4><p>One of our objectives is to continue growing, not only with turnovers but also in profits. In order to do that, we know we have to transform our business model. We will do this through the new lines of business mentioned earlier to achieve growth and cover the gap that comes from other lines that will not bring in much revenues. Another objective is to expand services and software beyond printing in large and medium-sized companies. And, finally, we plan to focus on the diversity and sustainability issue, because this is another way to grow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>As a company specialized in the luxury real estate segment in Mallorca, what is your assessment of current market sentiment and the appetite of foreigners for properties in Mallorca?</strong><br />After the lockdown due to the COVID-19, Mallorca experienced a huge increase in demand for luxury properties. Indeed, most of the properties ready to move into in the luxury segment have been sold. The huge increase in demand has seen a related rise in prices, and we expect to continue to see this appetite from foreigners. The pandemic has shown that homes are more important than ever before, and many people have realized they can work from anywhere. Home office is a reality, and it will be difficult to return to where we were in term of office-based employment. In this regard, Mallorca has some of the best weather in Europe, is a one-to-two-hour flight from every major European city, its infrastructure meets European standards, and its schools and hospitals are also excellent. Many are questioning the logic of returning to their busy and colder countries. Germans, in particular, are ramping up their investments in Mallorca. Scandinavians are also still keen on investing here. The English were the first to arrive to Mallorca and this year it seems that the desire to invest in Mallorca has reactivated. The price of housing has risen 45% in 5 years in the Balearic Islands, the highest increase in the entire country. The price of finished housing (new and used) rose in the Balearic Islands by 9.3% during this year, leading this indicator at the state level. The strong local and international demand explains this upward trend in prices in Mallorca and the rest of the islands. Compared to 2019, the year used as a reference because it was before the pandemic, prices increased by 7% after some moderation in growth began. The savings of private households, the confidence of consumers and the new housing needs discovered during the confinement have boosted the demand, mostly for the purpose of use, although there is also a professionalized demand, attracted by the profitability of housing compared to other financial products. My estimate is that we will still have a buoyant market for some time.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas on the island can have the highest yields taking into consideration the transition toward a more sustainable tourism business in the island?</strong><br />The island is extremely conscious of environmental responsibility. We know the beauty of this island, and the Majorcan people really love their &ldquo;rock," so there is a collective effort to keep it as sustainable as possible. The more mature areas where tourism started, Magaluf and Arenal, have already changed. The government is working to respond to the massive tourism demand by upgrading hotels. There are many incentives to achieve those upgrades. In terms of construction, there are more restrictions on volumes, building height, and types of property that can be built, while there are numerous areas under high protection. The Tramuntana mountain range is a world heritage site. Primary shoreline plots have many restrictions in place, while rustic areas now have a halved area available for construction. The areas that hold the most potential are those in the interior of the island. In the past, Majorcan people lived in the center of the island, while the coastal areas were left for hotel development. Right now, the potential is for a return to the center. People looking for a sustainable experience would go for country homes and rural hotels. Mallorca cannot compete with other areas in terms of urban or costal hotels, though it does have the best rural hotels. The lack of plots along the coast and the need for more space identified since the pandemic will spur the development of the rural luxury home market as well as homes that are eco-friendlier as well.</p>
<p><strong>MallorcaSite.com has become a reference site for properties on the island. How can the site help map opportunities for investment?</strong><br />We launched the website because the real estate market was an important sector on the island, though the service that was being provided by large and small players was not adequate for the new clients. That is why we started MallorcaSite.com. The most important thing when arriving in a new destination is to understand what it offers. And Mallorca has many things. There are 22 golf courses, 24 ports, and many international and local schools, and the city is highly cosmopolitan and rich in culture. We have residents from many parts of the world. MallorcaSite.com captures that sense of variety in Mallorca, while being specifically design for foreign investors in Mallorca. The site has a wide variety of properties for sale online. Clients can check online and do their searches, save their properties, and identify their favorites. We have a login offering access to a greater number of properties only available to registered clients. This first contact when considering to invest in Mallorca's real estate is then complemented by our property consultants. We want clients to contact us, and we do customized recommendations for them.</p>
<p><strong>How do you work to support the journey of foreigners investing in Mallorca's property market, and what are some of the main considerations when doing so?</strong><br />We are experts in finding property. However, when the client does not know exactly what they are looking for, or indeed what the island can offer, we give a first overall idea of what the island is like by area or property type. We first show them the island and the opportunities that exist, including rural properties, areas along the coast, and real estate assets. And where the property exists, a perfect match can be made. If it does not exist, it can be created by our team of collaborators such as architects, interior designers, builders, and so on. These partners are vital in terms of offering a tailor-made service for real estate investors. We are the point of contact on the island for these foreign investors, and our goal is to simplify their experience. We have around 800 properties online, but a number of properties reserved for registered clients are more exclusive in nature.</p>
<p><strong>What is your concluding message on the benefits of investing in Mallorca's real estate?</strong><br />Mallorca offers a quality of life that one can find in few places in the world. There are many people who want to retire in Mallorca. We are extremely fortunate because we already live in Mallorca. Besides, investing in Mallorca's real estate market is a secure choice. This market has considerable growth potential remaining, and we are here to assist the investor as it always pays to be well advised.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>stc pay graduated from SAMA's sandbox relatively recently, one of only two fintech firms to do so. What allowed you to excel in this process and move to market quickly?</h4><p>As part of stc pay's vision and commitment to be the leading regional operator in the field of fin-tech, we started looking at the service's road map a few years ago. We saw many complexities in the financial sector and not enough focus on the actual customer journey map as one of the ma-jor factors in achieving this vision. We believe that we should go back to the basics, offering simplicity, security, and convenience to our customers and injecting that into our services, starting from the design phase moving into the strategy. We believe that everyone should “simply take control" of their financials, whenever, wherever they are, as we are a group of passionate professionals and tech savvy individuals who can overcome all kinds of challenges and obstacles, do not accept traditional solutions, and seek innovation and only that. We believe nothing is impossible to create the future we want, and that is key to excel, lead the industry and persevere when it gets really tough. You have to have much passion in order to succeed. The second thing is SAMA's blessings in launching the Fin-Tech Saudi initiative, which aims to support the financial technology ecosystem by transforming Saudi Arabia into a fintech hub that harbors a flourishing and proficient ecosystem including banks, investors, companies, universities, and government agencies in a manner that promotes financial inclusion and increase electronic transactions.</p><h4>What was your experience throughout the pandemic? How did you react initially, and what patterns have you seen in spending and data since it began?</h4><p>Today, Saudi Arabia is notably more advanced than any country in the region or globally in the payments sector. It has the infrastructure, and the government had already started e-government before the coronavirus pandemic. For many activities, the base was already there, and all we needed was a trigger to promote it, get people to start using it, and build their confidence in it. After months of lock-down and social distancing as a result of COVID-19, consumers were forced to pay differently around the world and across sectors, fully relying on online and cash-less payments for everything from hand sanitizer to daily needs supplies, pushing toward a cashless society. As we are a fully digital platform that came to remove hassles and provide digital wheels of financial controls, we were ready for such a pandemic. Our product has no mediator and offers directly to customers through digital solutions.</p><h4>There have been many regulatory changes to create this playing field and a space for you to grow. How will these changes drive or change your business in 2021?</h4><p>We appreciate the central bank's work to change regulations to accommodate different activities and open doors for every-one to grow in the ecosystem. The instant payment system (IPS) introduction will significantly change the ecosystem and positively affect our growth stage. I am pleased to report that we are growing by triple digits to date and confirm that the trend will continue. stc pay will continue to add different products and services that people have been anticipating for years, with easy and instant methods. We are a customer-centric, data-driven company that uses data to predict customers' pace and needs. This is precisely why stc pay claims to create a difference in people's lives and add convenient financial services. We view 2021 as a promising year. The energy and passion from the team, the people around us, the company, and the shareholders are what drives us forward towards a brighter future and help us reach where we are today. The expectations are astonishingly high, and we plan to surpass them.</p><h4>Why do you think your transactions doubled after the introduction of the IPS Sarie?</h4><p>It is a network effect. Sarie came with an IPS system that significantly boosted the ecosystem and will continue to do so. It used to take us a week to transfer money internationally. When IPS and Sarie system launched as part of SAMA-led initiatives series to promote the national payments' ecosystem and to enhance its infrastructure and achieve financial inclusion, people realized the importance of instant, easy, and cashless payments, which translated into transaction increases.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your expectations and motivations as the new CEO of Sidra Medicine?</h4><p>My main motivation is the vision of the chairperson Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser for Sidra Medicine, which she has passionately supported to improve the health and quality of life of women and children in Qatar and elsewhere. I am also motivated by Sidra Medicine's strong genetic research program, which is based on precision medicine. I have worked in fairly high-intensity hospitals before, but this is the first place where if our clinicians propose that genes could be the reason for a malformation or disease, they can bring their hypotheses to our researchers who will research the genes. The researchers then come back with the required knowledge, and we can design a specific medical treatment for that specific genetic change. This is unique. I do not know of many hospitals in the world that can do that in-house, and it is exciting to say the least. It will bring us to the forefront of helping treat and care for children not only in Qatar but also the wider MENA region.</p><h4>How does Sidra Medicine fit into the strategy of Qatar for preventative healthcare and improving the tertiary system?</h4><p>There many examples of how Sidra Medicine is contributing to this end, as we are a key partner of the Qatar Genome Program and right now we have 25,000-30,000 Qatari full genomes in our data bank, which is a wealth of information to study and research. This will ultimately improve the lives of children with different genetic diseases and their transition to adulthood. Because of our precision medicine program, our approach to care starts early and can contribute to the population's health and preventive care. One prominent aspect is how we approach diseases such as diabetes, which is prevalent in Qatar and the Gulf. Diabetes can affect anyone, though there is also the added risk for children who may develop the disease due to genetic reasons. Sidra Medicine seeks to take a preventative approach to this in many of its pediatric patients before they actually become diabetic by improving lifestyle issues early on so that they can counteract the negative balance of genetic backgrounds. We also work closely with the families in this journey of care. In addition, Sidra Medicine is the main specialist hospital for children in Qatar and provides advanced tertiary care services. This covers a broad spectrum from NICU, plastics and craniofacial, neurosurgery, epilepsy, nephrology, oncology and much more. Our surgeons, nurses and allied health teams are highly qualified and take a multidisciplinary approach to care for our patients and their families. For example, our epilepsy treatment program, is advanced and of one of the leading in the Middle East, as is our Heart Center. Because of our ground-breaking and pioneering work, we have made it possible for many children to lead normal lives instead of being set back by their disease or mobility challenges.</p><h4>How is the hospital raising awareness of a healthier lifestyle?</h4><p>When it comes to women, Sidra Medicine is still at an early stage regarding holistic women's healthcare, which is a central part of Her Highness's vision. I am a gynecologist by training, so I have been working with women all my life; however, our work is not limited to obstetrics and gynecology. Sidra offers high quality maternity care including advanced neonatal care, if so needed. We are now in a planning mode to not only look at pregnancy, but many areas of women's health throughout life, for example osteoporosis, which is prevalent here, and other painful skeletal changes during the later years in life. Other prevalent health issue are hormonal changes, both during adolescence and menopause, but also metabolic disease and malfunctioning thyroid. This holistic, one-stop approach can change not only the health, well-being, and living conditions of women but also their entire family and children, who will bring that into the next generation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does digital transformation mean for MEEZA, and how will the concept evolve after COVID-19?</h4><p>Digital transformation to us means a combination of technology, governance, and human capital. Technology is probably the easiest to tackle. However, when it comes to governance, this means user-related processes that have to adjust to keep up with the advancement of technology. These are generally intertwined with corporate cultures, and it is usually hard to change corporate culture, especially when trying to keep up with the rapid pace of digital transformation. However, some of the main challenges have been access to the skillset, know-how, and the hefty budget requirements that are part of any digital transformation journey. This is where MEEZA offers an advantage to many of our clients, updating their skills set and making sure their staff can keep up with these new systems, especially now with more specialized technology like AI, blockchain, and robotic process automation. With the advent of COVID-19, digital transformation has suddenly become a must have, must do overnight. MEEZA is able to lead and offer this complex web of digital transformation dependencies in the form of a monthly rendered service to our clients. We not only accelerate our clients' migration toward that digital future but also the country's own digital agenda.</p><h4>What solutions and services will experience the largest demand growth in the medium term in Qatar and for what reasons?</h4><p>In the short term, jumping onto quick conferencing and collaboration tools is something that every business and entity in Qatar needed. However, in the medium to long term, we expect a maturity in the offerings of collaboration conferencing digital facilities, with a greater focus on the security of these services, namely how to encrypt and store all the communication being shared and collaborated upon. How can businesses mine all the data being exchanged so they can transform data into information and then information into business intelligence or governance intelligence. That is where the mid- to long-term growth will be: in data analytics and the security of all the data being digitally exchanged.</p><h4>How will MEEZA's fourth data center in Doha impact Qatar?</h4><p>In general, Qatar has been experiencing a drastic migration toward digital services in the last four to five years, and this has been accelerated with the arrival of Tier-1 hyperscalers in Qatar. Before, we were talking about front office-type cloud applications and some minimal cloud collaboration tools. Now, with the arrival of hyperscalers, we are talking about complex analytics tools and data platforms that are served right here in Qatar from our public cloud. This is partially one of the reasons why MEEZA is building and continuing to build more leading data centers in the country. The same demand here in Qatar can be witnessed throughout the world, whereby hyperscalers continue to rely on companies such as MEEZA to build and operate their infrastructure so they can deliver more smart cloud computing services faster to their clients. This becomes even-more evident when we discuss the fourth industrial revolution services such as the Internet of Things, AI, 5G, and so on.</p><h4>How does MEEZA collaborate with key players in every sector to offer industry-specific solutions in Qatar?</h4><p>MEEZA continues to build a leading ecosystem of market players to help them verticalize their offerings. This means MEEZA has been able to deliver digital and smart solutions into industries such as education and healthcare, tapping into the reach and global know-how of Tier 1 partners. This maps directly to Qatar's National Vision 2030 whereby education and healthcare continue to play an important part of the agenda. In addition to economic growth, pioneering IT service providers like MEEZA accelerate the government's objective of digitally industrializing society and the different industries within the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights for Ezdan Real Estate in recent years, and how do you expect the real estate environment to evolve in 2021?</h4><p>In 2019 and early 2020, we saw our occupancy level steadily grow. We were able to overcome all the challenges encountered in 2020 and adapt to the dynamics of the markets, thanks to a business model that has been pliable to satisfy different types of clients. When someone thinks of embarking on a new business in Qatar, one of the main variables to consider is commercial and residential property costs, as well as location convenience. Therefore, we operate in a strategic sector that will support growth and diversification in 2021.</p><h4>How will your client base evolve in the medium term?</h4><p>Ezdan has always been a reliable partner for different entities from the public and private sectors. Our business relationship with our partners is perfectly stable, so we expect stability in our clientele base. However, if our capacity allows us to admit new clients, we will try to do so. We adopt a rosier prospectus about the biennium 2020 and 2021, so we will most likely start working with new clients. The 2022 FIFA World Cup preparation works are some of the factors to consider for this bullish outlook.</p><h4>How will the 2022 FIFA World Cup impact the real estate sector in Qatar?</h4><p>Once the World Cup is over, we will be left with amazing and well-established infrastructure, as well as great business opportunities. Many people aspire to see the organizing country first-hand and see how advanced we are in terms of housing options, hotels, and so on. All these factors give us a great opportunity. Moreover, with the possibility of 100% ownership by expats recently approved, this stimulus will be enhanced to its full potential. On the long run, there will not be a real estate oversupply problem caused by the World Cup. As in every economy, there will be cycles but not a structural oversupply. Two thirds of our efforts and dedication are designated to certain tranche of the market, the middle and lower classes, so unlikely we can suffer a potential luxury market oversupply.</p><h4>How unique are the properties you manage in terms of Qatari culture and heritage, and how does Ezdan mix them with the modern aspect of Doha?</h4><p>Our buildings feature the genuine Qatari identity from A to Z and is etched and incorporated from the very earlier stages. We have down-to-earth, beautiful spaces for families to live in, with gardens and Qatari architecture playing a relevant role. Our business model focuses mainly on small villages, where such architecture is more appreciated than in central Doha. We operate buildings in around 25 villages, and they symbolize the Qatari legacy coupled with all meanings of fraternity, compatriotism and huddling. There are no superstructure buildings, and the decor and landscape provide a cozier ambience. We have buildings in Doha that mimic the city's modern style, but most of our portfolio is focused on villages.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for the next two years?</h4><p>Our company is mainly concerned with securing the current supply and how it fits the market. We also have some projects docketed in the pipeline. For example, Ezdan Oasis comprises 9,500 residential and commercial units. The launched stage of this project so far in the market has been extremely successful and is over- leased. Nevertheless, the project is fully established, and we plan to launch phase two in the next two years. In the future, we will release further phases to meet the demand from the World Cup. We have almost 30,000 units, which is putting Ezdan in a unique position compared to other developers in the market when it comes to meet regular and circumstantial demand. We also have more products in the offing waiting to be released at the most suitable moment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main highlights of 2019 and the first half of 2020?</h4><p>There were a few highlights during this period, significantly two major milestones: being awarded Construction Consultancy of the Year 2019 for the Middle East and bringing together all the international independent Northcroft branches to establish the Northcroft International Group, which has over 15 offices throughout Asia, Australia, and Europe. Following these achievements, we focused on our growth strategy for the next two to three years, though unfortunately we were impacted by COVID-19 at the start of 2020. While presenting a unique set of challenges, we are focusing on the positive benefits and opportunities that the situation has created for the construction industry. We experienced exponential growth in the demand for our expert commercial claims and dispute resolution services.</p><h4>What will be the state of the construction market after the wave of infrastructure projects we are currently witnessing is over?</h4><p>Lately, there have been many major projects coming to fruition within Qatar, specifically in connection with the Doha metro and rail, the airport and ports expansion, the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the gas sector and many more. These have a lasting positive and beneficial effect on Qatar as a whole, all of which has been inspired by the wise leadership and vision of Qatar's leaders. The involvement of larger international contracting companies and international consultancies has provided local companies with exposure to joint ventures, complex and risky projects and sometimes very challenging circumstances, an experience which sets the precedent and has laid the foundations for local companies to operate independently with confidence and experience as we rapidly approach 2022. Qatar has proudly developed a core expertise in infrastructure works, and after 2022, the country will continue to benefit from the local construction sector experience and focus on the 2030 vision, ultimately the continued enhancement of Qatar's superior infrastructure and development. Qatar has proven its ability to adapt and now has an enviable world-class built environment that will continue to develop for the foreseeable future.</p><h4>How do your different divisions cooperate on projects to maximize value proposition for your customers?</h4><p>Northcroft Middle East's expertise lies not only with its ability to engage at an early design stage but has developed its business units and services to encompass all pre-contract and post-contract services, post contract commercial and contractual management, claims and dispute resolution and project management. Regardless of the stage of the project, our expertise enables us to work alongside architects and designers, with the ability to provide pre-concept design estimates, and as the design matures we mature the estimates with detailed bills of quantities. It is here that we are able to leverage our market knowledge and experience and utilize our cost database to provide a degree of certainty for the client and project team for the contract price. The development of the tender documents, oversight of the tender phase, and commercial evaluation and recommendations to the client is a natural progression. Our post contract team then provide the drafting of contract agreements, commercial management, and contract administration through to the final account settlement. The knowledge, experience and services provided by our internationally sourced, professional team serves to assist our clientele by ensuring that they optimize their project objectives, effectively monitor, and manage project risk events and instigate appropriate claim prevention measures where required. Our team of contract experts provide support and oversight should there be a requirement to assist with the defense of or preparation and submission of a project commercial claim inclusive of dispute resolution assistance. Our business units therefore are competently experienced to provide the whole project life cycle commercial and contractual requirements to protect stakeholder interests and influence the success of the projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are UCC Holding's highlights in 2020, and how have you been preparing for the resumption of activities during Covid-19 time?</h4><p>It was obviously a tough year, but we enjoyed some landmark project wins. We are building two residential projects comprising of tens of thousands of units of accommodation in Al-Wakra, just south of Doha, for Barwa Real Estate. This transforms us from being a contractor of the region's most beautiful buildings, such as THE e18hteen tower in Lusail, to a contractor of whole cities. UCC Holding has also diversified into oil and gas, winning our first work in that sector with Shell Qatar and its liquefied natural gas site in Ras Laffan, 50 miles to the north of Doha. We were named as Qatar's overall country winner at the British Safety Council's International Safety Awards. We adopted that safety-led approach at all levels, from management downward, so we could keep working for our clients and protect our staff throughout the pandemic.</p><h4>What will the market look like once the current big wave of developments is over?</h4><p>We expect plenty more growth after the World Cup, particularly in infrastructure, hospitality, education and healthcare. Qatar is diversifying from its dependence on the oil market as part of Qatar National Vision 2030. Construction will play a huge part in that broadened economy, with major developments confirming Qatar as the new jewel of the Middle East.</p><h4>How do your different companies and divisions cooperate to provide all services within the value chain?</h4><p>We operate as one group, offering specialized services and skills, covering an extensive range of industries. To deliver the best service for our clients, while ensuring competitiveness in a tough marketplace, our companies work together to maximize efficiency. As well as offering cost advantages, this collaborative approach encourages the sharing of new ideas and best practice. Together, we are self-reliant and function as a one-stop shop, where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</p><h4>How will the adoption of digital technologies and innovations improve your environmental footprint in the medium-term?</h4><p>We are a partner of the Lean Construction Institute-Qatar—the first of its kind in the region—and an affiliate member of Gulf Organization for Research and Development. We are implementing Lean thinking across all our companies and workforce, which will minimize waste while maximizing productivity and quality.</p><h4>How do you expect the PPP Law and the new model of cooperation between Qatar's authorities and private companies to boost your participation in the important developments of the country?</h4><p>UCC Holding welcomes the PPP Law—it is a step towards deepening the economic diversification in Qatar and an important growth area for the company. The new law will free up development land, attract the private investment we need to maintain Qatar's economic momentum, and foster a spirit of partnership that will see risk and reward shared between the contractor and the state.</p><h4>What are the strategic priorities of UCC Holding for 2021?</h4><p>We are focused and determined to build on our recent successes in 2021. Across our companies, we will concentrate on delivering with quality, efficiency, and a renewed focus to address some project backlogs stemming from the pandemic delays. The requirement for health and safety excellence, further intensified by the pandemic, will remain a priority across all our project sites. We are looking to expand locally in oil and gas and secure some more international projects, particularly in Africa. Projects relating to the great expansion of tourism, education, and real estate will continue to dominate the construction sector in Qatar, and we are ready to work on them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main milestones for RC Al Mana in 2020?</h4><p>We have been and are still dealing with plans for 2022, because 90% of our work is related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup one way or another. Currently, we are doing Lusail Commercial Boulevard, which is one of the major developments as it will be the fan zone area for the World Cup. We are also building five FIFA hotels that will accommodate fans, players, and staff. Apart from the World Cup, we have another project that is extremely important; it is a QAR1-billion project and will be the biggest water park in the region located on Qetaifan Island North; however, the most pressing deadlines come from 2022 projects. We are one of the top players in the local market, so we have to be everywhere beyond 2022. We have a diversified strategy split 50-50 between the public and private sectors, which is important in Qatar. We have residential, commercial, business, and leisure developments. We have done one of the biggest projects in Qatar: the QAR6-billion Doha Oasis with a seven-star hotel, a theme park, and more. We are busy tendering for the future and have many projects that we are pricing right now. We have confidence in Qatar National Vision 2030.</p><h4>How will margins and prices evolve for contractors in the short term?</h4><p>Currently, we have a good margin that will cover us in the next two to three years. In the future, we are looking year by year rather than five years in advance, so we adjust ourselves accordingly. The COVID-19 crisis happened, and we have to deal with it proactively and are constantly adapting. During a crisis, projects must still be delivered; you cannot stop working and wait. Margins fall, but we have a commitment to our clients. We have to solve it internally and have assigned a team to solve all issues arising from the current reality of the market. All airports stopped running in March 2020, and we were supposed to have 3,000-4,000 people coming from India, Nepal, and all over the world to help us with these projects. We had to do local hiring with the subsequent pressure over margins, but we are a market leader and have done fairly well.</p><h4>Will the lifting of the blockade push down margins due to foreign competition?</h4><p>It is slightly different for the construction field. We already have competition from outside companies. The margins will perhaps go down only because there will be limited projects with the required size for our segment, though it is not related to opening the country or the lifting of the blockade. Our country has always been open to good companies regardless of their origin. Perhaps there will be competition in terms of construction materials and other supplies, but we know the government will handle this in the right way and protect local industries. We are not worried. On the contrary, this will help us because we will have more products and suppliers from close by that we did not have before which will help decrease the prices in terms of logistic fees.</p><h4>How have your sustainability efforts evolved in the last 12 months?</h4><p>We now have a full team working on this made up of people with the know-how. Now, we are a partner of Green Building Council Qatar and Lean Construction and pay more attention to sustainability and environmental-friendliness requirements. We are now doing our headquarters, which will be GSAS and LEED certified. We are also working on our business structure and enhancement of our processes. We have also have rebranded our logo in response to the development of the contracting industry in Qatar by bearing in mind sustainability and also to reflect the increasing modernization of today's world, which we wanted to be part of and be integrated into our brand; a fresh start cemented on our strengths will take us forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Qatar Cool's main achievements, and how have you contributed to the 2030 Qatar National Vision?</h4><p>Our main contributions are in the field of energy efficiency; in a fossil fuel-dependent country like Qatar, this is extremely relevant. We have addressed district cooling needs in 100% of the Pearl and 90% of the buildings in West Bay. The entire Pearl is supplied by the largest district cooling plant in the world (130,000 tons of refrigeration). We are amongst the top five largest district cooling companies in the world. Some 70% of the electricity that is generated in the country goes into air conditioning; conventional cooling consumes 1.8kW/TR per tons of refrigerants, whereas district cooling just 0.8kW/TR. However, the challenges we face to increase our market share include the distortion of electricity prices caused by subsidies. Additionally, not being considered a utility brings up many issues, such as high CAPEX and OPEX costs. Being in a country that has not done its share of planning for district cooling makes the installation of the network three to four times more expensive. If we had been considered at the initial urban planning stage as an essential utility, it would have reduced costs quite substantially, which would be reflected in our tariffs. Another challenge is the zoning perspective of district cooling, where consumers must understand and accept us as a mature monopoly. No one can invest in a district cooling area without a guarantee of demand. We are advocating for these concepts in Qatar because we know how beneficial district cooling can be for the country.</p><h4>What are the current regulations governing district cooling in Qatar?</h4><p>There is a lack of understanding regarding how our tariff structure works. Due to the electricity price distortion, we are perceived as expensive. If people were paying genuine prices for electricity, our business would be more viable and seen as moderately rated. There is a regulation on the business' commercial dimension being prepared by a division of Kahramaa. The regulation first came to light a couple of years ago, but we do not know exactly what it entails as of yet. It is said that it balances consumer protection and the viability and profitability of the business. Meanwhile, the technical code has already been enacted in Qatar, which supports the operational function of the business.</p><h4>How have your 2018 expansion plans crystalized during 2019 and 1Q2020?</h4><p>We are battling to keep our expansion plans into Asia and Europe alive; however, headwinds have prevented us from materializing them so far. We are even looking to tap into the US, which has some interesting local markets for us. On the other hand, locally we have increased our presence even more than expected. We added 8,000 tons of refrigeration to our local capacity in 2019, and we have 28 developments becoming operational. We are growing organically within the country's borders, but we still aspire to go beyond Qatar. The COVID-19 outbreak put a momentary halt to our discussions, as, despite the digital tools that we have today, M&amp;A transactions and negotiations still require the physical component.</p><h4>How are your environmentally friendly and energy-efficient attributes perceived in Qatar and how do they support your organic growth in the country?</h4><p>Those values form the foundation of the district cooling business. As such, we are almost exactly aligned with the Qatar National Vision 2030, which includes a whole pillar on Environmental Development. Energy efficiency is going to be subject to the most substantial discussion in Qatar's energy mix development and diversification strategy. District cooling is destined to play a role of paramount importance in the future of Qatar, which is becoming greener and more efficient. When it comes to environmental protection, we are exemplars, not only in terms of energy efficiency but also in GHG emission reduction. </p>]]></richbody0content>

We recently expanded our network to include more reliable meat suppliers to create a solid supply chain and ensure sustainable meat supply. Moreover, we have managed to build an adequate stock from livestock and frozen products, ready to be supplied to the market, in the event of any crisis or shortage.</p><h4>What are the main priorities for 2021 at Widam?</h4><p>We always strive to support the country in achieving self-sufficiency as well as meet all our customers' demands. Hence, we are expanding and revamping our local operations, by opening several state-of-the-art butcheries and slaughterhouses around the country following the highest standards. Moreover, we are expanding and diversifying our product range within the meat industry, and actively ensuring that all supplied products are in line with the country's health and safety regulations.</p><h4>How is Widam Food adapting to an increasingly number of digital consumers in Qatar, and how was this shaped by the pandemic?</h4><p>Technology is an essential element in everyone's daily life. In 2020, we revamped our very own mobile application, which rapidly become one of the best channels for selling our products. Likewise, we regularly improve our internal processes using the latest technological practices. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you guide us through your main LNG-related activities in Qatar?</h4><p>In Qatar, our main target is to use the Qatari LNG to facilitate international markets. Powerglobe does not carry out many activities in Qatar in terms of LNG, as we are not LNG consumers in the country. We try to facilitate projects in Qatar as developers, though our main target is to export the Qatari LNG, especially to European markets. We also want to facilitate our power to LNG facilities which will help us achieving our primary objective. As stated above, if there is any large-scale integrated project in power, electricity, renewables or anything related to power generation, we try to be actively involved. Actually, we are involved in many projects in Qatar, whether chemical, petrochemical, or power generation-related projects. For instance, we have been involved in the 1,000-MW solar development in the country, and Qatar Powerglobe will be extremely active in the North Field expansion project.</p><h4>What are the most relevant specifications and benefits of Powerglobe's LNG to power facilities?</h4><p>They are smart facilities because they combine power and LNG at the same unit. Today, the way power plants operate is that they deliver LNG to floating storage and regasification units (FSRU) and then these units convert it to natural gas, whereas electricity is produced in different units. To combine LNG with power, one or two units are needed between the two processes, and with this facility only one unit is needed; there is an evident resource and cost efficiency as a result. Now, the same facility receives, stores, and gasifies the LNG and produces electricity. It is an ideal scenario. Powerglobe developed this facility and Siemens provided the steam turbines. Based on estimates, this new facility can produce electricity at less than 50% of the traditional facility cost and with 10% more efficiency. Moreover, operation and maintenance costs are also low in comparison. However, the success of this story depends on the LNG prices. If we supply the facility with an economic input, we get as a result the best electricity price. Today, we have three global requests to install this facility.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you manage to always keep up with the demands of the population?</h4><p>The Qatari population is extremely diverse; expats represent around 85% of the total population. We have to maintain a full range of products to satisfy all the different demographic groups represented in the society. We worked hard in 2019 and 2020 to build and strengthen the capabilities of our marketing team with the aim of getting closer to consumers. For example, we introduced a whole suite for consumer product testing where we work to understand what drives consumer preferences. On the other hand, we are working closer with our local and foreign corporate customers to narrow the supply chain and better understand their needs.</p><p>Made in Qatar resonates strongly with all consumers in Qatar. Visionary in nature and demanding exacting standards, Baladna has proven that products made in Qatar can and do compete with the best the world can offer. Qatar has become a model for developing a food security and self-sufficiency program. Baladna has showcased how this can be done over an extremely short period of time and attracted the attention of many governments worldwide. This has been invaluable in supporting our expansion program as can be seen in the collaboration with the Malaysian government to create a JV.</p><h4>How do you use technology in your production processes to increase efficiency and quality?</h4><p>In our business, technology has a crucial impact on quality, productivity, and efficiency. At present, we are getting close to about 39 liters per cow per day. Due to Qatar's harsh climate conditions, the only way to reach this level of production is through technology. For example, Dairy Comp is a technology developed by Baladna to keep the cows cool and maintain a high level of production. Baladna has and will continue to invest in the latest technologies, allowing us to drive quality and productivity improvements through the entire value chain. This begins with the breakthrough technology deployed in our farming division, allowing Baladna to deliver the highest quality and ever-increasing milk yield, in spite of the extremely challenging climate conditions. Our processing facility houses state-of-art equipment, minimizing human intervention. In addition, technology plays an ever-increasing role in our sales delivery model. The company was created by encompassing new disruptive technologies.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most relevant highlights of 2019 and 1H2020?</h4><p>We have always done a monthly research series on energy and in 2019, we started doing one on sustainability. The Al-Attiyah awards night had been running for eight years, but, unfortunately, we had to cancel it in 2020 because of the pandemic. Another important set of events that we had to cancel was the luncheon party that we arrange every two or three months to gather all the CEOs of our member companies and invite experts to have discussions on particular topics. We have replaced those with webinars and podcasts, which in itself was quite a change for us.</p><h4>What is your strategy for international partnerships and expansion?</h4><p>At our first board meeting, we presented plans for a long list of initiatives, but the board quite wisely advised us against growing too quickly. In 2020, we have been expanding internationally on the back of podcasts and webinars. We partner with other broadcasters as well and we use their circulation lists to send out to other viewers. We will probably keep doing webinars and podcasts after the pandemic is over because they have become a part of our strategy. We had plans to go to Glasgow for the COP 2020 and do something special, but we will now have to wait until 2021. Whether it takes place next year or is held online, it will mark a major moment for us.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the current status of the oil and gas sector in Qatar?</h4><p>The supply of oil, gas, and petrochemicals has not been affected at all, which is a good sign. Unfortunately, we cannot say the same about prices and demand. In 2019, there was an oversupply of oil and gas, and in 2020, the sector has been hit with the double whammy of oversupply and reduced demand. It is difficult to anticipate what will happen, but the situation remains challenging,</p><h4>What do you think is the competitive advantage of Qatar LNG gas in international markets?</h4><p>What has happened with the gas market is that Qatar Gas has become the lowest cost supplier in the world. This means no other country can compete with Qatar on price, allowing Qatar to adopt an aggressive strategy at will. Australia is trying to compete but apart from North West Shelf, all the other projects in Australia are high cost. Moreover, the Shell Gorgon project is underdoing maintenance, and as a result, Australia is losing market share. While other countries such as Malaysia and Russia are also losing market share, Qatar has managed to increase its share of the LNG gas market.</p><h4>What is the significance of the North Field expansion project for Qatar?</h4><p>The market will not start to pick up in 2020 and people are even talking about further declines in 2021. However, now is a good time to start building because it is cheaper to do business with contractors, engineering companies, and equipment suppliers. The market will probably start picking up in 2024, which means 2025 and 2026 will be a good time to come on stream. Qatar's economy will also benefit from capital expenditure as billions of dollars will be spent, some in the domestic market. When built, Qatar's new LNG mega-trains will further boost the economy. This virtuous circle will continue as new profits will be reinvested into the economy. LNG plants do not require a lot of manpower because machines do the majority of work, and overall, although the oil and gas industry is not a huge employer, but it will generate some new high-quality jobs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you implement digital strategies during COVID-19?</h4><p>QPMC is overhauling everything to digital and online processes. We process suitability applications online now for people who bring in materials from overseas. This process used to take a long time and effort when it was done manually. Our new digital system gives clients more transparency about the entire backend process. This system also links into KPIs for QPMC's staff. In these times of difficulty, digitalization is not negotiable since we all have to take any opportunity to become more efficient. We have reduced application processes from 10 days to a maximum of three days.</p><h4>How is QPMC working with free zones and ports in Oman and Qatar to ensure smooth supply chain activities?</h4><p>We signed an NDA with Duqm Port in Oman. QPMC has a joint venture with a company in Oman, Marafi, and together we have established a new company that is developing a port hub in Oman. At present, we are in the design stage. The whole process will be systemized, and the entire logistics chain will be connected; hence, we will not have to use trucks. This will ensure better cost and time management. On top of this, the free zones in Doha are an excellent opportunity for developing companies looking to expand internationally. Free zones provide many opportunities, incentives, and facilities, and we are looking into this. We do not have anything established yet, though this is one of our major focuses. QPMC wants to diversify not only organically, but also inorganically. For that inorganic growth, we are in discussions with various international organizations to explore new opportunities. We will go for new business areas where we can add value. In all our ventures, our aim is to contribute both financially as well as in terms of knowledge.</p><h4>What is the future for the materials sector once the present wave of infrastructure development is over?</h4><p>Everyone talks about what comes after 2022. We need to bear in mind that the country has prioritized some projects, and all the projects being executed are required by the country; they are not just being done for 2022. 2022 is a catalyst to get some of these projects done, but this is not all that Qatar needs. Currently, the country is focusing on delivering projects related to 2022 on time. Post-2022, Qatar has many projects that were put on hold to be reenergized after the World Cup. This is in line with Vision 2030, which is the real goal. There will be an expansion in oil and gas, the financial sector, and other sectors such as aviation and tourism. Based on our studies, we expect projects to stabilize at the end of 2022, but shortly after that we can see a pickup of projects toward 2030.</p><h4>How does Qatar's new PPP Law affect QPMC's business?</h4><p>The new PPP Law allows the private sector to do business more efficiently; this is where we expect PPPs to play a significant role. Government entities want to execute jobs as a private business in terms of efficiency, speed, and cost reduction. QPMC has formed partnerships in areas, such as recycling where we have management responsibilities for the logistics. Private companies represent diversification, and they have human and financial capital. They can work with different government entities so both share the benefit. The PPP Law will make this process smoother.</p><h4>What is your balance between the import of raw materials and R&amp;D activities?</h4><p>We import gabbro, which is an aggregate. We do not have gabbro aggregate in Qatar, though we have quarries with aggregate specifications and strengths that meet our requirements in some applications. However, these quarries require some development in terms of their extraction methods. Recycling will replace some of the materials we import from abroad. The aim is to produce more in Qatar and find alternative solutions for the materials we currently import.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has 2020 meant for the Qatari sports industry? What have been the highlights of the year for Qatar Olympic Committee?</h4><p>2020 was undoubtedly a challenging year for Qatari sport, as it was for sport and societies around the world. From a corporate perspective, we had to change our business model in order to adapt to the business environment enforced upon all of us by the COVID-19 pandemic, where working remotely and the use of technology became a big part of our daily functioning as an industry. However, despite the challenges, there were many highlights in 2020. Team Qatar began the year by claiming the title of Asian Men's Handball Championship held in Kuwait.<br>One of the main highlights was Doha being awarded the 2030 Asian Games in December. Hosting the 2030 Asian Games has been a national priority for our country and so we were humbled and greatly honored to be awarded this prestigious event for the second time. We greatly look forward to welcoming Asia back to Doha in 2030 for a celebration of our continent's sporting excellence and cultural diversity. In spite of the difficulties in 2020, sport continued to play a critical role in helping us all to maintain positive physical and mental health and to keep us connected. Through initiatives such as the QOC Virtual Marathon we were able to achieve a sense of community.</p><h4>How do you see the sports industry evolving in Qatar up to 2030?</h4><p>It is certainly set to be an exciting decade for Qatar. Next year we will host the world's largest single sport event—the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. Qatar 2022 will be the first World Cup in the Middle East and will showcase the significant advancements our country has undertaken in recent years under the National Vision 2030. It will be one of the most sustainable and technologically advanced World Cups ever hosted. In 2023, we will host two more major sports events—the FINA World Aquatic Championships and the IJF World Judo Championships. And to end the decade, as mentioned, we will host the largest multi-sports games based on number of athletes and sports—the 2030 Asian Games. Hosting these major international events will strengthen Qatar's position as a sporting hub not just in Asia but on a global level. We look forward to offering our state-of-the-art facilities and know-how to the athletes of the region and wider world and to cooperating with all stakeholders to create a platform for sporting excellence. In addition, in the next decade we will stage many other national and international events as well that will allow us to enhance our hosting experience and expertise ensuring that we are continually improving and delivering world-class events.</p><h4>There are voices speaking up about a potential cancelation of the 2021 Olympics in Tokyo. How is Qatar collaborating with the International Committee and foreign national committees to overcome the challenges posed by the pandemic?</h4><p>I would like to reiterate our full support for the IOC and our Japanese colleagues who are doing everything possible to ensure that Tokyo 2021 does go ahead. We have full confidence in the IOC and Tokyo 2020, and we are working full-steam ahead to prepare Team Qatar for the Olympics in five months. In terms of hosting events safely in Qatar, thanks to His Highness the Amir and the government, Qatar has done an excellent job in managing COVID-19 in our country. When we host events, we have clear and well-defined rules that everyone must follow. We have many countermeasures in place including a bubble-to-bubble approach, regular testing, minimizing contact, and continuous sanitization of equipment and venues. We are not yet in a position to allow spectators back into venues, but we hope that with the rollout of the vaccines, it will not be long before fans can return and once again generate the fantastic atmospheres they have done in the past. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights of 2020?</h4><p>The biggest highlight was absolutely how our people stepped up and performed in uncertain and challenging circumstances. We had to quickly refashion our supply chain and manage our upstream oil and gas operations in an environment where many people had to work from home or in different shifts. The resilience of our people, their ability to understand this challenge, and quickly work as one big team to deliver high business performance was the highlight. The health and safety of our people—employees and contractors—is our highest priority. Schlumberger Qatar's safety record in 2020 was the best it has ever been, as was the quality of our service. During the pandemic, we also introduced new technology for the North Field Expansion Project to improve drilling and completion performance. At Schlumberger, our ambition is to be the performance partner of choice for our customers and the industry. In the oil and gas industry, digital transformation is not just working from home. We work with large amounts of data: seismic, geological, and simulation information that needs to be captured and used to inform better decisions. We are collaborating with Qatar Petroleum to deploy and leverage digital capabilities to increase team performance and maximize asset value through new digital technologies and integrated oilfield deployment for land oilfield by end of the year 2021.</p><h4>Where do you see growth coming for Schlumberger Qatar moving forward?</h4><p>We are a major part of the North Field Upstream Expansion Project. Many of these projects have already started. Most of our personnel growth is around the North Field Expansion Project. Schlumberger Qatar also supports QP, QPD, Dolphin, Total &amp; North Oil Company in its drilling activities and development planning. There are many growth opportunities for us in both gas and oil.</p><h4>How are environmental and safety concerns impacting your industry in Qatar?</h4><p>We always give the highest priority to environmental protection and the safety of our people. We are proud that our company is the first in upstream exploration and production services to commit to setting a science-based target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This is significant, because it challenges us with targets verified by the Science Based Targets initiative, not only to reduce our fuel and power consumption, but to also work with our suppliers and customers to reduce their consumption as well. We will set our reduction target, in line with SBTi's defined criteria, in 2021. There are many areas where we can contribute, both in reducing our own footprint and helping our customers to reduce their emissions. We actively participate in carbon capture and sequestration projects, as our customers are working on those, and we are supporting them as a technology provider, having identified around 100 technologies in our portfolio that can reduce environmental impacts. We are also looking to collaborate with the ministry, where there is an initiative to plant trees. A key attribute of Schlumberger's success and that of the wider industry is ensuring we proactively reduce emissions.</p><h4>What will be new in 2021?</h4><p>People will remain the key to delivering outstanding performance moving forward. We need to make sure we train local talent in the country and have the right foundation built to ensure they are successful. The second key is localization of the supply chain, as part of Qatar Tawteen initiatives—ensuring we have second and third degrees of manufacturing and that oilfield commodity is localized, which gives us greater resilience during operations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

It is a new tournament delivery model where the local organizing committee and FIFA work hand-in-hand, rather than separately as in past tournaments, to avoid inefficiencies and ensure effective tournament planning and operations. It combines the vast knowledge and tactical planning experience Qatar has gained locally since winning the bid in 2010 and FIFA's extensive tournament delivery expertise to ensure an optimum World Cup experience for fans, players, and officials in 2022. It's been two years since the JV was launched, and since then, we witnessed various milestones on our journey to delivering the first FIFA World Cup in the Middle East and the Arab world. On this front, the JV has been essential in helping us prepare for 2022 as it enabled teams to seamlessly integrate with one another for a smooth and successful delivering of various test events and major tournament milestones.</p><h4>Why is Qatar the perfect location to bring The World Cup to the Arabian Peninsula?</h4><p>Hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2022 presents a unique opportunity to break down barriers and build bridges of understanding between the East and the West, dispelling misconceptions carried by many around the world. This is central to our vision of what the FIFA World Cup will do not just for Qatar, but the entire region. Qatar is the perfect location to bring the World Cup to the Middle East for a number of reasons. Its central location means the tournament is more accessible to a higher number of fans, and the tournament can be viewed at convenient times for more than 3 billion people around the world. Qatar's size will also enable us to deliver a unique hosting concept—the most compact FIFA World Cup since the tournament's inaugural edition in 1930. Beyond the advantages this offers teams when it comes to maximizing resting and training periods and minimizing travel, it also means the entire country will be one large football festival. The country is also the perfect meeting point between modernity and tradition, which means it will be a fantastic host to the 1.5 million fans and visitors from across the globe we expect during the tournament. Accordingly, the FIFA World Cup in Qatar will not just be a celebration of football, but a celebration of everyone's common humanity, offering the chance to bridge cultures and enhance mutual understanding.</p><h4>2022 FIFA World Cup will be the first carbon-neutral event of its type in history. What role do you play in this?</h4><p>Qatar is committed to delivering the most sustainable sporting event in history in 2022, one that drives both human and environmental development in the country. One aspect of the plan is to deliver a carbon-neutral tournament. Water conservation, waste management, carbon management, renewable energy, environmental protection, urban connectivity, biodiversity, and urban ecology are just a few of the means being used in order to achieve this goal. From an operational perspective, the tournament's planning and the movement of fans and players also has to reflect this key consideration. Its compact nature will completely eliminate the need for air travel during the World Cup, as seen in past editions of the tournament. Fans will primarily use the state-of-the-art metro and sustainable bus network as their main means of transport, leaving a public transport network in place post-2022. We also launched in early 2020 the first-ever joint sustainability strategy with FIFA that covers issues related to the preparation, staging, and legacy activities of the tournament to describe how they will support the delivery of Vision 2030 and National Development Strategy 2018-2022, as well as 11 of the UN SDGs. No other strategy has aligned to the UN SDGs or a national vision.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 mean for Qatar beyond the obvious impact on the sports industry?</h4><p>To us, the FIFA World Cup is more than just a football tournament—it is a celebration of our common humanity. This celebration is even more important in 2022 given the post-COVID-19 world we will likely be operating in. As we edge closer to 2022, we are excited to share our country, culture, and region with millions who will travel for the tournament. In the context of COVID-19, the tournament is likely to be one of the world's first truly global gatherings that fans and teams will be able to confidently travel to and enjoy. The tournament has already positively impacted the country and the region, two years before it is set to begin. Whether it is increased economic activity directly or indirectly through preparations for hosting, increased participation in sports leading to healthier lifestyles, or developing and accelerating innovative sustainable building practices and standards, 2022 has already had a profound impact on the country and will have a lasting impact for generations to come.</p><h4>How will the 2022 FIFA World Cup help set a precedent for future events in terms of legacy?</h4><p>Being the first World Cup in the Arab World and the Middle East, and recognizing the power of sport—and football in particular—as a catalyst and driver for positive change, we wanted to make sure the tournament left a long-standing legacy not just for the people of Qatar, but the region as a whole. In planning for the tournament and curating our legacy programs, we ensured everything we do supported the realization of the Qatar National Vision 2030, thereby placing sustainability and legacy at the heart of every project we undertake. From an economic perspective, Qatar has always viewed the FIFA World Cup 2022 as a catalyst for accelerating not only the growth of the local economy by providing opportunities for local businesses, companies and contractors, but also wider infrastructure and nation-building projects. This has already had a significant impact on Qatar and helped accelerate a number of existing national infrastructure projects that are transforming the country into a modern and connected nation—a legacy that will be felt for generations to come. For example, the Doha Metro is already today a critical method of transport for the people of Qatar, helping take cars off the road, reducing carbon emissions, and supporting the realization of the country's environmental development goals. We are also utilizing the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 as a platform for several legacy programs aimed at supporting the realization of the National Vision 2030, specifically a knowledge-based economy and economic diversification. Josoor Institute, our education and training arm, is helping with the country's economic diversification and human capital development efforts. It aims to build the capabilities of the sports and events industries in Qatar and the region in the run up to the FIFA World Cup through education, training, professional certification, consultancy, and research. Tourism, property, media, service, and manufacturing are just some of the sectors that will rapidly grow while Qatar's successful track record in hosting first-class mega events continues to expand. From a modernization and preservation of traditions perspective, our state-of-the-art stadiums echo the spirit and essence of Arab and Qatari heritage and culture. This venue will be utilized by the people of Qatar long after the tournament concludes—post 2022, once its capacity is reduced to 20,000 seats, a boutique hotel will replace the stadium's upper stands, while a branch of Aspetar clinic will open on site. In addition, the stadium's precinct can be utilized by the community for a variety of sporting activities as well as the establishment of a number of retail and commercial units. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the main highlights for Elite Medical Center since its establishment in Qatar in 2017?</strong></p><p>Our research about the private healthcare sector in Qatar showed that most facilities were quite small with no specific focus on luxury services. Elite Medical Center is the first purpose built one-day surgery medical center in Qatar, where patients are cared for in a luxurious yet comfortable and welcoming environment. The center is housed in a 2,200-sqm, three-story building located on Al Jazeera Al-Arabiya street, which is very convenient. Each medical department has a designated 220-sqm area with its own reception and private waiting area. Our medical departments include obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, dental, radiology, family medicine, internal medicine, ENT, dermatology, plastic surgery, and IVF. Moreover, we have three fully equipped operating theaters, eight single preparation rooms, a four-bed recovery area, and four inpatient rooms. </p><p><strong>How has Elite Medical Center contributed to one of the best healthcare systems in the world?</strong></p><p>We wanted to contribute in two different ways. The first is to provide a state-of-the-art IVF unit with the latest technology for people who are unable to have children and have not been able to access fertility treatment via Qatar's public healthcare system. When we set up Elite Medical Center in 2016, there were no private IVF units in Qatar and only one government IVF unit at Hamad Women's Hospital to serve the whole population of Qatar. Obviously, that one unit was unable to cope with the huge demand, and as a result, people were traveling abroad to places such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Jordan for IVF treatment. Our second goal was to establish a one-day surgery with highly trained personnel capable of performing all forms laparoscopic procedures. This service falls between a conventional medical center that only treats outpatients and a fully-fledged hospital with overnight stays. We have also managed to staff the center with doctors and nurses from different backgrounds having received education or training abroad. Hence, our staff bring different clinical and surgical perspective of practice, from practicing in Europe and America.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the main highlights for CNA-Q in 2020</strong></p><p>CNA-Q is an international college that is transforming into the first applied university in the country. The bylaws have been submitted to the cabinet for approval, and hopefully the transformation will take place very soon. Because CNA-Q is an applied college, our infrastructure was ready before the pandemic hit. We were already offering many courses online, so the transformation from physical to blended learning was easy for us. The pandemic has had a big psychological impact on students and faculties worldwide, and CNA-Q is no exception; however, we have provided a great deal of support and aid to our students and staff, including medical aid as well as advice and counselling. The pandemic has been difficult for everyone, but there are also moments worth celebrating in 2020. One of them was the launch of unique applied bachelor programs in Qatar. We initially offered three bachelor's degree programs in maintenance engineering technology, applied business administration in human resource management, and medical radiography to assess the demand and needs. Engineering and HR programs were oversubscribed by 200%, while demand for medical radiography was almost 400%. CNA-Q will offer a number of new different degrees in fall 2021. The college currently has 3,600 students, and we expect to reach 4,000 in January 2021. The other major milestone for us was waiving tuition fees for Qatari students, and students with Qatari mothers, starting from the next term. Today, our student population is 80% non-Qatari and 20% Qatari; we expect more Qataris to join in the coming term. CNA-Q has also state-of-the-art sports facilities, and we are expanding them as well.</p><p><strong>CNA-Q is contributing to the country's knowledge-based economy and helping turn Vision 2030 a reality. How do these national programs and strategies impact the design of CNA-Q's new courses and activities offering?</strong></p><p>CNA-Q is an industry-driven organization; all our programs involve input and advice from industry experts. We focus heavily on the oil and gas industry and have a close relationship and partnership with Qatar Petroleum, Qatar Gas, Qatar Fertiliser Co (QAFCO), Qatar Petrochemical Company (QAPCO), Shell, and other oil and gas companies. We design our programs to truly serve their needs. In September 2021, we are starting two major programs specifically serving oil and gas companies: a bachelor's degree program in chemical processing and another one in telecommunication networking. The other field that is really important is business and IT. We are developing a bachelor's degree program in cybersecurity and data analytics, where there is a huge demand. All of CNA-Q's programs are applied, meaning they are really hands-on, and this saves companies and the government a lot of money in terms of additional workplace training. We are developing another applied program in financial services. CNA-Q is the first institution to apply a qualification like this locally in the market. There is huge demand for programs from our school of health sciences, and we are offering a bachelor's degree program in paramedicine. We are the only institute offering a paramedicine program in the country, and many of the workers at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), the Ministry of Health, and in the private healthcare sector are our graduates. We currently have a post-graduate diploma, but we are also adding a master's degree in diabetes to better prepare doctors and healthcare practitioners to deal with patients in this field.</p><p><strong>How does CNA-Q stay informed about the various industry and market needs in the various sectors?</strong></p><p>We have advisory committees that bring unique knowledge and skills to the college. The committees embody experts that keep us connected with the market needs, and deliver the experience that our students require. Our board of trustees comprises leading members of Qatari industry who provide us with specific market insights, and we tailor our programs accordingly. In addition, we have our in-house market/industry research team that keeps us aligned with the ever-changing market conditions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the level of diversification of Hassad Food's investment portfolio, especially the progress done in recent years?</h4><p>Hassad's investment portfolio is quite diverse, as we aim to support the country's food security initiatives by investing in businesses that brings strategic and commercial value. In the last few years, we have revamped and expanded our investment portfolio, both internationally and locally, and acquired stakes in key strategic commercial entities in a number of countries.<br>Hassad currently has direct and indirect investments in more than 18 countries around the world such as Australia, Canada, Turkey, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Qatar. All those investments are operating within our targeted investment segments such as seeds and grains, livestock, poultry, seafood, and others. Locally, we have 10 strategic investments operating in key segments such as food facilities management, agriculture production and marketing, poultry production, animal feed production and supply, dates processing, strategic grain reserves as well as meat and dairy sectors.</p><h4>What are Hassad's investment criteria and principles to take decisions in this field?</h4><p>When approaching a new investment, there are a number of investment principles that guide us, such as investing in business that brings strategic value to Qatar's food security initiatives, investing in independently operating assets with positive financial profile, as well as targeting segments that have positive and sustainable growth profile in the near future. Moreover, we acquire minority equity stakes in most of the international investments as well as Serttstakes in local strategic assets.<br>How have the investments in Qatar's local agricultural capacity helped overcome potential logistics issues due to COVID19?<br>Over the past couple of years, Hassad managed to develop new robust facilities and integrated marketing platforms, such as establishing a state-of-the-art facility dedicated for providing marketing services to local farmers and developing four central markets. Hassad also expanded and revamped the operations for its poultry, fodder, vegetables, and dates investments. This contribution provides the Qatari market with the needed logistical support at all times, especially during the pandemic.</p><h4>Qatar's agritech market is seeing a rapid growth. How has Hassad been involved in this regard?</h4><p>Utilizing technology in food production is particularly important in regions with harsher climate conditions as Qatar. Innovative solutions are needed to ensure sustainable high yield, using less water. Thus, we continuously support and collaborate with research and development institutions in projects that aim to advance the local agricultural sector to achieve self-sufficiency. In late 2019, we collaborated with distinguished international and local entities to launch Qatar's first pilot water saving greenhouse at one of Hassad's greenhouses in Al Shahaniya. Upon the completion of the project after a one-year trial, the pilot greenhouse demonstrated great results in yield and water consumption for fresh vegetables cultivation. The productivity achieved in the greenhouse was three times higher than the average productivity of tomato cultivation in Qatar, while water consumption was 12 times less. All these results were achieved by using an innovative water saving system, as well as applying the tailored fertilizer recipes in the pilot greenhouse.</p><h4>What will be Hassad Food's priorities over the course of 2021?</h4><p>We managed to establish a great foundation in the past few year with our global and local investments, and we are now looking to grow and secure other investments in line with our investment strategy and principles. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Amidst the COVID-19 scenario, how have you been preparing for the resumption of full academic activities?</strong></p><p>The pandemic came with many challenges for education, research, and businesses at large. We are a big believer that every challenge brings an opportunity with it, and it opened many doors for universities to do things in a different way. We were able to shift to online education quickly enough because part of our planning was on building a different educational experience for our students. The pandemic has helped the university push its strategy from a digitalization perspective, accelerated it, and opened many opportunities from the business aspect of the education elements. Even though we were considering how we can reach more students without the need to be physically in Qatar, that experience led us to putting in the right infrastructure in order to bring our degrees and education beyond physical borders. Having that infrastructure allows us to engage professors from different countries to teach classes for the university, for example.</p><p><strong>How can global and local coexist together within HBKU at the moment?</strong></p><p>The current challenges are global in nature and locally impactful. Climate change is a global issue that has a local relevancy in it, as well as cyber security, for example. It is now the time to truly engage globally in all those challenges. We would like to provide our students, faculty, and researchers with focus on the challenges that are  globally important but locally relevant. The way we are approaching things is by focusing on how we can really benefit Qatar and be the driver of change within the country based on the international changes and challenges that are happening. We are preparing our students to understand the local context and challenges and see how they can be an active citizen locally while also contributing to the international community.</p><p><strong>How do you capitalize on the educational, research, and community development infrastructure created in Education City?</strong></p><p>That atmosphere provides us with multiple advantages. One advantage is the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach to projects, which is the nature of all the problems and challenges people are facing right now. Having all that expertise around allows us to provide educational and research programs that are multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary by nature. When looking at sustainability of the environment, for example, we look at it from an engineering, policy, and media perspective, among others. The other advantage is that we have the continuum chain of taking education and research from the lab into incubation within Qatar Science and Technology Park, and ultimately into a company or business. Our focus for the near future as a university is take more and more of our start-up ideas into the market. We are really in the process of establishing what we call HBKU R&amp;D Corporation, which we would like to be the arm of commercializing a great deal of our research and the products that our researchers and students are getting into as a result of their work.</p><p><strong>What are your most strategic priorities for HBKU in the near future?</strong></p><p>We encourage all our students to make a change, and that change does not need to be a product. Everyone thinks an innovator or entrepreneur must have product; however, sometimes changing a policy by itself is an important element that leads to business opportunity and advantages. We are trying to push our students, faculty, and researchers as hard as we can to take their discoveries, ideas, and work from paper publication into an actual business or community knowing that failure is the way of success. We will be there for them if they fail to get them to keep trying. At every possibility, we try to encourage innovation and entrepreneurial spirit and that interaction with the private sector and industry. We all live on the same planet so we have to share the same agenda. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the highlights for PHCC in 2020?</strong></p><p>It would be difficult to talk about primary healthcare without talking about COVID-19, as the pandemic changed our lives significantly. We sought to be proactive in ensuring a continuity of care through the family medicine model. That was launched at the end of 2019, and we wanted to expand further in 2020. COVID-19 made it easy for us in certain aspects, as we were already trying to deliver digital services and found ourselves pushing hard to provide alternatives for one-to-one consultations or house visits, for example. Using e-services was the alternative during the pandemic; we introduced and piloted many e-services within primary healthcare. For example, our website provides several e-services such as online appointment bookings or changing one's family physician. We were following the news thoroughly and meticulously and decided to establish a strategy head command group under the leadership of the Ministry of Health. Under this initiative, we set up a community call center to respond to people's worries. We also did remote consultations by phone and video, which became almost the norm for more than 40% of our population who liked it. We assigned four of our 27 health centers as COVID-19 test centers, which made it easy for people to be directed to the right place.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment on your communication with the Ministry of Health and the government during these months?</strong></p><p>I was appointed national lead for integrated care as per the national health strategy, which is why Her Excellency assigned me to lead the community command group. It was the right decision to make myself available to the community and stay connected with the national level of health command. It gives me a great deal of leverage to communicate with any stakeholder or organization within the country. For example, when the decision was made by the higher authority to open the airport in August, we prepared for that to happen smoothly with Qatar Airways and Hamad International Airport. We also had the opportunity to communicate with other entities and organizations such as Hamad Medical Corporation in terms of quarantine programs. It was a good opportunity for close collaboration and integration with each other. This constant communication resulted in further services, such as supplying our staff for labs or physiotherapy centers. We also provided a great deal of support to and were in close communication with the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Commerce and Trading, Ministry of Education and Higher Education, and Ministry of Labor, as there were many discussions to coordinate the services that should be open, closed, or placed under restrictions.</p><p><strong>How has the preventive health directorate developed in the past year?</strong></p><p>There was great progress at the beginning when we started. The area has been affected because of resources being drawn from outside the department to serve elsewhere within COVID-19 centers. Thus far, many of the programs were shifted or redirected. For example, we decided to stop our plans for prevention and wellness programs to focus on urgent and acute cases. Subsequently, we have resumed them gradually. We also provided online services like mental health services to help people manage their crises during this stressful time. In addition, many of the wellness program staff were assigned to education campaigns addressed at our clients. There was also screening for newborn immune disease, which was usually done in secondary care after delivery. The healthcare protection department played a key role in the pandemic. It had to train all staff on how to do swabbing and make sure the preventive measures were in place in collaboration with other departments such as Educational Health and Safety operations. Since our country is fairly small, we had the opportunity to control the situation easily. From the start of the pandemic, the intention was to control infections, and we managed to do so.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the highlights for Georgetown University in Qatar in 2019 and early 2020?</strong></p><p>We had an extremely rewarding year up until the COVID-19 outbreak. The year was marked by close collaboration with the Qatar Foundation and the Qatari government, particularly through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense. The aim of these partnerships is to contribute to the development of a highly skilled and flexible workforce that can sustain the national vision of Qatar. The first thing we did in 2019 was expand our academic offering, and now our students can benefit from five new minors: economics, government, history, philosophy, and theology. We also introduced 21 new innovative courses, including one multiversity seminar jointly delivered with another Education City university, Northwestern University, and one course on state security which featured, among others, the deputy prime minister and minister of state as a guest speaker. In addition, we have enhanced the engagement and exposure of our students through internship partnerships with more than 50 local partners. The majority of our students have at least one opportunity to work in the public sector and gain real-life experiences.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment on the potential of Education City to support the creation of the knowledge-based economy envisioned under Qatar National Vision?</strong></p><p>Qatar Foundation's idea of creating an educational hub is visionary by any measure. When the Qatar Foundation was conceived 25 years ago, it was established by a small group of people who had great ambition. Today, any reasonable observer would agree it has achieved something truly remarkable. The vision has been to transform the nature of the Qatari economy and build a diversified and education-based economy that goes far beyond oil and gas. Quite clearly, Qatar has made tremendous achievements in this regard, particularly thanks to the establishment and development of Education City and the development of the education sector across the country. The idea of Education City was not just to invite one university to establish itself as a satellite campus, but multiple universities selected for specific areas of expertise. Once that was established, there has been a natural expansion in the offering from each of the institutions. Qatar Foundation and Education City have played a significant role in the social and economic transformations of the country. It is an important intellectual center not just for Qatar but the entire region; however, Education City is not the only relevant project to transform Qatar's education landscape, just the jewel of the crown</p><p><strong>How is Georgetown University in Qatar coping with the rapid digital transition that the COVID-19 outbreak is forcing us to implement?</strong></p><p>One of the most important things about our reaction is that it was driven by measures taken by the country. The government, through the Ministry of Education and Higher Education and Qatar Foundation, has continuously guided and supported us during this transition. In addition, we have an emergency instructional continuity plan in our university, which many universities have. We have had instructional continuity exercises last semester and early this semester in which we simulate disruptions, so our faculty members were trained to respond to situations like this one. We have multiple resources for instructional continuity. Still, no one ever imagined that we would have to do it for this long and 100% remotely. We have multiple resources for online instruction though again nothing on this scale. We are fortunate the government acted in this deliberate consistent way, and we have gladly followed its lead. In early March, we immediately moved our students to online instruction, and students were no longer able to come to the university; our staff moved to working from home shortly after and still works remotely. We have adjusted rapidly to this new reality and have held hundreds of lectures and seminars online, and have developed a number of ways to connect and support our students in the virtual environment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Qatar's healthcare system has made enormous progress in recent years. How has this benefitted Qatar throughout the COVID-19 pandemic?</strong></p><p>Qatar's healthcare sector has undergone a remarkable transformation throughout the last decade. In the public sector alone, we opened 10 new hospitals and eight new primary health centers between 2010 and 2019, significantly boosting capacity across the system. As well as expanding capacity, we have also seen tremendous improvements in the quality of care we provide to our patients, which has been formally recognized on multiple occasions through prestigious international accreditations. Another significant area of development has been our workforce. We have placed great importance on building a strong, highly skilled team of healthcare professionals across the system to lead the delivery of high-quality care to Qatar's population. These improvements in recent years meant the healthcare system was in a strong position to cope with the unprecedented pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p><strong>How has the healthcare sector dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in relation to priority population groups?</strong></p><p>The entire healthcare sector has played an important role in Qatar's comprehensive measures to protect its population from COVID-19. There are three key focus areas of our strategy that have been central to the healthcare sector's COVID-19 strategy: capacity expansion; a proactive testing strategy; and protecting the most vulnerable. We significantly expanded our hospital capacity to ensure every patient with COVID-19 has been able to receive the care they need without delay. This expansion saw our bed capacity increase from 2,250 beds to a potential maximum 3,500 hospital beds and a three-fold increase in our intensive care capacity. Our proactive testing strategy enabled us to rapidly identify positive cases and ensure they were provided with the medical care they need at an early stage, before their symptoms worsen. A vital factor in maintaining a low COVID-19 death rate has been the way in which we have protected the most vulnerable members of our society, most notably the elderly and those with chronic diseases. We quickly introduced telemedicine and home delivery services to ensure these at-risk patients could continue to receive the medical care they need from the comfort and safety of their homes, without having to come into a hospital or health center. Additionally, we delivered targeted outreach and education programs for these risk groups to ensure they were aware of the actions to take to keep themselves safe during the pandemic. </p><p><strong>How can the non-human contact and social distancing trends that prevail in our new normal give a boost to the rise of technologies with health applications?</strong></p><p>COVID-19 has forced us to change and adapt many of our existing systems and processes as we entered a world where in-person contact between healthcare teams and patients was a potential risk. This led to us rapidly innovating and creating a range of virtual and telemedicine services for patients to access care from the safety of their own homes. Initially, all outpatient appointments were switched to telemedicine consultations, and a remote urgent care service was launched. This was made possible by launching the COVID-19 call center 16000. This physician-led urgent care service provided advice and care for urgent, but non-life-threatening, conditions and significantly reduced the number of people needing to visit emergency departments. With the pandemic leading to increased stress and anxiety among Qatar's population, we also launched a new Mental Health Helpline providing easy access to professional support for people experiencing stress or psychological distress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other issues. All of these virtual and telemedicine services were established as a result of COVID-19, but they have been so positively received by our patients that we are now planning how best to continue delivering these services alongside regular in person consultations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do the two dimensions of Islamic studies and global affairs fit within the College of Islamic Studies?</strong></p><p>Islam is a comprehensive universal religion in the sense that it tries to project the universal Islamic values to the entire world; for example, the dignity of the human being, freedom of choice, pluralism, diversity, the issue of justice, and the universal value of cooperation. We also seek to embody these values into our curricula and deliver morality-laden syllabi utilizing state-of-the-art pedagogies. In this regard, we introduced a master's program called Islam and global affairs, one of the few in the world—if not the only—degree granting program of its type. It focuses on Islam and diplomacy, contemporary diplomacy, and how these can be intertwined. It also explores topics such as humanitarian assistance, the role of technology, social inequalities, and environmentalism. Our perspective always combines the internal and external dimensions. For example, two major projects have emerged from this program: the Maker-Majlis which brings together a global council involving collaborators from across the globe to discuss creating a better world, innovation, and SDGs; and Design Post-COVID Humanity (DPCH), which is a six-month global program dense with activities, ideas, and training, and involves collaborators such as the UN, UNDP, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. </p><p><strong>What new areas of knowledge and challenges will be covered by Islamic studies in the future with this new normal?</strong></p><p>We have introduced a number of new programs and activities in niche areas; for example, the first master's degree in the world in applied Islamic ethics. It is extremely relevant in the current times we are living in with a full spectrum of ethical issues that contemporary societies are trying to navigate. We also have an Islamic art, architecture, and urbanism program that informs the built infrastructure of past and modern Muslim societies; and Islamic finance programs that delve into the concepts of financial solidarity and social economy to boost microprojects to alleviate poverty. We have also completely redesigned our master's program in Islamic studies, which explores interesting aspects of society, law, media, and foundational studies.  </p><p><strong>How crucial will the digital world be for Islamic studies in the aftermath of COVID-19?</strong></p><p>We have switched all our courses to online lessons. We viewed this crisis and its implications as both a challenge and an opportunity, such as how the digital world allows us to surpass geographical and spatial barriers. In terms of collaboration, we have invited prominent figures from leading universities to co-teach with us in courses virtually to avoid unnecessary travel while also enriching the student experience. We introduced modules within courses and switched total delivery to digital until it is safe to consider an on-site/online blended format. We have promoted more collaborative teaching and platforms with other prominent universities and redesigned our students' learning outcomes for the digital world. As a modern educational institution, we plan to continue with a blended system even after the crisis. </p><p><strong>Why are Islamic values and studies suitable for contemporary challenges?</strong></p><p>Islamic studies can truly contribute positively to modern and contemporary crises. For example, when we investigate the core cause of the financial crisis in 2008, all the complex dynamics at play essentially boiled down to greed. This is where Islamic and ethical studies can play a role. We can help societies find a balance between self-interest, profit, and ethical and social values. A second element is the future digital and technological development, which are fraught with ethical issues. AI, for example, is an area that CIS has already initiated work in. Another example is genome testing, which can give us more in-depth information about our own DNA composition but engages highly controversial ethical debates. In the college, we do not look at these issues from a parochial point of view, as we are open to all faiths as well as interfaith inquiry. The combination of Islamic studies and modern challenges can have positive outcomes and build better clarity and direction for Muslim societies globally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How was 2020 for the Qatar Foundation's community engagement division?</strong></p><p><span></span>AMY JOHNSON So much happened in 2020 from an economic and social standpoint, and one can choose to look at this in a negative light or as an opportunity. When the pandemic hit in March 2020, Qatar Foundation was agile in becoming digital. Qatar Foundation has a strong risk mitigation team. Opening Education City Golf Course was one of the highlights for us in 2020. It is one of the few golf courses in the world that has a sustainable element and is winning numerous awards. We hosted the Qatar Masters Golf Tournament in 2020. We also virtually launched Education City Stadium. From a programming point of view, we had ambitious plans for 2020, and instead of stopping these plans when the pandemic hit, we immediately switched to a virtual medium.</p><p><strong><span></span>What are the benefits of digital tools for the achievement of your community development goals?</strong></p><p><span></span>MOHAMMED FAKHROO The digital world has opened new doors for us in terms of scalability. We can now cross the world with our digital programs, which are diverse, ranging from research and education to community development. Qatar Foundation and Education City have an incredible ecosystem spanning 12,000sqkm and houses everything from K-12 to university on the education side, as well as research elements and community programs. This has created a unique ecosystem in the world. After COVID-19 hit, we created educationcity.qa, which complements our Qatar Foundation website. This is essentially an online consolidation of the 50 different entities that operate, thrive, and offer continuous resources to the community. Our unique ecosystem is now online.</p><p><strong><span></span>Where does Qatar Foundation fit in a society as complex and multicultural as Qatar's?</strong></p><p><span></span>AJ Qatar Foundation is a unique space and idea that was developed by Her Highness Sheikha Moza 25 years ago. Like any country, Qatar has public and private sectors that work together, but here the Qatar Foundation fits somewhere in the middle. Again, we have to be agile and constantly adapt to change. What Qatar Foundation has become over the last 25 years, whether organically or otherwise, is the organization that fills those needs that are not being met by other organizations. We make sure we really listen to what the community needs. Partnerships and collaborations are one of the special things that Qatar Foundation offers in the wider space of Qatar. We are open and want to hear from organizations, individuals, and anyone else with feedback on how we can adapt and pivot ourselves to meet different needs.</p><p><span></span><strong>How do Qatar Foundation's three divisions of research, community development, and education cooperate to achieve the National Vision and your goals?</strong></p><p><span></span>MF We cannot achieve success without all three elements, and these three pillars are present in every single program we do. We believe in collaboration. The only guarantee for prosperity for any country is the ability of its people to develop, adapt, and innovate. The natural synergy between our three pillars of education, research, and community development enable us to provide holistic innovation and solutions at a local and international level. One great example is our user-friendly program for children with autism created when we acknowledged that we had not included all our community members in our sport programs. It is exportable to every country that needs to address this same challenge. That is the beauty of Qatar Foundation—the intertwining of those three pillars to find innovative solutions at multiple levels. We have many other examples of this in research, our incubators, and the energy sustainability field, to name a few. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Vodafone Qatar contributed to the digital and knowledge-based economy targets of 2030 Qatar National Vision?</strong></p><p>Like many companies around the world, Vodafone Qatar had to continue to deliver critical national digital infrastructure to keep families connected, enable businesses to operate, students to learn, health care to be delivered, and governments to provide critical services during COVID-19. To meet the evolving needs of our customers, both consumers and enterprises alike, we accelerated a number of digital transformation initiatives and our underlying connectivity infrastructure as part of our long-term vision in Qatar to pioneer digital innovation and to be people's first choice in telecom and digital services. An example of some of the initiatives that came to market in 2020 is our nationwide Narrowband Internet of Things network (NB-IoT) and our IoT Platform that power a number of IoT use cases to support current national priorities to make our cities smarter and fit for the future. Vodafone Qatar has undertaken to support the digital and knowledge-based economic targets of the 2030 Qatar National Vision in two ways: a smart metering deployment with Qatar General Electricity &amp; Water Corporation (KAHRAMAA) that will see the digitalization of Qatar's utilities industry, with smart meters powered by IoT rolled out nationwide; and the implementation of Vodafone's big data and advanced analytics solution and subsequent MoU with Qatar National Tourism Council (QNTC) that will accelerate the country's goal of being a world-class tourist destination through the use of data, advanced analytics, and a layer of AI.</p><p><strong>What is your expansion strategy for your 5G GigaNet Network in the medium term?</strong></p><p>Our 5G GigaNet now covers more than 70% of the country's population and has been deployed across key locations including HIA, several of the FIFA 2022 venues, and prime leisure areas such as Katara and Souq Waqif just to mention a couple. In the medium term, we will continue our investment in 5G technology and facilitate the next wave of innovation. This emerging technology will certainly support Qatar in its ambition to lead in digital transformation and position Qatar as one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world.</p><p><strong>What are the main challenges to bring Qatar digital agenda forward?</strong></p><p>A number of both SMEs and start-ups focused on verticals such as IoT, fintech, e-commerce, and cybersecurity have started to emerge in Qatar. We are focused on working with such companies either through establishing strategic partnerships that enable us to orchestrate our core services with their solutions or by providing them with the most advanced information and communication technology services to support their growth.</p><p><strong>What is Vodafone Qatar's partnership strategy to increase the reach of your solutions in Qatar?</strong></p><p>Any great partnership starts with a strong understanding of the complex challenges our customers face today and by working closely with them to tailor our core services and solutions to their unique needs. The investments we made to buildout our nationwide NB- IoT and launch our IoT Platform stem specifically from an understanding of our customers' complex challenges, testing a number of use cases and then subsequently developing specific technology solutions for these partners.</p><p><strong>What are the main challenges from a technology perspective to organize an event with the dimensions of 2022 FIFA World Cup?</strong></p><p>Given its ultra-fast speed and low latency, Vodafone's 5G will open up a new set of entertainment options related directly to the 2022 FIFA World Cup experience. Broadcasters can use its capabilities to offer exciting live viewing experiences, while fan engagement can become more interactive and immersive with virtual and augmented reality. On the event management and logistics side, 5G will have a transformative effect on how industries operate and engage guests by introducing automation in key services such as transport, crowd safety and stadium operations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you characterize the year for The Peninsula beyond the pandemic?</strong></p><p>COVID-19 surprised everyone and greatly impacted all aspects of economic and social life. The media was no exception, but had its share of the repercussions that are still ongoing. The suspension of economic activities has negatively affected the media in general and print media in particular. However, this did not prevent us from continuing with our media message and our goals to provide readers with timely news and information. The Peninsula continued to be issued in PDF version under work-from-home arrangement. Communication with readers continued through the newspaper's website, which enhanced its role with the support of social media. These platforms played an effective pioneering role in providing information to the readers instantly. Thus, the newspaper maintained its position and still has the highest rate of reading and follow-up on its electronic platforms. We attracted a number of competent journalists during the crisis to preserve its achievements as the best English-language newspaper in the country and to strengthen our position in the media scene.</p><p><strong>How did your young and flexible structure help you to adapt to new digital technologies applicable to information services?</strong></p><p>When The Peninsula newspaper was founded in 1996, we were aware of the urban renaissance, economic development and expansion of investments that the country was witnessing, and attracting large numbers of foreigners to work. This necessitated response to their needs as people who became part of the fabric of Qatari society. Through continuous renewal, improvement of content, innovation, and creating partnerships with various entities, the newspaper was able to become one of the main English newspapers in the country. The Peninsula is considered today the first and best newspaper in Qatar in terms of wide reach, readership, and ability to respond to the needs of the country's financial and business sector. Indeed, its fame has exceeded outside the country, receiving invitations to hold interviews with heads of states and important personalities in a number of countries. As for the challenge of cybersecurity, it is a global issue that was not something specific to Qatar, and the experience of cyber attack on the Qatar News Agency website in May 2017 was the first of its kind, and I hope it will be the last.</p><p><strong>Media groups generally partner with a variety of government bodies, private companies and cultural, sports and other events to increase the reach of its information services. What is your growth strategy in this regard?</strong></p><p>The Peninsula newspaper establishes partnerships with various governmental and non-governmental agencies in the country through which we provide integrated coverage of the activities of these sectors and meet their media needs. The newspaper enjoys high flexibility in its plans that enable it to adapt and respond quickly to the developments in the country and the development projects that are implemented in it. That is why our vision is based first on the local level, but with a global vision, because we live in a world that has turned into something like a global village thanks to the development of communication systems.</p><p><strong>With the 2022 FIFA World Cup fast approaching, what are your plans for the event?</strong></p><p>FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 is one of the most important events. I hope everyone in the region will celebrate it and that the current fabricated blockade and disagreements will end. I expect it to be a distinguished and memorable event and to be perpetuated by the history of football games. Our plans are to strengthen the role of the newspaper before, during and after this World Cup, and we will strengthen the sports section and support it to play a distinguished role in media coverage of various sports activities. The role of social media will also remain important and will be strengthened, as the platforms have the speed to transmit the news in audio, image and readable text.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has beIN managed to navigate the seismic challenges presented by the pandemic, and what have been your takeaways from this unprecedented year?</strong></p><p>It is hard to exaggerate how dramatically the sports and entertainment industry has changed; and how after years of careful planning and strategy everything was turned upside down in a matter of days. 2020 was due to be one of our biggest years of sport, with the Tokyo Olympics and the UEFA Euros being just two of dozens of major events we were scheduled to broadcast. What makes me enormously proud is how we responded and worked through the night for weeks to ensure we kept the show on the road for our subscribers and partners. All our studios—Arabic, English, French, Turkish, and many more covering 43 countries—never once stopped broadcasting. We had teams creating original non-live sports content from scratch. We launched a new beIN Cinema service in April. And when live sport returned on May 23 with the return of the Bundesliga, for three frenetic months up until the UEFA Champions League final on August 23, we produced more premium live sport in that period than any other broadcaster in history. It was an immense achievement. What I learned was that at the end of the day, when challenges come along, you can either make excuses, or make a difference—we chose the latter.</p><p><strong>You are known around the world for leading the global fight against broadcast piracy. It's been a momentous year for beIN and for Qatar on that front, hasn't it?</strong></p><p>We have been relentless in our fight against piracy for over three and a half years now; and we won't stop. Through international legal cases, political lobbying, media scrutiny and commercial pressure, we have deployed every lever of influence to hold to account anyone who steals intellectual property. In June, Qatar won one of its most high-profile legal cases of recent times at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). This was an important moment for beIN and for Qatar as together—side by side—supported by the entire international community (including the most senior levels of the US and UK governments, the European Commission, the WTO, and world sport), we upheld international law. It was also an important moment for the truth, which always prevails.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities for 2021, and how will they contribute to the 2030 Qatar National Vision goals?</strong></p><p>First and foremost, like all businesses, our priority is to keep our head above the water as the pandemic continues — no doubt there will be many more twists, turns and challenges ahead. For us, this means being nimble; being creative; and constantly listening to our subscribers to give them the content they want, when and where they want it. We now have an enormous year of rescheduled sport in 2021, with marquee moments including the Olympics, the Euros, Copa América, the CONCACAF Gold Cup—which Qatar is competing in—to name only a few, and premium live sport will remain the bedrock of our business. However, we will also continue to build our entertainment business in MENA—investing in our movies, series, kids, gourmet, and documentary offerings. We will improve our OTT platform and infrastructure, we will keep fighting piracy, we will promote under-represented sports and talent through our beINSPIRED initiative, and we will continue supporting the WHO and the UN in the global fight against COVID-19. Sport and entertainment are at the heart of Qatar's national vision, and we are proud to support that mission every day. More than anything, I am immensely proud that we are a Qatari company that is constantly raising the bar of excellence locally, regionally, and on the global stage. In everything we do, we strive to showcase the very best of Qatar to the world and bring the world to Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>In 2020, we learnt about the willingness of MOTC to invest in the ICT industry to increase its contribution to Qatar's GDP, which stood at 2.7% in 2018. How do you see this plan developing in the short term?</strong></p><p>The ICT market in Qatar is projected to grow at an annual rate of 5.1% until 2024, with total spending projected to reach USD2.77 billion. As a significant contributor to overall ICT spending, MOTC has made significant investments in the ICT sector through launch and procurement of various digital initiatives that will result in increased ICT contribution to overall GDP. Being at the forefront of global trends, Qatar had already started its digital transformation toward being a smart and connected country. With TASMU Smart Qatar Program, MOTC will be soon launch Smart Qatar Central Platform (SQCP), an IoT-based platform being built on Azure Cloud that has not only spearheaded direct investment in the cloud computing technologies but will also enable indirect investment in the cloud computing sector. Various government and business entities will utilize its capabilities to develop various smart city solutions and technologies. This has resulted in cloud computing being anticipated to have the highest growth rate of revenues, reaching USD1.6 billion, equivalent to 17.8% growth by 2024. Also, part of TASMU Smart Qatar Program, MOTC will be launching 100-plus digital use cases across five priority sectors that will leverage the latest emerging technologies such as IoT, AI, analytics, and cloud. The use cases will be launched through 2021 for the next coming areas and will drive MOTC's investment in innovative and emerging technologies. This will also lead to wider diffusion and application of such solutions in respecting sectors, thus increasing overall investments in the ICT sector.</p><p><strong>What specific initiatives will MOTC prioritize in the short term to advance toward the goals set?</strong></p><p>Through our other MOTC programs, we are also driving efforts to develop a vibrant digital ecosystem. We will see an increase in ICT contribution to overall GDP. Programs such as e-commerce and supporting adoption of smart solutions among small-medium business (SMEs Go Digital) will drive SMEs sector efforts to adopt technologies and improve sustainability and efficiency of various economic subsectors. From a digital skills perspective, digitalization will accelerate the development and growth of the ICT industry (with above-average expected growth of 4.5% until 2030). Equally important is the contribution of investments in digitalization and digital skills in a comprehensive series of industries such as healthcare, environment or education sectors, which are expected to be expedited through technological advancements. This means that in the next few years we will also focus our investments in establishing the right skills foundation so that Qatar's workforce is equipped with best-in-class digital skills necessary to leverage the full economic potential of digitalization. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How have you prepared for the reactivation of the economy and supply chains during the pandemic time?</strong></p><p>Milaha has been extremely proactive during this extraordinary time, and we have successes to report. Our incredible workforce has risen to all the challenges set before them, going further than the extra mile. We were delighted to report strong financial performance. Our operating profit in particular continues to perform well. We are also seeing strong core-business performance. Again, despite the changes and uncertainty over the past months, we continued operating and serving our clients. One of our major priorities is and will continue to be keeping a safe working environment for our employees. In April, we held our first-ever virtual town hall meeting for all employees to reflect on our business operations and most notable achievements over the past 12 months, becoming one of the first firms to play host to such an event. With regard to the reactivation of the economy and supply chains during these past few months, we have been highly active in making changes to how we operate as a company, which will be beneficial to all stakeholders and entities who have dealings with us, whether they are long-standing friends of many decades or new customers. We introduced a brand refresh and new digital systems to reflect the realignment of our overall business strategy. We continue to chart our path toward our vision, despite the challenges.</p><p><strong>The country has a lot of infrastructure developments in the pipeline, which are very relevant to the logistics industry. What are your expansion plans?</strong></p><p>Setting aside all the challenges caused by the pandemic for just a moment, it is right to say that exciting and profitable times for Qatar lie ahead. This is an extremely significant decade ahead of Qatar National Vision 2030, and everyone at Milaha is determined to play their part to ensure it is a tremendously successful one. The various developments and expansion schemes across our nation truly are exciting, while the idea of Qatar becoming a logistics hub for the Middle East, Asia and East Africa is an ambition that we all want to make a reality. Milaha is determined to work to the best of its abilities to ensure its loyal customers receive the very best at all times. Going back to our new marine and technical services pillar, this includes both current activities (ship management, shipping agency, shipyard, bunkering) and introduces new services, such as ship chandlering. We have also combined our truck sales and distribution activities with our land-based asset maintenance and servicing activities. Meanwhile, our existing maritime and logistics pillar now focuses on enabling trade and providing end-to-end supply chain solutions for commercial customers, through our container shipping, ports, freight forwarding, warehousing, and land transport business units. I am certain all these will neatly dovetail with the various projects lined up across our country.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities for the remaining of 2020 and 2021?</strong></p><p>We look at COVID-19 as an opportunity to both further solidify the foundation of our business as well as to launch new service offerings. This is in addition to tackling the priorities that were already identified as part of our medium- and long-term strategy prior to the outbreak. As a first step, we are focusing on mitigating the impact of the pandemic in the short term; however, it is important that these initiatives make us structurally stronger for the coming years as we anticipate further disruptions to the global economy, whether due to trade disputes or black swan events. As part of this, we are doubling down on our efforts to digitalize the business in order to both become more efficient as well as to target new digitally enabled revenue streams. We want to take this opportunity to fundamentally reshape the business model in some of our sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What does the Qatari market represent for Turkish Airlines?</strong></p><p>Economic and cultural relations between Qatar and Turkey have been growing in recent years, and within this framework, Turkish Airlines' global network and high-end services offered all through the journey showed an asset for promoting both countries as a destination. Furthermore, Turkish Airlines and its hub in Istanbul stand as a gateway to the world from Qatar for business or leisure purposes as well.</p><p><strong>Qatar and Turkey enjoy excellent business relations across many sectors. How do you assess this partnership?</strong></p><p>Qatar and Turkey enjoy unique bilateral relations, which has helped Turkish companies and entrepreneurs to choose Qatar as one of their go-to destination for business. Furthermore, Qatar has also its focuses on the tourism sector, and the country has a rich calendar in terms of business, networking, and festive events. The aviation and transportation sector in Qatar has had great development and growth over the last few years, and the competition is relatively high in this market. Turkish Airlines' hospitality, connectivity, and high-end services have received excellent feedback in terms of customer satisfaction. The market looks promising in the years to come, with major international forums and events queued up, such as the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p><p><strong>What is your growth strategy for the air cargo division, which seems to become more important every day?</strong></p><p>Turkish Cargo, the global air cargo brand, has been carrying out the air cargo transportation operations of Turkish Airlines. Having the widest air cargo aircraft network in the world, Turkish Cargo now offers air cargo services to 95 direct freighter destinations. Besides, Turkish Cargo is making use of the passenger flight network of the parent brand Turkish Airlines, which is in the leading position in the world; thus, cargo is being carried to more than 300 destinations by means of passenger aircraft. Turkish Cargo offers one of the best solutions in terms of air and land transport, both domestically and internationally, to meet the needs of its customers and industry partners. Within this framework, Turkish Cargo aims to become one of the top five air cargo brands in the world by 2023. Our brand, which aspires to redefine Istanbul, the intersection point of air cargo traffic, as the logistics center in the world, continues to be preferred for the air cargo transportation by ensuring a sustainable growth thanks to its infrastructure, operational capability, and fleet as well as its highly qualified staff members.</p><p><strong>What impact has the pandemic had on the digitalization of the aviation industry?</strong></p><p>We conducted R&amp;D studies and pilot projects in emerging technology areas such as AI, augmented/virtual reality, the Internet of Things, and blockchain. With the Turkish Airlines Chatbot, Boti, our passengers were provided with the opportunity to inquire about flights, view flight prices, inquire about flight status, check-in assistant, access a mobile boarding pass, airport maps, and campaign inquiries via WhatsApp. We continued to support the work carried out at the IATA AIR Think Tank, which sets standards that will shape the future of airline retail and works together to develop new initiatives in this field. Aiming to optimize the direction finding experience of our passengers at airports, we presented interactive terminal maps of Istanbul Airport, Sabiha Gökçen Airport, and Adnan Menderes Airport to the service of our passengers in the Turkish Airlines Mobile Application.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities for 2021?</strong></p><p>With the launch of Istanbul Airport in 2018, Turkish Airlines has started operating through its new hub, which is at the crossroads of all continents and offers one of the best high-end technologies in terms of travel experience. Our company has then been developing its activities to maintain its position of being one of the most preferred airlines in the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the main highlights for QAA in 2020?</strong></p><p>The major challenge during that period was the pandemic. Because of this, QAA launched its distance learning system given that online learning is the fastest and easiest route in the present situation. The e-learning mechanism guide submitted by Qatar Aeronautical Academy was accredited by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and the agency reported that QAA was among the first academies to migrate to distance learning. Moreover, QAA's guide is used as a criterion for accrediting other academies, and EASA has clarified that it is possible to continue to use the distance learning guide even after the crisis is over. Furthermore, to ensure the new batch would graduate on time, in July QAA held the 2020 graduation ceremony virtually, which was broadcasted on Al-Rayyan TV as well as on different news platforms.</p><p><strong>QAA not only trains pilots, but also other professionals of the civil aviation sector. Can you briefly guide us through your main programs?</strong></p><p>In addition to the pilot training division, QAA has: aircraft maintenance engineering that is recognized by both QCAA and EASA; a new air transport safety electronics personnel (ATSEP) course to prepare graduates to work as airport technicians; an advanced aviation management program (AAMP) designed to teach a range of subjects including the daily operational running of a modern airport; a meteorology department, a recognized training center that trains students to work in National Met services; the air traffic control department (ATC), whose courses follow criteria set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO); and an advanced master's program in aviation safety management (ASM). Moreover, QAA is an approved testing site for IELTS and QAA IELTS testing center and has obtained two certificates of appreciation and distinction from the granting partner of the authority to practice it.</p><p><strong>How do you cooperate with other civil aviation bodies in Qatar to better understand the needs of the sector?</strong></p><p>Being a key training provider in Qatar, we work in collaboration with QCAA and provide various training programs for QCAA staff, HIA, Qatar Armed Forces, and Qatar Airways. Moreover, Qatar's HIA has added much to the aviation sector since 2014, as it is the number-one airport in the world that provides ultra-modern facilities at the disposal of the passenger in addition to its special design features. The ATC tower has become more of a signature piece of architecture that Qatar is identified with.</p><p><strong>What does your recent MoU with Qatar University mean for QAA? Can you also elaborate on the potential accreditation from EASA?</strong></p><p>With the change in the Amiri decree to convert the college into an academy with the possibility of issuing bachelor degrees, QAA started to explore partnership with national and international universities for top-up program and BSc degrees. QU is a leading university in Qatar, and we have been working with it to explore different ways of cooperation. The agreement between QAA and QU will allow both organization to exchange experts in different fields, research, studies, joint seminars, and workshops. QAA always seeks international recognition for its programs, and the pilot training division is an approved training organization (ATO) under the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority. To open the international market for QAA cadet pilots, we applied to EASA head Quarter in Cologne, Germany, for the EASA approval as an approved training organization for the airline transport pilot license program. Moreover, our QAA A320, DA40, and DA42 simulators are approved by EASA, and this will facilitate the EASA ATO approval process and shorten the timeline to get the approval.</p><p><strong>What are your most urgent strategic priorities for 2021?</strong></p><p>QAA is working on ensuring the best blended training for all its students and ensuring that the e-learning process will continue to be a part of the education process, even after the pandemic. QAA prioritizes the health and safety of its staff and students without compromising the learning experience. Additionally, we are also focusing on upgrading our facility as well as our simulators to make sure our students are trained accordingly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your assessment on the evolution of projects with private sector's involvement?</strong></p><p>MOTC has developed a private-sector participation strategy to engage the private sector in the related transport and communication projects as deemed feasible. Based on a predefined multi-criteria assessment framework, the ministry has initiated several potential projects that can be evolved into strategic partnerships between MOTC and the private sector, mainly in feeder bus services, electric bus charging systems, bus parking operations, on-street metered parking, airport vehicle parking, provision of public transport infrastructure on a cost-share basis, ferry services into the Qatar public transport network involving the private sector, the establishment of a bus assembly plant in Qatar, the provision of bus shelters and bus shelter advertising by the private sector, the provision of bus wrapping and advertising as a revenue sharing venture with private companies, and discussions with the private sector for the development of transit-oriented development (TOD) around metro stations.</p><p><strong>What further improvements do Doha Metro and Lusail Tram require to replace or dramatically reduced private transportation in the country?</strong></p><p>The Doha Metro has already made great inroads into private car usage by providing world-class metro services that are connected to most areas of Doha by a network of Metrolink services using mid-sized buses that can provide connectivity from the Metro to most neighborhoods, thus alleviating the need for the second car, and in some cases, the first car for families. MOTC is exploring the extension of Doha Metro to other parts of Qatar in the long term. These extensions would benefit residents and workers and encourage further use of public transport. MOTC will lead the way to dramatically reduce private transportation (in cooperation with the Doha Metro, Lusail Tram and Mowasalat) by implementing the following further improvements soon: promoting residential areas near Metro stations as desirable, cost-effective, and smart places to live for lifestyle reasons; introducing an automated integrated fare collection system that provides seamless payment for bus, taxi, and Metro using credit cards or the Sila dedicated public transit payment card; launching an integrated passenger information and journey planner app and website to ensure everyone in Doha always has their journey planner app on their phone and knows the best way to use the system and get to their destination; promoting the integrated public transport system through extensive marketing campaigns and the launch of an integrated public transport brand “Sila;" providing feeder bus connectivity to Metro stations from residential and commercial areas; increasing the number and frequency of public bus services with an additional 500 buses in 2023 to provide a cheap, reliable, and convenient alternative to private transportation; and introducing long-distance bus rapid transit services between Doha, Al Khor, and Mesaieed.</p><p><strong>2021 is the year in which Hamad Port becomes 100% operational at full capacity. What does maritime cargo transportation represent for the achievement of Qatar's economic independence and diversification?</strong></p><p>Hamad Port's strong capabilities, modern facilities, and advanced systems are leading its position as the gateway to Qatar and a transshipment and a re-export hub in the region, increasing the volume of trade between Qatar and the rest of the world. Last year, Hamad Port achieved a record container volume for the fourth straight year in a row with transshipment volumes rising by 106%. The increase in transshipments is an important sign of the port's role in the region. Multiple container terminals at Hamad Port have been planned to facilitate the expansion of container handling capacity, commensurate with the growing traffic of cargo demand. The port handles a variety of services, including container, general cargo, roll-on/roll-off (RORO) operations, livestock, and offshore supply services. The port has handled more than 5 million TEUs of containerized cargo, more than 5.1 million FT of bulk and breakbulk, 5.9 million FT / 283,000 units of RORO, and more than 1.7 million heads of livestock since it started its commercial operation in December 2016. Efficient management of goods transportation is the key to the achievement of Qatar's economic independence and diversification. Hamad Port is working to attract trade and industrialization to diversify the economy in line with Vision 2030. The services and facilities at Hamad Port have encouraged shipping lines to call their mainline services to Hamad Port directly. The port is currently handling more than 24 direct services of all the major global shipping lines every week. These direct mainline services have opened various new trade routes and opportunities to bolster the growth of trade and industry in Qatar. Hamad Port is instrumental in the efficient shipping of products that companies handle for clients.</p><p><strong>Given the high number of tourists expected for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, how will MOTC cooperate with all stakeholders in Qatar to guarantee a safe and successful development of the event?</strong></p><p>Since the announcement of Qatar as host of the FIFA World Cup 2022, the state began to make necessary preparations for this important sporting event. Plans have been set up, and work began to implement them in high standards. The authorities have applied quality advanced work mechanisms with high-level coordination to host a successful and distinguished edition of the FIFA World Cup. MOTC has worked with the Civil Aviation Authority, HIA, and Qatar Airways to make all possible efforts to prepare for this prominent sporting event. This cooperation resulted in the launch of complete development processes of the aviation sector in the State of Qatar. Devices and systems used in air navigation were updated, increasing aircraft routes and providing all necessary support to ensure the highest safety levels considering the anticipated increase in air traffic and passenger traffic of visitors during the tournament. With the aim of increasing the capacity of HIA, QCAA recently signed a contract with the leading Swedish company IBG specialized in the management, consulting, and training of aviation sector. The agreement aims to provide all requirements for hosting FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is HIA preparing for the reactivation of the economy and the resumption of flights?</strong></p><p>HIA's successful transformation of its airport experience amidst the COVID-19 pandemic was fueled by a robust business continuity plan that prioritized the health and well-being of staff and passengers while keeping the airport's doors open to repatriate stranded passengers and deliver essential goods across the globe. The airport optimized its operations with smart solutions to rise to the challenges presented by the pandemic. HIA invested in Smart Screening Helmets, which are wearable intelligent helmets that are portable, safe, and effective in enabling contactless temperature measurement. HIA also introduced UV disinfectant robots, which are fully autonomous mobile devices, emitting concentrated UV-C light, effective in eliminating the majority of infectious microorganisms and are being deployed in vulnerable high passenger flow areas to reduce the spread of pathogens. In addition, HIA installed C2 technology, the latest security screening system, which acts as a significant COVID-19 counter measure by reducing possible cross-contamination in passenger carry-on bags. Inbound luggage is likewise sanitized by the airport's UV-C disinfection tunnels. Moreover, HIA was the first airport to trial an innovative cabin baggage X-ray screening system that utilizes UV-C disinfectant lights retrofitted into the scanners' trail return systems. The airport also pioneered its own technological solutions. Using computer vision and AI, HIA's internal teams developed an automated facial detection system to ensure the wearing of masks. The home-grown technology was rapidly integrated into HIA's thermal scanning stations. The implementation of such technologies elevates the airport's hygiene standards by limiting human contact at security checkpoints, making the process safer and faster for both staff and passengers.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of the improvements to customer experience that this phase will bring to HIA? </strong></p><p>The airport's multi-phase expansion project will enhance its position as the preferred gateway for travel while accommodating the success and growth of its national carrier, Qatar Airways. Hence, it is a direct investment into the country's future. Catering to Qatar's thriving economic diversification and development, the expansion will play a significant role in delivering HIA's promise of the airport-of-the-future by enhancing the multi-dimensional offerings of the five-star airport. It will integrate world-class art, a refreshing environment of lush greenery, contemporary retail and dining concepts and leisure attractions and facilities under one expansive terminal. The greenery will be introduced to reduce the stress of travel and inspire positive emotions among travelers. HIA will feature a 10,000-sqm indoor tropical garden and 268-sqm water feature. The expansion design will allow passenger flow to seamlessly tie up with the existing terminal and at the same time, improve the overall passenger experience by minimizing travel distances for connections, as well as providing clear and intuitive wayfinding as passengers move through the lush rainforest. HIA is a standout among other airports of its size for the fact that it operates under one expansive terminal, giving it a competitive edge in terms of managing operations. The airport's expansion will also be part of that same terminal. This helps HIA easily guide passengers toward a specific journey.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities for 2021 and 2022?</strong></p><p>As airlines reinstate their flights and border restrictions start to ease, HIA has already put critical measures in place to ensure a cautious recovery, while maintaining the safety and wellbeing of all staff and passengers. The airport is working toward the normalization of travel in the safest way possible. The latest set of measures adopted by the airport works toward regaining passenger trust and rebuilding confidence in air travel. Nonetheless, Qatar's airport is also heading in a direction of growth and development with the airport's expansion plans. The expansion of HIA is a vital part of the future success of the Qatar Airways Group. HIA will continue to invest in infrastructure and cutting-edge technology to provide tailored solutions that address the ever-changing traveler needs and wants, especially against the backdrop of the pandemic.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How have you been preparing for the reactivation of the economy and the resumption of flights during the pandemic?</strong></p><p>Since the beginning of the pandemic our main focus has been to take people home safely. Qatar Airways is one of the few global airlines that never stopped flying during the crisis. Our focus is not only on resuming destinations, but also on serving as many connections as possible to enable our passengers to travel where and whenever they want. One of our greatest assets in these challenging times is our highly flexible fleet: a mix of fuel-efficient aircraft and strategic network management has enabled us to resume operations quickly and to expand our service in response to passenger demand. As entry restrictions around the world begin to ease, we expect passenger demand to increase gradually. The airline has introduced the latest safety and hygiene measures during the same period, making it one of the few international airlines that is fully equipped to resume operations. We apply the highest standards of cleanliness on board with our aircraft thoroughly disinfected and equipped with industrial-size HEPA filters that remove 99.97% of viral and bacterial contaminants for re-circulated air, and thermal screening of our crew. In September 2020, Qatar Airways became the first global carrier to operate Honeywell's Ultraviolet (UV) Cabin System, further advancing its hygiene measures onboard. I have every confidence that the Qatar Airways Group will emerge stronger from this difficult period and continue to innovate and set the standards that our competitors can only hope to emulate.</p><p><strong>What is your strategy to keep leading rankings during the new normal?</strong></p><p>We will gradually reinstate suspended destinations and additional frequencies in line with expected relaxation of entry restrictions around the world with a focus on key global destinations and partner hubs. From the experience we have gained throughout the pandemic, we have further established ourselves as one of the world's most trusted airlines. The success of the airline's robust COVID-19 monitoring, detection, and hygiene program has resulted in more than 99.988% of passengers travelling COVID-19-free on board and 0.002% of operating cabin crew have been affected on board to date. These latest statistics are a clear indication that, with the adoption of the right measures such as meticulous on-board safety, hygiene and social distancing procedures in place at airports, and compliance with the testing and entry requirements of local authorities, air travel does not need to be a source of concern to passengers. In October 2020, we extended our commitment to offering passengers flexible booking options, for all tickets issued before December 31, 2020. In December 2020, Hamad International Airport became the first airport in the Middle East and Asia to be awarded a five-star COVID-19 Airport Safety Rating by Skytrax.</p><p><strong>What is your partnership strategy with other institutions and companies?</strong></p><p>Qatar's National Tourism Strategy 2030 charts the next 10 years of the tourism sector's growth and defines the long-term goals for the country providing a framework in which national strategies and implementation plans can be developed in conjunction with stakeholders. Service excellence is one of the key pillars of our tourism strategy. These measures outlined in this strategy align along the central goal of ensuring an exceptional guest experience across every touch point of the visitor journey. While working together as a cohesive group, Qatar Airways, Hamad International Airport, and QNTC can facilitate interactions and shared experiences between Qatar's residents and its guests to achieve this end. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Ashghal has been one of the key axes of the great economic and infrastructure development Qatar and Doha have experienced in recent times. Can you brief us on its main contributions to Qatar's well-being?</strong></p><p>Over the last 15 years, Ashghal has continued to create advanced and sustainable infrastructure that meets the current needs and future aspirations of the State of Qatar. As one of the key enablers of the Qatar National Vision 2030, all of Ashghal's programs and projects are being implemented to ensure the country's roads and drainage infrastructure is upgraded to create a long-term sustainable network that continues to support economic growth. Ashghal's undertakings cover a vast range of programs being implemented across the country, which are delivering some of the largest expressways and integrated infrastructure projects, providing new free-flowing roads linking ports and logistical locations, thus boosting trade and commerce, and supporting the socio-economic growth of Qatar. In 2019 alone, we opened key highways that span vital arteries connecting areas with a total length reaching more than 120km. Ashghal's Local Areas Infrastructure Program continues to maintain the road and drainage network across Qatar through the development of infrastructure to serve the residential areas and citizens' subdivisions. This is in addition to enhancing the operations and maintenance of Qatar's road and drainage networks and delivering the essential public buildings projects that include health and educational buildings. Despite the global challenges, Ashghal has continued to embark on a phase marked by acceleration in the pace of project implementation and delivery, which has resulted in a robust operating and performance outcome.</p><p><strong>How will Qatar guarantee the timely delivery of the projects in spite of the disruptions caused by the pandemic, and what will be the future of the infrastructure sector once this huge wave of developments is over?</strong></p><p>Infrastructure development did not stop during the pandemic. With strict health and safety compliance, Ashghal's projects continued to progress as per project timelines, some of them ahead of schedule. In our efforts to pave the road to FIFA World Cup 2022, Ashghal has already completed 95% of the roads leading to the stadiums. We are geared up to continue working at the same pace and with the same commitment to implement all infrastructure projects despite the current worldwide economic crisis. To stop the spread of COVID-19, Ashghal along with its contractors and consultants has developed and implemented emergency plans that include preventive measures to protect workers, employees, and residents of the areas to reduce and control infection. Ashghal is gradually transitioning from an authority entrusted with awarding and executing efficient sustainable infrastructure projects to an entity that focuses on the operation and maintenance of the state's road and drainage networks and delivering quality services and solutions in managing projects and assets. Our plan post 2030 aims to provide integrated infrastructure and drainage networks for all areas in Qatar.</p><p><strong>How will the PPP Law change the role of the public sector and Ashghal in the infrastructure development of Qatar?</strong></p><p>PPPs will play a vital role in further developing the private sector and will be an important mechanism for future projects. In continuation of the country's efforts to increase the participation of the local and international private sector, Ashghal is extending the PPP model across other projects. We have listed projects for which feasibility studies have been done in coordination with relevant government entities, within the framework of requirements of the law regulating partnerships between public and private sector. Ashghal has already bid for tenders on some projects in the fields of buildings and wastewater treatment, and there are other projects in the pipeline for partnerships between the two sectors currently undergoing a feasibility study, and we are hopeful of successful bidding of these projects for the benefit of public and private sectors. We are also working in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Education and Higher Education toward implementing the Qatar Public Private Partnership Schools Development program, which will follow best-in-class PPP practice.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What has been your experience in recent years?</strong></p><p>2019 was the year of the big things. We completed the 13 major skylights meaning we had effectively made the building watertight. We completed the majority of the external trunk utilities, which meant that later in 2019 we were able to connect the cooling, power and water systems. These were big milestones and of particular interest to our retailers and their fit out planning. Our focus in early 2020 was authority approvals, and we spent considerable energy getting ready for this. These landlord major approvals are a prerequisite for the tenants to be able to get theirs so it was vital. COVID-19 was a major speed bump in our opening strategy. While the work progress slowed somewhat, we felt the major impact through our retailers. We significantly amplified our communication to them with the result that all were in support of the opening to be planned for September 2021.</p><p><strong>What makes Lusail the perfect location for replicating the original Place Vendí´me?</strong></p><p>I would not agree it is a replica but rather Place Vendí´me 2.0 the modern, fresh, and contemporary version in the most vibrant community in the world. When we first presented our idea of Place Vendí´me 2.0 we had significant buy-in from the world's major retailers like LVMH, Kering, and Richemont. It is an often repeated truism, but location is everything. Brands could see that Lusail was not only in the right country, in the right city, and in the right district but also the quantum and the quality of infrastructure meant it was a no-brainer in terms of location. Then our job was to define, create, and deliver the right product for Lusail. It was clear it needed to be a destination that would resonate with the well-travelled Qatari consumer, the local family market, and all those in between.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the main highlights for Msheireb Properties over the past year?</strong></p><p>For the last part of 2019 and the first half of 2020, Msheireb Properties was extremely successful and we saw outstanding achievements in our journey. In the second half of 2019, Msheireb Downtown Doha saw the opening of its third five-star hotel, the Park Hyatt Doha, which followed the openings of the Alwadi Hotel - MGallery and Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Doha, both of which were launched in early 2019. We also worked on the connections with Doha Metro, which has become extremely popular with residents. In 2020, Msheireb Properties signed a collaboration agreement with Qatar University in the area of smart cities and an MoU with Siemens to provide smart city solutions within Msheireb Downtown Doha. The year also saw the virtual launch of Al Khail Apartments, for which we offered virtual tours for those looking to live in our smart city, allowing them to discover our unique offerings from the comfort of their own homes. Finally, we cannot forget the launch of Msheireb Tram, our smart transportation solution for Msheireb Downtown Doha, inaugurated in 2020.</p><p><strong>How is the rapid adoption of digital technologies during the pandemic impacting your strategy?</strong></p><p>The early vision of Msheireb Downtown Doha set by the board focused on building a smart infrastructure in this development and subsequently changing the way people think about urban living and improving their overall quality of life. It was a real test for us to showcase how strong we are and how we can face this extraordinary situation. During the pandemic, we truly experienced the importance of technology in finding solutions. We were equipped with the latest smart solutions and dealing with this pandemic was fast and smooth for us. From the beginning, we invested to be one of the smartest city districts in the world. Thanks to our early investments in communications and infrastructure, there were no disruptions. Msheireb Properties is completely in line with the vision of Qatar 2030. We support human development, even in the most challenging scenarios. Furthermore, we hold the highest standards of corporate governance, ethics, and environmental policy. On top of this, we support local talent and are actively looking to increase our Qatarization ratio, as well as the enhancement of local culture and heritage. Our future is based on the concept of collective gain, where we enrich all the lives we touch. In pursuit of this, we will create a knowledge ecosystem inspired by Qatar National Vision 2030, through which we will deliver cultural, societal, environmental, and knowledge wealth for all whom we work with.</p><p><strong>How will the new PPP law affect development plans for Msheireb Properties?</strong></p><p>The private sector will play a vital role in adopting the latest smart solutions and turning Doha into a smart city of the future. In Msheireb Downtown Doha, we are already leveraging these laws. We have active partnerships with private-sector companies that are providing a wide range of solutions and services in areas such as home smart solutions, inner-city transportation, smart parking, smart and sustainable offices, and residential spaces, among others. The PPP Law will have a positive impact in our city district as it will increase footfall. There has been growing interest from international firms who would like to have a presence in Qatar and need the private sector to help achieve all our goals and develop Msheireb Downtown Doha to its full potential.</p><p><strong>What are your plans for 2021?</strong></p><p>2021 will be another year of activation; we are moving at full speed in terms of opening stores and bringing in retailers, with international brands opening here for the first time at Msheireb Downtown Doha. We will be launching our mall, Msheireb Galleria, at the end of the first quarter. We have reached only 40% of our capacity and will complete phase four in the second half of the year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What has been your experience over the last year?</strong></p><p>We have managed through the pandemic relatively successfully. Almost immediately our people started working remotely. Much of our work was already moving to the cloud, and our Qatar business has been one of the leading advocates for AECOM's cloud-based delivery. In 2019, we delivered and inaugurated the Al Janoub stadium, which used to be called Al Wakrah. Al Rayyan stadium is our other FIFA 2022 project, which is also nearing completion. We have a great proven delivery record on the stadium side. The other real successes were threefold. First, we won the Engineering News Record Global Best Project in 2019 for our Inner Doha Resewerage Implementation Strategy (IDRIS) project. Second, we delivered the bus connection to the metro that brings visitors out into the rapid feeder and into Al Wakrah stadium. We are starting to see the whole fabric of the city coming together and we can see AECOM's role in that. Third, over the last year, we have been recognized as a four-star supplier by Raytheon's Integrated Defense Systems business, an American defense equipment manufacturer, for a project in Qatar.</p><p><strong>What will drive growth for AECOM in Qatar in the future once the current wave of development is over?</strong></p><p>As the country looks to conclude major real estate programs such as Lusail City, we see potential growth there. That might be through partnering directly as a designer or it may be with a design-build contractor, which we are seeing more and more. There are opportunities to partner with top-tier contractors, and that will not go away. In the public sector there will also continue to be significant investment in stitching the fabric of the city together. There is the whole overlay from the World Cup, the legacy after the World Cup, and also what we put in place for the local community. One of our biggest programs for Ashghal is the local roads and drainage program. Some of it is greenfield, and some of it is retrofitting the right level of infrastructure for the community. Qatar has become a mature market so we have to keep close to key clients and identify new im.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Seib Insurance recently organised the Seib Al Massiya Golf Tournament, in line with Qatar's aim of building a strong sports sector in the run-up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. What opportunities does sport open up for insurers in Qatar?</strong></p><p>Not only in the run-up to 2022, but equally as part of the Qatar National Vision 2030, we are proud to promote and sponsor sporting events that contribute to the nation's health and well-being. As a provider of medical insurance coverage, there is obviously a certain synergy for us in associating our products with sport. That is why, together with our friends and partners at the Education City Golf Club, we organised the Seib Al Massiya Golf Tournament—"Massiya" being the name of our advanced healthcare plan. Giving prizes and policies with a total value of QR1 million, we have created a prestigious event that we believe makes a powerful statement about our commitment to helping build a stronger, more coherent community that will certainly lead to a better tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Compared to global standards, annual premiums as a percentage of GDP are very low in Qatar and the Middle East generally. Has COVID-19 raised awareness of the need for improved insurance penetration across the region?</strong></p><p>Over the past decade, Qatar's insurance industry has been among the fastest growing in the region. But, as your question implies, that is because we were starting from a very low base—with huge potential for growth, which has still been only partially realized. Certainly, the COVID-19 pandemic, whether you look at the health emergency itself or at the global business and economic crisis it has triggered, can only focus greater attention on the vital importance of the financial protections that the insurance sector offers.</p><p><strong>How is Seib adapting to new insurtech trends, especially with regard to potentially high-growth service sectors in Qatar, such as SMEs and retail?</strong></p><p>Insurtech as a business model is still emerging, along the same lines as the fintech concept. But a more tech-savvy approach does represent the future, and our investment in a range of new technologies has already been significant. As more and more insurance-related functions move online, we continue to invest in the systems security infrastructure needed to keep our clients' data safe, as well as take us to the next level in digital distribution and AI. That said, we do believe that technology should assist customer service, not replace it. Person-to-person contact—especially in Arab cultures—is fundamental to good business, because of the trust and loyalty it generates. Our superior customer service, allied to innovative solutions, has been particularly attractive in the SME and retail segments, which in turn has helped make Seib Insurance one of Qatar's great success stories. </p><p><strong>Qatar has approved legislation to make health insurance mandatory for expatriates and visitors. What would be your assessment of the impact of the new law on the local insurance sector?</strong></p><p>Clearly, the new health insurance law looks set to increase the uptake of private medical insurance and it is a piece of legislation that we are very enthusiastic about. All stakeholders should benefit—primarily the public, as no resident in the state of Qatar will be left uninsured, which supports the social and human development pillars of the Qatar National Vision 2030. For the insurance market, the advantages are also expected to include a doubling of premiums in personal insurance, beyond the health insurance sector. Customer service will be key, and Seib's excellence in building customer loyalty will give us a competitive edge. Medical centres in Qatar will compete on healthcare quality and delivery, ensuring the very highest global standards. Seib is ready for the new legislation and has already partnered with the best healthcare providers to serve our clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Beema has moved to its new office in Lusail City, an upcoming smart city that will serve as a venue for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. What does this change mean for Beema?</strong></p><p>Lusail is upcoming smart city. The new Beema HQ comprises two basement levels, the ground and mezzanine levels, as well as another three floors to be leased out. This is a strategic investment by Beema; considering the fact that Lusail could be major business hub, I expect the rental income to increase considerably. From a business point of view, being in our own building, especially at an extremely prestigious location, significantly boosts the image of the company and demonstrates our strong financial base.</p><p><strong>Digitalization has gained incredible importance in recent years. How has Beema managed to keep up with trends in insurtech, and how is this helping to improve customer service and internal efficiency?</strong></p><p>Beema has always believed in the digitalization of the business, and we were giving thrust to this, even before the pandemic. Most of the back-office process, particularly the motor claims process, was fully digitalized and paperless, except for a few legal cases. While we were selling policies via our offices in addition to online and door-to-door services, the pandemic helped us push our sales through the digital medium and discourage walk-in customers, even for lodging claims. In fact, during pandemic we closed down two of our branches and shifted our focus to telesales, online, and so on and claims processes over phone, email, and WhatsApp. Our clients are extremely satisfied, as their insurance requirements are fulfilled from the comfort of their homes or office. We are also in process of installing a self-service kiosk soon at some vantage locations where there is public traffic.</p><p><strong>Moody's has upgraded Beema's rating to A3 with a stable outlook. What have been the contributing factors to this improvement?</strong></p><p>Moody's rating upgrade for Beema to A3 demonstrates Beema's long-term objective and vision. There are various factors for this rating upgrade, such as its structured underwriting, risk management, strong bottom line year on year, healthy market share, quality investments, strong board, stable management, and many more.</p><p><strong>Despite Qatar's highly competitive insurance market, Beema is a top tier takaful player. What are your plans to maintain this strong position and explore new sectors and segments as Qatar embarks on further economic diversification?</strong></p><p>I always believe a fair competition is a must to get the best out of companies. It forces us to think out of the box. Beema continuously works to come out with innovative products and services for our customers. Be it door-to-door services for polices, registering motor claims by phone or WhatsApp, or picking up the accident car for repair from our customer's place, Beema has always been in the forefront of customer services. It is not always the price that a customer looks at, but also the service that they get. This is probably the unique selling point for Beema being a top-tier takaful player.</p><p><strong>What is Beema's outlook for 2021?</strong></p><p>Beema's outlook for 2021 remains stable, with a projected single-digit growth for this year. Considering the FIFA World Cup is only a year away, we believe reasonable growth is possible even though the current pandemic situation may pose some challenges.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What were the highlights of Qatar's financial system last year? How has the pandemic affected stability and what measures have you taken to counter its impact?</strong></p><p>The banking sector, with a high level of capital and a low delinquency rate remains safe, sound and solid. The proactive regulatory and supervisory approach of QCB ensures smooth sailing of the financial sector during the challenging periods. Enhanced macroprudential regulation and introduction of IFRS-9 standards, necessitated banks to increase the holding of high quality liquid assets and provisioning for non-performing loans. Moreover, the banking sector has improved its funded liquidity by lengthening the maturity structure and expanding the geographical diversity of its external sources of funding. To mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government had implemented a stimulus package of over 11% of GDP. Within this framework, market liquidity is ensured through QAR50 billion zero REPO facility. New credit facilities through a national guarantee scheme and deferring the repayment of loan instalments assisted the affected business units to mitigate the business losses due to restrictions imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19 to a greater extent. Digital financing and other financial innovations are other focus areas for the banking sector during this period. Social distancing measures, shifting customer preferences and continuously changing the technological environment provided necessary momentum to these activities. QCB on its part is in the process of providing an enabling regulatory infrastructure, which defines the environment under which the financial sector should operate, while ensuring protection of customers. Needless to say, to enhance digital financial transactions and to support the social distancing measures, QCB has launched the Qatar Mobile Payment System during the year, which provides a new and safe method for fast electronic payment.</p><p><strong>What key policies and circumstances will determine the evolution of credit flow in Qatar in the next few years?</strong></p><p>Qatar was quick to respond to the blockade and the economy sailed through the challenging macroeconomic environment successfully. The financial sector returned to normalcy after an initial period of capital outflows. Qatar pursued various reform measures to meet the needs of international investors. The major thrust of the measures has been to strengthen and increase the space for the private sector, create an environment conducive for attracting foreign investment, and ensure the development of a knowledge-based economy by leveraging technology. A new Strategic Plan for Financial Sector Regulation was published in 2018, in close coordination among the three domestic regulators. The strategy provided a roadmap to guide the financial sector in its future endeavor towards building a sound and resilient financial sector. </p><p><strong>What would a consolidation wave mean for Qatar banking sector's profitability and efficiency, and how will this process develop in the next few years?</strong></p><p>The merger of two banks in 2019 originated from the individual banks, where the banks came with the consolidation proposal and QCB provided the necessary approval after conducting legal and financial due diligence. The feasibility study conducted showed the merger would be beneficial with lower cost and higher efficiency. The latest result published by the merged banks indicated the same whereas the merged entity reported increase in profits for the half year ended 2020. The possibility of further consolidation of banks depends solely on the individual banks business strategy. It is not desirable for the central bank to stifle the creativity and drive for efficiency of the banking sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the main milestones for Dyarco in 2020?</strong></p><p>When COVID-19 occurred, we were prepared as a society. We know how to think out of the box and understand the opportunities that challenges offer. There are some issues that we could not handle, but they opened other paths. For us, the best thing to happen during COVID-19 was that we developed our teams to be much more productive and coordinated. We were also fortunate that our cash flow was not severely affected because of the measures taken by His Highness the Amir. In comparative terms, Qatar was one of those countries that had little to complain about.</p><p><strong>What are your growth strategies to expand to other sectors, and what is your focus over the next 10 years toward the Qatar National Vision 2030?</strong></p><p>The blockade gave us the opportunity to develop internal resources. Since the blockade, we have started to understand that in order to be committed to the national goals, such as the 2030 National Vision, a company has to establish solid production units aligned with the principles of the vision. Now that the blockade has been lifted, we have more supplying options if necessary, though the strategy remains the same. We need to produce here, which is our growth strategy toward 2030. For example, although we have not started the commercial production of our new paint factory yet, we have already done all the registration and administrative procedures. We established the company and are now doing much better than we used to. There has been a great deal of industry coming into the country, and that will not change. For example, now in many large supermarkets, the Made in Qatar section is huge. Now, with the lifting of the blockade, Made in Qatar products will be sold in stores in Dubai and Saudi Arabia, so our growth strategy is definitely based on this strategy. Depending on competition in terms of pricing and product quality, we will have to adjust the sectors of interest and our strategy.</p><p><strong>What digital strategies and new technologies have you been adopting during this time of limited human interactions?</strong></p><p>We are not traveling as much as in the past, though we are communicating more, faster, and more efficiently than ever before from our screens. Now, shipping costs have dramatically risen, so technology allows us to control costs and compensate loses. There will be a stabilization of shipping rates, and margins will be interesting thanks to the new trend of communicating digitally. Physical interactions will only be for the most important issues.</p><p><strong>What key factors made the government in Qatar so successful during this period?</strong></p><p>The key is protecting the circulation of cash in the economy. The government reacted immediately to COVID-19; it injected QAR75 billion in order to support most affected industries, particularly SMEs, retail, tourism, real estate, and more. If these sectors had not received this support, they would have struggled to survive. All these were taken care of by the state by refinancing the loss of revenue. The economy continued to function, though some industries still suffered heavily. Hotels and restaurant segments suffered heavily but they were all compensated by the state by taking care of their losses to some extent. The quick reaction of the government allowed most companies and industries to survive.</p><p><strong>What are your main priorities for 2021?</strong></p><p>Once the confidence is built up and returns, there will be more business transactions, and liquidity will improve. That is our first priority: to assess how the situation and market trends will develop. If there are no improvements, we will have to continue focusing on cost control to maintain our performance in 2021. We are proud that we kept some areas operational and have had a fairly successful result because of local demand and ongoing projects, like the 2022 World Cup. We will maintain the same strategy for 2021.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has COVID-19 altered your strategy, and what have become your geographical and operative priority areas of focus since the start of the pandemic? </strong></p><p>Qatar Charity has implemented a total of 21,505 development projects since 2019 in 42 countries around the world. The total cost of these projects exceeded QAR558 million. The projects targeted various developmental fields such as education, health, water, and income-generating projects. Regarding the measures and strategies implemented amid the outbreak of COVID-19, Qatar Charity has focused its efforts inside and outside the State of Qatar. Its humanitarian action faced various challenges due to travel restrictions. However, we continued working on strengthening international cooperation and international partnerships with prominent organizations such as UNICEF. Moreover, we focused our work on providing urgent aid to countries in need. Our priority was to curb the pandemic's spread by providing medical equipment, medicines, sterilizers, and food aid to affected countries.</p><p><strong>What is Qatar Charity's strategy to balance between international and national aid programs, and how can Qatar improve its internal well-being. How will Qatar Charity act in this regard?</strong></p><p>In addition to our work within the State of Qatar, we have offices in more than 30 countries that work toward achieving sustainable development. In addition, Qatar Charity has established a designated sector for local development. It is dedicated to implementing various development programs, including cultural, social, and sports programs, that focus on vulnerable community members such as orphans, widows, and workers. </p><p><strong>How will digitalization improve the reach and efficiency of your already invaluable work? Can you share with us your partnership strategy in this regard? </strong></p><p>Digitalization has dramatically simplified our work. For instance, online donations were made possible thanks to such technological advancement. Now, all the information that donors need can be found on our website. In fact, Qatar Charity's applications act as an effective link between our organization and our community members. I consider that digitalization has definitely improved our work.</p><p><strong>What are your most urgent strategic priorities for the remaining of 2020 and 2021?</strong></p><p>The new vision at Qatar Charity strives for a world where societies and people enjoy their right to live in peace and prosperity, as well as securing protection and assistance whenever they face exceptional circumstances during disasters and crises. Qatar Charity strives to realize a world where all individuals, especially children, enjoy their fundamental rights without discrimination and live in dignity. This vision came about three years after the international community adopted the 2030 plan expressed in a number of global initiatives such as the sustainable development goals, the world humanitarian summit outcomes, and the Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction. This strategy reflects our belief that the world needs intensified efforts to face the current development and humanitarian challenges that hinder the development efforts in many countries and threaten their resilience, stability, and security. Qatar Charity is concerned with a set of strategic issues closely related to the fundamental rights of beneficiaries and targeted communities. Our five-year strategic plan will focus on education, food security, climate change, crises and emergency response, social protection system, sustainability, economic empowerment, resilience to disasters and crises, utilizing technology, and improving people's living conditions and dignified living.</p><p><strong>Can you elaborate on your mechanisms for monitoring donations and tracking projects?</strong></p><p>Qatar Charity provides donors with unique features for live tracking of their donations around the world through its field offices. Detailed reports, projects status, projects progress timeline—all these features are sent to donors in order to show the impact of their contributions. Through Qatar Charity app, available on PlayStore and AppStore, donors have access to check projects information and much more. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>The labor market in Qatar has seen recent changes such as the introduction of a non-discriminatory minimum wage and the generalization of teleworking. How can we expect the labor market to evolve in the coming years?</strong></p><p>The implementation of the new law aids the change to a more accomplished and dynamic workforce, which is key in order for the Qatar National Vision 2030 to be enabled. The labor market will grow and help support economic recovery from the crisis wrought by COVID-19. Economic growth will proceed to be long term. By introducing these significant changes, Qatar has now set a precedent and will continue to evolve and be committed to a having extremely prosperous labor market. The labor market will provide workers with more freedom and protection and, at the same time, provide employers with additional choices. Qatar aims to be a beacon of light when it comes to reforming the labor market. The labor reform speaks positively and is evident of moving forward and in the right direction. I believe Qatar will also introduce new labor reforms that will help it be even more competitive on a global scale.</p><p><strong>You were appointed a member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Legal Committee as well as a member of Qatar Sports Arbitration Foundation (QSAF). What does it mean for Essa Al Sulaiti Law Firm as a specialized firm in the sports industry?</strong></p><p>It is a great honor for me and my law firm to be appointed as a member of AFC Legal Committee as well as QSAF. As a specialized law firm in the sports sector, our goal is to become increasingly involved in the industry. As a professional in sports law, it is a dream to be recognized for the exemplary work that the law firm provides. Thus, through hard work, determination, and perseverance, only a select few have been appointed as members of the aforementioned entities. However, this comes with a great deal of responsibility, which Essa Al Sulaiti Law Firm is ready to shoulder, due to the rapid growth of the sports industry in Qatar. Essa Al Sulaiti Law Firm is extremely excited for the upcoming years, where the 2022 World Cup will be held, as well as the 2030 Asian games. This will be a monumental moment for Qatar and a valuable experience for our law firm, since we specialize in sports law.</p><p><strong>What is Essa Al Sulaiti Firm's outlook for 2021?</strong></p><p>This is a success story. Even though COVID-19 has forced many businesses to hit a pause on their progression and initiatives, we have managed to push through and focus on how to thrive. We have accelerated our digitization by implementing new technology and attempting to only use soft copies and digital documents. We have evolved our customer relationship and services, because during the pandemic, we made ourselves easily available, even in the sanctuary of our own homes. This has built trust with our existing clientele in 2020, and it has proceeded to continue in 2021 with our existing and new clients. We have had an excellent start in 2021, with an increase of 25% of litigation work, as well as many new clients seeking counsel from our law firm. Legal services are one of the most important industries in the world markets. We are expecting to see an increase in demand for legal services. Essa Al Sulaiti Law Firm can and will address this increased demand in the industry in many different ways. Finally, COVID-19 introduced special types of disputes and extremely challenging cases due to the sector being negatively affected economically. Essa Al Sulaiti Law Firm was successful in securing several judgments for our client where COVID-19 was considered as force majeure, which will definitely be a seen as a benchmark for future cases.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you guide us through the main achievements of QFC in 2020?</strong></p><p>Despite the challenges we faced due to the global pandemic, QFC experienced a remarkable 78% growth with 364 new firms registered on its platform in 2020. Profits of QFC firms rose over 2020, with the aggregate tax take rising nearly 68% YoY. A variety of QFC firm activities expanded, with commercial opportunities greater than ever before. At the same time, assets under management of institutions on our platform more than doubled compared to a year earlier, which pointed to the health of the financial sector. Within business development (BD), which I oversee, growth has manifested across its core areas, increasing the number of registered licenses by 71% compared to 2019, totaling 318 by year-end 2020. Because of these achievements, projections have been made of BD-licensed firms to reach an approximate: 4,000 FTEs, USD1,134 million in revenues to be generated by QFC entities, and USD1,327 million of assets held by 2022.</p><p><strong>In 2021, we enter in the final decade to realize the Qatar National Vision 2030. How does this situation impact your strategy over the next decade, and does QFC have a focus on sectors and geographical origin of investors?</strong></p><p>QFC's strategy is aligned with the Qatar National Vision 2030, geared toward a diverse and knowledge-based economy. This strategy includes a keen focus on high value-adding services such as the digital, media, sports, and financial service sectors, which is analogous with Qatar's positioning in those fields. Another facet of the QFC strategy is our emphasis on moving more broadly into geographical markets in APAC such as China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Pakistan, and South Korea, as well as the US, parts of Europe and Russia. We are also looking to boost our high-net worth individuals' product offering to further service these markets and customers.</p><p><strong>The government has established other free zones and investment ecosystems in the country, such as QFZA and QSTP. What makes QFC a unique ecosystem in 2021?</strong></p><p>QFC is an onshore jurisdiction, providing an ideal environment for international, local, and regional companies to flourish and grow in Qatar and beyond. Since its inception in 2005, QFC's role and contribution to Qatar and its economy has evolved, expanding its permitted activities and enhancing its product offerings in line with country priorities and business needs. However, over its entire 15-year history, QFC has continued its original focus on finance and professional services. This role complements the activities of QFZA and QSTP, which have their own niche industry mandates that focus on export-oriented manufacturing and scientific research, respectively. The collective efforts of these three platforms drive Qatar's economic diversification across all industries.</p><p><strong>Qatar has been given a stable economic outlook which includes a 2.5-3% growth rate in 2021. What is the role of the QFC in the recovery after this year's recession?</strong></p><p>The health crisis abruptly changed the global business ecosystem, and QFC quickly adapted to the new business norm. We provided financial relief measures, introduced technical solutions, and enhanced our digital outreach to help our firms and the larger business community withstand the crisis and enable business continuity. Qatar and QFC have proven themselves resilient in past crises, and this adaptability will continue to serve it well in 2021 and beyond. QFC sees its role this year as enabling the firms and institutions on its platform to succeed locally and internationally. We intend on working with our growing client base to realize commercial opportunities and ensuring we continue to a best-in-class platform from which to do business.</p><p><strong>What are QFC's most urgent strategic priorities for 2021?</strong></p><p>We aim to attract QAR91.25 billion in FDI with a particular focus on the digital, media, sports and financial service industries and to anchor them with opportunities in Qatar and other markets so they remain sustainable and contribute to the local economy in the long term. Despite some of the challenges at hand, QFC's outlook in terms of acquisition and growth prospects is extremely promising.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has QSTP evolved over the last decade?</strong></p><p>Since opening its doors in 2010, QSTP has become an international hub for applied research, technology innovation, incubation, and entrepreneurship. Over the last 10 years, QSTP had over a hundred companies from 17 countries operate in its Business Park and Free Zone, including multinationals such as ConocoPhillips, Cisco, and Siemens. As Qatar's hub for tech-based innovation, product development, and entrepreneurship and Free Zone, QSTP offers high-tech facilities and supports a network of startups and rising tech ventures through a value chain of acceleration, incubation, and funding programs. So far, 20 local companies have been incubated in QSTP, producing impactful innovations, such as Meddy, the largest doctor booking platform in Qatar, with over 200,000 monthly users. Stellic, a degree planning, advising, and auditing platform which has signed agreements with CMU and Tufts University in the US, is also a product of our Incubation Center, as well as the award-winning braille entertainment device, Bonocle.</p><p><strong>What is the uniqueness of QSTP compared to other entities seeking to attract the same type of companies, and what is your level of cooperation with them?</strong></p><p>Qatar is a viable market for a vast range of industries, offering different business platforms and free zones to local and international companies.  While all these platforms boast of world-class facilities, there are programs and services unique to QSTP, such as facilitating the development of new high-tech products and services, supporting the commercialization of market-ready technologies and easy incorporation. These qualities are highly suitable to science and technology-oriented companies, which we want to attract. QSTP's location also gives us an advantage over other platforms. Being in the middle of Qatar Foundations' ecosystem, our clients/tenants can benefit from their proximity to Qatar's academic and research institutions. Moreover, we advise newcomers on where their business can benefit the most in this ecosystem. Our agreement with the Free Zone Authority allows entities in their platform to open a research or product development center with us and vice versa. This enables us to share our strengths with other players in the ecosystem, and vice versa, while giving our clients the flexibility to access other facilities in Qatar. It also works the other way around. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>What has traditionally been the importance of Qatar for the interests of Canadian public and private sectors, and how can the progressive achievement of Qatar National Vision 2030 enhance this relationship in terms of new areas of cooperation?</p><p>Canada and Qatar have enjoyed uninterrupted diplomatic relations for 46 years. Our relationship is warm and growing, and Qatar is a key partner for Canada in the Gulf region. The people-to-people connections underpin this steadfast relationship based on mutual respect for each other and cooperation toward shared goals. Our dynamic Canadian expatriate community is active in Qatar and helps advance our mutual interests and strengthen trade and investment ties. We are seeing growth in our bilateral relations. For example, 2019 bilateral trade between Canada and Qatar increased 35% compared to 2018, which resulted in Qatar becoming Canada's third-largest trading partner in the region, an important milestone for Canadian-Qatari trade relations. Canada has the expertise and the capacity to continue playing an important role in supporting Qatar's National Vision 2030, the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and its drive for self sufficiency in many sectors. Take the health sector, for example. Canada has played a significant and leading role in Qatar's health for a long time and in a variety of areas including accreditation, education and training, and medical supplies. Canada is in the privileged position of having two important institutions offering top-tier Canadian healthcare education in Qatar: the University of Calgary in Qatar delivering its nursing programs, and the College of the North Atlantic — Qatar offering various diplomas and courses in allied healthcare through its School of Health Sciences. In addition, Canadian companies and organizations have long supplied Qatar with essential equipment, tools, and training in best practices in healthcare. Looking to the future, we would like to continue to build stronger linkages in the fields of agriculture, defence and security, clean technologies, and ICT.</p><p><br><br><br>What potential does Qatar have to become an important partner in the pharmaceutical, high-tech, and F&amp;B industries, which have traditionally been important to Canada and are specifically targeted by the government of Qatar?<br>The Embassy of Canada to Qatar is always monitoring new policy developments and initiatives that aim to position Qatar as an even more attractive business and investment destination for Canadian companies. The introduction of new regulations, laws, free zones, incentive programs, and other similarly important mechanisms all serve to increase Qatar's competitiveness and attractiveness for the international business community. We work closely with various partners to raise awareness among the Canadian business community about important developments in Qatar and encourage them to explore the various opportunities available to them. The Canadian Business Council Qatar (CBCQ) based in Doha and the Canada-Arab Business Council (CABC) based in Toronto are two important partners in this regard. Canada and Qatar already enjoy a strong relationship in various sectors, but we see tremendous opportunity for growth and diversification. In fact, Canada is a global leader in many areas that are priorities for the government of Qatar, including health, education, social development, the environment, and respect for human rights and the multilateral system. Moreover, our companies have much to offer in these strategic sectors—particularly agriculture, life sciences, clean technology, education and ICT. Canada and Qatar will continue to explore opportunities and identify synergies that are mutually beneficial in both trade and investment. Much positive momentum had been built between our two countries, and although the pandemic has significantly hampered travel and business mobility, I expect our forward momentum will be re-established quickly once global travel restrictions ease, and the worst of the pandemic is behind us. Despite these challenges, we have continued to work closely with our partners in government and the private sector to facilitate trade and investment, and to strengthen bilateral frameworks—such as the negotiation of a Foreign Investment Protection Agreement and the expansion of our Air Transportation Agreement—to build confidence and create all the conditions necessary for growth in trade and investment. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>The Qatar National Vision 2030 tries to keep a balance between an increasingly diversified economy and acknowledging the importance of hydrocarbons. What are your most important findings regarding this future balance?</strong></p><p>From 2014-2020, the Qatari economy faced several challenges that contributed to a relative change in the economy structure, mainly: the fluctuating global demand and the fluctuating prices of oil and gas products and their manufacturing derivatives; financing the infrastructure associated with diversifying the economy and hosting the World Cup 2022; and the unjust blockade imposed on the State of Qatar, which has caused economic and social shocks. The economic policies and administrative measures implemented by the government to reduce the negative effects of the blockade and the fluctuations in the oil and gas markets and maximize the benefits of public and private investment have led to an increase in the share of non-hydrocarbon activities at the expense of a decline in the share of hydrocarbon activities. <br>Vision 2030 seeks to achieve a balance between an oil-based and a knowledge-based economy. In this regard, the future and transformation will depend on: firstly the optimal use of hydrocarbon resources, with an effective and dynamic management of the depleted resources by raising the operational efficiency of Qatari companies working in oil and gas projects; creating a balance between reserves and production by encouraging investment in economic sectors by creating an enabling environment and developing a stimulus package in addition to an attractive legislative framework for investors and the activation of the Investor Service Center and Kiosk, and the launch of the Investment Promotion Agency, an affiliate of the Qatar Financial Center that facilitates the establishment and operation of businesses; and diversifying Qatar's sources of income by investing in the sovereign fund for future generations.</p><p><strong>How will environmental issues impact the future success of Qatari lives and businesses?</strong></p><p>In order to realize the importance of environmental sustainability for the leadership of Qatar, we must look at its position as a fundamental pillar in Vision 2030. Since our livelihood depends mainly on the optimal use of our wealth and natural resources, it was important to build a solid human capital in the field of environmental sustainability. It was also important and critical to attract global talent in the field of environmental sustainability and the use of environmental resources. Based on these strategic directions, the issue of environmental sustainability and development has assumed a great and prominent position in the education system, starting from pre-school to post-doctoral research and study centers that have been more focused in this regard. Over the past two decades, several environmental sustainability research grants have been awarded to a number of university professors, undergraduates, and graduate students (Texas A&amp;M University and Carnegie Mellon University). Some of these grants were made through remarkable cooperation with elite industrial partners such as Qatar Petroleum, Shell, and Total, as these research focus on environmental sustainability as a major national priority to preserve environmental resources for future generations.</p><p><strong>What are your most immediate strategic priorities for 2021, and what new innovations will you adopt to make your work more efficient?</strong></p><p>PSA continues its national role in ensuring the achievement of Vision 2030 by following up on the implementation and progress of achieving the goals and projects of the National Development Strategy 2018-2022 as planned. PSA also provides continuous social and economic forecasts, while continuing to support the concerned national authorities in the planning efforts and implementing the goals of the national development strategy. PSA's priorities in the field of statistics evolve with the development of the processes of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating national statistics, in line with the unified global statistics approved by the UN's Statistics Division. Preparations are also being made in PSA to start the organizational and coordination measures to prepare the third National Development Strategy 2023-2028 as part of a series of medium-term strategies to achieve the goals of Vision 2030. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What is your growth plan in the medium term in terms of new services, and how do you expect these initiatives to increase your member base, particularly among SMEs?</strong></p><p>As part of its accelerated efforts to support its members, the chamber launched a host of services and initiatives that are of significant advantages to the interests of the private sector. In 2020, we launched many electronic services on the chamber's website such as issuing certificates of origin and document attestation. We also will focus more to intensify efforts played by the chamber's sectorial committees with relevant bodies in the state to address all issues related to the private sector and find solutions for obstacles faced by our members. Due to the importance of SMEs in economic development, the chamber attaches special interest to this sector. We have ongoing coordination and cooperation with the relevant agencies that provide support SMEs such as QDB and other bodies.</p><p><strong>How will the PPP Law enhance private-sector participation in Qatar, and what other regulatory and institutional efforts do you consider necessary to complement it?</strong></p><p>The law will certainly contribute to accelerating the country's massive infrastructure development and providing greater support for the private sector and foreign investments. It paves the way for the launch of several investment projects in Qatar in various sectors including healthcare, sports, tourism, and education. The involvement of the private sector in PPP projects will be greater, given that the private sector enjoys substantial support from the wise leadership and the government, especially since the law enables benefitting from the private sector's administrative and technical competencies and financing capabilities in joint projects with the public sector. Overall, the partnership will further foster Qatar's position as a leading international center for business and investments, as well as support the implementation of projects connected to the Qatar 2030 vision and the 2022 World Cup. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the major highlights for QDB in the first half of 2020?</strong></p><p>QDB's direct financing reached QAR7.14 billion by July 2020, supporting over 950 companies and driving a 36% growth in our capital deployed in start-ups. Our export trade financing also grew to reach QAR1 billion in 2019. Meanwhile, we continued to help SMEs access local and global markets with over QAR1 billion worth of contracts awarded to local buyers and orders valued at over QAR560 million booked for exports. In 2020, disruptions caused by COVID-19 prompted the bank to put in place an agile strategy to address three areas of focus for entrepreneurs: surviving the pandemic; reviving their businesses amid ongoing challenges; and thriving in the new economy. First, we delayed SMEs' loan repayment without interest fees for six months and granted special exemptions to tenants at the Qatar Business Incubation Center (QBIC) as well as in our commercial complexes (Al Furjan Markets) and Jahiz 1, and Jahiz 2 factories. In parallel, QDB launched the National Guarantee Program as part of the country's QAR75-billion incentives package, helping more than 3,500 companies finance their employee wage bills and pay rental fees. We also introduced an entire suite of virtual consultation and training services and relaunched the bank's situation room to deal with supply chain disruptions for SMEs, among other related initiatives. Finally, we established the Revive program to support SMEs with packages covering the areas of finance, knowledge, and skill development, to help them overcome challenges while turning crises into a platform to grow and access new markets.</p><p><strong>How is QDB, and the business ecosystem in Qatar, supporting entrepreneurs and SMEs towards becoming the backbone of the national economy?</strong></p><p>QDB and its affiliate institutions adopt an ideation-to-fruition approach to supporting SMEs in Qatar. We start by instilling an entrepreneurial mindset in our younger generation through Bedaya Center while helping aspiring entrepreneurs turn their ideas into start-ups at QBIC—the MENA region's largest mixed-use business incubator. With the outstanding impact of QBIC, we were inspired to launch a number of specialized incubators in collaboration with our strategic partners covering various areas that had witnessed growing demand such as Fintech and Sports-tech. We also have yet another incubator coming up soon for entrepreneurs in the fashion industry. But that's not all. To bring fruition to the ventures and endeavors of established Qatari SMEs, QDB provides them with a rich range of advisory and financial support services to fuel their growth, while granting them access to local and global markets.</p><p><strong>What innovative initiatives and new partnerships can we expect from QDB in the medium term to achieve these goals?</strong></p><p>In addition to its ever-growing SME-focused funding, support, and capacity-building programs, QDB works closely with government entities and Qatar's wider SME ecosystem to promote localization, export development, and self-sufficiency. For example, the COVID-19 outbreak prompted QDB to establish a dedicated hotline for affected SMEs, providing them with on-the-spot consultations tailored to their situation and context. Moreover, the bank has played a vital role in accelerating the acquisition of raw materials for hand sanitizer and mask production businesses to maintain local supply amid the sort of deglobalization that is currently taking place.</p><p><strong>How is QDB creating localization opportunities for Qatari SMEs, and how does cooperation between Qatar's authorities and private companies through public-private partnerships benefit local SMEs?</strong></p><p>We are continuously pursuing avenues for localization, including signing a cooperation agreement for a localization program with one of Qatar's biggest national enterprises. During our first B2B workshop within this framework, 17 F&amp;B SMEs were directly introduced to the brand's current business opportunities, and we plan to continue providing SMEs with direct access to market and supply chain localization opportunities with our strategic partners. When it comes to PPPs, we see them as an additional growth for private enterprises, while introducing private-sector expertise and innovation to public projects. The recently introduced PPP Law grants them access to partnership opportunities with the public sector at a scale that was never before available, which complements the various channels QDB makes available to them in this domain.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How is Manateq preparing for the reactivation of the economy after the crisis we are starting to overcome? How did Manateq support the logistics zones investors during this time?</strong></p><p>Apart from introducing strict health and safety protocols throughout Manateq assets to safeguard our staff, visitors, and clients, we focused on easing the financial burden of our investors during the height of the pandemic and nationwide shutdown, with the COVID-19 pandemic. In March, as the effects of the pandemic were taking hold globally, we issued a six-month rent exemption for all our investors in the logistics parks and industrial zone. We later extended this by a further three months. However, our incentivization program began before the COVID outbreak. For instance, in 2018 leased plot investors who issued building permits benefited from the rent exemption and backed this up with a 2019 rent exemption for those investors who issued building completion certificates, in the logistics parks. We also exempted rent for production companies in the Mesaieed Industrial Zone for 2019 to encourage and increase their economic development contribution. More recently, we have signed with Waseef Asset Management Company, a leader in the management and marketing of real estate projects, to provide facilities and rental management of all the commercial and residential assets in seven service hubs across all our logistics parks. Waseef will now manage the rental affairs of all our investors' commercial and accommodation assets in the service hubs in our Jery Al Summar, Birkat Al Awamer, Aba Saleel and Al Wakra logistics parks, which are gateways to fast-track economic diversity and business growth throughout Qatar and beyond. We have designed these service hubs as thriving, showpiece communities with cafés and restaurants, supermarkets, money exchange services with ATMs, pharmacies, and medical centers and a host of service operators including utilities providers, laundries, barbershops, and tailors with ample parking throughout. We are raising the bar, not just regionally but internationally as well on infrastructure provision within logistics parks.</p><p><strong>How will Manateq incentivize the establishment and expansion of SME investor base, especially considering the difficulties they may be suffering under the current scenario?</strong></p><p>SMEs significantly contribute to areas such as innovation, efficiency, job creation and international competitiveness, all of which are key to Qatar's economic diversification. Qatar has worked harder to provide the appropriate environment for the growth of SMEs by enacting laws and administrative procedures necessary to encourage this sector, facilitating the necessary procedures for their establishment, and launching national initiatives and programs that support the owners of these enterprises. There have been initiatives to enhance the competitiveness of SME products and services at the local level and support for their export capabilities at the regional and global levels, thus reflecting the directives of the wise leadership in Qatar. This is also in line with the most important economic pillars of Qatar National Vision 2030. In response to the market needs, we have offered attractive practical solutions for SMEs by offering open yards in Al Khor and Al Karaana industrial zones at an affordable rental price as low as QAR10 per square meters annually with short-term lease contracts. This has resulted in successfully leasing more than 3 million sqm of open yard space.</p><p><strong>What is Manateq's role in assisting the private sector gain access to the local market?</strong></p><p>Manateq has been assisting the private sector by offering around 3.4 million sqm of leasable area spread over our private projects—Al Wukair logistics parks and four warehousing parks Bu Sulba, Bu Fessila, Um Shaharaine 1, and Um Shaharaine 2. This has been backed up by our rental exemption initiatives, mobility infrastructure, and financial support partnerships to make setting up businesses as swift and easy as possible. Manateq is committed to developing a world-class business environment, premium infrastructure, and the provision of high-quality services, including investor partnerships and aftercare, to fully support investment climate reforms in a post-COVID-19 world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the Chamber of Commerce of Mallorca, and what are some of its distinctive features?</h4><p>The Chamber of Commerce of Mallorca is an organization of economic diplomacy. The Chamber was established 135 years ago and has acquired an international approach that has intensified over the years. We are part of a lobby group of chambers of commerce called the Network of the Insular Chambers of Commerce and Industry of the European Union (Insuleur), and we hold the position of secretary general of this organization. We seek to promote the economy of these islands, which share a common disadvantage due to the fact that we are separated from the European continent, and this means a considerable economic disadvantage in terms of cost of living, transport costs and land scarcity, for example. In our case, Mallorca is the most populated one of the Balearic Islands. Most of the public officials of the regional government and private businesses are located on this island. The headquarters of the most important businesses in the Balearic Islands are also in Mallorca, as are most politicians and lobby groups. There are 1.1 million residents on the Balearic Islands. Of that, 12,000 are in Formentera, 100,000 in Ibiza, 80,000 in Menorca, and 900,000 in Mallorca. We have a strong collaboration with the chambers of Ibiza and Menorca because we are part of the same insular status. Our mission is to always offer a way to develop common projects.</p><h4>As Mallorca seeks to diversify its economy, what are some of the most attractive sectors for foreign investment?</h4><p>Before the pandemic, we had a narrow view of foreign investment into Mallorca. The situation has completely changed since then, and we have realized there are many important sectors that we need to work with to further develop them. There are more than 120,000 companies in Mallorca, and we are committed to supporting every company incorporated on the island. We support businesses because this will help the economy of the Balearic islands and its society. Now, we are closely monitoring non-traditional sectors on the island such as agriculture and industrial production, as we were mostly focused completely on the services sector. Tourism is an important sector of the economy of Mallorca, though we see foreign investment in other sectors such as wine production and ecologic agriculture. These areas were not a priority for us before the pandemic, because it was cheaper to import these products instead of developing these products here. Right now, it is an important challenge to have a new vision, an international vision for Mallorca that includes paying attention to the sustainability of our products and the digitalization of processes.</p><h4>How is the Chamber of Commerce of Mallorca supporting the island's transition into a more ecological and sustainable environment?</h4><p>We are focusing on improving sustainability, digitalization, and catering to EU funds to finance long-term projects. Among other projects, there are currently discussions on the island around using sewage water for irrigation, for example. All this requires future investments. This is the moment to invest and support the development of more sustainable islands. The Balearic Islands are an important geostrategic location in the Mediterranean. The return of mobility will allow us to regain our importance. Many start-ups and digital nomads are coming to Mallorca because of its strategic location. It takes two hours to fly from Palma to Berlin, Paris, Munich, Rome, or Lisbon.</p><h4>What will the priorities for the Chamber of Commerce of Mallorca in the near future?</h4><p>As a business organization, we want to support all forms of business, regardless of their size, which is why our plan is to pay extra attention to freelancers and SMEs. We are supporting them in their digitalization and internationalization process. There are some areas in which more skilled workers are required, so we need to provide training. We want to expedite the growth of small businesses, which have been heavily affected by the pandemic. In that regard, the Chamber is hosting virtual conferences as part of our digitalization strategies. Training, the development of startups, and greater support for businesswomen are some of the key areas that we should further develop. We must support the weaker areas of the business sector. That is where we are focusing on and where we are putting in place most of our actions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The demand for OTT media across the globe has significantly increased in the past few years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. How has GBI adapted its business accordingly?</h4><p>GBI was prepared for high-demand circumstances such as COVID-19, as our GBI Smart Network is a high-capacity network that was purpose-built for the future. With capacity demand ever increasing, the network is facilitating growing requirements to deliver consumer content from OTT media players, as well as supporting business-critical enterprise applications. In partnership with local and regional telecommunication operators and internet service providers, GBI was able to ensure internet availability and business continuity for its partners and the communities it serves throughout the pandemic. Conversely, we were able to meet increasing internet demand with the same high-level performance and availability. This ability was due to the GBI network possessing the capacity to cope with the increase in traffic, while still leaving plenty of headroom to maintain capacity to manage changing customer requirements and traffic spikes.</p><h4>How do GBI's partnerships with companies such as Microsoft and Vodafone help support the digitalization of Qatar?</h4><p>GBI plays a crucial role in supporting Qatar's digitalization by providing innovative solutions to optimize digital experiences in the region and beyond. Indeed, we work in partnership with companies such as Microsoft and Vodafone, and these relationships represent significant milestones in this mission. Through strategic collaboration, we are able to mitigate challenges faced by organizations of all kinds as they look toward cloud adoption by providing a solid foundation for future digital transformation. Cloud adoption can pose significant obstacles to businesses, specifically ensuring secure connectivity with on-premises and public cloud environments, managing connection breaks, the high cost of bandwidth required for migration, as well as the overall expenditure associated with cloud adoption. However, our partnerships with the aforementioned companies aim to address these obstacles by using GBI's global MPLS backbone to provide greater reliability, security, and speeds while yielding significant cost benefits. There are many barriers to innovation as it applies to the digitalization of Qatar, and GBI and its partners are working incredibly hard to remove them and support the digital future.</p><h4>Qatar is set to further use new technologies such as IoT, big data, and AI to achieve the Qatar National Vision 2030. What will be GBI's role in implementing these technologies?</h4><p>GBI serves a critical role in facilitating all these new innovations. These smart technologies, as well as many others, are reliant on reliable, low latency, high-speed connectivity in order to adequately communicate with each other. When these ecosystems of technologies and devices do not have access to such connectivity, it has a direct correlation to the end users' overall digital experience. GBI understands the sheer amount of data, high-level security, and the high speeds required for the adoption of these technologies and is prepared to play the critical role of providing the connectivity foundation that is essential to their success.</p><h4>As a submarine cable provider, which regions offer more attractiveness to expand your infrastructure?</h4><p>As it currently stands, GBI has a prominent presence in the Middle Eastern region as a result of our core network. However, we are continuously looking for new opportunities to expand our footprint through various avenues. It is critical that we are able to diversify and provide as many services as possible on our own network. We strive to offer unique affordable solutions that are dependable through our infrastructure, while upgrading to the latest available technologies in an effort to improve network uptime, minimize outages, and ensure multiple diverse options. At GBI, we adopt a policy of continual transformation and hope to focus future investments on unique, low latency, differentiated routes.</p><h4>What will be your priorities for 2021?</h4><p>For 2021, GBI is focused on continuing to understand the networking needs of both our partners and customers, delivering connectivity that is scalable and flexible, while striving to provide the best possible digital experience for end users. We plan on continuing to deliver critical value-add services to fulfill ever-evolving market requirements through our world-class infrastructure, as well as continuously creating new sets of services that are able to anticipate and fill both future and existing gaps. GBI plans to use its infrastructure and solid foundation to reaffirm its long-standing commitment to the market. We will continue to deliver across the entire value chain to ensure we consistently provide a springboard for innovation both locally and across the region, while removing complexity from networking in an effort to support the future success of Qatar's digital transformation journey.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>IGNIS Energí­a, founded in 2015, works in the areas of development, generation, energy services, operation, and maintenance, with more than 20GW under development in Spain and abroad. How has IGNIS evolved over its six-year history?</h4><p>The company was founded in March 2015 with an integrated management vision of the energy business and a goal to provide energy competitively to all consumers. We aim to foster integrated management of energy at every stage of the value chain. This includes the project design, including the engineering, purchasing, and monitoring process of the construction; the implementation; and the launch of certain technology-immersed facilities. We are currently managing 4% of Spain's total energy produced, through a multi-technology platform that comprises hydropower plants, wind farms, PV solar parks, cogeneration, and so on. Furthermore, we manage this power across every electricity market, both in the daily market and realtime markets, in which Ignis is the leading independent platform. Ignis' mission is to leverage in that expertise and expand this capabilities in other markets. Ignis operates 1GW of assets through 25year O&amp;M contracts and is one of the few companies with expertise in utility scale solar parks, as it operates the 800MW Aragón Solar project, the largest photovoltaic plant in Europe since November 2019. This experience is allowing us to develop technology to operate future parks in order to, for example, increase productivity, reduce the failure rate, improve the performance ratio, and so on. One further activity being implemented by Ignis is the comprehensive design of the plant from scratch, which involves the entire organization. This integral vision offers us a huge competitive advantage and allows us to provide solutions adapted to market conditions and the specific requirements of the customer. As a consequence of the project in Aragón, we started developing what is currently the largest portfolio of renewable in Spain under development. We are leaders in promoting renewable energy in Spain, namely solar photovoltaic energy.</p><h4>Recently, the government approved the Climate Change and Energy Transition Law to help Spain comply with its international commitments in the fight against climate change to achieve so-called “climate neutrality“ before 2050. What is your view on this?</h4><p>It is a legislative development that allows for the implementation of more renewable plants, which makes economic sense, not only environmental sense. Spain has the best wind and solar power resources in Europe. As a country, we are confident we will be able to retain and attract energy-intensive industry, maintain those that we already have, and apply shifts to the usage of such energy. We can, therefore, make our industry more competitive and our houses greener, by modifying infrastructures. Hence, we will have achieved the transformation of the sector without the need for any subsidies, and we will promote national and foreign investments, creating jobs and much more.</p><h4>What are Ignis' priorities for the year ahead and for 2022?</h4><p>For the year ahead, we essentially target reaching ready-to-build status in a significant part of the portfolio of renewable energy projects and mature our strategy in the above mentioned international markets. For example, we are planning the construction of a 90MW wind farm in California. This means we can get our foot in the door and start thinking about gas, marketing, management of energy, trading, and more, in the US. Our objective is to set up small projects in different places in order to determine the ones that are the most profitable in order to make an investment. We would also like to develop our own technology of components in the future. Where it may not a short-term project, Ignis is a product manufacturer, and we are already present in the R&amp;D of products and processes. In fact, we are already active and developing new projects with hydrogen and in the asset management sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you consider to be among FUNO® (Fibra UNO)s most important achievements in the last year?</h4><p>Throughout the past year, our focus has been on supporting our tenants. We have a duty to our tenants so that they can do business, and our business can also thrive. We are currently seeing many of their businesses recovering. We have shopping centers where footfall are around pre-pandemic levels. This situation has affected many households and their incomes. However, people who have been locked down for such a long time need to go about their lives. For us, continuing to support out tenants is a highly important achievement, so that they can move on as soon as possible and reach pre-pandemic numbers once again.</p><h4>What trends in retail spaces do you expect in the coming years?</h4><p>Today, the trend in shopping centers is to offer far greater entertainment opportunities and a greater focus on food. Food and entertainment made up about 9% of our portfolios upon purchase. Today, that figure is approaching 30%. In Mexico, people tend to take walks in shopping centers, with all kinds of consumption habits, and this is another trend we see in the commercial area. In addition, we see “location, location, location“ as one of the main assets in FUNO®'s portfolio. However, when comparing Mexico to other countries with similar characteristics, the number of square meters of retail per capita is much higher. Therefore, in the retail area, there is still room for growth.</p><h4>How would you rate the competitiveness of the REIT market in Mexico now?</h4><p>We were the founding members of the Mexican Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (AMEFIBRA) in Mexico. I consider all the managers of these trusts, or FIBRAs in Spanish, as colleagues in the field. If we add up the square meters of FIBRAs, FUNO® accounts for 45%. There is still room for more FIBRAs to join, and we are likely to see some of them consolidating.</p><h4>There are now a greater number of young people interested in investing in the public market. Has this benefited investment in FIBRAs in Mexico?</h4><p>FIBRAs are still at an early stage in the market. I always look to educate the investor, so that they understand what FIBRAs are and their benefits, so as to access the retail market in Mexico. From FUNO®'s Mexican and foreign investors today, Mexican investors account for between 12-13%, where 10-11% come from Retirement Fund Administrators (AFORES) and insurance companies, and 2% are private banking and brokerage firms. 90% of the economically active population in the US has an account open at a brokerage firm, whereas the overall number of accounts opened in brokerage firms in Mexico is 200,000 for a population of 126 million. Of this, 80 million are economically active. This is a cultural issue that has a huge impact. As far as possible, however, I will ensure this reaches everyone, so that, every day, the public has better access.</p><h4>What are this year's goals regarding the Mí­tikah project?</h4><p>Mí­tikah Tower will have 62 floors and 670 apartments, of which over 600 have been sold. The tower will be built over three phases. For the first 20 floors, we will start handing over the apartments so that they can be occupied in the next 60 days. The idea is to finish the handover, namely finalize the construction and have no more operators within before the end of the year. In the next year, we aim for the tower to be fully occupied. Additionally, we also aim to complete the construction of the shopping center over the course of 2021 and open it in early 2022. The San Ángel Inn Hospital is in the same complex. There are also 10 levels that are fully occupied by consulting rooms. We then have the shopping center. In phase two, we will see the arrival of a new office tower. Therefore, the complex will boast a hotel, hospital, consulting rooms, a shopping center, fitness centers and gyms, offices, and apartments. More than a complex, it will be a city where one can live without ever needing to leave.</p><h4>How well prepared was FUNO® to face an economic crisis like the one in 2020?</h4><p>We have about 40 years' of experience in the real estate sector and have lived through every crisis. As a result, we took on the philosophy not to be the priciest landlord in the market—on the contrary, we prefer to be below market average. Another very important point is our careful leverage that allows us to be highly protected. We have sensibly taken many flat rates. This care, in terms of quantity, quality, timing, and the rates of our debt, offers us certainty in being shielded against such crises.</p><h4>What are FUNO®'s main goals for the rest of the year?</h4><p>We seek stability, both our future tenants and for ourselves. We must move forward after such a tough year. Today, we have a large industrial development in the north of Mexico City. It has 370,000sqm of warehouses, of which we have already completed and occupied around 150,000sqm. We are also accelerating construction, as a square meter finished is a square meter leased. I would especially seek to complete the development we have here sooner.</p><h4>Are you preparing your portfolio to take advantage of this market opportunity?</h4><p>Absolutely. All our land reserves, either for light industry or for warehousing and logistics, are being leveraged. This US growth of up to 8% can help Mexico. The result is that light industry, mainly in the border states, is picking up steam. Logistics, as Mexico's largest market, accounting for about one-quarter of the country's GDP, continues to grow and will continue to do so over the coming years. We are therefore focused on the support and the growth of Mexico, especially within the light industry, logistics, and warehousing sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Farmaindustria, created in 1963, is the national trade association of the pharmaceutical industry in Spain. What are the objectives with which it was created?</h4><p>Farmaindustria is close to reaching 60 years of activity. We group together 137 companies, the majority of the innovative biopharmaceutical laboratories established in our country, with both national and multinational capital, which represent almost all sales of patented prescription drugs in Spain. Therefore, we represent a strategic sector for society, both due to the nature of its activity and based on its commitment to health as well as its business and economic contribution, with high added value: the pharmaceutical industry. The association's objective is to represent the associated companies in society and before their public administrations, collaborate with them, support the sector's commitment to R&amp;D, communicate the reality of the pharmaceutical industry to public opinion, and offer value-added services to associated companies.</p><h4>The pharmaceutical sector brings together around 20% of investment in R&amp;D in the Spanish industry and leads in the number of patent applications in our country. How do you rate the innovation processes carried out by local pharmaceutical companies?</h4><p>We do actively collaborate with public and private biomedical research centers, contributing to its dynamization. The investment of our companies in R&amp;D in Spain now exceeds 1.2 billion euros per year, with almost half of that investment made in collaboration with third parties. This strong investment by companies and close collaboration with the health administration, hospitals, researchers, and patients has made Spain an international reference in clinical trials and has generated experience and dynamics compared to other countries that, with the appropriate strategy, can help attract more international investment in research.</p><h4>There has been some debate regarding the protection of patents related to COVID-19. Should patents on COVID-19 vaccines, treatments, and medicines be eliminated?</h4><p>Eliminating patents is not the solution today in order to meet the challenge of urgently increasing global production of vaccines. This challenge must be faced through collaboration agreements between vaccine development companies and those that have the capacity to participate in some phase of the production process. Not all countries and companies are qualified to produce vaccines. Therefore, it is not a patent problem. On the contrary, these collaboration agreements imply the transfer of technology and the necessary know-how to be able to produce these vaccines with guarantees, which could not be done without a clear framework of industrial property. And that route is already working. Since 2020, more than 300 cooperation agreements have been concluded between developer and producer companies, involving 100 companies from 33 countries. With these agreements in place, the forecasts made by independent institutions are that in 2021 there will be between 10 and 12 billion doses, which would be enough to vaccinate 70-75% of the population and achieve group immunity.</p><h4>What are Farmaindustria's main objectives for the rest of 2021?</h4><p>Farmaindustria has been proposing a strategy to the administration that, through cooperation, allows pharmaceutical companies to be one of the strategic sectors that contributes to economic reactivation and promotes a production model for the coming years. We are proposing a model in which the large classic sectors of the Spanish economy, such as tourism and construction, are complemented by others linked to innovation and the ability to attract new sources of international investment. For this, we need to generate a country strategy that understands health, biomedical research, and medicine not as an expense, but as an investment with clear returns in the health, economic, and social aspects. On this basis, there are two lines to advance moving forward: reinforcing the manufacturing sector to reduce dependence on the outside production of essential drugs and working to turn Spain into a great international space for biomedical research. To start with, Spain has a solid manufacturing sector, with 82 plants for the production of medicines for human use and exports worth 12.7 billion euros a year; however, the pandemic has forced us to ask ourselves if we should limit our foreign dependence on the production of essential drugs abroad, especially from Asia. We have the capacity to recover part of that production, give our country greater strategic protection, and reinforce our pharmaceutical manufacturing sector. From Farmaindustria, we have already presented a specific initiative to the Ministry of Industry that aspires to be one of the Strategic Projects for Economic Recovery and Transformation (Perte) approved at the time by the Council of Ministers. It is about increasing strategic manufacturing capacities to have greater guarantees in the supply of strategic medicines and, at the same time, improving the productive competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry in Spain through its training in knowledge, technology, and digitalization. The other great commitment of our sector is related to excellence in clinical research. We are convinced we can be a great international investment pillar in this field. We are already a global reference in clinical drug research, as has been demonstrated during the pandemic, as our country is the first in Europe and the fourth in the world in clinical trials against COVID-19. The solidity of our healthcare system, the high qualification of our healthcare professionals, the involvement of patients, and the strong commitment of companies has allowed us to get here, and we are in a position to take a big leap.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities did you identify in the market that motivated you to create this company?</h4><p>I specialize in the industrial food industry. Our service is focused on all national and international companies that have a certain number of workers. We help take care of everything related to food. We specialize in the industrial sector and believe that if it is well supported, it will never stop growing. Mexico is well-situated geographically, which is why we started our business in the industrial food service. We have approximately 715 employees, and we continue to grow. At present, we have 28 clients, and for the end of 2021 we expect to have a fully 100% growth.</p><h4>What is the added value in comparison to companies from the same sector?</h4><p>The added value is my partners, my hardworking family, and the camaraderie, loyalty, friendship, and love with which we treat each other. I am grateful for having a family and a company that support and believe in me, and all this is reflected in the services we provide. There are many companies far bigger than ours, and in my opinion they offer a colder and far more robotic service.</p><h4>What strategies do you use to help reduce costs for your clients?</h4><p>One of the first steps to take was becoming our own suppliers, in other words, buying everything ourselves. We buy everything directly from wholesalers, which helps us reduce operational costs and allows us to oversee something that is important in our company: supervising the quality of our food. Thus, we ensure that our food is not tampered with in any way. This helps us with two important things: being aware of the costs and having a better quality and control over all the food we purchase.</p><h4>How many cities do you operate in?</h4><p>Right now, we are in present in Matamoros, Reynosa, Nuevo León, Juárez, and Guanajuato. In 2020-2021, we made the decision to knock on new market doors because we had found significant work in Reynosa. We are growing at a rate of 50% annually.</p><h4>What sectors are your prioritizing for growth?</h4><p>We are focused on oil and industry. There is a great opportunity in the oil sector because many workers live in platforms and go for days without seeing their families. Food should be a way to help them relax and feel at home. You could say we make food to comfort them. The industrial sector is a particularly important one because if we work hard in Mexico, we could break the record in terms of industrial growth. It is a sector with more than 4 million job positions in Mexico. What is more, right now, we are looking to expand into Oaxaca and Yucatán. For example, in the industrial sector, many plants did not close at the height of the pandemic. Though the wellbeing and safety of their employees was of paramount importance, they were also worried about food production.</p><h4>What are your main goals for the next few years?</h4><p>My goal for 2020-2021 is to lead our company to 100% growth. There are many opportunities to grow at this rate. Currently, there is significant demand for our products, and we are experiencing the best working year thus far. The motto that we instill in our workers is that our company offers added value We do not want to be just another industrial food company; we want to be the best.</p><h4>How has the pandemic affected you?</h4><p>It has forced us to completely restructure the business, and thanks to that we have been able grow as we have. Before COVID-19, our growth had dropped by 40%, and now we are in the midst of a recovery, heading for 100% growth. In addition, I have also grown as a person and feel I am a better manager than before. Many companies had to restructure themselves during the pandemic. There are managers who have stated that if they had followed their original plans prior to COVID-19, they would not have grown as they have. That is precisely what we have done. As leaders, it is our duty to adapt to difficult situations. In moments like these, it is important to be persistent, find a way to create something new, and see the positive side of things. In our case, the pandemic forced us to roll up our sleeves, and this is the result that we have obtained. I am extremely grateful for this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the response of the government to the COVID-19 pandemic changed the needs of the companies you are serving?</h4><p>Credit Oman is the national export credit agency of Oman and provides trade credit insurance for accounts receivable, B2B. We work with manufacturers and providers selling in Oman and outside of Oman by covering them against insolvency, bankruptcy, and default from the non-payment risk of the counterparty. We collect a premium from that. It helps companies reach a wider segment of companies and markets. They can also diversify into new products or enter Africa, East Asia, and Latin America. Businesses are reluctant to export, as they are worried they will not get paid. This is why Oman set up this agency 30 years ago to promote and facilitate trade. The pandemic caused a drastic global slowdown of the supply chain. There were lockdowns that restricted traveling and the effective number of people who can actually work. Many companies had the capacity in place but were unable to sell, and it also led to a buildup of receivables because they did not earn revenues and are unable to fulfil their liabilities, such as paying salaries and vendors. The Omani government sought to reduce the liabilities by introducing stimulus packages, financial incentives, tax incentives, and the cancellation or reduction of many fees. One of the latest packages introduced by the Minister of Finance was for investment promotion and export enhancement. Diversification from oil is key, so exports will play an important role in Vision 2040. Exports have benefits such as attracting foreign currency, creating jobs within the country, enhancing SMEs, and so on. COVID-19 has put a hold on some initiatives but has accelerated others. We were expecting many cases of bankruptcy, but thanks to efforts from companies and the government to get banks to waive the liabilities against them, the domino effect has been reduced. Hopefully with the vaccinations, we will see things reopening.</p><h4>Which sectors are your main clients from right now?</h4><p>We cut across all sectors. We have building materials, large pharmaceuticals, food, sanitation products, telephone, and IT companies. We are seeing huge growth in those segments. During the pandemic we reviewed our policies, processes, and people and sought to streamline our IT systems. We had strong support from our shareholders and worked to adapt to the new market in an agile way. We also created something specific for SMEs, and the benefit is that they will have protection for their accounts receivable. They can also use this to avail trading facilities from financial institutions, which helps with collateral for banks. SMEs can often be excluded from financial assistance, so this support can allow them to flourish.</p><h4>How are you working to expand the credit to companies supporting Oman's diversification efforts?</h4><p>We assess the creditworthiness and risk of the buyer, look at the commodity, semi-finished or finished product, and how trends are developing. We also look at the sector and how it is performing and at the country exports. We try to identify risks. We want to work with AI and big data. Some companies gather this information that can help us assess these factors. In the future, we plan to offer our clients information on the commodities that are attractive and the possible buyers. For now, we have revisited our products, reviewed our pricing, and become more flexible and solution oriented. We have introduced new products for mid- and short-term projects for anything between three to 20 years.</p><h4>In which foreign markets are you providing the greatest level of coverage?</h4><p>The GCC is the biggest market for Oman, especially the UAE, KSA, Qatar, and India. This is not for oil. A large amount of credit goes to East Africa because of its proximity and the culture. We have also extended our lines to go to Colombia, Jamaica, Guatemala, Honduras, and so on. We protect companies from commercial risk, for example insolvency of the buyer. In some cases, we have a by-country risk assessment guided by international standards. We look at the risk assessment, and we cover for war, mutinies, or anything else that might prevent funds from going back to Oman. In fact, as a standard for most of our export policies we add the commercial and political risk. Different countries have different levels of risk. We try to encourage our exporters to not go where everybody is going, be smart, and identify other opportunities. We have some fisheries sending fish to Vietnam, for example. We have a mix and match in Oman's output.</p><h4>What would your advice be for Omani exporters to reach untapped markets?</h4><p>There are useful websites like ITC, which has filters by sector, country, and commodity. Companies can research demand for their products around the world and the main countries that import such products. There are some tools available to Omani sellers to explore. There is also a procurement map, where one can look into how they can get suppliers for raw materials or products. It is a handy tool, and we advise our clients to use it. They can always come to us, and we can validate the information for them and instill more confidence.</p><h4>What are your medium-term expectations for export growth, and what would be the main challenges?</h4><p>The global expectation is that we will see a surge in supply for main commodities such as semiconductors. Many raw commodities will see a surge, and we will see ICT coming up strongly—technology platforms, smarter consumption, e-commerce platforms, and so on. We have seen a huge flourishment in start-ups. We expect a solid recovery of the international market; we will have some little bumps, but because of the state's support to provide a lifeline to businesses, we expect companies to grow. The awareness element in the insurance still needs to improve, but interest in our services has increased after the pandemic, because companies see the value in being protected against unforeseen adverse events.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the recent activities of OES?</h4><p>At OES, we had to convert everything to online learning, which taught us a great deal. We did the digital transformation much faster than planned and continued with education online, without any major challenges. At the school level, most of the students were in Muscat, so going online was easy for them. As soon as the Ministry of Education authorized students to come back to campus, we opened again. At first, some were reluctant to return, but after one month everyone shifted. Parents were struggling to supervise their kids while working from home. Up to grade 3, children need a great deal of attention, which is very difficult online. From grade 4 to grade 7, they can work better than any other students online, and they did not struggle. The upper graders—teenagers—did not want to attend online lessons. At the university level, however, some students did not have internet access, because they lived in rural areas, while for some, their internet speed was too slow. Thus, we had to work with the Ministry of Higher Education to make an exemption for those students and postpone their studies for one semester. We assumed many would postpone, but the number was not that high. What is key is our relationship with our partners, at the school level with our Finnish partners and at the university level with our German partners, as we get the best solutions from abroad. It is extremely important to bring students back to campus as they need practical courses. Business or logistics can be done online more than other practical programs such as engineering, sciences, and architecture which need in-person or hands-on training.</p><h4>OES also created a technology transfer office. What pushed you to do that?</h4><p>The technology transfer office aims to strengthen the connection between academia with industry. In Oman and the region in particular, this is a challenge. We are oil and gas driven, and we do not have a solid interaction with the industry. The objective of the new office is to have a strong link with the job market, in Oman and beyond, as well as enhance our capabilities when it comes to patent registrations, IP issues, project development and consultancy. It also opens the doors to our students, because they have amazing ideas, though they do not know who can support them. This office looks into their projects, and if they believe they have potential, they will take them further, helping them step by step to make a business out of the idea. As a result, they will not need to find a job, but are creating jobs. It will also be linked to the Oman Hydrogen Center (OHC), which is part of the university, and the Indian Ocean Center. We are working on developing a third center, called the Building Technology Center, which will research building materials and technology, like 3D printing and building printers. We also have a commercial project within the university that will be like a shopping area and a built-in 3D printer. We should start the project by the end of 2021.</p><h4>What lessons did you learn over the past year while managing the newly created OHC, and what role do you hope it will play in the energy transition?</h4><p>OHC is a research center focused on green hydrogen. The goal of the center is to raise awareness about green hydrogen and how Oman can benefit from it. This year, we have some research projects with international partners on how to convert grey or blue hydrogen that comes from the oil and gas industry into green hydrogen. These projects will be strategic for the country in the long term. We have a great deal of infrastructure for the oil and gas industry, so it will require a big investment to switch to a green hydrogen infrastructure; however, if we come up with a solution to convert all that infrastructure to be green, instead of building from scratch, it will be better. This center is the only research center on hydrogen in Oman, and we are in the process of a pilot project to create green hydrogen. It is small scale but has the potential for growth. We recently founded the new company called 'Hydrogen Rise LLC.', which is heavily business focused. We own 50% of the company, and Hydrogen Rise AG in Germany owns the other half. We are now launching our first project in Sohar. We have a steel company there that is willing to connect to the plant. Green steel is a trend in Europe that allows you to treat the steel differently. We are in the process in reaching an agreement with the government, then we can start the first project. We need a real project to show people that they can benefit from this. For now, we need a subsidy from the government, because there is a huge price difference between green hydrogen and oil or gas, though in perhaps 10 years it will be cheaper than gas. We have received great interest from private investors, though some are still skeptical because of the size of the investment. That is why we need to create awareness. In the future, we might open a specific program for green hydrogen, connecting academia with this new industry.</p><h4>What are your objectives for the next 12 months?</h4><p>In line with the Oman Vision 2040, we are creating two new programs—one in cybersecurity and one in AI. These will be launched soon. We are also thinking of a new program for mining, in addition to introducing PhDs. The Building Technology Center should start as well. We created Eco-House building, which was sponsored by the research council in Oman as competition between all universities in Oman. The success story of the Eco House is in a building generating its own energy and uses mud bricks in an innovative way which are examples of what the new Building Technology Center can work to develop in the future.  We want to develop all that we have created as a basis and take OHC to the next level, starting with the pilot project in Sohar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main activities of Oman Data Park over the past year?</h4><p>Oman Data Park is the leader in Oman when it comes to cloud services provision. This is because we started very early. We started with a pure data center and then went one step further by providing cloud services. Today, we have four types of services and the past year has seen new additions to each of them. The first of the four is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) which now has our own product, Nebula — Oman's first and only virtual data center. It also has another version built in called Nebula Lagoon, which, is open source. Nebula serves critical workloads from key industries such as banks and oil &amp; gas, while Lagoon is more in the mid and small market cap. They have different service level agreements in terms of availability. On top of this, we signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide Microsoft Azure in Oman, and we have another platform that sits on Oracle cloud. In addition to IaaS, we started providing Platform as a Service (PaaS), which is more into database, as well as Software as a Service (SaaS), one of which is the e-signature which is marketed in Oman as eSign. This e-signature solution is the only such service in Oman that is connected to the national PKI system and is integrated with the ID card so that every corporation and citizen can use it confidently knowing that the signing parties are authenticated. We also provide another platform, Logistics as a Service (LaaS), which is for logistic SMEs in Oman that want to automate their logistics process. Furthermore, in 2020, we also renamed our existing cyber security center and launched Cyber Security Park, to  focus  purely on managed security services, be it proactive or reactive. We also supported businesses with the COVID-19 situation  where we provided a service that helps people to work remotely with the required security for their enterprise data. We call it Workspace as a Service (WaaS) and started providing it to all corporates.</p><h4>What services have you planned for 2021? </h4><p>In 2021, we are launching a product to provide a high-performance computing infrastructure for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform. We will launch it by June, and it will take us to the AI readiness space. We also look forward to focusing more on Duqm, where we have our third data center. We are considering to use Duqm as a test bed because it is a green area, with large corporations already established there. We will focus on providing IoT and AI. The idea is to work with different partners and the Duqm Authority to transform Duqm into a smart city.</p><h4>What role does technology play in maintaining positive growth in the country despite the pandemic?</h4><p>COVID-19 has been positive for technology. It created a different path toward a technology-rich highway. In Oman, for example, there are many developments today in regard to e-commerce that were not there before. E-commerce is growing in Oman, which has impacted us positively in terms of growth, balance sheets, cash flow, and P&amp;L. Some of the technological changes might not be permanent, but they will transform themselves and adapt to the new mode. Those companies that do not adapt to the new ways and means of doing business might not make it, unfortunately.</p><h4>What types of services have your big clients been demanding the most?</h4><p>IaaS, or the cloud, is in high demand. This was due to the disruption over international supply chains, as many corporates did not have the luxury of procuring IT hardware from different countries like before. There were many delays with imports of servers and storage devices, so we helped them seek an alternative: a local cloud. The second-most demanded were applications that promoted remote working, like Workspace as a Service. Other applications like e-signatures and Logistics as a Service were also in demand.</p><h4>What can the government do further to facilitate the growth of the ICT sector?</h4><p>Oman is positively geared toward the gig digital economy, and the government has its own initiatives and frameworks that will drive this transformation. We see ourselves as enablers and partners in this journey, as IT transformation and the gig economy sit on clouds. The business model of cloud purely sits on what we call economies of scale, which is why it is cheaper and the smarter way of doing things. The first step toward transforming one's company is cloudifying your product. Now, the government understands it is in great need of optimization, namely a cloud that results in at least 35-40% reduction in total cost of ownership over a period of three to five years. We have done this with the banking sector; today, 12 banks are hosted in ODP data centers. The same model is now embraced by government entities but slowly. The other side of the story is gearing up the service sector, namely providing robotic process automation and automating the services that we provide to citizens. We need to make it easier for citizens to acquire and pay for services in a seamless manner online using digital platforms. That is where you can create an SME market in the gig economy. The service sector in Oman is one of the ways of bringing up SMEs and improving the SME sector. One day, we hope to see ICT companies in the stock exchange of Oman, as that would mean that the gig economy is playing its part.</p><h4>What is your long-term strategy for international growth, and what challenges do you expect?</h4><p>Oman Data Park's next step is to grow internationally. Saudi Arabia and Africa are interesting markets for us. To work there, we are seeking partners that would take forward Oman Data Park's portfolio, sell it, and position it in those countries. There are two ways of doing this: through digital channels, where a large portion of data will sit in Oman Data Park's  main data centers; or through localized data centers in a foreign country. Nebula, for example, is our own product that we can ship and allow our partner to run. Currently, we are in talks with a few partners in Saudi Arabia and Africa. Some of them are small cloud or internet service providers, while others are system integrators and IT companies that are seeking to diversify their portfolios. We go in and diversify their portfolios by positioning our products and services. We are also working with corporates in Oman, like ports, to channel us outside, as they have many international relationships.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the most recent developments at Siemens Energy?</h4><p>Siemens Energy was spun-off from Siemens AG in order to leverage the business' strengths and to address the entire value chain of the energy sector. In September 2020, the company was publicly listed, and was promoted to the DAX, the main German stock index. Supporting our goal of making our own operations climate neutral by 2030, we also launched the Siemens Energy sustainability report, at the end of 2020. In addition, on a global scale 100% of Siemens Energy's electricity consumption should be met by power from renewable sources by 2023. In Oman, we also have a number of successful and recent developments; some 45% of the power produced in the Sultanate is by Siemens Energy's technologies. We have executed a number of strategic projects; with Liwa plastics and Salalah LPG, and have a strong footprint in oil and gas and transmission. Siemens Energy is providing the Duqm Integrated Power and Water project (DIPWP) with gas and steam turbines, long-term power generation services and digital solutions, to ensure stable energy supply and asset security. We want to energize society and ensure we are delivering stable, reliable, and efficient power across the energy value chain. It is not only about business transactions, but also about becoming a reliable partner that provides innovative technologies, creates jobs, helps communities, and has a positive impact on the growth of the economy. That is why we are a trusted partner and advisor to governments, especially on the energy transition journey.</p><h4>What projects on the government side can help you achieve your aims in Oman?</h4><p>Governments across the world are addressing the energy transition in order to build efficient, sustainable, affordable and secure energy systems, for society. Hydrogen is one key technology that is playing an increasingly important role in the energy transition and becoming an important component of the energy mix for most countries, governments, and businesses. We are working with our partners and customers to optimize efficiency and costs, reduce emissions, and therefore hydrogen can play an important role. We are investing heavily in green hydrogen and are also looking to collaborate with our strategic partners to advance the industry. We are engaged in several discussions in Oman on forming partnerships where we can develop green hydrogen projects. Looking at Oman's new targets, it is aiming to achieve 10% of renewable energy contribution by 2025. Oman is also focusing on diversifying the economy, and all of that is aligned with the energy transition. In order to achieve such ambitious goals, it is extremely important to select the right partners, ones able to bring investment, technology, and collaboration, to facilitate the energy transition journey. Siemens Energy's expertise and innovative technology makes us a partner of choice for companies and governments across the world.</p><h4>How is technology changing the energy sector in Oman?</h4><p>Innovation in technology is rapidly accelerating the development of the energy sector in Oman. However, the pandemic was an alarm and forced us to accelerate our digitalization and advanced technology strategy and become more flexible and innovative. Business continuity was extremely important in Oman as our work at strategically important infrastructure sites such as the Duqm, Salalah and Sur power plants, could not be suspended. We implemented digitalization and utilized advanced technologies, including in the form of remote services for field engineers, and at facilities, whilst adapting and updating our processes to uphold the highest HSE standards amid the pandemic. Aside from projects under execution, we also have several long term service agreements, which required us to mobilize field engineers to undertake vital inspections, maintenance and repair work at sites across Oman, to ensure stable access to power.. We needed to look at it from a logistics value chain perspective and tackle the obstacles. Everything was a lesson. Energy is something that cannot take on risk; everyone needs a stable, secure, and affordable energy system, so only businesses that decide to invest in the latest technology will remain. At the end of the day, you need technology that will support your transition. It is important to also ensure cybersecurity when working remotely; a plant has to be secure. In the coming years, we will continue to innovate new technology to enhance the operational excellence and the efficiency of plants.</p><h4>Do you see a need to upgrade Oman's infrastructure? How can technology help with that in the midterm?</h4><p>Oman has well established and diverse infrastructure, but like any other country, has its own challenges, like modernizing and upgrading ageing assets, transmitting electricity to remote villages, or across mountains. There are easy solutions, but they can be expensive, so we first need to do a complete study on the energy supply to see how it fits into the 2040 Vision. There are plenty of areas where the infrastructure can be modernized and made more efficient. We are already involved in a number of strategic projects where we will upgrade power plants and replace generators to increase efficiency and lower costs in terms of investment.</p><h4>How can Oman boost its efforts to reduce reliance on hydrocarbons and move toward the 2040 Vision?</h4><p>Oil and gas built the foundations of Oman, and it is now time to diversify its energy system and economy. Looking at the 2040 Vision, there are two fundamental aspects: investing in human capital and protecting the environment. The priorities to diversify the portfolio are centered on innovation, education, health, energy, and renewables. The renewable energy sector is broad and requires a diverse range of competencies, technologies, and skills, encompassing solar, wind, including both onshore and offshore; and the new business of hydrogen, whether green or blue. The country needs long-term partners with which it can work hand-in-hand and share its vision. It is not just about delivering turbines or transformers; there is also market access, knowledge transfer, partnerships, and creating business opportunities. Oman also needs to identify the sectors to invest in, where the gaps are, and which sectors will complement others. We are pleased to be supporting the country in the energy transition.</p><h4>How much of a priority is sustainability when you're building infrastructure in special industrial zones such as Duqm?</h4><p>Sustainability is core to our strategy and vision. We publish sustainability reports and our chief sustainability officer is our chief executive officer, highlighting the importance we place on the topic. We want to reduce CO2 emissions and the environmental impact of energy generation. All of that will be done by new and advanced technology. When that time comes, businesses will need a partner who has the technology. We are investing about EUR1 billion every year on innovation as a token of our commitment to the future.</p><h4>What are your main priorities for Oman for the next 12 months?</h4><p>We have a solid footprint in Oman in energy generation, transmission, distribution, and oil and gas. We want to maintain the installed base of our assets and extend their lifecycles. Second, we need to expand the energy business. We want to work with our partners to develop energy roadmaps and support them through the energy transition. When you diversify you need reliable energy. The new sectors will require new energy and this is where we see ourselves expanding our business. Part of the 2040 Vision is focused on the energy transition and diversification and we know we can add value and contribute there. That comes with creating jobs, working with universities, training students, and making a widespread positive impact. We “energize society“ for a brighter future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which directions have you expanded your services, and how are you progressing with the fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) initiative?</h4><p>We are now finalizing phase one of our expansion plan. We have rolled out FTTH to more than 460,000 homes in Oman (or nearly 50% of the housing units) and covered 91% of Muscat and 30% of the outside regions. In parallel, we have already started our phase two expansion plan that has three unique features and should be completed by 2030. First, we plan to allocate an element of our investment through a public-private partnership and the tender is currently being floated. We hope that some of the local community companies could participate in this because the return on investment would not only be financial, it will also boost businesses in the area and support broadband to schools for their children's education. <br>Second, we will introduce another technology, which is Fixed Wireless Access, in order to complement FTTH. We will commercialize our trial that was started last year but in parallel we want to tap into the C-band spectrum that is used for 5G technology. The negotiations with the regulator are moving fairly well regarding that. The third thing is providing a broadband service to remote areas through an initiative from the government. There has been a subsidiary allocated by the government worth around OMR15 million over 10 years. The service has already been launched at the end of last year. In terms of coverage, we have already reached 600 remote villages, which includes connections to  about 90 schools and many houses that had almost no telecom service. This broadband service is unique, as it is open access over satellite medium. We have signed with Ooredoo and Omantel and have been overwhelmed by the number of requests we received for the supply of terminals and connections. We were expecting to have a demand of around 600-700 in a year but received 500 in two months. Through these three approaches, by the end of phase two, around 75% of the housing units in Oman should be connected through fiber, another 10% will be through fixed wireless access on our side, close to 14% would be through supporting the operators connecting their towers with fiber, and 1% on satellite. Ultimately our plan is for every single house in Oman to have broadband service.</p><h4>In comparison to other connection options, why is fiber important?</h4><p>The pandemic has opened the eyes of everyone to the importance of solid infrastructure. In the past, connectivity was used for surfing the internet, mainly for entertainment; however, when everyone is forced to study and work from home, needs change. We have seen the shift. The highest demand we have seen since the inception of Oman Broadband was the last three months of 2020. We were hit when around 300,000 expatriates left the country for good, but even so we have still managed to grow our business. Now, with the shift taking place in the way we conduct our business and our lives, solid infrastructure is becoming extremely important. The demand for bandwidth doubles every two years and no other medium can compete with fiber. We cannot reach everywhere with fiber just yet so we will complement it with fixed wireless, which is advancing significantly.</p><h4>What led to your decision to be listed at the Muscat Securities Market in 2023? What role will that play in your long-term strategy?</h4><p>It is actually part of our license obligation—in January 2019, we were given five years to go public. We have progressed rapidly as a company and delivered broadband infrastructure to almost 50% of the homes in Oman. We set an IPO target for 2023, but we will prepare ourselves ahead of that. It all depends on the market readiness as well because we want to do the IPO when we can get a decent value for our shares.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>In 2021, we should be able to fast track the migration of users using other technologies into fiber and reach a decent number toward 2022. We will also start on fixed wireless, as the need for solid infrastructure is becoming obvious to everyone. There is a great deal of attention on the ICT sector from the government, which will be a positive thing for Oman Broadband. We have Vodafone as a new client and have started setting up the infrastructure to support them.  A new mobile operator will increase the competition in the telecom sector in Oman, although looking at the amount of investment Vodafone needs to do for 5G and with a small market like Oman, it has to be very careful. We have been receiving requests to backhaul its mobile sites with fiber as preparation for that, and many orders are already coming up. Fortunately in 2020, we made an agreement with all six electricity companies to leverage on their infrastructure. This allows us to provide competitive offers to the operators so they can shift their backhaul to fiber.</p><h4>How will the whole ICT landscape evolve in the long term, and what regulatory focus should be placed to ensure its evolution will be innovation based?</h4><p>Forming the ICT group reflects the government's aim to increase value on the GDP created from these sectors and its confidence in them. If you look at the ICT on the telecom side, we are doing quite well though on the IT side there is big potential for leverage. We have the infrastructure, and perhaps the government needs to revisit some of its regulations. A greater amount of traffic could potentially transit in Oman as long as we can adopt the open-access approach with competitive pricing. If we step in and are able to liberalize this aspect, then potentially we could attract a great deal of international traffic.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Cercle d'Economia de Mallorca play in the long-term planning of the island's public policies, especially in the economic field?</h4><p>Cercle d'Economia de Mallorca is a not-for-profit organization that works in the Spanish region of the Balearic Islands, and its action is based on four strategic goals. The first of its goals is to maintain its independence and impartiality in matters that affect the region. We bring together companies. Its 275 members and 32 collaborating entities make the Cercle a plural and independent organisation of all types of private, sectoral or political interest. The diverse professional profiles and political sensitivities of its members makes the Cercle a socially transverse institution. These qualities give the Cercle a unique personality and a pluralistic view consistent with the complex society of today. Second, we are an active collaborator of public institutions. Along with other organizations and private companies, we work with the public sector with the goal of establishing strategic alliances. In order to improve our governance, we meet with public officials and leading politicians from all parties. A third area is the revitalization and progress of society in general. Cercle d'Economia de Mallorca seeks to attain sustainable growth, and with this in mind, we are working to push for a roadmap for transformation of the Balearic Islands. This is a small region in Spain, but it receives about 16 million tourists per year. Mallorca and Baleares in general have historically been a strategic location in the Mediterranean. Despite the small size of the archipelago, the four islands are extremely different from each other. Menorca is a biosphere reserve, Ibiza is the internationally known leisure destination, Mallorca is a mix of the two islands, and the fourth island is Formentera. In all, we have a strategic location, an extraordinary international airport and outstanding power and telecom connectivity. Over the last 50 years, Baleares has grown significantly due to construction and tourism. We need to maintain an excellent tourism experience to receive quality visitors who respect the environment. In addition, there is an opportunity to develop new projects that help to diversify the economy of the region, following the examples of other regions in Spain such as Málaga. Málaga over the last 20 years has worked to create a technology industry that accounts for 20% of its GDP. Tourism remains important to the city and surrounding region, but the city has managed to diversify into other sectors of the economy. For example, in Palma de Mallorca, which concentrates 40% of the island's population, there is a project being approved to align several sectors. This is a project that will be developed by 2030 to become a business hub in the city. It is located five minutes away from the city center and is expected to act as center for innovation located in the capital of the Balearic Islands: Nou Llevant innovation district.</p><h4>What would be the main goals in terms of economic diversification, and which sectors are better positioned to serve this purpose?</h4><p>Every economic plan has to be led by the regional government. Health tourism can be an important area, as there can be long- and short-term health tourists that not only dynamize tourism facilities, but also health facilities such as clinics or hospitals. The excellent weather conditions are a perfect fit for such tourism. The sun is our oil, as we have 2,800 sun hours per year. That is also one of the reasons why many foreigners buy homes on the islands. They want to spend the winter enjoying the island's pleasant weather. Additionally, there are some sectors that are growing significantly. The Balearian economy is to some extent already diversified, although it might not be widely known. We need to develop sectors that are already performing well in the island, such as biomedicine. There are many companies in Baleares that are working with universities to conduct research in areas such as cancer. Energy transition has great potential as well. A great deal of investments are being made in solar power facilities and even in green hydrogen. Besides, there are many investments in elderly care, which will become a strategic area given the ageing population.</p><h4>How has the pandemic affected the economic direction of Mallorca?</h4><p>The COVID-19 crisis has been a shock for the residents of Baleares. Our GDP declined by 25%. Because of that, we are focusing on improving the quality of the tourism sector and developing alternative economic sectors. As a result of that, there are sectors that are experiencing rapid growth. Some of these investments come from large hotel chains that have revamped their hotels. One of the most important hotels, Formentor Hotel, has been bought for EUR165 million. Right now, we need to receive large capital investments, and that is happening already. We see many funds acquiring hotels. For example, Apple Leisure Group is investing in Mallorca. We are seeing a reconversion of the economy. Before COVID-19, we did not feel the need to find alternative businesses. However, now we have realized it is necessary to develop other complementary sectors such as academia. We have a university among the best 500 in the world according to the ShanghaiRanking. Despite being a small university, it is highly specialized in certain scientific areas, such as physics. The university is also assessing the type of professionals that the islands will require in the coming years thanks to the presence in the island of technology company such as OmniAccess or Robot Corporativo.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes ProColombia the number-one organization that companies in Colombia can count on and a one-stop shop support for their expansion endeavors?</h4><p>As part of the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Tourism, we want to establish Colombia as a leading destination for FDI. We offer strategic support for investors at all stages of the investment cycle. We adopted a strategy along with the government that we call the “red carpet,“ which is a comprehensive package of institutional, legal, and financial actions that give us the necessary tools to offer investors timely and empathetic attention. We also developed a one-stop shop with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank to be the single point of institutional contact for foreign investors who seek to be profitable and successful in Colombia. We want investors to find valuable information to make investment decisions that will allow them to carry out the process of getting established in our country. We prepare agendas tailor-made to the sectors and individual investors.</p><h4>What programs does ProColombia have for the benefit of the business community?</h4><p>We are working hard to support the reactivation program. We are convinced of the importance of the immense contribution by the international business sector for the development of our country. We consider it an honor to support them in their internationalization and investment processes. From August 2018 to April 2021, we have accompanied the arrival of 521 investment projects from 48 countries, which represent more than USD20.1 billion and will create more than 215,000 new jobs. For 1Q2021, we had USD4,236 million in non-mining exports, a 14.3% increase YoY. Agro exports grew 16.5%, while chemicals and life sciences increased by 20.9%. We also promote sustainable and high-quality tourism, which is why the country has led major projects such as the sustainable tourism policy and the general tourism law, which focus on strengthening the sector from a sustainable perspective. We have resumed 55% of air travel routes. In recent studies, Colombia is one of the countries in the region with the greatest recovery in tourism. We are ready to assist all national and foreign companies to succeed here.</p><h4>What steps has the country taken in terms of export promotion?</h4><p>We started as an agency to promote exports in our country. We are working hard to make our exports well-known and recognized as quality products and talented services. We are working on strategies to reach key markets and working through the internationalization factories program to make regions more successful in exports. This program offers tailor-made services for our companies, and the idea is to strengthen their foreign trade area. We would like them to take advantage of exporting via e-commerce, among other services. We also want Colombian companies to participate in the main fairs around the world because we want to establish relationships with the most relevant buyers of industries. We would also like to facilitate business opportunities.</p><h4>What areas of the Colombian economy are interesting for business and pose important opportunities for investors abroad?</h4><p>We have several sectors that we want to showcase to the world. For example, there are great opportunities in agribusiness and infrastructure. In infrastructure, there are opportunities to modernize roads, railroads, river transportation, and airports. Colombia also has great potential to generate energy through non-conventional sources such as solar, wind, ocean, and geothermal. For the agribusiness sector, our country has more than 32 million ha available to grow fruit, vegetables, cocoa, specialty coffees, teas, and other products. There are opportunities in assembly of auto parts, construction materials, and aerospace among others. Colombia also presents opportunities in cosmetics, chemicals, and life sciences. We have been growing at high rates of exports in those sectors. We also have opportunities in the oil and gas sectors. For tourism, our country has a range of possibilities in hospitality, infrastructure, and tourism projects. During the last five years, Colombia has ranked fifth with the largest number of FDI in projects in the tourism sector in the region. IT infrastructure is also a great opportunity for the delivery of services. We are the fourth-largest IT market in Latin America. The orange law seeks to develop and promote the creative industry. Colombia is also a prime location for movie production. We have a law that provides tax incentives for film creatives. Medellí­n is host to the  Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution of the World Economic Forum, and it represents a great opportunity to be the first Spanish-speaking country and Latin American state to be part of that network.</p><h4>In the first part of 2021, the Colombian tourism sector had the quickest recovery among South American countries. To what do you attribute this success, and how is Pro Colombia committed to supporting this industry?</h4><p>We were working before the pandemic to make tourism the new oil for Colombia. We want the tourism industry to have a full recovery. We took measures to protect the sector and designed a recovery plan focused on developing processes that the new reality required for our sector to adapt. We are providing the tools to help travel sector companies maintain their businesses, which is essential. We are redesigning all products and experiences according to the new types of consumers. For example, we made our exporter training program virtual, and it has been an example for the region. This tool offers training on biosafety, innovation, sustainability. In 2020, we had more than 21,000 participants in all departments of the country, and this year, we will relaunch the same program with more content. We implemented our certified COVID-19 biosafety seal, which seeks to generate trust among travelers and consumers, minimize the risk of infection, and boost tourism. Right now, more than 700 companies have been certified, including airports like Bogotá, Cali, Cartagena, Santa Marta, Bucaramanga, and Cúcuta; airlines such as Vivaair, Wingo, Satena, and Easyfly; and hotels like Movich and Decameron. In 2021. Colombia has already recovered 55% of its international capacity. We want to promote best practices that conserve and protect Colombia's natural and cultural heritage through responsible tourism. We have reformed the tourism law that puts sustainability as the main core.</p><h4>How would you describe Colombia in a sentence and how would you like the country to be recognized abroad?</h4><p>We want to be recognized through our new country brand manifesto, “Colombia: The most welcoming place on Earth.“ We want the world to experience, know, and feel at home in Colombia. The international community must recognize Colombia's service-oriented culture and the empathy that is part of our DNA. We want travelers to enjoy the warmth and richness of our destinations, and for business leaders to appreciate the talent of our people. We want to tell travelers, investors, and international buyers that Colombia is ready to continue with their businesses. We will work hard to develop success stories by working hard in our transformation through innovation, sustainability, and business in our different regions. We are working hard on our vaccination program as well. We hope we can see more visitors soon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

The diverse professional profiles and political sensitivities of its members makes the Cercle a socially transverse institution. These qualities give the Cercle a unique personality and a pluralistic view consistent with the complex society of today. Second, we are an active collaborator of public institutions. Along with other organizations and private companies, we work with the public sector with the goal of establishing strategic alliances. In order to improve our governance, we meet with public officials and leading politicians from all parties. A third area is the revitalization and progress of society in general. Cercle d'Economia de Mallorca seeks to attain sustainable growth, and with this in mind, we are working to push for a roadmap for transformation of the Balearic Islands. This is a small region in Spain, but it receives about 16 million tourists per year. Mallorca and Baleares in general have historically been a strategic location in the Mediterranean. Despite the small size of the archipelago, the four islands are extremely different from each other. Menorca is a biosphere reserve, Ibiza is the internationally known leisure destination, Mallorca is a mix of the two islands, and the fourth island is Formentera. In all, we have a strategic location, an extraordinary international airport and outstanding power and telecom connectivity. Over the last 50 years, Baleares has grown significantly due to construction and tourism. We need to maintain an excellent tourism experience to receive quality visitors who respect the environment. In addition, there is an opportunity to develop new projects that help to diversify the economy of the region, following the examples of other regions in Spain such as Málaga. Málaga over the last 20 years has worked to create a technology industry that accounts for 20% of its GDP. Tourism remains important to the city and surrounding region, but the city has managed to diversify into other sectors of the economy. For example, in Palma de Mallorca, which concentrates 40% of the island's population, there is a project being approved to align several sectors. This is a project that will be developed by 2030 to become a business hub in the city. It is located five minutes away from the city center and is expected to act as center for innovation located in the capital of the Balearic Islands: Nou Llevant innovation district.</p><h4>What would be the main goals in terms of economic diversification, and which sectors are better positioned to serve this purpose?</h4><p>Every economic plan has to be led by the regional government. Health tourism can be an important area, as there can be long- and short-term health tourists that not only dynamize tourism facilities, but also health facilities such as clinics or hospitals. The excellent weather conditions are a perfect fit for such tourism. The sun is our oil, as we have 2,800 sun hours per year. That is also one of the reasons why many foreigners buy homes on the islands. They want to spend the winter enjoying the island's pleasant weather. Additionally, there are some sectors that are growing significantly. The Balearian economy is to some extent already diversified, although it might not be widely known. We need to develop sectors that are already performing well in the island, such as biomedicine. There are many companies in Baleares that are working with universities to conduct research in areas such as cancer. Energy transition has great potential as well. A great deal of investments are being made in solar power facilities and even in green hydrogen. Besides, there are many investments in elderly care, which will become a strategic area given the ageing population.</p><h4>How has the pandemic affected the economic direction of Mallorca?</h4><p>The COVID-19 crisis has been a shock for the residents of Baleares. Our GDP declined by 25%. Because of that, we are focusing on improving the quality of the tourism sector and developing alternative economic sectors. As a result of that, there are sectors that are experiencing rapid growth. Some of these investments come from large hotel chains that have revamped their hotels. One of the most important hotels, Formentor Hotel, has been bought for EUR165 million. Right now, we need to receive large capital investments, and that is happening already. We see many funds acquiring hotels. For example, Apple Leisure Group is investing in Mallorca. We are seeing a reconversion of the economy. Before COVID-19, we did not feel the need to find alternative businesses. However, now we have realized it is necessary to develop other complementary sectors such as academia. We have a university among the best 500 in the world according to the ShanghaiRanking. Despite being a small university, it is highly specialized in certain scientific areas, such as physics. The university is also assessing the type of professionals that the islands will require in the coming years thanks to the presence in the island of technology company such as OmniAccess or Robot Corporativo.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Jotun Saudia was founded in 1984. What is your outlook for operations in Saudi Arabia, and which sector is Jotun Saudia focusing on in terms of growth?</h4><p>Jotun Saudia is focused on paints and coatings, and we are number-one in Saudi Arabia in this business. We are active in four segments. Our main focus is decorative paint used in construction, while our second focus is protective paint and coatings used mainly in oil and gas, energy, and infrastructure projects. We then have marine paints used for ships. The marine segment provides an opportunity to grow in Saudi Arabia because the country is investing in new shipyards on its eastern seaboard. Fourthly, we have powder coatings that are unique to Jotun Saudia and used in many industries, such as oil and gas, piping, and manufacturing.</p><h4>Jotun Saudia has introduced the world's first resilient antifouling technology, SeaLion Resilient. What other environmentally friendly initiatives are in the pipeline?</h4><p>We have had the environmental program Green Steps for many years. The program does not solely focus on our end products; it starts from the raw materials, goes through our manufacturing process, our products, and finally their application. We look at the full product cycle to study each step's impact on the environment. This is not only to invent new products but to develop new ways of producing and to look at what materials we are using. Second, regarding the development of end-user benefits, we have the latest technology, and our parent company is keen on environmental protection because of our Scandinavian roots. We have developed it further locally in our R&amp;D, and we apply an environmentally friendly model of high quality. We are releasing environmentally friendly products in our four segments, including decorative products related to house interiors and exteriors and industrial products that are applicable to airports and refineries.</p><h4>How is Jotun Saudia increasing its technological innovations, specifically with AI affecting the paint industry and your operations in this field?</h4><p>We are far ahead when compared to similar industries. When it comes to our factory operations and manufacturing, we use many automated machines. We have three factories in Saudi Arabia. As one of them was established 30 years ago, we update our machinery and automation annually. When it comes to e-solutions, most of our processes are digitalized now. Our ERP system is one of the latest, and our other operating and finance systems are digital. We handle our day-to-day activities electronically, thus eliminating the need for paper. In general, we are much less dependent on manual processes today.</p><h4>How has the Kingdom's shift away from being an oil-based economy enhanced and increased your business?</h4><p>The impact on our business depends on the government's spending. If the Saudi government is spending on non-oil and gas sectors, it affects our bottom line. For example, the government has announced a huge Ministry of Housing project through which some 47,000 housing units will be built all over the country. As paint is required for this type of construction project, we sell paints to these types of projects. But we also benefit when the government focuses on the oil and gas sector.</p><h4>How is Jotun Saudia looking to leverage its international advantages as an established and highly knowledgeable local partner?</h4><p>Our motto is global experience with a local presence. We have international experience and international R&amp;D labs all over the world, so we share knowledge. But when we apply this knowledge, we try to use our local and regional R&amp;D lab to innovate products that fit the local market and needs. This is why we are ahead of the game compared to our competitors. Jotun Saudia is the biggest paint manufacturer with the highest number of companies, factories, and R&amp;D centers in the Middle East. Nobody has invested like us over so many years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Endesa was established in 1944 within INI with the aim of becoming the leading company in the energy sector in Spain. What are Endesa's values, and how has the company evolved over the years?</h4><p>Endesa has been at the forefront of the electricity sector in Spain for 77 years. Since its creation in 1944 to date, the company has been a protagonist in the development of the energy sector, betting from the first moment on innovation and the development of the regions in which it operates. These values marked the company since its inception and continue to do so now, when the sector undergoes an unprecedented transformation with two protagonists: decarbonization and digitization. We were born with coal, which helped the economic development of Spain for decades, but now we live in a completely different world. Endesa, the leader in the electricity market in Spain, has made clear its commitment to decarbonization, which has its best ally in the electrification of the economy, and has been committed to promoting renewable energies for years. Approximately 85% of Endesa's peninsular energy production is now emissions free, a figure that will reach 90% by 2023. We are in a new era of energy, more open, participatory and digital, in which sustainability must mark the way of acting of the company in all its areas. Endesa is convinced this is the way forward, and we make every effort to achieve it.</p><h4>Endesa announced in 2021 a 22% increase in the volume of projects submitted to the European funds. What are the main activities to which these funds would be used?</h4><p>The Recovery, Transformation, and Resilience Funds represent a unique opportunity to accelerate the transformation of the Spanish economy and recover from the enormous blow caused by the pandemic. Among the 122 projects presented by Endesa with an associated investment of EUR23.3 billion are projects for the development of smart grids, the promotion of renewables, sustainable transport, renewable hydrogen, the rehabilitation of buildings, and the improvement of efficiency. There are also programs on storage and flexibility and the development of the circular economy, mainly recycling shovels and batteries. It is a powerful battery of projects marked by innovation that would significantly help the recovery of the Spanish economy, with the creation of 214,000 jobs and estimated emission reductions of 13.6 million tons of CO2 per year if they go ahead in their entirety.</p><h4>Endesa has shown a firm commitment to the UN's SGDs set out in the 2030 Agenda. What goals has Endesa set in this area within its 2021-2023 strategic plan?</h4><p>Endesa's strategy is fully aligned with the goal of achieving a 100% decarbonized economy by 2050, in line with the European objectives to combat climate change. In this sense, our strategic plan for the period 2021-2023, which provides for an investment of EUR7.9 billion, focuses on promoting renewable energies and digitization to accelerate the energy transition and decarbonization. In these three years, we will increase our renewable generation park by 50%, with an investment of EUR3,300 million, and we will give a definitive boost to the digitization of the electricity grid with investments of EUR2,600 million. We will continue to bet on the electrification of demand and the promotion of sustainable mobility with the forecast of deploying 56,000 charging points for electric vehicles by the end of 2023.</p><h4>The energy sector is immersed in a paradigm shift due to COVID-19, with digitalization being one of its pillars. What main challenges has Endesa had to face in this regard?</h4><p>The pandemic has accelerated the digitalization of the economy. The most digitalized companies are the ones that have been best able to cope with the pandemic. Those that did not bet on it have surrendered to the fact that without digitalization there is no future, while those that were already convinced of its virtues, like Endesa, have only more than doubled their commitment to digitalization. The digitization of the customer relationship and asset management has allowed Endesa to successfully cope with the extraordinary conditions generated by COVID-19 and contribute to guaranteeing the electricity supply, customer service, and even remote work of a solid part of our staff in the best conditions.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for 2021?</h4><p>After a complex start to the year still marked by the pandemic, we hope the situation will gradually normalize. 2021 is a decisive year to begin the recovery of the economy. Endesa will continue to bet on digitalization, decarbonization, and sustainable growth. We are determined to be one of the engines of this economic take-off after the pandemic, and for this we will deploy a significant investment effort to continue advancing. We will do so in compliance with our model of just energy transition, in which no one is left behind.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights for Mall of Qatar since its opening, and how have you prepared for the reactivation of the economy post COVID-19?</h4><p>Mall of Qatar opened in December 2016 and has had great success both in the country and the region since then. It was the first of its type in the sense of being a huge mall and the experiences it offers. It is the favourite destination for the residents and visitors due to the exceptional facilities and variety of options. At the Nation's Mall, we always endeavor to meet the customers' expectations and make their exceptional and unique. During the first quarter of 2020, we accomplished huge success, especially during the Shop Qatar festival. We hosted a concert for famous singers and bands on our oasis stage, with hundreds of fans attending. The following two quarters of 2020 have significantly impacted all sectors of the economy, specifically the retail sectors, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Mall of Qatar strategy for 2020 consisted of the two-level process: One is to support the tenants to tackle the current unfortunate situation, and the second is related to the customers. Many tenants started their on-line services during the pandemic through their channels, and we supported them through our communication channels to maximize customers' reach and support their business during the closure of their stores. During the temporary closure, we were preparing for the upcoming phases and the reopening of the Mall; we explored the best options to reactivate the business, that's why we implemented a well-designed plan for safety measures and marketing strategy. The precautionary measures helped us gain the visitor's and tenant's confidence to come back to the Mall of Qatar and maintain a pleasant shopping and dining experience. Our communication campaigns supported all those precautionary measures. We have successfully met our expectations by encouraging people to do their shopping again at the Mall. As a result, we received a decent number of shoppers who were keen to return in-person to retail shopping. During the fourth quarter, we organised the biggest Shop &amp; Win festival, with 20 luxury cars until January 2021 by giving a car every week to the lucky winner, and this is one of the biggest shopping festivals ever done in Qatar. All these factors were crucial to reactivate the economic cycle, and we are planning for more in the coming months. At Mall of Qatar, our focus is to create exceptional customer experience through understanding their interaction with the mall brands and the level of their satisfaction for us to provide the best services.</p><h4>What is the Mall of Qatar's unique value proposition taking into consideration the fierce competition in the sector?</h4><p>The competition is increasing due to the opening of new malls, and this will only positively affect the customers and push us to improve our services and offering. That's why our strategy is built on two main pillars: world-class products and five-star services. We are a massive mall of around 500 stores and dining outlets that caters to all classes, with world-class entertainment facilities for all ages and genders, including KidzMondo, Cinema theatres, play area, and many other services. Our 360-degree stage in the Oasis is exceptionally unique in Qatar, and no other mall has such a facility in which they are capable of hosting shows and events.  The 360-degree stage is another factor that makes the Mall of Qatar a significant entertainment destination. We host international singers, artists, music shows while visitors can enjoy having food in the surrounding restaurants or watch football matches on giant screens. Mall of Qatar is the first mall to be connected directly to Doha by metro. One can travel to the Mall of Qatar quickly and without going outside in the heat. We have a 19 cinema screens, the largest in Qatar. We have an IMAX cinema, a cinema with traditional Arabic seating, and a VIP cinema where one can order food while watching a movie. Besides, Al Rayyan Hotel, which is connected to the Mall, is a significant addition to our facilities that complements our business and the customers' journey. In addition, an important factor that differentiates us is the means of transportation available to get into the mall. Mall of Qatar can be reached easily by car, bus, or metro, especially that we are only 20 minutes away from the heart of Doha; this has helped us to receive more visitors. When it comes to customer service, our main objective is to enhance the customer journey and exceed their expectations, from the moment they arrive until they leave. In brief, the Mall of Qatar is not just a shopping mall, it is a destination where people can enjoy world-class shopping and dining experience with entertainment.</p><h4>How does the metro connection broaden Mall of Qatar's customer base?</h4><p>Mall of Qatar is the only Mall in the country that is attached to the Metro station through an air-conditioned bridge. Besides, we are the destination for a massive community in nearby areas such as the education city, Qatar Foundation, and Sidra Hospital. These communities also can use the metro, which passes by their substations. It is effortless and comfortable for them to reach the Mall within minutes. Today everyone is using the metro because it is very comfortable and contribute to protecting the environment. So, the metro has been a very important advantage for us.</p><h4>What does going to a mall mean today?</h4><p>Mall nowadays is more than shopping. It is a complete experience for everyone. That's why we are planning to come up with a new comprehensive program once restrictions are eased. Hopefully, we will have a completely different program of a theatre type live shows in 2021. Shopping malls must create a greater role in consumers' social life and act as a destination hub to enjoy dinning, entertainment, leisure, and socializing.</p><h4>Al Rayyan Stadium has a capacity of 45,000 people, but there will also be many more World Cup fans outside the stadium. What will Mall of Qatar be like during a World Cup game?</h4><p>Mall of Qatar is located next to one of FIFA 2022 stadiums -  Al-Rayyan Stadium; this will maximize our visitors' reach during the global event or for other main events it will host The Mall will  be the main hub for the fans coming to the stadium and those who do not have the opportunity to attend the game. For FIFA 2022 competitions, we are working in close coordination with the Supreme Committee for Delivery &amp; Legacy (SC). Thousands of football fans will come to the stadium, and Mall of Qatar will be their main stop before and after the match, whether to shop, dine, entertain, or even participate in the many activities.Besides, our screens at the 360-degree stage at the Oasis will be a hub for watching the matches live while enjoying the variety of food options or merely just enjoying the live events we will organize during the tournament. Besides, we are working on strategic plans for fans to live an exciting experience with the global and famous bands that we will host.</p><h4>How is Mall of Qatar enacting Qatar's digital and technology transformation?</h4><p>Our digital transformation will be something more than the normal standard. We will use innovations to enhance our e-commerce proposition, loyalty program, and customer relationship management (CRM). Our digital transformation plan is a huge project. The pandemic was a good opportunity to strategize and plan what we will do. We are spending a great deal of effort, resources, and investment to make Mall of Qatar's digital transformation project successful. Innovation should be constant to improve different areas of the business and keep creating new value for the customers. That's why we focus on strategies that deliver greater customer journey by offering services that meet their expectations</p><h4>What are the next steps for Mall of Qatar in the coming months and years?</h4><p>The primary focus now is to overcome the challenges of COVID-19 and bring back life and business to normal. In this regard, Qatar's strategy in healthcare and the heavy investments for the development of healthcare infrastructure, medical supplies and other products and services for over the last several years have helped the country achieve 100 percent self-sufficiency. The country is today well-positioned in fighting its battle against the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic on its own to keep the people of this country safe and protected. Qatar's healthcare spending is among the highest in the Middle East and one of the best in the world. Now with the vaccination plan in place, we are very optimistic that we will win this battle. And we, in Mall of Qatar, are well prepared for that. Our vision in Mall of Qatar is to create an innovative and engaging experience to our customers that go well beyond traditional shopping, by adapting technologies to improve customers' journey and cater to their needs and well-being. Mall of Qatar the Nation's Mall is a perfect social place to share quality time with friends and family. We will continue to deliver innovative and interactive activities and events that adds value to the shopping experience. our strategy on adopting different approach that combines digital and physical experience will cater attract to the next generation of visitors. The plan for 2021 is to accomplish growth and maintain our position as the Nation's Mall and the favorite destination for all customer groups. Next to the mall, there will be a new urban community that includes residential towers of around 1,000 units and a school. The Mall will be serving the needs of this new community, and it will help to revive the area and create an integrated neighborhood that has all services and needs within walking distance. All those upcoming plans will support us in accomplishing and reaching our primary objective, which is to contribute to the national economy and the 2030 National Vision through diversifying the economy, maintaining sustainable development, and motivating the tourism and retail sector in Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most significant achievements of Ahlibank since its rebranding in 2014?</h4><p>We did a great job with the new brand and the new vision for Ahlibank, which is to be at the heart of the community. We are a 37-year-old bank, and we consider ourselves as a boutique bank providing different banking experiences and services. We like to remain close to our clients, understand their needs, and design our products based on those needs. Now, we have a great selection of products in line with our overall brand. Our achievements after the rebranding were on the side of products as well as on our position in the market and branch openings. We invested heavily on the technology side and are currently working on that because the future of banking services will be even more digital. Mobile and online banking services, will enhance customers' banking experience.</p><h4>Was this caused by COVID-19 or was it a previous trend at Ahlibank?</h4><p>COVID-19 has set an example in the sense that 80% are working from home, and business is still going smoothly. We knew about the importance of deploying more technology, but COVID-19 helped us to give incredible importance to it. The new normal is an online and digital arena, but how you design it and its quality are also crucial to all stakeholders. We recently launched our updated online banking and mobile banking app offering new features for fast, secure, and convenient banking services. You can even experience the touch of technology in our branches; as we have digitalized services but have retained well-designed branches with a proper distribution in Qatar covering many areas and with the best staff selected under the Qatarization criteria. The result of our digitalization and rebranding is that we have a stable balance sheet with a great portfolio of clients. We can grow fast very easily but our aim is to grow strategically.</p><h4>How do you assess the confidence in Ahlibank from the capital markets after your last issuance?</h4><p>We issued bonds in mid-September 2020 for USD500 million. It was a great success for Ahlibank because a major share of demand came from the UK, Europe, and Asia, and the international market covered 90% of our issuance. That proves the trust the international market has in Ahlibank. These investors studied Ahlibank in depth and decided to go forward.  The support from international banks such as Barclays and QNB Capital had also a great positive implication. This confidence was reflected in the price, and this gives us a feeling of pride and also of responsibility to keep doing our best to grow Ahlibank.</p><h4>What is your assessment on the PPP Law, and what it brings to Qatar in terms of the development of the country?</h4><p>We are a local bank, and we always support the development of the country. This is excellent for the long-term growth of Qatar itself, including the banking sector. The PPP Law gives a solid and transparent structure for the development of PPP projects in Qatar. We participate in many important government and non-government projects in Qatar, and one of our responsibilities is to support sectors such as contracting, as there is a huge construction sector here in Qatar. We finance the infrastructure projects in Qatar to develop industry and schools, for example, as we have a great base of such transactions. The PPP Law makes these transactions even more possible, efficient, and smoother in terms of the relations between the government and the private sector. We do our best to assist on all projects, especially government-related ones as these are important projects, with on-time payments and great security. Our bank is well organized, and we are present in all sectors. The PPP Law is just a new tool to keep growing in that direction and in alignment with Qatar National Vision 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the main highlights for Clairra Group in 2020?</strong></p><p><span></span>SAAD SULTAN AL HAJIRI In 2020, our foodstuff division was at its peak, such as introducing and bringing in a variety of new products, ranging from frozen, fresh, chilled, and dry products from Europe, the US, Turkey, and other countries. This was in line with our vision of becoming the prime distributors and suppliers of food products and dominating the food industry (from catering, QSR, and HORECA) and also be in a position to meet the needs of a more demanding consumer. We also partnered with companies from the EU under an exclusivity agreement to be the sole distributor of their products in the local Qatari market. In our real estate division, we provide worker accommodations and have increased our properties such as acquiring more staff accommodation and government-approved land.</p><p><strong><span></span>What is your assessment of the current situation of the food security program, and how are you contributing?</strong></p><p><span></span>SSAH Qatar has experienced a tremendous evolution in food security and food system sustainability as a result of challenges such as the blockade and COVID-19, which has truly shaped food-related trends. To ensure long-term food security for its population, Qatar has implemented various policies and strategies envisioned in Qatar National Vision 2030, in which private sectors such as Clairra plays a prominent role in diversifying the market with quality products and services to foster the transition toward sustainable food distribution, consumption, and production in Qatar.</p><p><strong><span></span>Why is Qatar so resilient when it comes to shocks such as the blockade and the current pandemic?</strong></p><p><span></span>SSAH The blockade was a blessing in disguise for Qatar, spurring a shift to self-reliance that gave rise to local manufacturers of variety of food products that were not there previously. In less than three years, our government has supported through swift response in addressing the emerging challenges while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Qatar population.</p><p><span></span>SULAIMAN PALAPATTA By 2019, Qatari's economy had effectively dealt with the shocks from the blockade and oil price drop, and when COVID-19 struck, Qatar was already resilient and highly self-sustainable, thanks to the Qatari government that had successfully bridged the shortfall in domestic agricultural production, by supporting local production, which ensured the availability of food that was affordable, safe, and of the best quality to sustain its growing and more affluent population.</p><p><strong><span></span>How do you see the real estate market evolving in light of the 2022 FIFA World Cup?</strong></p><p><span></span>SSAH Real estate is a new priority for us, and there is no doubt that the 2022 FIFA World Cup, estimated to draw more than 1.5 million fans, has created the perfect momentum in the country. This major influx of tourists will likely result in Qatar investing more in real estate. We have laid the foundation for our real estate business in the last few years and are now acquiring properties and accommodations for workers, who play a vital role in the development of the World Cup project. We have plans for the entire project cycle, from inception to delivery and legacy. We seek to do our best to provide all that we can in terms of accommodation in the high-end residential areas for the tourists.</p><p><span></span>SP The road to 2022 will witness tremendous growth, with an increase in construction activities, GDP growth, and the introduction of various policies by the government boosting the real estate sector in the country and driving the growth of commercial real estate. Clairra will grab the opportunity with both hands and benefit from this great opportunity.</p><p><strong><span></span>What segments of the real estate business will have an edge in the future?</strong></p><p><span></span>SP We are also focusing heavily on villas and the higher tier segments of accommodation. We are increasing our portfolio and will continue to do so. We also rely on the corporate sector and have some contracts here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>What were the main highlights for 360 Nautica in 2019 and 2020?</strong></p><p>In 2019, we progressed well despite the costs of building our own brands and adopting a formal startup-enhancing structure. In 2019, we also became Qatar's chapter lead for the global start-up program “Startup Grind." Our role within this partnership is to enhance the startup ecosystem through networking and knowldge sharing initiatives. We have extended our partnership in 2020 by joining forces with Microsoft for Startups, Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, Trescon, and Lankan Angel Network to create meaningful additions in building the ecosystem. Our role is to look for promising ideas, incubate, accelerate, fund, and/or coach them. Through our engagement with all stakeholders in the ecosystem we came to understand the gaps in the system, thanks to all these activities, so we decided to launch the 360Nautica Startup programe in October 2019 at QITCOM. We are currently one of the first venture builders in the country, and our main objective is to support the local entrepreneurial ecosystem. We have taken another step in doing so by embarking on a strategic investment in Qatar's healthcare tech start-up, At Home Doc. We look forward to further helping them grow through our partners and reaching their full potential. We have to remain innovative, diversify our target businesses and sectors, and learn how to survive and thrive during a crisis like everyone else. In light of this, we have also launched Qatar's first start-up portal, <a href="http://www.dohastartups.com">www.dohastartups.com</a>. The Doha Startups portal is designed to be Qatar's largest online platform for start-ups, investors, incubators, accelerators, mentors, and other ecosystem enablers. The objective is to create possibilities for collaboration and partnerships between different entities.</p><p><strong>What is a profile of company that 360 Nautica looks for when investing?</strong></p><p>There are two focus areas that we are trying to explore and expand on. First, 360 Nautica has always aimed to be a diverse conglomerate of businesses since we established in Doha 15 years ago and always try to fill the gaps in the market. Now, the trend is digital services, which is where we are focusing our efforts. The constant has always been having to innovate in order to revolutionize the way of doing business. Second, we meet start-ups that have B2C business models with an innovative digital component, and we do it with an open mind. One of the other main aspects we look for when we make investments in startups is the founders' vision and the passion to learn. Flexibility to learn and coached is an important pre-requisite for a successful model.</p><p><strong>What does Qatar offer start-ups that so many decide to establish in or relocate to the country?</strong></p><p>Qatar is a great incubator and accelerator for any type of project. The country is geographically small; however, it is easy to control growth and scalability. Plus, marketing expenses tend to be under control due to the market size. Despite the size, the population mix is great, so there is a great diversity of demographic segments. When you launch a product in Qatar, you have made it global in a way, so it is much easier to export from inside the country than from anywhere else. The incentives the government is introducing through free zones and other methods definitely add value to the process and encouraging new businesses to start.</p><p><strong>What benefits will you have from being a pioneer when the private start-up incubation market evolves?</strong></p><p>We will definitely leverage our advantage. A person who has just entered with an idea and has established a start-up is most likely a new businessman who needs much more than a financial investor. 360 Nautica already understands this necessity, and that understanding will make us market leaders in time to come. We know the difference between a regular investment and a venture building program, so we can provide start-ups with the right mentorship, coaching, and training to operate and succeed in the Qatari market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has QSTP evolved over the last decade?</strong></p><p>Since opening its doors in 2010, QSTP has become an international hub for applied research, technology innovation, incubation, and entrepreneurship. Over the last 10 years, QSTP had over a hundred companies from 17 countries operate in its Business Park and Free Zone, including multinationals such as ConocoPhillips, Cisco, and Siemens. As Qatar's hub for tech-based innovation, product development, and entrepreneurship and Free Zone, QSTP offers high-tech facilities and supports a network of startups and rising tech ventures through a value chain of acceleration, incubation, and funding programs. So far, 20 local companies have been incubated in QSTP, producing impactful innovations, such as Meddy, the largest doctor booking platform in Qatar, with over 200,000 monthly users. Stellic, a degree planning, advising, and auditing platform which has signed agreements with CMU and Tufts University in the US, is also a product of our Incubation Center, as well as the award-winning braille entertainment device, Bonocle.</p><p><strong>What is the uniqueness of QSTP compared to other entities seeking to attract the same type of companies, and what is your level of cooperation with them?</strong></p><p>Qatar is a viable market for a vast range of industries, offering different business platforms and free zones to local and international companies.  While all these platforms boast of world-class facilities, there are programs and services unique to QSTP, such as facilitating the development of new high-tech products and services, supporting the commercialization of market-ready technologies and easy incorporation. These qualities are highly suitable to science and technology-oriented companies, which we want to attract. QSTP's location also gives us an advantage over other platforms. Being in the middle of Qatar Foundations' ecosystem, our clients/tenants can benefit from their proximity to Qatar's academic and research institutions. Moreover, we advise newcomers on where their business can benefit the most in this ecosystem. Our agreement with the Free Zone Authority allows entities in their platform to open a research or product development center with us and vice versa. This enables us to share our strengths with other players in the ecosystem, and vice versa, while giving our clients the flexibility to access other facilities in Qatar. It also works the other way around.</p>]]></richbody0content>

What business will become more relevant as the 2030 Qatar National Vision approaches?</strong></p><p><span></span>MOUTAZ AL-KHAYYAT Vision 2030 encapsulates the spirit of PIH's businesses across dairy and agriculture, construction and real estate, and F&amp;B sectors. One of the strategic pillars of Qatar's National Vision is human development, in particular, to develop a world-class healthcare system in Qatar. Like many businesses, PIH is always open to new opportunities. One of our subsidiaries, Elegancia Healthcare, recently signed an agreement with Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles for our first general hospital: The View Hospital. It will be a luxurious 250-bed facility and is expected to be completed in August 2022.</p><p><strong><span></span>What digital and innovative strategies have you adopted to maintain business as usual during COVID-19?</strong></p><p><span></span>Ramez Al-Khayyat As an innovative business, we have been investing in digital transformation. For example, we created a comprehensive ecosystem of digital shopping experience for the Mall of Qatar, including a customer data platform that allows engagement with customers, a generous loyalty program encouraging frequent visits, and an innovative e-commerce platform to complement the experience. AURA Hospitality rapidly adapted to the challenges posed by the pandemic by embracing digital solutions both online and across its venues. For example, scannable QR codes have replaced physical menus and enhanced booking systems keeping diners at safe social distances. Amid the pandemic, the group has also introduced Wajbati, the one-stop shop for shoppers, combining food delivery, ingredients delivery, and a food subscription service. We are working with the top players in digital transformation, such as SAP, to futureproof our business frameworks and processes. We are proud of our roots in Qatar and primarily operate in the local market. However, the lessons we have learnt here have global applications. </p><p><strong><span></span>What are the keys to resilience of Qatar's economy and its companies?</strong></p><p><span></span>MAK Qatar has weathered disruption before, not least the 2017 blockades. The ability of the nation to come together and succeed in the face of that crisis, through swift action by government and private sector ingenuity, has stood us in good stead for dealing with the pandemic. This positive culture of self-reliance and innovation is embedded throughout our country and has given us the tools to successfully navigate the unprecedented global pandemic this year. Baladna Food Industries has become a symbol of Qatar's resilience. In the wake of the June 2017 embargo, Baladna, with state support, expanded rapidly into producing cow's milk, a crucial commodity that had previously been largely imported. We purchased thousands of cows and began milking them at a farm in Umm al Hawaya. Today, Baladna Farm spreads over an area of 2.4 million sqm, with a capacity to house 24,000 cows. We now supply eight in every 10 glasses of Qatar's milk and have expanded into new product lines, such as juices. We are exporting to Oman, Afghanistan, and Yemen and have signed a memorandum of understanding with FELCRA Berhad, the Malaysian agricultural conglomerate, to establish a farm and factory, helping the country to also achieve self-sufficiency in fresh milk. </p><p><strong><span></span>How does PIH assess the government's efforts to industrialize the country in terms of the diversification of your portfolio?</strong></p><p><span></span>RAK Private businesses like Power International Holding have a big role to play in achieving Qatar's national vision. We are proud to have already been behind key construction and infrastructure projects throughout the country. In July 2020, our company UCC Holding was proud to be the golden sponsor of Qatar's first public private partnership conference. The implementation of this law will open great opportunities for the private sector to participate in development and the revival of Qatar in all fields. This will further diversify the economy and help to attract further foreign investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was UCQ doing before COVID-19 hit, and how have you been preparing for the resumption of educational activities?</h4><p>UCQ was advancing plans for growth in our current programs as well as for new programs. We were planning a master's degree revision and aimed to increase our student numbers by reaching over 800 students by 2023. Like other institutions in Qatar, COVID-19 has impacted our budget and programs, however I am pleased to say we surpassed our revised enrolment target by 6%. We are extremely excited about our new four-year regular track program and continue to educate and support our current post-diploma baccalaureate and masters in nursing students. We have been incredibly resilient in moving to online delivery, assuring the faculty were prepared using the best practices for online teaching and learning. The restrictions associated with COVID varied depending on the course. For example, clinical courses couldn't be conducted at designated timeframes. Our partners have been key in accommodating changes and supporting student progression. The use of virtual simulations has also been an excellent learning addition. Lastly, to assure students were ready for January 2021 clinical, we focused on concentrated skill development to prepare them. To do this, we used our spaces appropriately with the help of masks, gowns, and physical distancing. COVID-19 has not only resulted in looking at teaching and learning, but also in applying best practices in our facility and assuring alignment with Ministry guidelines. Today, every student attending laboratories, or undergoing practical upskilling experiences, is being taught in an environment that fully meets COVID-19 restrictions. While challenging, COVID-19 has resulted in innovation in course development and delivery. It has resulted in innovative theory and clinical experiences to support the State of Qatar COVID-19 activities such as vaccination and triaging. Our partners have helped ensure we are not paralyzed by the crisis. We are learning and accommodating together. For example, faculty have volunteered with the Ministry of Public Health and Primary Health Care Corporation to assist in their efforts to fight COVID-19. We hope the current spotlight on nursing continues. Over this past year, I had the opportunity to meet with employees to explore the teaching and operational challenges they faced, what they saw as important for growth, and to learn more about their innovative practices. For UCQ, blended approaches of teaching and learning is the way forward. This, coupled with innovation, evidence and commitment, is a recipe for excellence in nursing education.</p><h4>How can you prepare your new graduates to react to and manage this kind of crisis?</h4><p>Preparing for crisis requires an understanding of how crisis impacts people's lives, social educational and health care systems. Crisis is about adaptation, understanding change, learning and collective efforts to reach common goals. It is about assisting students to think critically about the crisis and consider: who is impacted by the crisis, what structures and processes require alteration, what might be unintended consequences and what are the outcomes we want to measure, in order to better understand our success and areas of improvement.</p><h4>What skills can be taught through virtual simulations and laboratories, and will you go back to more traditional learning practices post-COVID-19?</h4><p>There is a digital platform that the students sign into, and this enables a great deal of skill assessments and critical thinking. For example, students are taken through a scenario for a patient with heart failure. This virtual simulation platform has worked out well, and the students have enjoyed using it. Future learning post-COVID-19 will be a combination of traditional teaching and new digital tools. Going forward, I see a blend of learning techniques; that is the way of the future. We cannot forget the importance of social interactions for students, as these teaching methods are complementary.</p><h4>How do you see the rise of the private healthcare sector in Qatar impacting the future of UCQ's graduates?</h4><p>Reaching out to private healthcare is an opportunity. We have to work closely with the sector, as we do with our partners at SIDRA, Primary Health Care Corporation and Hamad Medical Corporation. We look forward to further collaborations with these entities so that we can understand where they are going and what skill sets their current and future employees need. This also includes looking at what their people will need for their continuing professional development (CPD). It is also about us having students in those organizations and ensuring there are individuals in the organization who can support our students.</p><h4>Qatar has been named one of the world's top five healthcare systems. What role does nursing, which is sometimes an overlooked profession, play in this achievement?</h4><p>Nurses are on the frontline—they are at the coalface for patients, families, and communities. Nursing is about promoting wellness through transitions of acute illness and supporting management and self-management for patients and families with chronic conditions. Nurses are also key in influencing policy and system transformation to support excellent integrated care. We have a world-class education system to make sure these students are competent and can meet the demands of care. During COVID-19, nurses are being called heroes. They have entered unusual conditions where they are giving everything in terms of long hours being on the frontline and supporting families who are struggling with their loved ones being unwell. It has put a spotlight on the importance of nursing. There has been a great deal of learning around COVID-19 as a disease and its economic and societal impact. Nurses are heroes, but they also work in partnership with all the allied healthcare professionals. COVID-19 has spotlighted all healthcare workers and their dedication, and it takes a team. That is the contribution of nursing to the excellence of Qatar's healthcare system.</p><h4>What are UCQ's immediate strategic priorities?</h4><p>Given that UCQ has a brand-new curriculum, our immediate priority is its full implementation. It is an exciting, progressive, evidence-based concept and competency-based curriculum that has enhanced clinical opportunities, that addresses population health needs and that continues to be positioned within the local context. A second priority is to continue with UCQ's Continuing Professional Development (CPD) program. To add to our vaccination program, we have a new inter-professional program where we are training pharmacists, physicians, and nurses to work in teams around vaccinations. We just received a three-year accreditation for that program and are extremely excited about it. We also have an Emerging Teaching Certificate, which is about building capacity for teaching both in our faculty and also in the community with nurse educators. An important priority for UCQ is building capacity in the State of Qatar with people who will stay in the country. Moving forward, we are also examining new education delivery modes, including revenue generating, shared-cost, reinvestment options, and stackable certificates that lead to degrees for professionals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<intervieweelist0description><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu became the 15th Governor of Lagos State following his victory at the 2019 gubernatorial elections.  The governor's political career started in 2003, when he was appointed Special Adviser on Corporate Matters to the then Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Femi Pedro; and later as Special Adviser on Corporate Matters to the Governor, His Excellency, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. For his outstanding performance, Mr. Sanwo-Olu was appointed Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget. In 2007, he became the Commissioner for Commerce and Industry under Governor Tinubu. After the General Elections in 2007, Mr. Sanwo-Olu was appointed Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions by Governor Babatunde Fashola, SAN. His meritorious service to Lagos State continued when Governor Akinwumi Ambode appointed him as the Managing Director/CEO of the Lagos State Development Property Corporation (LSDPC) in 2016, and was later fielded as the All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial candidate for the 2019 elections. He is an alumnus of the prestigious Harvard Kennedy School of Government, London Business School and the Lagos Business School.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were your administration's main achievements during its first two years in office?</h4><p>What has guided our executions and driven our achievements is our development agenda, which we named THEMES Agenda. THEMES is an acronym for: traffic management and transportation, health and environment, education and technology, making Lagos a 21st century economy, entertainment and tourism, and security and governance. On the traffic management and transportation side, we have built a robust public transportation system and introduced high-capacity buses into the system, and we are about to introduce additional 100 high-capacity buses. We are also launching 500 First and Last Mile (FLM) buses, with the goal of making the number of buses hit 5000 in a year, or so. This will be complemented by an additional 1000 taxis in our LagosRide Scheme. We are also building four bus terminal stations. In the future, we plan to introduce green buses. For waterways, we are working with the private sector to build 15 jetties, six or seven of which to be commissioned by the end of 2021. A journey that would normally take up to 1.5 hours by road can take 40 minutes by waterways. With regards to rail infrastructure, we have invested more in the last two years than previous administrations did in the last six. We are hoping to complete the blue and red line by the end of 2022. We just started Phase I of the blue line, which is 27km. We built six stations, and there are two remaining. The red line covers the federal government corridor from Lagos to Ibadan and Kano. We also want to improve signaling, and are installing traffic lights and line marking to provide citizens with a better experience on roads. On health and environment, Lagos has remained the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. We have received support from the private sector, built capacity in our health workers, built isolation centers and developed our health facilities. COVID-19 has helped us boost our health infrastructure rapidly. We are building a mental wellness and rehabilitation facility with a capacity for 500 patients as well as a radiology and orthopedic center. We also plan to build the first Africa's Institute for Infectious Diseases and Research Center. We are pushing the health insurance scheme so that health can be accessible and affordable. In the last two years, a world-class center for cancer treatment and an infectious diseases specialist hospital were built in Lagos in collaboration with the private sector. We will also continue to ensure that Lagos remains clean, with beautification projects and local interventions. We are working with the private sector to make sure that it is an ongoing process. We have cleaned up three landfill sites, and they are being completely modernized. We are also building one or two additional landfill sites. We are also building significant drainage infrastructure on our roads. As for education and technology, in the past two years, we built over 500 new classrooms, recruited 3,000 new teachers, and made sure our children have better learning outcomes. Our philosophy is 'leave no child behind'. We distributed abut 80,000 handheld devices. Technology is a key component for us, and we are deploying 3,600km of fiber optic in Lagos that will connect fiber to our schools, hospitals, and public buildings, which means access to internet will be significantly cheaper. Eventually, it will get to homes and increase the speed of the internet. We want Lagos to be the technology hub of Africa. Making Lagos a 21st Century Economy to us means making housing as affordable as possible, as well as expanding our energy supply. On energy, we are doing direct intervention with the federal government because it is still a nationally controlled industry, though we are trying to get off-grid generation. We are doing 1,200 streetlights with high LED, so our streets are brighter. In entertainment and tourism, we have worked to create a tourism fund and started the Lagos Creative Academy to train Scriptwriters, Actresses, Actors, Newscasters and Producers. The Academy is conducting thousands of online training programmes with trainers from all over the world, all of which, are funded by our government, though we are using the private sector to run it. We constituted a committee to assess the needs movie producers and directors for support so they can produce many more movies. Many people have great stories to tell, but do not have sponsors. We are also working with the Lagos Employment Trust Fund to support entrepreneurs with different skills, for example providing grants to people developing software.</p><h4>What is the state government doing in the areas of agriculture and security?</h4><p>We have set a five-year master plan for agriculture and want to enable the sector. We are building the biggest rice mill in the country, and we want to have interventions in the red meat value chain, which is a massive industry. We want to add value to the sector. We also want to support the fishing industry and explore urban farming. We cannot do all these without a secure and safe environment, so we have continued to support the Nigerian police and the entire security architecture in the state. We want to demonstrate transparency and accountability, and show that we are a responsible government.</p><h4>What is your message to the international investor community?</h4><p>No one will help develop the nation if one does not start; investors need to feel it is a safe place to be. We have attracted more investments in the last two years than in the last five years. The Dangote refinery is the single-biggest construction site project in the world right now, and it is a USD16-billion investment in the eastern part of Lagos. We are building the largest port in West Africa, Lekki Port, a deep seaport that can handle four times the size of vessels compared to the current size allowed at the Apapa ports . We are also ensuring there is a secure and safe environment, with increased commitment to the Ease of Doing Business. Not having clear regulatory frameworks can slow down investments. We have an active court of arbitration, and we are digitalizing our records so that people can have access to titles and contract approvals easily. We are making sure that people can travel from one part of the state to another freely, easily, and safely. Lagos airport receives 60-65% of international travels in the country. We are also building the JK Randle museum in partnership with the British museum.</p><h4>Which sectors present the largest opportunities for investors?</h4><p>We see growth in technology, which is why we are building the metropolitan fiber optic network. We see great potential in the financial industry as well, and we expect the sector to grow further. Real estate in Lagos is always a sector where one can participate in. Because of the population, goods that are consumer driven will always do well in an environment such as ours. People need food, clothes, and need to move around. It is also an educated market; the level of literacy is far higher than other parts of West Africa.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>INVIAS' recent combined projects of infrastructure development in Colombia are the country's most ambitious to date. What is the goal behind of this initiative?</h4><p>President Iván Duque wants to frame the economic reactivation of the country around projects that are employment intensive, spread opportunities across regions, and leave a long-lasting mark of infrastructure improvement. These projects make up Compromiso por Colombia, the most ambitious public infrastructure program ever carried out in the country. It will generate 105,000 direct jobs, benefit 24 million Colombians and with which there will be 1,660 new kilometers of roads. It is a medium and long-term commitment to increase competitive productive areas in the country. Among its objectives is to guarantee the connection with remote regions, which is why it includes roads in Arauca, Guajira, Caquetá, Cauca and Putumayo.    <br>INVIAS is focused on the development of infrastructure projects that improve transportation of materials, food and economic opportunities, and the increase in connectivity helps to guarantee regional growth. INVIAS has designed the projects, but resources to guarantee execution were lacking. Today, thanks to Compromiso por Colombia, COP11.5 trillion (about USD3.125 million) have been allocated for the construction and completion of highways. In some cases, the highways connect capital cities, but have low volume of traffic, which means that they do not generate enough income to build them through PPPs, so they need public funds. Compromiso por Colombia is divided into two lines. The first one is called Concluir y Concluir para la Reactivación de las Regiones and seeks to conclude infrastructure projects that began 15 years ago or more and have not been completed. There are 28 projects (of which INVIAS has already awarded and started 27) that will need around COP2.3 trillion (about USD629 millions) to finish those roads that connect remote places. For example, in the department of Choco, there were no roads connecting it to Antioquia or Risaralda, and now there are. We are also completing the road that connects Putumayo to the border with Ecuador and a road that connects Bogotá with Cúcuta, on the border with Venezuela. This infrastructure investment package seeks to improve access links with neighboring countries. The second line is Ví­as para la Legalidad y la Reactivación de las Regiones Visión 2030, comprising 22 more infrastructure projects with which we expect to transform the country's mobility in the next 5 to 10 years. Of these 22 projects, we have already awarded 19. We are also completing a binational corridor between Ecuador and Colombia. Simultaneously, we are working on rural roads with investments of around COP3.7 trillion (about USD1,013 million) so that educational and health services reach remote places and the countryside of Colombia is more productive. This is the Colombia Rural program, which aims to maintain and improve tertiary roads. The country has 142,000 km of tertiary roads and our goal is to improve 8,000 km of these tertiary roads and maintain 15,000 km.   <br>We want the country to be more competitive. All the roads built by INVIAS have social cost effectiveness, rather than economic cost effectiveness. We become a social entity for infrastructure. Colombia Fluvial, for example, is a program focused in the Pacific, Orinoquia, and Amazon regions. Through this program we have quintupled investments in infrastructure works in municipalities where the only access is through rivers or air. Among these works, contracts for the construction of 13 docks have been awarded. These works, which have a total investment of COP26,200 million (about USD7.2 million), benefit about 46,585 inhabitants of departments such as Chocó, Amazonas, Putumayo, Meta, Vichada, Guaviare, Vaupés, Guainí­a and Caquetá.   </p><h4>These projects have been extremely efficient in terms of awarding. Why has the process been so efficient, and why is it there so much interest from the market?</h4><p>We started the strategy to gather funds to increase the possibility of public investment. We had advanced on designs and licenses, and we have always been known for legality and transparency in the awarding processes. As a result, there is trust in the market in our projects. We need to do a sustainable social transformation to have stable finances and guarantee these projects can be carried out. There are regions that are highly productive, but because they do not have connection or access, they generate illegal products, or there is no agricultural development. We are building a road in Guaviare, and while we were building it all the illicit crops started disappearing. Now, there is avocado, cocoa, blackberries, and coffee. This is all under the leadership of Transport Minister Ángela Marí­a Orozco, who is an excellent manager, which helps to improve confidence from the private sector. She brings credibility to the sector, which has been a priority for this government. The leadership of Vice President Marta Lucí­a Ramí­rez has also been outstanding; she is a champion of infrastructure.</p><h4>INVIAS aims to be recognized by 2030 in the region for its leadership and excellence in planning, execution, and operation of infrastructure. What steps are you taking toward this goal?</h4><p>INVIAS is making sure people are well-connected in a safe, timely, and efficient way. We have three large goals to achieve this vision in the long term. We have to continue with the efficient management of the projects discussed previously. We are also going through an administrative transformation, through institutional redesign, being transparent in hiring practices, and a digital transformation. The third key element is technical strengthening based on innovation, risk management and sustainability. We are the leaders in the infrastructure industry, so if we innovate, the regional offices also become renovated, and we develop new technologies that they can use. The country is finally thinking of intelligent systems for roads such as radars and sensors on national roads. We will start selling securities for INVIAS future projects so people can buy them and participate in the process. Those three elements lead us to modernize infrastructure so people can travel around the country better. In this government, we are delivering the projects that were never delivered before. Puente Pumarejo and Túnel de La Lí­nea projects are examples that public entities such as INVIAS can carry out large projects. In the second semester of 2021, we will deliver Cruce de la Cordillera Central, the most important infrastructure project in the history of the country. Colombia is a leader in tunnels: we have the longest tunnel, the widest tunnel, and the tunnel at the highest altitude. The five longest tunnels on the continent are in Colombia, and we have over 100 tunnels. We do knowledge exchanges with other countries of what we have learned in projects like Túnel de La Lí­nea, which had a multiplier effect on the building of tunnels in the country. Colombian companies that build tunnels are extremely competitive on the global market, because our geography is daunting. Chile is looking to cross the Andes Mountains to Argentina, and it came to study the Túnel de La Lí­nea project for that purpose.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has STI Norland evolved since mid-2019?</h4><p>There have been many changes and we have grown significantly. In 2019, we achieved the goal we had set for ourselves, which was to reach EUR100 million in revenue. In 2020, we exceeded our goal of growing by 25%, experiencing 200% growth compared to 2019 even during the pandemic. In early 2020, the pandemic had already started to affect us since we purchase many goods from China. Later, we were affected in India because there was a sudden lockdown there as well. We have a supplier in India that suddenly could not ship goods overseas. Subsequently, the lockdown in Spain followed. The reality is that our projects have not stopped despite the challenges. Commercial activity, fortunately, was ongoing, and in the first months of the pandemic we saw a great deal of activity.</p><h4>In February 2020, Aurica Capital acquired a 41.5% stake in STI Norland. What does mean for the company?</h4><p>We incorporated shareholders and venture capital investors, which demonstrates the attractiveness of this sector for investors. From my point of view, this is extremely interesting because we are seeking a partner for the growth that we will continue to experience. On top of that, Aurica is connected to Banco Sabadell. We saw some synergies because renewable energy projects are capital intensive, and most of them are financed. That took place in February, and the relationship has been excellent.</p><h4>What are the latest innovations from STI Norland in terms of new products or others in the pipeline?</h4><p>The main update is that for a year and a half now we have been working on a project to develop a program regarding the dynamic calculation of the tracker. This is something that is highly sought after in the market. It is a system that calculates the structures in a dynamic way and takes into account external factors such as wind. In addition, we have developed a control system and installed it, and we will start manufacturing it in Spain to sell it everywhere. We could sell this product to every country.</p><h4>The sector is attractive, but is also fairly competitive. What differentiates the company from its competitors?</h4><p>The main difference is our experience. We are the pioneering company in developing trackers in the world. We have developed an array of trackers, and these designs are for different products and are all our own. We certainly have extensive experience and capacity to develop products and are leaders in product development. We have been working with some of our clients for 18 years. There is no company in the sector that has been working with the same clients for such a long time. Furthermore, I want to stress the robustness of our products and our impeccable service, since we do everything for the clients. We work to provide the best service possible.</p><h4>The company turns 25 years in 2021. In 2020, despite the pandemic, you entered into the Australian market. What was the process like, and are you planning to enter other markets?</h4><p>We planned to start in early 2020 but postponed those plans because of the situation. It has been difficult to enter Australia due to the different lockdown measures. There are certain travel restrictions, so we started in 4Q2020 with a goal to develop between 100 and 150MW in 2021 and obtain more than EUR8 million in revenue. As for other markets, we have a roadmap, which is our growth plan. In addition to Australia, we want to enter other markets where we plan to replicate the model that we implemented in Brazil, where we are market leaders. We have a team of about 150 workers in Brazil, where we also manufacture.</p><h4>What criteria do you implement when deciding which countries to enter?</h4><p>We have evaluated the growth potential for the sector in many countries and identified that those with the greatest prospects for growth are in the photovoltaic market. One of them is China, which is number one, followed by the US and India, respectively. In these markets, however, not everything that gets installed is through trackers. We do trackers and fixed structures. Sometimes, these are installed on roofs, for example. We, therefore, evaluated where more photovoltaic development will take place and where more trackers will be installed. We evaluated both factors and came up with that shortlist.</p><h4>In terms of innovation, you invest more than 2% of your annual revenue in R&amp;D. How important is innovation for STI Norland?</h4><p>Innovation is one of the pillars of STI Norland, and as a result of this, we have developed many products. There are technologies that did not succeed, though others did. We are heavily focused on R&amp;D for trackers, and innovation differentiates us from our competitors. The photovoltaic industry evolves rapidly, as there are many new innovations constantly coming to the market. In that regard, we must be ready to constantly adapt to new environments.</p><h4>In terms of regulations, what main challenges is the sector facing?</h4><p>It is important to have a scenario for this sector. In 2018, 3GW of photovoltaic were developed in Spain, while in 2019 zero were developed. Investors in photovoltaic energy require stable regulations. It is important to provide certainty in the market so that investors know what they will face and can plan ahead. There has been a huge bubble in renewable energy, and that should be cooled off.</p><h4>What is your main goal for 2021?</h4><p>The main goal is to continue with our growth strategy. Early 2021 has been heavily influenced by the effects of 2020. Right now, there are many factors that are not under our control. Steel prices are dramatically increasing, and there is a lack of supply. In fact, we cannot carry out some projects in certain countries because there is a lack of steel. Also, some of the vessels leaving China are four times more expensive than before. The situation is extremely tough. It is difficult to obtain projects, and the current environment is challenging to work in under normal conditions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Canal de Isabel II is a public company for the citizens of Madrid. What is its mission and vision?</h4><p>The company's main mission is to guarantee an uncompromised water supply at all times. Our long-term vision is to develop sustainable policies, thereby making Canal de Isabel II a first-class environmental tool. We work with the complete water cycle. Beyond water treatment and its distribution, following its consumption, we regenerate it for reuse. In many cases, water is returned to rivers in order to improve their watercourse.</p><h4>How has the pandemic affected Canal de Isabel II, and what is your assessment of 2020's results?</h4><p>2020 was certainly a unique year, shaped by the pandemic. The turnover of Canal de Isabel II exceeds EUR850 million, whilst this year pre-tax turnover exceeds EUR300 million. We have sought to combine the investments made in the canal with voluntary social assistance for those suffering the consequences of the pandemic. We have dedicated over EUR8 million for people on furlough, those on provisional downsizing plans, businesses and industries that were forced to close down, hotels used as hospitals made available to citizens, and so on, where extraordinary assistance was established more than those they would otherwise have received.</p><h4>One of the main projects in 2020 is “El Proyecto Vigí­a“ (The Watcher Project). What does it consist of, and what are its objectives?</h4><p>The <em>Vigí­a</em> system represents a significant investment in order to detect the presence of COVID-19 in wastewater. At the end of March, we dedicated many hours to collecting large amounts of information on an experiment being developed in the Netherlands. Initially, we deployed a system with experts and technicians from the canal, supported by the innovative management of Canal de Isabel II. The tools available at that time could only identify if the virus was present or not. It was a binary yes-or-no analysis, and it was not possible to run any sort of quantity analysis. Subsequently, different tools and methodologies were launched in the market that allowed us to view the virus load. We decided to run a trial experiment in Torrejón de Ardoz, which allowed us to establish the methodology for selecting the sampling points, so that they were representative of the entire population. In June 2020, we identified the now 289 sampling points that are currently active. Wastewater is collected from 100% of the population of the Community of Madrid, and, as a result, we are able to monitor the evolution of the virus across 100% of the population. Since it has been operational, we have carried out such monitoring 48 times. This has allowed us to get ahead of the virus, detect the arrival of the second and third waves, and observe its evolution by town and district. All citizens now have access to an interactive map that allows them to check this evolution in wastewater by street, town, or district. Therefore, it is possible to have a perspective of the situation through the wastewater analyses from our own homes or workplaces with weekly reports. This was presented to the EU, the management of 50 European companies, and the UN General Assembly in March 2021. That same month, the European Commission released a communication to all EU member states requesting they incorporate a wastewater monitoring system, like Vigí­a, by October 2021. We are 10 months ahead of the EU's request. We are pleased to have dedicated so much work and such great human resources. We invested EUR5.2 million between 2020 and 2021, and we have engaged a genomic laboratory specialized in waterways to detect the presence of COVID-19 and other types of viruses.</p><h4>What are the canal's strategic plans?</h4><p>We are running a total of 32 R&amp;D&amp;I projects. These are projects of different kinds: some are closely linked to new technologies and communication; others will allow us to improve water quality control or offer citizens transparent knowledge of water consumption in their homes. There are many other projects involving investments in infrastructures. These strategic plans and investments cover the entire lifecycle of water, from the work carried out at the reservoirs, through remote control, to the water when it reaches our homes. People will have total knowledge of their consumption, such as the times at which it is highest and lowest, and—when they are not at home—they will know if there is a possible leak and we will be notified of unusual water consumption. Beyond this, we maintain the work on our environmental policies for water regeneration.</p><h4>How is your strategy to reduce debt?</h4><p>Our strategy is to follow the efficient management of resources and their proper investment and use. We also focus on what creates value for the company. Innovation projects, despite the significant investment they require, reduce the cost of certain processes over time. We are creating a more efficient and citizen-oriented Canal de Isabel II every year, and we are increasing responsibility regarding water consumption.</p><h4>What are the main goals of Canal de Isabel II?</h4><p>We are working on three key projects. The first is to open the first green hydrogen plant in Spain that will use photovoltaic energy and regenerated water. The second is the remote meters project to be installed in all homes and industries in order to allow us to monitor water consumption in real time. Right now, meter reading takes place once every two months. Once these are installed, the population will have immediate knowledge of their own consumption and will be able to check it whenever they want via an app. The third and final project is a solar plan that involves 12 photovoltaic solar plants for the canal's self-consumption.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which sector do you consider the most dynamic considering the impact of the pandemic?</h4><p>As a result of the pandemic, some sectors have been more active than others and have performed better as a result. For instance, the construction and home renovation sectors is doing particularly well given the long periods of time being spent at home. The food sector has also grown, specifically supermarkets and food delivery. The metal-mechanic industry also performed well this year. On the whole, every traditional exportation sector has recovered and is growing even more than before the pandemic. 2021 will be a good year, given the fact that the US will need to update its equipment and infrastructure. This will positively impact several sectors in Mexico.</p><h4>How have you adapted your modus operandi to launch external trade?</h4><p>In order to get all these products to other countries, logistics and keeping competitive across all routes are essential. This includes all means of transportation (by land, train, sea, or air) and its costs, because if you do not calculate your logistics costs well, when you reach the market you might end up with a much higher final price than anticipated. For example, China has become more expensive lately and that has affected some companies, forcing them to turn to Mexico and other countries to become more competitive. In the last year, interest in exports and commercial relationships with Asia has grown. There are more Asia-based companies that want to install operations here in order to export to the US. Furthermore, now there are many companies that are not only looking to export from China but to China.</p><h4>How has your plan for diversification been developed?</h4><p>It has been difficult because there were doubts as to whether NAFTA would be renewed. This caused concern, and we decided not to rely solely on the US. It was then when we realized that we had to diversify our markets. However, we were unable to diversify as we had envisaged, and USMCA was later signed and now, pretty much of our business continues to come from the US. We feel safe in the knowledge that we will continue to have work coming in from the US, although this also means that we might forget to diversify. We have developed a diversification plan with Central and South America, though the reality is that 80% of Mexican exports go to US. In other words, the US market has so much potential that it is difficult to diversify. Only medium-sized and large corporations that already have a strong presence in the US dare to break into other markets.</p><h4>How are you helping fill in the void caused by the closure of ProMexico?</h4><p>ProMexico should not have been closed down. Perhaps some procedures needed to be restructured, but the image and positioning that Mexico had achieved was too important to leave vacant. We have been trying to fill the void and support companies. We are a non-profit private initiative, and our mission is to help and promote Mexican Foreign Trade not only within our membership, but also with any company or person who approaches us for assistance. With COVID-19, we had to carry out all our courses, seminars, and services, such as diagnosis and consulting via online. This was not easy because we had barely digitalized and did not have anything on Zoom or any other platform; everything we did was face-to-face. First, we started offering free webinars and later introduced longer and more complete paid courses. This went well because we had both local participants and participants from across the country. We went from having an average of 30 participants to 80.</p><h4>What are the main objectives behind your new office in Laredo?</h4><p>We did it because we have several partners in Laredo, Teas. We were able to open the office through one of our Board Members who lives there and due to an agreement we signed five years ago with the city of Laredo. The city of Laredo is interested in collaborating with us so that goods will pass customs through Laredo, generating income from taxes and job positions. Our interest is for our member companies to have an agile route, we signed an agreement to work out how to make the crossing of goods more efficient in terms of security along the logistics chain. The other issue was checking the infrastructure of highways, customs, and inspection points so that everything works as efficient as possible. More than 14,000 trailers cross Laredo daily. Laredo College also offered us a space in which to open an office and work in support of Mexican companies to help them with their paperwork, permits, and information on US markets.</p><h4>Why is it important to incentivize more foreign trade activity in Mexico?</h4><p>Foreign trade activity is fundamental for the economic development of our regions and our country as a whole. This has been the case since the signing of NAFTA. The growth of foreign trade, which has been steady, has  led to significant growth in terms of Mexico's GDP. In fact, currently about 72% of GDP is made up of foreign trade (exports and imports). Therefore, as long as we have more companies participating in international markets, this generates more international trade, which in turn boosts GDP. The more GDP Mexico generates, the better we can develop our regions, states, and cities. All these will generate a sense of economic well-being for the people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Club de Industriales play within the economy?</h4><p>The Club de Industriales was founded 65 years ago and has currently 1,580 members. Almost 80% of its associates have personal ties with the United States and other countries and regularly hosts meetings, working breakfasts and lunches, as well as private events, corporate gatherings, etc.  Among its prominent international members, the Club is proud to be headquarters of Mexico's major Chambers of Commerce and, although its main activities take place in Mexico City, it accepts members from all over Mexico, Europe, and the US. We have recently closed a deal with the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, of which I am the founding vice president. This international scope implies a great responsibility for us across all aspects, especially in terms of health and safety. Nowadays , events are ready to be held,  a welcome return to business activities.</p><h4>What is the country's economic outlook with respect to the public and private sector initiatives undertaken to boost recovery?</h4><p>There are no public sector initiatives likely to boost investment and growth, except in a localized fashion and thanks to ill begotten projects like the Tren Maya and the Dos Bocas Refinery. Thanks to the USMCA, we will have an overall strong recovery of around 5% annual growth, even though the government has all but stopped public investment and frightened foreign investment. That is, although domestic consumption has lagged,  we remain strong exporters to the US and Canada. Next year, growth is anticipated to be around 2 to 2.5% with services beginning to recover as well as manufacturing and agricultural exports. Mexico sets a global example in effort, diversification, and quality. We often do not realize the impact of Mexico's fruits and vegetable exports on the world. However, in terms of the environment, we have not made the effort needed to conserve green areas and protect water in Mexico. Unfortunately, in terms of education, a wrong policy was chosen, which will set us back a long way in terms of the development and growth of higher education in Mexico. The private sector must strengthen its investment and participation in education. We need universities in the southeast of Mexico. We would like to have two or three universities across Chiapas and Oaxaca so that we may have the opportunity to train poor Mexicans in high quality jobs.</p><h4>What are some of the biggest projects that the club is taking on this year?</h4><p>Like most institutions, the Club has had to limit its activities and it is only starting to organize events and host business lunches. Our members are slowly returning, and we expect to see a full recovery once the city government decrees a green flag and a return to a post pandemic normalcy.  The Club itself is not involved in business activities besides its culinary and social purposes. However, given our exposure in the business community, it has promoted and offers its support to a few philanthropic organizations, among which I would highlight the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the German Chamber of Commerce, Mares de México and the Mexican Gastronomic Academy.</p><h4>What trends has Club de Industriales seen in the investments being made by China in Mexico?</h4><p>The Club is actively promoting the establishment of the China-Mexico Chamber of Commerce expecting to provide Mexican investors market intelligence to take advantage of opportunities arising in China and vice-versa, it will also strive to facilitate Chinese interests in Mexico, given the recent trend in North America of sourcing a larger share of its trade within its geographical space.</p><h4>What is an area of opportunity for Mexico currently?</h4><p>Mexico´s consolidation as trade partner with the United States and Canada draws interest from foreign investors. We have a partnership with the Hong Kong ambassador in Mexico to offer our assistance and financing for the development of the southeast of Mexico. The National Fund for Tourism Development (FONATUR) currently does not have the representation, budget, or workforce needed to develop the southeast. To develop one-third of this country, another concept is needed. Instead of FONATUR, the National Commission for the Development of the Southeast should manage the process and then report to FONATUR. However, despite the underdevelopment of the southeast, it is the richest area of the country. The three great rivers originate there. The uranium mines, highly significant in Chihuahua and Oaxaca, are also found there. There is no communication between the private and public sectors. The private sector aims to bring in money and investment, but the public sector has closed the doors to it. The private sector is developing its own projects, such as Invest Monterrey, to replace ProMéxico.</p><h4>What other areas of development are there? How have developments in e-commerce and technology taken place?</h4><p>Again, due to the strong economic links with our partners in North America, Mexico has become a powerhouse in the automotive, aeronautical, and information technology sectors.  The Club is optimistic that, notwithstanding the governments inaction and enmity towards private ventures, the country will maintain its preeminence in those sectors and with a reversal in Congress, recover its trend towards opening the energy sector, confirm the educational reform and embark on further integration with its trade partners. The US will undoubtedly remain a global power due to its technological and innovative prowess, and Mexico is well positioned to take advantage of  its geographical location. Finally, it is important to recognize who were Mexico's most important leaders, for it is them that inspire our actions:</p><p>•     Eugenio Garza Sada, who brought in and shaped the steel, beer, glass, plastics, and urban development industries. He also did so for the polytechnic industry, approaching universities offering the best education to Mexican students. He also offered workers the first housing and healthcare guaranties in the history of Mexico. He founded the “Tecnológico de Monterrey“</p><p>•    Manuel Senderos who was a pioneer and developer of the automobile industry, insurance, banking, tourism, and also founder of one of the most important private universities in Mexico which is the “Universidad Iberoamericana“.</p><p>•    Raul Bailleres. From the very beginning of the mining development in the country, Mexico recognizes that in the latest century and up to now, Mr. Raul Bailleres and his sons took leadership in the exportation of silver and gold and at the same time they also started one of the most important universities in Mexico “Instituto  Tecnológico Autónomo de México — ITAM“</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What trends have you observed in terms of air traffic in the country at the moment?</h4><p>Our industry was one of the most affected globally by the pandemic, as most airports, airlines, and the tourism industry were hit extremely hard. We are starting to see a gradual recovery, though we are still far from our pre-pandemic figures. For example, the group used to manage around 48 million passengers in 2019, and in 2020 we ended with less than 28 million passengers. That recovery will likely take some years, perhaps until 2024. In general, there has been a huge impact on numbers, though we are also seeing a complete change in the trends of our passengers.</p><h4>Despite the pandemic, the group was able to grow in the last trimester. How was it able to achieve this?</h4><p>In 2020, we had to work heavily on costs and the digital transformation of the company. In airports, there are two main businesses: aeronautical and commercial revenues, which have changed completely. In the past, in the areas of food and beverage, people spent a few hours at the airport eating and drinking. Now, despite the slow return of passengers, their behaviors have dramatically changed; for instance, there are passengers that do not want to remove their masks, so they do not eat at the airports. Another trend that changed was e-commerce, which has opened the door for the use of apps. On the retail side, there has been a huge impact. In May, we will launch our mobile app, and through it you can order food and beverages and even retail products that will be delivered directly to the passenger gates. We are changing the layout of our different commercial areas to minimize crowded zones. We are trying to improve the customer experience, rather than just provide a big offering of products. The new reality of airports is that we need to compete more in terms of retail or food and beverage. We are in the middle of transforming our business. At the end of the day, a happy passenger is a larger consumption ticket for the airport. We want to transform our airports in the quickest way possible to adapt us to this new reality.</p><h4>What have been Grupo GAP's biggest achievements over the past year?</h4><p>One of the most important aspects was working with this new reality; as an airport operator, we needed to adapt all our biosecurity procedures to inspire confidence among our passengers. We worked with Tec de Monterrey to develop all the procedures for passengers. The Airport Council International, which is the association of airports, gave us a certification to our safety procedures. We were the first group of airports in the world to obtain that certification. Our airport in Los Cabos was the second in the world to obtain it, just after Istanbul. We are working hard to restore confidence in flying. We have worked with airlines and the tourism ministers of the different states we operate in. One of the biggest learnings from this pandemic is that everything can change dramatically from one day to the next one, and as a company you need to be extremely flexible. We know we have to carry out a digital transformation, not only for our passengers but also for the internal processes of the company. We have thermal cameras that measure temperature, do facial recognition, and assess the risk that passengers have.</p><h4>What are some of the main projects and investments that Grupo GAP will develop this year?</h4><p>We are starting the construction of the second runway at the Guadalajara airport. This is important because we currently only have two airports in Mexico that operate two runways: Mexico City and Cancún. Guadalajara will be the third airport with a second runway. We are also developing a huge building at the Tijuana airport. In Tijuana, we have the cross-border express, a unique bridge that connects Tijuana with California. We are developing a building that will be a game changer to capture additional markets. We are trying to attract the Asian, European and Latin American markets and make Tijuana an important hub in the area. We also seek to be an secondary airport for San Diego. We have many different projects, and in the next five years we will invest more than USD1 billion. We will also begin the construction of a hotel in Guadalajara this year and we are expecting to replicate this project in Tijuana in the coming years.</p><h4>What strategies are you using to make sure the airport remains competitive as others around the world?</h4><p>The experience of the passenger is at the centerfold of our strategy, first with the app and also with technology to clean the different areas of the airport. One of the big points we noticed in this pandemic was that passengers are more conscious of the cleanliness of the airport. We needed to invest in additional technology for all the cleaning processes. We began the acquisition of plenty of steam machines for toilets and installed sensors on the toilets that count the number of passengers that go into the restrooms in order to better manage our cleaning process and make real-time decisions. The idea is to have a contactless process for passengers at the airport.</p><h4>What are your long-term goals?</h4><p>As a company, we are trying to be greener. In the last year, we have installed solar panels in 11 of our 12 Mexican airports and in the Montego Bay airport in Jamaica, and six of our airports are fully independent in terms of energy consumption and they only consume solar energy for their daily operations. The new terminals in Guadalajara and Vallarta will be the first net-zero terminals in the Americas, which means the terminal has zero carbon emissions. It will also have a system to recapture water and return it back into the buildings. One of our key objectives for the coming years is sustainability. We did a tender for the engineering part of the solar panel system, and we have multiple suppliers. Our carbon footprint has been reduced.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors are behind the strong levels of growth in demand the chemical industry is observing despite lockdown?</h4><p>Globally, figures for the chemical market for 1Q2021 are the highest in probably 10 years, driven by improved expectations and demand. Business expectations have been increasing steadily since January 2021. ACC (American Chemical Council) data of global chemical production shows increases since January 2021, and China is up 17% year-on-year, Europe up 12% and, while the US is also showing meanwhile strong recovery, they are still lagging probably -1 or -2% year-on-year due to the still depressed oil industry. Driven by positive news around COVID-19 vaccinations, some degree of economic normalization is expected for the 2nd half of 2021. These positive trends in chemicals are already visible, and the risk of a potential downswing should be limited. We believe we are about to see a steady recovery going forward. The good news for Mexico would be that US expects a fast recovery, caused by its fiscal response and aggressive rollout of vaccines, and industry shows positive momentum, services also look promising, and household income in 2020 is higher than 2019, with a higher saving rate (10 % higher than average of last 20 years and the highest since WWII). Just recently, we heard about an expected GDP by year end will at 5 to 7% for US for 2021. Outlook for 2021 is a 3.5 — 4.0% GDP growth in Mexico, where all sectors and markets actively participating in exports would show significant growth while the ones associated to the domestic market would get weaker. We do expect an increase in exports to support the recovery of the US economy and the uncertainty of the commercial policies in the region disappear with the implementation of the new North American free trade agreement.  The economic stimulus is a boost for Mexican exports. On another side, current recovery is being challenged by supply chain interruptions, increasing delivery times and prices.</p><h4>What do you consider having been Evonik's greatest achievement in Mexico of 2020?</h4><p>Evonik survived the pandemic well, especially here in North America. The company achieved its financial targets, and production and logistics have been secured globally and all measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees have been consistently implemented. For 2021, the company will continue his growth journey and agenda. In Mexico, we are showing consistent strong results in 2020 versus previous year volume-wise and achieving higher turnover due to organic growth, execution of ongoing projects with customers locally and the further integration of acquisitions made by the group recently. We have successfully overcome the crisis and we have delivered. During 2020, from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the chemical industry in Mexico was regarded as essential, giving us the opportunity not only of focusing on our employees and their families but also our customers, their needs and how we could team up to develop a more collaborative strategy along the value chain we participate in. Despite the new virtually-driven reality, we were closer to our team and our business partners more than ever supporting them, and we all together were able to execute our strategic agenda for Mexico. It became obvious, that in a crisis like this one, Evonik's transformation towards more specialty chemicals has paid off. A more resilient and diversified portfolio of specialty chemicals is certainly a reason for such strong results in Mexico. And we continue with our transformation process, which will generate further growth in 2021 and beyond, globally.</p><h4>In what way is Evonik helping global partners start operations in the country?</h4><p>Mexico plays a pivotal role for many of our local partners, but particularly for our regional and global business partners across several industries and market segments. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Mexico was the country that shows the least negative impact and decrease on direct foreign investment flow in Americas during 2020. Beyond the well known success stories around the automotive, aerospace, medical devices industries, among others, getting established in Mexico as global platform to serve regional and international markets is becoming a common strategy by several of the global players we serve around the world and now in Mexico. Making our products and technologies available to them locally and be ready to engage in more strategic discussions around local R&amp;D, more Applied Technology projects for new products and applications, as well, as mentioned before, a more collaborative approach to innovation along the value chains, are just few examples on how we are leading beyond chemistry in Mexico.</p><h4>What kind of changes have you implemented in your business model to adapt to the challenges of the new normality?</h4><p>Like many others here, since March 2020, we are operating in Mexico on an adapted basis. While we keep our sites in Monterrey, Querétaro and Santa Clara running to guarantee our operations, we have implemented several other changes at those sites and at our corporate office to support our business lines and shared service organization to be safe, healthy and be able to run the business in the most efficient manner. Following our existing contingency plan, that we have implemented back in September 2017 in the aftermath of the last heavy earthquake in Mexico City, we were able to have our entire team operational remotely 24 hours after we decided to close our corporate office down. Our HR, IT and ESHQS teams, among others, did a terrific work in supporting and enabling our organization to keep operations running and be able to serve our customers properly. We have engaged in existing and new digital solutions internally for our processes and especially with our customers. Just as an example, we benefit from a massive global footprint of technical services experts and other valuable colleagues that were available now virtually to support our projects with our customers, allowing us to create distinctive value in Mexico. While we walk into 2021, we are following our own game plan and strategy for a safe and healthy return to work while we also attend the directions given by the local authorities in all places we operate in the country.</p><h4>What kind of products or services do you plan to launch in the short to medium term in Mexico and why?</h4><p>We will continue during 2021 executing our agenda through our business lines in Mexico, serving markets such as Agriculture, Health &amp; Oral Care, Personal &amp; Household Care, Automotive, Aerospace, Animal Protein &amp; Food Safety, Coatings, Paints and Colorants, among others. Particularly in Mexico, due to the global manufacturing role that we play, the nearshoring of supply chains as consequence of the new free trade agreement with US &amp; Canada and as part of the strategic repositioning of several players cross market segments as part of the COVID-19 pandemic risk mitigation, we are prepared to support our customers further. For Evonik Industries, globally, growth projects include the expansion of specialty lipids production, which are essential for mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. In addition to production in the USA and Canada, Evonik Industries is further expanding its production facilities at the German sites, which are expected to produce lipids in commercial quantities as early as the second half of 2021. Evonik's new production complex for Polyamide 12, used in growth markets such as 3D printing and in automotive and aerospace, will also be ready this year as planned. Mexico plays a very important role for those products.<br>Today Evonik generates around 35% of its sales from products that offer superior sustainability benefits to customers. In the field of future technologies, these so-called Next Generation Solutions are urgently needed in Mexico and globally. Evonik will continue increasing the proportion of solutions and business from these products in the coming years.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for 2021?</h4><p>Our people, their health and wellbeing and safety in all our processes, remain a top priority while we continue navigating with our customers through the weather of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global supply chain challenges. And markets are recovering rapidly, which motivates us to continue working diligently. As we strive to become the best specialty chemicals company in the world, we are moving beyond chemistry. We are interlinking disciplines, skills, and perspectives with one another so that as a partner of our customers we can create value-generating and sustainable solutions. As a result, we play a leading role in our markets and in the development of our industry. The answer to the question of why we exist lies in the passion with which we provide our customers' products with special characteristics: in order to make people's lives better, day after day.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the principles and values of the university?</h4><p>We are an institution that forms part of the social and solidarity-based economy. Therefore, all our principles are grounded in solidarity. Our mission to democratize education must be reflected in the development of regions and in the betterment of the quality of life of our alumni. We have a multi-campus system spread across 16 cities. All of our principles and values underpin the work of the university. What is more, our students come from over 900 cities, more than 80% of country. This means they are able to appreciate the quality and relevance of the wide-ranging coverage that the university offers to the less privileged populations of Colombia. In many cases, these are populations with specific socioeconomic, political, and social issues. Our values of inclusion, quality, and coverage have the power to strengthen our entire system.</p><h4>What has the university's experience been like with remote learning? How have digital media and distance learning made it possible for the university to reach rural or geographically remote areas?</h4><p>Inclusion is a key strategic element. The switch to remote learning and then to hybrid was made possible thanks to 10 years of digital transformation research and investment at the Cooperative University of Colombia. In the past few years alone, we have invested more than USD60 million in technology and digital competency development for all our employees. Some years ago, we began building a vision for the future of the university, preparing for a moment like this without imaging that we would face it so soon. However, we had no idea it would come about so quickly. This has been made possible thanks to all the work carried out over the course of the last decade. Therefore, with the participation of teachers, we were able to implement a hybrid model of learning for the benefit of students and families. The university began offering zero-interest financial plans for the payment of full tuition, ranging from six to 10 months in conjunction with our cooperative bank COMUNA, and we opened free enrollment. In 2021, we have continued to offer all students a 10% discount on tuition. We also started up several mentoring programs, delivered almost 2,000 computers to students and administrative staff, and organized donation campaigns in order to raise funds for connectivity and travel grants for national and international students.</p><h4>What has been achieved in terms of gender equality?</h4><p>We are the only university in the country with the EQUIPARES seal. This prestigious accolade is awarded to institutions that are able to demonstrate that they advocate for gender equality. It is presented on behalf of Office of the Presidency of the Republic of Colombia, the Ministry of Labor, and the United Nations Development Program. We were awarded the first seal in the city of Cali. We have been working to support the inclusion vulnerable populations for some years now. The gender and sexual diversity in the university community is highly respected. It is not a case of simply having policies or processes in place, but of generating a culture. In addition, this year we will put ourselves forward for the gold seal in order to demonstrate to the community just how far we have come in terms of our gender equality policy.</p><h4>What lessons from your time as Quality Director of the Ministry of Education have been useful during your tenure?</h4><p>It was two years of hard work and non-stop learning. I have been in higher education for 33 years, and by the time I came to join the Quality Directorate, I had been working at a university for 18 years. When you reach a government position where you are able see the diversity of the institutions, the opportunities, and the needs, and you have the opportunity to implement a public policy on learning, you play a part in improving it. I am fortunate to have come from a position in which I was aware of policy of the country because I implemented it, and I had the chance to build a rapport with some universities. Then, I moved on to a multi-campus university with a presence across multiple regions of Colombia and with students from more than 900 cities. It was a great opportunity for me. When you are aware of the reality of the situation, you better understand the needs of others. That has been my greatest lesson.</p><h4>What are you doing in terms of environment, environmental sustainability, and environmental protection?</h4><p>We have our own environmental management system and a program we call Reduce Your Footprint. This program, which we have been promoting for six years, includes information on how to save energy, make efficient use of energy, responsible waste management, efficient use of water at the university, and our purchases. We are always on the lookout for strategic allies that are able to provide us with certified eco-friendly foods. Obviously, we use the “environmentalization“ concept. This essentially involves conveying the importance of managing resources, taking care of the environment, generating campaigns, taking proper care of waste, and recycling in the classroom. We want to make sure students are aware of environmental protection and that it generates a domino effect so that when they get home, they, in turn, can teach their families. In 2020, we saw a 57% reduction in energy consumption across all campuses and a 63% fall in water consumption. At the Cooperative University of Colombia, we have already reduced the use of paper by 70%.</p><h4>How does the Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia work with teachers to support them in the digital transformation?</h4><p>We have 3,000 teachers and about 38,000 students. We have been building a collaborative working network called Rizoma, which enables teachers to share experiences and ideas for about six years now. Before the pandemic, we had brought about 1,200 teachers together online, and this has now risen to 2,200. In addition, Microsoft named us among the 10 universities that most use its resources in Latin America. We were the first in Colombia.</p><h4>How do you see the development of the higher education system in Colombia? How would you like it to develop?</h4><p>One of the important things to highlight about the higher education system in Colombia is that we have all come together. The Padrino Brown Plan, which was headed up the Ministry of Education, brought together over 34 universities and higher education institutions to support more than 180 people in need. The opportunities are continuing to grow, and awareness is increasing; however, education remains key to reducing poverty. It is the fundamental basis for social transformation and mobility. The pandemic has given students the power to decide what they want to learn and how they want to go about it. For this reason, the Cooperative University of Colombia fast tracked a project called Ligros that had been in the works for a few years. This decision was made based on the fact that the pandemic has forced us to educate students online. We must continue to learn that technologies are a key factor in learning. Likewise, the system must become resilient and flexible. I believe it must adapt and innovate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved over the last two years?</h4><p>We have leveraged the last few years to consolidate our expertise on the market, positioning us among the top five European leaders as a pure player in cybersecurity services. The accelerated digital transformation that many companies have had to undergo, especially over the last two years, has enabled cybersecurity to become one of the priorities for executives across all sectors. We have guided those companies with suitable advice for the situation, during which teleworking was implemented as an almost exclusive form of working in many companies that did not have the necessary infrastructure, but we were able to support them with our expertise, providing solutions so they could continue their business without worrying about the possibility of a cyberattack bringing their business to a standstill. Also, one of the company's most important operations was having the support of Maxive Cybersecurity, a holding company that combines the expertise of S21sec, based in Spain, Portugal and Mexico, with that of Excellium, based in Luxembourg, which has an excellent positioning on the market. Both companies offer a wide range of services that harness the best practices and the experience of both companies as managed security service providers (MSSP). Our mission is to continue growing as one of the largest European pure players in MSSP.   </p><h4>Do you have clients from other European markets?</h4><p>As I mentioned, we have a strong presence in Europe; we have major multinationals who entrust us with the management of their cybersecurity. Thanks to our geographical position, and our long trajectory, we have important clients in Spain, Portugal, and Benelux. In addition to our strong European presence, we have a headquarters in Mexico and that enables us to manage major operations in Latin America.</p><h4>The pandemic has caused an increase in spending by companies in the ICT sector, and cybersecurity is the segment with the highest performance. How have you adapted to the increase in demand?</h4><p>Indeed, as we mentioned previously, cybersecurity has positioned itself as one of the priorities for all companies. It is a matter that was still pending for many of them and the pandemic has highlighted its importance and even its urgency, in many cases. We have been on the front line to support, in an altruistic way, the hospitals and any entity from the health sector, to ensure they had our backing, in the areas where our headquarters are located, against any cyberattack, because regrettably such attacks did occur during the pandemic. Our team was 100% ready to telework without problems and the transition was easy for us. During lockdown we have had to carry out client interventions that were implemented perfectly, our teams enable us to manage many incidents remotely, but when it is necessary to go further and carry out actions physically on site, we did not suffer any setbacks. Demand has grown exponentially, teleworking turned companies into more vulnerable targets, we have witnessed a 300% increase in cyberattacks during the pandemic. Faced with these new challenges, where many clients have had to reinvent themselves by adapting their services, changing to e-commerce, invoicing and making orders online, etc., we have been monitoring the new tactics of cybercriminals to prevent and resolve possible security incidents that our clients may suffer, supporting them and guiding them at all times. Major cybersecurity challenges that everyone, both the clients and our team of experts, have emerged from stronger than before.</p><h4>In terms of revenue, how were your 2020 results?</h4><p>We closed with 116% goal achievement, with an added growth of around 12%, above sector average. Our goal was always to grow above 10%.</p><h4>R&amp;D has always been a main focus for S21Sec, which invests more than 10% of its profits in it. Have you maintained the same level of investment despite the pandemic?</h4><p>Our investment in R+D has remained at the same level. Technology is always progressing so our knowledge must constantly grow. Our services adapt continuously to market changes and so too do our staff, who undergo ongoing training to be certified in the most cutting-edge technologies.</p><h4>What is your strategy to attract talent and motivate it into this sector?</h4><p>This is linked to the value proposition that we offer our clients, which I always want to be appealing for people at S21sec: we must understand that the management of cybersecurity services is not only rooted in the understanding of the business of clients, but rather in how the use of technology affects them. Our objective is to advise clients so they can take the best cybersecurity decisions based on data, because we study their business in order to protect them from possible vulnerabilities that could endanger the continuity of their business. We constantly learn from the tactics of cybercriminals with the intention of anticipating their movements. We have a cyber-intelligence department that investigates cybercrimes, analyzing how and from where gangs of cybercriminals operate, which is really appealing to students who leave university in search of innovative and disruptive working challenges. We also collaborate with national and international organizations to combat cybercrime, thus protecting the critical infrastructures of countries.</p><h4>You collaborate with IESE in master sessions for managers. One of the points that you were focused on changing is the concept that cybersecurity decisions should not be delegated to the IT teams of companies. Who should take decisions related to cybersecurity?</h4><p>When they take our courses, most of the executive directors tell us that they prefer to delegate. In these courses, we highlight the importance of cybersecurity in companies due to the impact that an incident can have on the continuity of their business. It is important for executives to be aware of the implications that cybersecurity crimes now have, both in terms of legislation and malpractice. They need to be aware of the importance of legal compliance with GDPR, for example, or the need to train the staff to limit risks due to malpractice.  We remind them in training that people continue to be the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain, and that shows the invaluable need for a suitable action plan adapted to the company, its sector, and the nature of its business. Today, a cybersecurity attack can affect the business processes of a company, the prices of its shares, its public image, besides the impact in the media and the market; therefore, we try to create awareness about this matter. It is the senior management that must establish a responsibilities map and a complete cybersecurity plan, they must know how much time they need to restore their business if they suffer a cyberattack, because this can have an impact worth thousands of Euros that can be contained or avoided with good planning. At present, most executive directors know that they must lead the digital transformation of their companies in order to harness the possibilities offered by new technologies and adapt their business model to new challenges and the new era. They must also be aware that this involves certain risks that must be addressed, both in terms of finances and company image.</p><h4>What public-private collaboration opportunities exist in this area of cybersecurity?</h4><p>There are COVID-19 recovery funds which can be fully harnessed, as well as several that have been allocated to encourage the digital transformation of companies, which could help them to fund part of the investments they need to make in different technologies, infrastructures, etc.  We also need to bear in mind that there are public grants aimed at helping countries to develop industrially in a secure way, which means that there are plans to allocate funds to cybersecurity.</p><h4>What are your objectives for the rest of the year?</h4><p>We are aiming to consolidate our project for European growth, and we have considered other acquisitions.  We want to continue to grow and maintain our position of innovation and leadership as benchmarks for the industry within the context of the COVID-19 environment, where work forces are scattered around or teleworking.  Lastly, our aim is to strengthen our position as a leader for the management of these secure environments, security in the cloud and accompanying companies through their detection protocols and response to cybersecurity incidents.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Coface helped and supported its partners through the pandemic?</h4><p>Coface's clients are the company's focal point. Guaranteeing the long-reach service our members expect has been our priority throughout the pandemic. We need to ensure we have solid communication, which includes the technical aspects of cooperation. For this reason, we have strengthened our cloud service capacity and the web capabilities of our partners. Coface's database of information is key for clients, and fortunately, it is an international platform that can be transferred online in real time. Ensuring our clients can maintain access to information of credit risk allowed them to navigate pandemic-related trade interruptions. This is what we focused on in the first few months, as well as ensuring our workforce was productive and secure at home.</p><h4>How is your global network an asset for clients looking to partner with Coface?</h4><p>Our global network is one of our main assets because it has crucial information that guides international credit decisions. It will attract an even larger role in the future as reduced travel possibilities impede our clients from getting to know their clients directly. The information we offer from having a presence in Europe, South Africa, Asia, and Latin America ensure that our clients have more information to be able to make their credit risk decisions and expand their global network of partners.</p><h4>How do you use data analytics to provide support for clients?</h4><p>Data analytics is a methodology that Coface uses to deepen and enrich the information we offer to clients. We use all the information available—on the ground and in each country in which we are present—to ensure our clients are able to have firsthand insights. Our platform is constantly being improved and updated. We support partners with information specific to credit insurance as well as information on other exposures such as the economy and market.</p><h4>What market opportunities exist in Colombia for Coface?</h4><p>The online migration of SMEs has been extremely important for Coface, especially manufacturers growing targeted online business lines. Companies in this area need information and credit insurance. Colombian companies must be in touch with credit insurance and the benefits it offers. Even if they do not use the tool of credit insurance to cover their sales at home or abroad, they need to use the information available to them to make better decisions: who they will sell to and the companies that will be their clients. We are working on products specific for the needs of smaller companies, a market segment to whom credit insurance was not accessible. Most large companies in Colombia use credit insurance, as do also most multinational companies; however, SMEs are only now realizing the value of covering their sales. We want to expand access to credit insurance at every level and offer products that are tailor made.</p><h4>How is Coface helping to create tailor-made products?</h4><p>We create products specific to our client's needs in Colombia. That ensures we have a product that provides sufficient coverage for our policyholder and gives them sufficient information to make better decisions on how to leverage the positive aspects and opportunities of the market. The economic insights we offer, not only abroad in larger countries but also on a sectorial basis, give our clients information on the more profitable sectors or sectors that would need their type of products. That is what we offer them.</p><h4>What growth potential do you see for Colombia in this sector?</h4><p>We have full potential. There are over 1 million companies affiliated to the Chamber of Commerce in Colombia, of which only 1,200 have hired a credit insurance policy. We are not doing enough to help companies, giving them credit insurance, granting them limits or helping them decide if they should work together with a company. We need to be out there giving them information on how credit insurance works and what benefits exist.</p><h4>What is your business development strategy, and what catalysts are available to expand insurance to the Colombian market?</h4><p>One of the things we need to work on is the basics and giving more information and granting companies the possibility of getting to know what credit insurance can do for them. One of our strategies is to provide better-quality information as we cannot keep our information to ourselves. One of my goals is to be more out there and get people more involved in what credit insurance can do to help them out. We look at the traditionally large sectors such as the food industry and large companies and multinational companies like Nestlé that mostly do not use credit insurance as a tool. When we look at these large companies and compare them to other large companies in retail, they traditionally share the interest in credit insurance. We need to ensure the large companies use it as an example for the midsized and smaller companies to have this information replicated starting from the largest companies to the tiny ones, as this will give them the opportunity to trust in credit insurance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What methods did the company use to finally break its production benchmark of 1 million tons of copper in 2019 for the first time?</h4><p>There will always be potential for mining growth in Mexico, Peru, and the US. We have seven open-pit mines: two in Mexico, two in Peru, and three in Arizona. Our production in 2019 was, for the first time, over 1 million tons of copper; due to the completed expansion of the second concentrator in Toquepala. This added expansion allowed us to increase our production by 100,000 tons; leading to a grand total of over 1 million tons.</p><h4>What are your expectations for production in 2020?</h4><p>We have about the same expectations. We have three investments in Mexico, one of those will be Buenavista Zinc, we found zinc inside copper, this material needs to be process in a new concentrator. That will increase production and total income in our underground mines in Mexico. The construction of the new concentrator is due to start this year and is expected to be completed in two years with an investment of approximately USD480 million.</p><h4>Are you still contemplating entering new markets such as Ecuador, Argentina, and Chile?</h4><p>We are exploring market opportunities in the mining sector in other three countries. We are currently exploring the opportunity of evolving us into a project in Ecuador for a copper mine. We have not taken a final decision; however, we need to evaluate the long term benefits this important investment can add up to our company. At the moment, we are exploring possibilities, that can prove it will be a substantial project. </p><h4>How will COVID-19 impact your production and performance in 2020?</h4><p>We cannot deny the fact; this global pandemic is affecting our sector, but Americas Mining Corporation is in the other hand, already sold 80-85% of our production to Chinese companies in October 2019. The only inconvenience we have encountered is the change of distribution dates because some companies are suggesting that we do not send it according to the timing we had already set up. Apart from that, it has not been a problem, since we already signed the contracts. We will send our production following a different timing than we expected, and we hope it will not cause any further problems.</p><h4>What does the mining industry in Mexico need to become more competitive?</h4><p>We consider Mexico already competitive. We are achieving higher production levels in Mexico compared to Peru, mainly in Buenavista del Cobre. Moreover, due to the addition of a new concentrator, we were able to increase our production by more than 100,000 tons of copper. This addition helped us achieve over 1 million tons we produced in 2019. Out of our total production, 60% comes from Mexico, and 40% comes from Peru. Nevertheless, we have three pending projects in Peru: Tí­a Marí­a, Los Chancas, and Michiquillay. They have different dates. In Mexico, we have the Buenavista mine, which is centered in zinc extraction. Furthermore, we have an upcoming small mine project, El Pilar, in Mexico, which is expected to produce 30,000 tons of copper. El Pilar project will start in 2020 and will take at least 1.5 years to produce the amount of copper we expect.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Minas Buenaventura's current strategies for applying technological innovations to its operations?</h4><p>We are putting in place AI in many aspects of the production chain. We have monitors all over the processing plants as well as in the mines. We are definitely applying a great deal in terms of exploration and geology. In the future, we are advancing in one important project, San Gabriel, where we expect to have a full digitalization as much as can be done but with alternative sources of energy, namely solar. We have to look at such innovations in order to be more environmentally friendly, which applies to all industries and not just mining alone.</p><h4>What is the current timeline of the San Gabriel project?</h4><p>Many around the world do not understand how difficult it is to do mining in Peru. San Gabriel is located 4,700m above sea level, and one can hardly breathe at that altitude. The mine was a discovery made by Buenaventura's geologists using a great deal of technology. We have been working for the last five years and are currently in the process of feasibility. We expect to start construction by 2021 and be in production by 2022 or 2023. In this project, the ideal situation is to have solar panels that could substitute diesel or other sources of energy for this specific mine. If we are able to do 100% solar energy, it will be a great achievement for us, and we are heading in that direction.</p><h4>What role does Buenaventura and Peru play in the growing demand for renewable energy solutions across the globe?</h4><p>Copper is the metal for infrastructure, and the main consumer of copper globally is China as well as developing countries such as India. Silver is being used heavily in solar energy, while gold is being used for specific industrial aspects as well as for jewelry, so that has great demand. People need metals, and we contribute to society in that respect. In Peru, mining has been a blessing for the country. We are in first, second, and third place for most of the metals needed by the world, and we not only need to but we have the right to add value to all those resources. Peru has been blessed with natural resources, and there is nothing wrong with mining all these natural resources for the benefit of the country, for integrating with society and to contribute with the well-being of my country in the long-term.</p><h4>What are your priorities for Buenaventura and your general outlook for the mining sector for 2021?</h4><p>Mining represents 10% of total GDP in Peru but represents over 50% of total exports. We need to export and are part of many free trade agreements. We have relationships with two-thirds of global GDP, with China, Japan, the US, Canada, Latin American countries, and Asia. We need to promote exports, which are mainly defined by fishing, manufacturing, agroindustry, and, most importantly, mining. The future for Buenaventura is to continue contributing to society, generating employment, generating decentralization, and overall relating ourselves to other industries. Mining is more than simply producing metals; it is an industry that is also related to other industries, and we are contributing to the Peruvian economy in that respect. Buenaventura operates in eight out of the 24 regions in Peru, and that shows how decentralized a mining company can be. We certainly contribute via professional education and are closely linked to universities such as the National University of Engineering and the Catholic University of Peru, both in Lima. We are also linked to the National University of Saint Augustine in Arequipa, the National University of Saint Anthony in Cuzco, and the National University of Cajamarca, so we are not isolated from the rest of society. We do believe in sustainability and socially responsible mining and industry in general.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a summary of where the company was at when you took over, what your intentions were, and what you have accomplished thus far?</h4><p>JAZADCO is a publicly listed company established in 1993 and has grown to operate several business lines, such as agriculture, aquaculture, and real estate. We are also exploring new projects in the energy sector. Part of our mandate is to contribute to the development of Jazan region, a unique area located south of Saudi Arabia that features magnificent natural scenary of mountains as well as many kilometers of coastline, and has long been an agriculture center. Recently, a new board for JAZADCO was appointed and a mandate in line with Vision 2030 was established. The new vision is set forth with a clear focus on company profitability, as well as expand to various industries and improve operations. The mission for me as CEO of JAZADCO was to transform the company to achieve those goals. We started by understanding our current state and the business lines we are operating in as well as the expectations from the board, shareholders, and market. We also analyzed how we compare to our competitors regionally and globally, and how we benchmark in industries globally. We designed our transformation program and started implementing a number of initiatives that aim to achieve our strategic focus. We had to increase production efficiency and increase our sales revenues, which we did by expanding to new markets. As a result, our revenue increased by 18% in 2020 despite the pandemic, and the company achieved its highest profits since 2015.</p><h4>How did you manage to increase revenue and profit? What were the key drivers for your growth?</h4><p>It was not attributed one particular major decision, but many smaller choices that contributed to increasing revenue and reducing costs. Adapting how we conduct business and how we operate in the field to current market conditions has been important. We also looked for opportunities through aqcuisitions aimed at achieving our strategic objectives and aligned with our strategic ambition. For example, and prior to the pandemic, we acquired two e-commerce start-ups that enabled us to expand market reach of our agriculture and aquaculture offerings, which ended up significantly boosting and supporting our sales during lockdown. We also focused on investing in our human capital to achieve our goals. We created an incremental approach to help us to consitantly assess and improve as we go, rather than have a top-down transformation plan, so everyday we review where we are and how we can do it better. The incremental approach helped us achieve more in less time.</p><h4>Which segment of your business drove the increase in revenue?</h4><p>We increased our sales by attracting new clients, accessing new markets, and adding new approaches such as food processing. We increased our shrimp sales, which is the largest bulk of our revenue. We increased our sales by having investing in technology and improving our marketing and operations. We reduced our expenses, which did not mean cutting salaries, but being more efficient. We also increased our production significantly by 41%.</p><h4>What is the story behind the acquisition of the two start-ups, and how have they influenced your results?</h4><p>We did not want to reinvent the wheel or to build capabilities that already existed on the market, so we surveyed the market. I came across Mango Jazan, which was doing amazingly well. Amazing team, the brand is strong,  and it has the know-how and a solid presence in the market with established clients. It was a smooth integration, because it fit naturally as our sales arm. It sells high-quality mangoes regionally through an online channel. The main target was to grow and expand in the market, and e-commerce was a must in the pandemic. We acquired another start-up called Fish Day that specializes in selling seafood products, and it was perfect because we wanted more diversity in our offering. It sells various types of fish, packs it well, and delivers it to clients.</p><h4>How did the pandemic impact your business and influence your decisions surrounding digitalization?</h4><p>First and far most, our priority is the wellbeing of our employees. We invested in raising awareness and adapting the recommended measures for health and safety. We adopted a dynamic approach to working through the pandemic by observing the market and adjusting accordingly. We had to pause a number of initiatives, and our team became somewhat demoralized because we had had big plans for 2020. However, we have been magnificently resilient, and we can see it in the results today. Motivating people to work with uncertainty helped us be resilient. We were also fortunate because we acquired the start-ups before the pandemic, so we were ready to have our products available to our clients through digital channels. Our sales were stable through the pandemic, and we were not hit as hard as other industries.</p><h4>What are your goals for the coming years in your broader strategy, and what steps are you taking to achieve those long-term goals?</h4><p>We look to expand in the aquaculture business. For agriculture, we aspire to be a leader in the market, connect, and promote high-quality fruit and vegetables to other markets. We want to expand our presence online and have more channels to reach different markets. We also want to strengthen our food brand. In a nutshell, we want to continue with our transformation and expansion in order to improve our operations.</p><h4>How do you see JAZADCO being part of the country's transformation?</h4><p>The whole country is going through a major transformation, both the public and private sectors and individuals are working tirelessly to achieve Vision 2030. JAZADCO is part of this movement, and we are contributing by increasing our production and improving our revenue, thereby supporting the economy where we operate in Jazan. We are contributing to national goals by increasing consumption of seafood, raising awareness, and better access to quality products and services. We play a role in agriculture transformation, because food security is part of our agenda. We are working with local producers to gain access to our logistic hubs and connect the end consumer with high-quality products. We are also trying to reach other international markets as part of our vision to expand. Finally, Employment opportunities in the aquaculture and agriculture among other industries within which JAZADCO is operating is somewhat challenging, especially for female professionals, but we can see how such diversity of profiles and backgrounds can add to the economy, which JAZADCO is taking part to facilitate access to those markets and industries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have an offering to SME clients that is unique in the Kingdom. What advantages does it offer, and what has allowed you to innovate in this direction?</h4><p>We are highly focused on point of sale (POS) financing, or, as it is known in the West, Merchant Cash Advance (MCA). We are the first to launch MCA in Saudi Arabia. This product allows small businesses to use their future POS transactions as collateral to gain access to financing. The repayment is a percentage of their daily sales directly through their POS devices. This system is perfect for the needs of SMEs. We could introduce this product because the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) opened its regulations to allow 3rd party payment aggregators into the market, who are able to support the operational requirements of such products. In January 2020, we signed with Geidea and Sure Global Technology, which are both payment aggregators. Previously, the only payment aggregators were banks. SAMA's new initiatives allow new products to be introduced to the market while remaining in a sandbox environment allowing both the regulator and Fintech an opportunity to test the market viability of their technology.</p><h4>How has the pandemic influenced your business, and what have you done to respond to the current situation?</h4><p>We were impacted significantly, as our core business is SMEs. When the shutdown occurred in Saudi Arabia, nearly all SMEs were shut down. The Saudi government's response was amazing, we deferred payments to support those SMEs based on the mandates of SAMA and Monsha'at. It has also required us to look at the delivery mechanism of our product to our SMEs. It required the Company to move plans forward on the complete digitization of our merchant experience. Our product is well adapted to the crises because if one's business has to temporarily close, and has no revenue they would not have to pay until they were allowed to reopen. This is built into the product and was an immediate relief to customers during this pandemic. We have begun pilot tests and now have about 70 SME merchants on the MCA platform. Our expectation is to grow the platform exponentially going forward with an expectation of having 2,000 merchants on the platform in 2021.</p><h4>Has the short-term impact for you been curbed by the SAMA interventions?</h4><p>Many countries did not have a clear stimulus package until after lockdown, while Saudi Arabia to a proactive approach and announced the plan prior to the temporary shutdown, so the sequence of events was done properly. While there was anxiety amongst business owners, they felt relief that they would not have to pay their debtors or go bankrupt from their financing arrangements. That was extremely important.</p><h4>What does your recent MoU with Mastercard achieve?</h4><p>Our tie up with Mastercard provides an SME in a box service. We can issue prepaid cards, so that people have access to financing or capital, immediately. Most of merchants are underserved, and we wanted to make sure they had access to capital when they need it the most. We are dealing with micro to very small businesses with a maximum of SAR5 million in revenue. That is why we are looking at the entire SME ecosystem, from payments to cards. Once we have access to data, it will be easy for us to expand digitally. In that sense, open banking is a requirement to expand lending to SMEs, personal finance, and have a thriving fintech industry. Fintech is driven by data. If you cannot get to the data, there are many limitations going forward, and this is a regulatory change we hope to see in the future.</p><h4>What is on the horizon for you, and where do you see growth coming from in the next year?</h4><p>Growth will come from expanding our current product, as we have a product that is scalable. Typical SME products are not scalable without large operations, and our expectation is to serve 2,000-3,000 merchants over the next 12-24 months. We will likely be fifth or sixth in terms of the number of payment devices in the market. The goal is to penetrate the market and expand the MCA products reach. In the short term. However, the delivery mechanism of the product and access to data will evolve over time. We have 100 employees currently which is an increase of 100% prior to the pandemic. This is required to keep up with the market demand of our product.  We have some very exciting new products to complement our current offering to SMEs in 2021-2022.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Al Rajhi has been a leader in digitalization and the adoption of new technologies. Where does digitalization stand in the bank's overall strategy? </h4><p>Digitalization has been one of the main pillars of our strategy; we have been extremely ambitious in our digitalization strategy from the beginning. We set up a digital banking group to consolidate the digital agenda, and the first step of the strategy was to make available most of our branch and phone banking services via our mobile app. After this, we digitalized our key products (personal finance, cards, mortgages, and so on) end-to-end. The results have been outstanding, and today we have more than 85% of new customers joining the bank by opening current accounts via either our internet banking website or mobile app. We see a rapid migration toward digital channels of many of the services offered by the bank including cards such as debit, prepaid, and credit, remittances, local transfers, and personal finance. Our mobile banking app has been the key driver for this success. We started a similar journey in our SME and corporate business, where we see digital growth happening at a rapid pace.</p><h4>You assumed the CEO position a year ago, just before the pandemic, and managed to steer the organization through a historic crisis and still post a 4% YoY profit. What key changes did you implement across this challenging year?</h4><p>COVID-19 has been a challenge unlike other economic recessions in terms of the extent and duration of the impacts on our customers and the economy. There was no standard playbook to refer to, meaning our whole team had to adapt quickly. We have, however, kept several things front of mind when making these decisions: protecting our team members and customers; adapting our business operations to ensure we remain accessible to our customers; and supporting the Saudi government in its efforts to navigate the pandemic and ensure a recovery on the other side. To protect our team members, we reduced branch operations during the first wave lockdown, instituted changes to cash handling, and moved our call center operations to remote working. We were able to move quickly thanks to a combination of our recent investments in technology and the tireless work by our team members. For our customers, there was a rapid and enthusiastic switch to remote channels due in large part to the great investment and effort we have made in the last three years to make most service and sales capabilities available over our desktop and award-winning mobile banking app. All our retail banking products are now available for purchase online, which is a first for Saudi banks. These innovations have been greatly welcomed by customers, as seen by the rapid uptake in online account opening and loan applications for Al Rajhi and our new Emkan finance company. Al Rajhi has also supported the numerous government initiatives to support the economy and customers during the pandemic, including fee waivers and support for small business customers. In addition, Al Rajhi's continued support for the government's efforts to encourage home ownership in the Kingdom saw our mortgage lending continue throughout 2020.</p><h4>Regulatory changes in the Kingdom have moved quickly in recent years, with extensive changes that enable innovation. How is Al Rajhi working to take advantage of new regulatory space?</h4><p>All over the world, the banking community is moving to embrace open banking. Open banking is a technological innovation that enables customers to securely share their data with third parties. In recent years, several fintech companies have emerged, presenting new business models that would benefit from access to customers' data. This opens the doors to creating and offering new financial services. Therefore, SAMA views open banking as pivotal to the further development of the Kingdom's financial sector. It represents an opportunity for stakeholders to leverage on the data associated with financial transactions to imagine and access new ways of managing money. In addition, customers will benefit from better financial products and services, ranging from bringing all accounts into a single dashboard to creating smoother journeys into daily banking activities. Critical to the success of this vision is the need for the financial ecosystem to be entirely secure, always available, and operate with no delays.</p><h4>In what ways has the pandemic shifted the way banks operate, both internally in terms of work norms and externally in terms of contact with clients?</h4><p>The lockdown to prevent the spread of the pandemic halted economic activity across many sectors, with important repercussions for firms and households. The banking sector was also affected. While banking services can be provided remotely and do not rely on direct customer contact, the linkages of the sector with the real sector as the provider of payment, savings, credit, and risk management services had to operate smoothly without any disruption from COVID-19-induced restrictions. Digital solutions provided a lifeline to households and businesses; for example, the value of POS transactions via mobile increased by about five times in 2020 compared to 2019. At the same time, the banking sector had to support firms and households during this period of lower revenues and incomes, which triggered important policy actions by financial supervisors and governments. In Saudi Arabia, the government stimulated the economy by supporting households and businesses through the banking system; SAR100 billion (equal to 3% of 2019 GDP) in stimulus support was deployed in the banking sector as part of a larger stimulus package. In addition, banks play an integral role in facilitating international trade; essential goods and equipment had to continue to be imported such as food, medicine, and protective equipment. Finally, COVID-19 accelerated digital adoption by necessitating conducting banking without physical interactions. By implementing completely digitalized and remote customer transactions, banks ensured that both everyday and exceptional processes were carried out with limited disruptions. In terms of reaching clients, banks leveraged their pre-pandemic investments in digital infrastructure to continue to run smoothly, offer their services, and stay closely in touch with their customers. During the lockdown, Al Rajhi managed its relationship with its clients through social media with continuous announcements of the most recent developments as well as on an individual level, where emails and phone calls were employed to deal with customers' needs and the bank's customers' support and preventive actions. All these were possible as a result of the bank's continuous investment in digital channels. This allowed Al Rajhi to continue offering its products and expand its reach to even more clients; for example, it started offering digital cards during the pandemic without requiring customers to visit a branch. Also, in 2020, 83% of all bank transactions were digital compared to 66% in 2019. The number of online financing applications increased by 233% in 2020 YoY. Also, the number of active digital users in 2020 reached 7.9 million users, growth of 39% from the 2019 level. Helping customers and businesses recover from the economic impact of COVID-19 means helping them focus on productive economic activity. Banking must be a seamless enabler of that activity and enable customers and businesses to manage their financial needs in the right way. Increasingly, that means digitally. This trend has proven its effectiveness and convenience to clients and cost efficiency to banks. Banks are expected to expand in AI and analytics-based software for its product offerings in the medium term. The pandemic will further strengthen competition for banks from fintechs, as well as, the trend toward digitalization will only grow further, implying a lesser need for bank branches and a greater reliance on telephone and internet banking.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Three years ago, our Cerro Corona operation was scheduled to be shut down in 2023; however, thanks to our team and some innovative proposals, we have been able to extend the life of the Cerro Corona mine to at least 2030 and likely to 2032. This is big news for the country, Gold Fields, and Cerro Corona. We are also extremely active in our exploration activities. We have a 16% stake in Chakana Copper Corp.'s Peruvian subsidiary Chakana Resources, a mining company exploring in Ancash Province not far from Lima. With that, we have a footprint in the Ancash region. In 2020, we created a new exploration vice-president role at Gold Fields where the main focus is to find more assets in Peru. We are looking for properties in central and southern Peru. Hopefully, if the pandemic allows it, we will be in a position to make a big announcement in 2021.</p><h4>What is Gold Fields' strategy for developing new technologies to extend the life of your mines?</h4><p>First, we decided to change our strategy. We were going to continue doing things the same way as in the past and, as a result, shut down our Cerro Corona operations in 2023. However, we renewed and reshaped the team, and it came back with a new proposal. The main restriction at Cerro Corona mine is space; we do not have room for additional tailings. We decided to use the pit as the tailings compartment, which is extremely challenging to do from an engineering standpoint. We did some research and investigations around the pit. We drilled deep holes and studied the hydrologic, geological, and hydric configurations. With that, we completed a feasibility study, proposed a new mine plan, and were able to recommend using the pit as a tailings compartment. That gained us another seven years mine life.</p><h4>How is Gold Fields and the wider mining sector in Peru engaging with the big global trend of environmental responsibility and sustainability?</h4><p>We have been talking about technologies and mining activities, but beneath that is a huge social apparatus working in Peru to secure our social license. Since we commenced our operations here 11 years ago, we have established our main style based on our important pillar of adding value to society. We believe in the shared value concept. Our value is not only in the taxes we generate, but also in the jobs we create around us, the local suppliers we promote, the local economy we stimulate, and our positive intervention in social activities in all our surrounding communities. In the world today, it is not enough for a company just to be a good taxpayer; it has to be a good citizen and, more than that, a good friend to communities.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the local mining regulatory framework? Are there things the government could do to improve the sector's and Gold Field's ability to operate in the country?</h4><p>Peru is extremely competitive due to its geological endowment; when it comes to taxes, it's similar to other big mining jurisdictions. However, it is not that successful in terms of infrastructure because Peru is in the Andes, and many mining sites are remote and far from the ocean and ports. Peru also has more regulations, and processes in its public offices are slower and more administratively repetitive. When it comes to the social environment, we do have conflicts in Peru due to a lack of public investment. We have many things to improve when it comes to regulation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Al Khaleel Group decide to build a new hotel in Muscat, and what challenges did you face when executing that idea in the middle of a pandemic?</h4><p>The process of building the Ramada Encore by Wyndham started years ago. Nevertheless, the construction closing phases had their fair share of drawbacks due to the logistical challenges across the globe in 2020, namely a lack of building materials, hiring team members, and many other operational difficulties. On another note, the hospitality industry was deeply affected by the pandemic due to the lockdown, the closure of airports, and travel bans. These factors had a direct impact on occupancy levels and rate structures, which impacted overall revenues. Nevertheless, Al Khaleel Group did not cut any corners in order to construct a landmark for years to come.</p><h4>What key characteristics of the hospitality industry in Oman did you incorporate into the property and what are the features of the hotel?</h4><p>Al Khaleel Group always believes the soul of any building remains in the artwork on display in public areas. Wanting to exude and represent the essence of a true Omani, the group was honored to work with a female Omani artist who crafted custom-made paintings for every room of the hotel, in addition to the public areas. Each of these works of art provides a strong Omani flavor in every corner of the hotel and helps communicates the Omani culture and feel to guests. The Ramada Encore Muscat Hotel is a 163-room property with an Italian cuisine specialty restaurant and a craft coffee shop. The rooms are spacious and come with hardwood floors, flatscreen TVs, and a high-tech control panel for the lighting system and air-conditioning. There are also 23 premiere and executive suites, a fully-equipped fitness center, and a rooftop pool. The hotel's location in the middle of the city, in addition to its ease of access to the airport and various government offices and companies, makes it ideal for both business and leisure travelers.</p><h4>How will the hotel fit within the Muscat hospitality landscape and remain competitive?</h4><p>With the economic effects of the pandemic on businesses, companies are now looking at significant savings across the board. We have lined up our selling strategies accordingly, giving companies that choose the Ramada Encore Muscat value for their money. We have included breakfast for all companies that sign a corporate rate with us and are providing them with additional benefits such as drop-offs to their local offices in the area, free Wi-Fi, and others. When it comes to international hotel chains branded products, the local market is extremely heavy on upscale and upper upscale properties, which constitute more than 70% of the available rooms inventory. The Ramada Encore by Wyndham is positioned in the upper-midscale categories at an attractive price point for travelers.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in the midterm for the regional hospitality industry?</h4><p>The pandemic brutally ravaged the hospitality sector. In the years to come, new trends will emerge to fill the gap of group travel or conventions that have disappeared. This will mainly come from companies that are reducing their office footprint and will start relying more on convention hotels to conduct quarterly meetings. Some of these businesses will even use the work-from-hotel model to provide a reliable, private office space in lieu of longer rental arrangements. In addition, the work-from-anywhere culture will spur a new type of business travel, where remote working will result in a new source of revenue. Remote employees around the region will increasingly be required to attend company-wide in-person meetings. In some corporations, it will become frequent to address company cohesiveness. On the other hand, a growing segment of travelers are now choosing to take trips closer to home instead of flying. The emphasis will be on safety, sustainability, and profound experiences while getting from point A to B without destroying the climate or the local quality of life in the process. Travelers seek coastal drive-to destinations, as well as wellness and outdoor-oriented rural areas, and cultural experiences within 100 miles of their home. Domestic tourism is not a new concept for the regions, but it will be more relevant in the near future. Finally, the hotel industry has been taking notes from the airline sector's playbook on rebuilding after a pandemic. Services that were once included in the room rate will now be charged on an a la carte basis, especially in economy-scale hotels.</p><h4>How will technology impact the tourism sector and travelers' patterns in the long-term?</h4><p>Since 2020, the tourism industry has started focusing on integrating technology for safety and ease of use, namely by reducing the touch points travelers have to go through while on the road. It started with boarding pass scanning from a device at airports to now checking into a hotel through an app and allowing guests to use their phone RFID signals to open up hotel room doors. Ordering a meal on one's phone after browsing through the hotel room service menu all while staying in the room is now a common thing. The industry's digital advancement is looking even brighter with the latest focus on integrating all travel services onto a single platform where flights, car rentals, and accommodations are all interconnected. With one press of a button, one will be able to change their flight, triggering their car rental reservation to shift and match their new flight details coupled with a change in their accommodation arrival time. This will save the consumer multiple logins or calls to work around changes in their schedules or flight cancellations.</p><h4>How do you expect demand for travelling to evolve in the medium term, and how will that impact your services?</h4><p>People still want to travel, and being locked up at home for a while has given everyone additional reasons to want to break away. Safety and security measures should continue being at the heart of the guest experience so that they feel confident returning to the same property over and over again. With the easing of restrictions and the vaccines rollout, tourism will return slowly but surely. We anticipate a better recovery in 4Q 2021 and much better perspectives for the beginning of 2022.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Financial Academy reacted to the pandemic?</h4><p>There is no doubt that COVID-19 took the world by surprise and changed the way businesses operate today. The Financial Academy is no exception. We had to suddenly alter some of our operations. Prior to the pandemic, all of our programs relied on personal attendance of participants (face-to-face). We changed that afterwards to online platforms. It was challenging, to say the least, particularly to our exams since we have specific criteria for them. We had to postpone the dates for our professional certificate examination until we were allowed to return to office. When we returned, we introduced procedures for social distancing between examinees as a precautionary health measures. For example, before COVID-19, each of our exam halls had a capacity of 40 examinees, that number has now been reduced by half.</p><h4>Tell us about the Financial Academy?</h4><p>The Financial Academy is dated back to 1965 when it began as the "Institute of Banking Training", a training department affiliated to the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA). At the time of its establishment, it aimed at implementing best practices to sharpen technical and administrative skills of banking sector professionals at that time. The institute's operations continued to evolve year after year, and in 1989 its scope was broaden to cover financing in addition to banking under the name on "Institute of Banking" (IoB). With the expansion of the scope of work and the need of the insurance sector for qualified professionals, IoB was rebranded into the Institute of Finance (IoF) in 2014. In 2019, and with the cooperation of SAMA and the Capital Market Authority (CMA), the Financial Academy was established to cover all the financial sub-sectors: (banking, capital market, insurance and financing). The following year we became independent, as per the resolution of the Saudi Council of Ministers. We support our country's 2030 vision by developing the skills of locals who can work in the financial sector, enhancing the sustainability of financial resources and financial discipline, increasing the efficiency of innovative services and solutions, and developing competencies of human cadres in the academy.</p><h4>What are the top priorities on the agenda?</h4><p>We updated our strategy to focus on developing local talent and content that reflects the needs of Saudi's markets. Previously, our aim was to increase partnerships with international schools. The new strategy aims at developing more local Saudi content with special focus on education materials, content of training materials, and case studies. Our intention is to collaborate as much as possible with independent practitioners to deliver training and prepare study materials and examination questions.  We have also changed some of our KPIs. However, our mission has not changed as we continue to set standards for ongoing professional training and qualifying trainers in the financial sector, conduct exams, as well as host regional and international events that enhance the development of best practices of the financial sector. We also will continue to host, organize, and participate in workshops, seminars and conferences related to the financial sector.</p><h4>How does Financial Academy select the independent experts who assist in formulating your training programs and exams?</h4><p>We have two types of collaborations in the Academy: local and international. We collaborate with international parties in areas that local experts do not cover. To better prepare future generations, and since TASI is now among the top ten markets in the world with foreigners having direct access to the market, we believe it is imperative to reflect the expertise of international experts in the academy's training sessions. At the same time, we will have international speakers for some of our workshops wherever needed. We are currently in the final phase of a study that should provide us with a model for choosing the types of experts we want to collaborate with at the Financial Academy. We also have established a new department for online learning to promote online programs. Now that normality has returned after the authorities lifted curfews, we will still need online programs, but not to the extent we see now. People like to have face-to-face interaction. We cannot accurately measure people's needs for online programs because at the moment they are obliged to attend online courses. In the future, when we offer both normal and online courses, we believe the percentage will be 70% for attendance in classrooms and 30% for online programs.</p><h4>What does Financial Academy hope to achieve over the coming year?</h4><p>We expect the Financial Academy to become the first choice for training for any person who wishes to gain knowledge in financial sector in Saudi Arabia. Currently, we are developing our digital infrastructure to convert our training programs and study materials to a digital platform. Each of our professional certificate programs has its own study materials and we aim to convert these materials to electronic versions by the end of this year. Due to the shortage of local content, our first priority is to develop more local material, because in the past we collaborated only with international schools. We are now developing our own local content. The next step would be to evaluate which materials need to be converted into electronic versions.  The Financial Academy signed a MoU recently with the Saudi Electronic University, among its many MoUs signed with government entities. Our collaboration with the Saudi Electronic University assists us in converting our materials into digital content.</p><h4>Do the course offerings need to change in some way?</h4><p>The Financial Academy's training programs cover all areas and needs of the financial sector, not just regulatory topics. We also cover any new aspect in financial markets. We have the framework, competencies, and mechanisms to cover the entire sector and this allows us to predict the needs of the financial market in the next three to four years. In our aim to achieve efficiency, we ensured to develop our framework working closely with experts and consultation groups. Furthermore, representatives from various entities of the financial sector have participated in our workshops to identify the needs and competencies required by the sector over the next few years.  Our programs should fill the gaps in terms of what the sector needs. In addition, in October 2020, we set up four “Trainathon" workshops with segments of the financial sector to identify their specific needs and challenges, and the capabilities required for Saudis to get jobs in the financial sector. We work as a partner with the financial sector and we support the Saudi Vision 2030 by communicating effectively with specialists in the financial sector to identify the industry's current and future needs.</p><h4>Vision 2030 has an ambitious reform agenda, including many KPIs around the finance sector. How does Financial Academy fit into this broader agenda of reform and growth for the Kingdom's financial sector?</h4><p>The Financial Academy is one of the initiatives of the Financial Sector Development Program of (Saudi Vision 2030). Its main goal is developing and enhancing the capabilities of human cadres in the sub-sectors of the financial sector: banking, financing, insurance and capital market. To develop the sector, you need to develop the people. You must have experts, knowledge, and training. In collaboration with regulators SAMA and CMA, the Financial Academy has set up standards and qualifications required to work in the financial sector to ensure the efficiency of people working at each level in the sector. This will help organize the financial sector and establish competencies for each job so that regulators can be certain that the people applying for jobs in the sector have the right knowledge for the job. The success of our nation's vision relies on the success of its people, and the Financial Academy plays a vital role in setting the standards for ongoing professional training and qualifying trainers in the financial sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your services evolved since you joined Travel Point, and how do they reflect the needs of travellers?</h4><p>When I joined Travel Point in 2018, we had a presence in the market but needed to move our services to the next level. The company was looking at deploying a B2B portal, so within three months of joining I picked the supplier that could deliver the goods, and we deployed the service. We put our content on the B2B portal and gave it to about 600 small and medium travel companies that currently buy from us. We also digitalized most of our core processes and streamlined the service delivery mechanisms. For us, quality and customer care are extremely important, so I helped bring in that element of international standards to the system. We were the first company to get the ISO9001:2015 and the first to get the PCI certification from the US. The idea was to deliver impeccable services to our customers and, at the same time, upgrade our technology and the skillsets of our employees. COVID-19 caused a great deal of disruption, and we had to realign and restructure to present the services and products in different ways as the trends and customer travel patterns changed. As a result, we had to go back to the drawing board and redesign the products and services. Today, we are talking about a new normal and whatever services models we deployed earlier became defunct, as they were not making sense commercially and operationally. I am optimistic, as things are changing, and vaccines are already being rolled out. Some airlines have already vaccinated all their employees, and IATA is suggesting vaccine passports that store the data for PCR tests and vaccinations.</p><h4>What role does technological innovation play in your mid-term strategy?</h4><p>COVID-19 pushed us to come up with an innovation strategy, and we looked at two things. The first is the technology innovation modifications and process enhancements. The second is about the things we can do for the people in the country and are limited to just moving inside the country. Doing something here is why we came up with “staycations," where locals can stay in places around Oman, and we have been launching such new packages every week. Another opportunity is what we call the “quarantine packages" for those who are restricted from traveling directly to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. We have booked close to 2,000 people so far for such 15-17-day staycations, and this is climbing so it will help fuel our growth in 2Q2021.</p><h4>What are the other major trends in Oman, and how are you incorporating them in your strategy?</h4><p>The changing patterns of travellers, in addition to the fact that the regular flights have been thrown out of the window because of COVID-19, have brought in new trends. The previous trends were predictable but the current trends aren't. When the new more contagious variants of the virus emerged, governments around the world got spooked and shut down their borders again. The only hope is that people are getting vaccinated, and if we also have vaccine passports then it will become easier for everyone to travel. The question is when this will happen. It may take three to five months or more; perhaps vaccine passports might become a reality in early 2022. Until then, the conventional methods of using a face mask, sanitization, and having PCR tests done will suit those who are in dire need of travel or have emergencies. Business travel will not even happen because of the quarantine required in different countries. Governments need to cooperate with each other and come up with mechanisms to allow such travel.</p><h4>What key elements should the government work on to give the tourism industry an extra push?</h4><p>Governments across the world are doing a tremendous job, especially in Oman. The government is extremely supportive of businesses. However, governments have to work with each other in order to have scheduled international departures happening. For us to be effectively moving into at least 50-60% of 2019 levels in terms of revenue, governments have to work together instead of just using bilateral /Bubble agreements. They need to reach out with an understanding about the restrictions that will prevent more infections, but at the same time ease the travel process. There should be government coordination and close work with IATA in order to come up with innovative means and approaches to measure, contain, and control these infections. Also, closer coordination between health authorities, ROP &amp; Ministry of tourism authorities for a swifter /realistic actions on the ground. They also need to ensure that vaccine passports are deployed as soon as possible once base level inoculations are done. They could come up with another approach, where people who travel regularly for business are given the vaccines first. This will allow people to travel without the PCR test requirement for travelling.</p><h4>How do you expect the demand for travel to evolve in the midterm, and how will that impact your services?</h4><p>The demand for travel was better in January compared to February, when it went down by almost 35%. If this uncertainty continues further, there might be a further decline in the revenues of airlines and travel companies. We are not talking quarter to quarter at the moment, but week to week, and this is directly linked to the announcements of governments. We are understanding how tourism organizations could work closely with governments across the world, starting with Oman, deploy their vision in terms of making travel safer for people and also for people to follow the instructions related to COVID-19 protocol. Currently, the quality and timing of data is extremely important and has to be brought to the attention of people. Anyone traveling to another country wants to know the rate of infections, so in our systems we have the travel health index percentage that tells our customers the infection rates and the number of deaths at their destination. We can gauge that in real time and advise them on the destinations to avoid and the ones that are safer. This is one of the unique approaches of Travel Point. You cannot expect governments to babysit their citizens in terms of following COVID-19 health protocols. It is everyone's responsibly. This way, things might improve in the third or fourth quarter of 2021.</p><h4>What are your growth priorities, and what challenges do you expect?</h4><p>Quality over quantity is key now, as we do not have 2019 levels of volumes. The larger companies like us work on bulk volumes, and that is where we have the leverage over the airlines/Hotels in promoting and building critical mass. We have to look at optimizing our costs, services, and yield. The strategy we have laid out for 2Q2021 is to double our yield, even if our volumes have dropped 50-60% compared to previous years. If the yield goes up, we can meet our revenue targets and our cost objectives. Importantly we need to take good care of our employees during these challenging times, all companies have gone through the re-structuring process to mitigate high operational costs. Our owners were generous to keep the company afloat during last year, when most part of the year airports were shut, as they felt it is important to take care of people as they took care of our business in good times.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you walk us through the recent developments at Hempel?</h4><p>2020 was challenging, but was also interesting because we utilized it to look at how we could streamline our operations and run our business in a more efficient and customer centric way. It has also challenged our flexibility as a team because we have been forced to work from home and adopt new technologies.  It definitely changed the way we do business in many ways for the better. We finally entered the new millennium—embracing the technology that has always been in our hands but had never been fully utilized. We have certainly improved our digitalization, placing orders through digital portals and more. All this has contributed to generating a base from which to elevate our business for the next 10-20 years. As a company, we worked on a strategy in 2020 that will lead us to doubling our business in the next five years. It is our Double Impact strategy. 50% will be organic and internal growth, while the other 50% will come through acquisitions in the Middle East and Worldwide.</p><h4>What are the main challenges in the industry right now?</h4><p>In the Middle East, the greatest challenge is reduced government spending. The influx in various economies in the region is not as high as we would like it to be, which is influenced by lower oil prices. We will likely be facing COVID-19 for the next year and a half or even two more years. Traveling and closed borders are certainly challenging other aspects that puts a strain to general operations. Recovery is going to be long and hard since this last year has put a strain on many businesses and their savings.  Right now, and likely for the next year, the lack of bigger projects will be a problem. The Duqm project will be completed toward the end of 2021, and we need to look at what next big project might be coming up next. Oman has an immense advantage compared to the entire Gulf region with its strategic location, and it should leverage on this greatly. Setting up business here is definitely more interesting than setting up a business in the UAE, due to the potential of Oman. Governments should approach the economy like a private enterprise and try to make it as competitive and appealing as possible in order to attract business and investments.  Open market economy and liberalization can be two aspects that can greatly improve the attractiveness of a country. I still feel Oman has taken that road but there are still few roadblocks along its path. All changes need some time.</p><h4>What actions should the government take from a regulatory perspective?</h4><p>The government should implement more open market regulations. The Omanization process has to continue, which can also be done by implementing specialized schools to train the local labor force and help them reach certain levels of technical expertise. This would make them an attractive labor force for employers. I do not believe too much in pushing companies to employ; it has to be balanced between the two. Then, it has to open the country more to foreign investment and allow foreign owners to own land, not just in selected areas. Oman has to grow from medium-sized enterprises to eventually develop larger-sized enterprises. It will not attract multinationals here from one day to the next; business has to grow from here. If the country does not facilitate this or loosen up the labor regulations, it becomes even more challenging.</p><h4>Is the market here competitive?</h4><p>The market is divided into four categories that are extremely competitive. Powder coatings are extremely specific and commoditized. On another perspective you have marine business, where you have few players since it is highly technological and customers are fewer. Oil and gas use fairly high-tech paint with many components that are constantly being updated. Decorative is a simple market that is also highly commoditized. It is extremely price oriented and dynamic and depends on fashion and trends. If we compare it to the other products we are selling in the rest of the region, however, it is not yet very much quality-oriented but predominantly price sensitive. However, it is a growing process, and the demand for quality will grow over time like it did across the region.</p><h4>How do new technologies impact your operations, and how will they help you become more sustainable moving forward?</h4><p>As a group, one of our pillars is sustainability. We are looking to become carbon neutral over the next five years. We are also looking to refresh our fleet to hybrid cars, despite the difficulty in buying them in the Middle East, and will be working with the oil and gas segment to find sustainable solutions for PDO. We are implementing new technologies in order to move away from solvent-based products and into water-based ones. From a marine perspective, we have a silicon-based product used on the bottom of vessels that guarantees lower fuel consumption by 1.2%. As a group our aim is to reduce our carbon emission directly and indirectly by 7.5 million tons. We seek to monitor electricity and wastewater consumption, and we may look into implementing solar panels in some of our offices and factories. Being a Danish company, sustainability is forced on us regardless of whether it is a priority in any country since its part of our DNA. Thus, we want to be an example for the industry, setting some sustainable parameters moving forward. We also want to digitalize our orders more and increase the efficiency of our distribution network.</p><h4>In what direction are you hoping to expand midterm, and how does that fit within your long-term strategy?</h4><p>We are looking to address our ICV position during this year. At present, we are importing material from the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Our goal remains to double our sales locally in each country. In Oman, we will be targeting specific segments where we see scope for growth. In the protective and oil and gas sectors, we have a strong market share that may be difficult to increase. However, in decorative we have a small market share, and this is a key segment where we aim to grow and expand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the most recent developments at Haya Water in the past year?</h4><p>2020 was both a challenging and an interesting year for us. In spite of all the problems, we managed to commission two major projects that we have in Muscat, which are the New Darsait Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) which is worth around OMR32 million, and theAI Amerat Sewage treatment plant worth OMR25 million. It is a state-of-the­ art sewage plant that does not look like a sewage treatment plant but rather like a mall with beautiful buildings. The technology is top notch in terms of odor and appearance. Both treatment plants use Membrane Biological Reactor (MBR) technology, which is considered to be the best applied system in the world in wastewater treatment and results in obtaining a treated effluent of high quality without any pollutants. The plants also incorporate a chemical odor treatment system that minimizes the potential impact of odors on the plant environment. The New Darsait Sewage Treatment Plant will serve the areas of Hamriyah, Ruwi, Bait AI Falaj, Darsait, Coastal Darsait, AI Aynt, Muttrah, and Muscat and will cater to all issues of sewage overflows and non-connectivity issues to properties of the area, and we might expand it further to 50,000cbm and AI Amerat sewage treatment plant currently 18,000cbm and we might expand it further to 37,500cbm based on the pace of development. This was a great achievement in 2020. We also launched the first PPP project in 2020 and, hopefully, by the end of 2021we are going to award this project.</p><h4>What will your role be as the main utility company?</h4><p>To date, Haya Water has been overseeing wastewater systems in Muscat and Regional Governorates (except Dhofar), and PAW "Diam" has been overseeing potable water systems. The merger of the two is a major step that we have been expecting for a long time. Now, we are going to have one entity called Haya Water that will look after both water and wastewater all over Oman except in Dhofar Government. There is also a step where there will be a transfer of assets in terms of ownership from the government t to this entity. I n terms of billing, we had challenges, but this will help us be much more efficient. This will attract more investors in both water and wastewater.</p><h4>How are you working toward international expansion?</h4><p>We like to work with many international organizations in terms of knowledge transfer and importing technologies into the country that could suit our country and provide the best, efficient technology in desalination or wastewater treatment. Currently, we work with many organizations and import technologies from China, Japan, Germany, and more to build our own asset; however, we are also looking to work with foreign investors when it comes to constructing sewage treatment plants. They will execute it via the PPP model, and after some 25 years they will transfer it to us.</p><h4>What new technologies are you implementing in order to increase the quality of wastewater services?</h4><p>Oman has some of the strictest standards worldwide in terms of wastewater treatment-These standards call for tertiary treatment by using membrane and UF technologies, but we are also working with research centers to develop in-house technologies. We established our own team for R&amp;D. In 2017; for example, we managed to test the sand filters, which typically do not meet the right standards, and repair them. This technology will reduce the cost of treatment in the future.</p><h4>Is the current regulatory environment welcoming toward SMEs?</h4><p>We do not have to wait for the regulator to help SMEs, as it is part of our standards at Haya Water. We spent OMR4 million in 2020 on small companies to do projects with us and have a system for registering SMEs and helping them. We provide them training where we bring them here and give them a framework to work with. Now, for example, house connections can only be done by SMEs. In 2021, we have pledged to give 10,000 connections, most of them only for SMEs. We have around 28 SMEs who only do house connections. We hope they will grow further, align more together, and become better companies that can participate in bigger projects.</p><h4>What are some of the major trends in Oman that you are incorporating into your strategy?</h4><p>One of the major trends that we are pushing for at Haya Water is the water reuse programs. We produce around 180,000cbm of treated water daily, through sewer systems that serve 1million people. We have to clean the water, bring it back, and allow it to be reused, and this water can have a great impact on the economy if we use it for food security, manufacturing, and so on. We have managed to utilize 50-60% of this water though unfortunately, for the other 40% there are no projects. In order to utilize this water, we initiated the Barka project that supplys water to farms outside of Muscat. We can supply water to around 135 producing farms, and the farmers are pleased with this. We initiated a project in March to work with investors on the basis of shared revenues.  They will come and build the network for these farms from our main trunk line and main pipe and implement a distribution system where they can sell the water  and we share the revenue. We are in the process of signing an MoU with the Omani Food Holding Company, which will develop the farms. Another of our initiatives is using treated water to farm trees that can generate castor oil and/or bio diesel. To this end we signed an agreement with OQ where it will take the water and plant trees. We are currently in the phase of developing the business plan. We are working with international companies that have experience in doing similar work.</p><h4>What are your objectives and growth priorities for the next 12 months?</h4><p>We are currently focusing on the merger program and on increasing our number of customers by connecting at least 10,000 properties in Muscat. We are also focusing on efficiency to reduce our operating costs to become more commercial. One important project is the conversion of waste to energy, done together with be'ah and Majis, which I call “waste to value". We used to convert sludge to compost, but now we convert it to power. This way, we can be self-sufficient in terms of power and become a green organization that does not use any fossil oil in its STPs. We estimate we can produce around 12MW of power, and this can cover all our STPs within Muscat.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major developments at the Port of Salalah over the past year?</h4><p>It has been such an unpredictable year. We have to break Port of Salalah into two main segments: general cargo and containers. We are a Hub port, therefore our volumes are driven by what goes on globally. What has happened globally due lockdowns is that consumers have been spending more of their disposable income on things for their homes and less on services and going out. Many of these items go into containers which has driven volumes up in our industry. That has created some congestion around the world, where supply chains were not able to keep up, because at the same time supply chain players were dealing with their own COVID-19 challenges. In Port of Salalah, we handled record volumes in 2020, with 4.3 million TEUs last year. We had a slight disruption in the middle of the year due to some COVID-19 cases within the port and frontline staff stuck in other parts of the world due air transport disruptions, however we recovered fantastically due great teamwork. We managed our volumes in close coordination with our customers to avoid any kind of disruptions which worked very well. What also helped us was that very early on in the pandemic, we established our clear priorities, of which number one was always making sure our people are kept safe. This meant, among other things that we got them the best possible PPE. The second was ensuring that supply chains were not disrupted meaning we needed to continue to operate as much as possible. The third priority was to ensure we run a sustainable business, i.e. that we get paid on time and that we pay our suppliers and staff on time on time too. We were able to protect the business through these guiding principles, and, even though we had a slight drop in capacity in the middle of 2020, at the end of 3Q and 4Q we had a strong recovery and performance which led to an annual volume record. On the general cargo side, dry bulk cargo exports namely gypsum and limestone are our mainstay. COVID-19 related challenges in the importing markets, mostly in the middle of the year meant that we did not achieve our volume targets however recovery in Q4 meant that we came close which was impressive.</p><h4>How significant is having the free zone for the success of the port?</h4><p>Salalah has been successful in the last two decades in trans-shipments, which goes back to the Hub concept. With our commercial strategy going forward, we need to consider more container integration logistics and the integration of logistics in general. This is where the free zone comes into play. We run separate business units, as we are not integrated like in other parts of the world, though that is not holding us back. We are in close coordination with the FZ in terms of how we market Brand Salalah for the future. This is central to our commercial strategy for the future, in which we will promote our overall very strategic locations as opposed to three separate business units, if we include the Airport too when Sea-Air opportunities exist. We need to integrate our services as much as possible in order for us to offer the product that our customer want. We have to replicate much of the success we have had on the transshipment side toward more integrated service offerings to customers. When supply chains have been disrupted over the last year, many customers had issues getting their products from one end of the world to the other. The pandemic taught us that we need to shorten some of those supply chains, and that is where Salalah comes into play. We have world-class infrastructure in the free zone, port, and airport, and we are on the doorstep of massive consumer markets such as South Asia and East Africa so we have the ability to act as a staging area toward some of those key markets. We need to act in unison for this to happen and maximize our potential. Collaboration will take us to a new level regarding that.</p><h4>How important is it to continue investing in modernizing the infrastructure of the port?</h4><p>Businesses the size of ours require continuous investment on all fronts and there definitely are expansion plans, as our business is growing. We are in discussions with the government as well about how we do this together because we are a public-private partnership, where the government is also a shareholder, along with private investors. A big theme that we are embracing a lot more is digital, for example blockchain technology. We are also busy investing significantly in internal digitalization too, by retrofitting many of our assets to make ourselves more efficient — for example equipment is being fitted with all kinds of sensors which ensures the effective running, deployment and maintenance helps us control our costs better. There is also a whole piece on our more customer-facing aspects—including our webpage, issue resolution, and services offered to customers. We have the two pillars—the internal efficiency and the customer part. In general, the ports industry has some catching up to do compared to the rest of the world, and we realize that.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the current state of the maritime in Oman?</h4><p>Oman is already a global hub on an international scale. Salalah is the second-largest hub in the region and around 50th in the world in terms of container volume throughout. We are also the world's leading exporter of Gypsum and therefore we have a strong market position already with excellent market coverage, which would not have happened without strong and clear leadership from the Government of Oman. We need to continue to capitalize heavily on our geographical location and proximity to key markets. We will continue to work closely with the Government who have a clear logistics vision for the future. Diversification of the economy is central to the 2040 Vision, with logistics being a key sector, and we need to make sure we maintain that position and capture more commercial opportunities.</p><h4>What does growth mean for the Port of Salalah?</h4><p>The growth of Port of Salalah means we need to expand beyond the pure transshipment side, although this will always be the backbone of our operation and therefore gives us the launching pad that we need to start new services. As a Hub, we play a vital role for shipping lines in terms of the network coverage, and keeping supply chains fluid which we need to protect as we grow around ever increasing customer demands. Growth for us also means growing our capacity. The vessels in the world are getting bigger, so growth for us means physical growth of the ships we handle and the cranes we operate too. We also need to grow the integrated logistics section of the business, which is linked to growth of Brand Salalah</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most recent highlights across your portfolio?</h4><p>We had to move with the market and rethink how we do things. We have been investing in technologies used in Europe and other parts of the world and brought it to Oman in order for the industry to move to the next step. We are focusing on specialized application based projects where our clients and partners trust our technologies and quality of service. We are working closely with our suppliers and partners and provide customized solutions that clients are looking for in order to tackle the new challenges they have reducing their capital and increasing their asset life. We successfully managed to increase on export sales in 2020 and target to double the value of exports in 2021. Things are slightly slow in Oman, but we have been selling in Egypt, Qatar, the UAE, Bahrain, and Kuwait and much more for the last four to five years and have the ambition to sell everywhere in the world.</p><h4>What are some of the projects that you are currently working on?</h4><p>We are involved in every major project in Oman in one way or another. We supplied and supported clients in prestigious projects in the UAE and Oman and were recently awarded a project that allows us to utilize our technology in gas applications. As a manufacturer, we work with everyone, oil and gas, infrastructure projects, irrigation, landscaping, and telecommunications.</p><h4>What is your current market share, and what competitive advantage do you have?</h4><p>Overall, we are at approximately 40% market share. Our competitive edge comes with our capability to deliver on time with the right quality. Also, providing engineered solutions delivered with quality products and assurances to our clients is what we believe gives us the edge.</p><h4>What is your strategy for growing outside of Oman, and what is your focus?</h4><p>We can provide custom solutions to our customers, and that is where we succeeded. Now, we look at each market in order to understand where we can add value. We did that in the UAE and we expanded our presence there, so now we are doing the same for other parts of the world.</p><h4>What innovative technologies are you employing, and how can these move the whole industry further?</h4><p>End users are looking at how they use plastics in their applications. Sometimes we compete against other technologies that have been in the market first. We are working closely with oil and gas companies to provide them out of the box solutions that can be applied in their fields, as they can also save them large sums of money. We are also providing solutions for telecommunications industries that are lighter, more durable, safer, cheaper, and really quick to install. The final application that we have is drainage and stormwater applications, and we apply our solutions with the highest international standards. The maintenance is less demanding, and these products can last up to 50 years, compared to other materials that need to be maintained or replaced in five to 10 years.</p><h4>What are your short-term objectives for the next 12 months?</h4><p>Our main goal is to return to our pre-pandemic 2018 levels. The second focus is expanding the exports. The third focus is to grow our market share and rebound in the markets that were reduced if any due to volatility we saw in the market in 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does digital transformation mean for MEEZA, and how will the concept evolve after COVID-19?</h4><p>Digital transformation to us means a combination of technology, governance, and human capital. Technology is probably the easiest to tackle. However, when it comes to governance, this means user-related processes that have to adjust to keep up with the advancement of technology. These are generally intertwined with corporate cultures, and it is usually hard to change corporate culture, especially when trying to keep up with the rapid pace of digital transformation. However, some of the main challenges have been access to the skillset, knowhow, and the hefty budget requirements that are part of any digital transformation journey. This is where MEEZA offers an advantage to many of our clients, updating their skills set and making sure their staff can keep up with these new systems, especially now with more specialized technology like AI, blockchain, and robotic process automation. With the advent of COVID-19, digital transformation has suddenly become a must have, must do overnight. MEEZA is able to lead and offer this complex web of digital transformation dependencies in the form of a monthly rendered service to our clients. We not only accelerate our clients' migration toward that digital future but also the country's own digital agenda.</p><h4>What solutions and services will experience the largest demand growth in the medium term in Qatar and for what reasons?</h4><p>In the short term, jumping onto quick conferencing and collaboration tools is something that every business and entity in Qatar needed. However, in the medium to long term, we expect a maturity in the offerings of collaboration conferencing digital facilities, with a greater focus on the security of these services, namely how to encrypt and store all the communication being shared and collaborated upon. How can businesses mine all the data being exchanged so they can transform data into information and then information into business intelligence or governance intelligence. That is where the mid to longterm growth will be: in data analytics and the security of all the data being digitally exchanged.</p><h4>How will MEEZA's fourth data center in Doha impact Qatar?</h4><p>In general, Qatar has been experiencing a drastic migration toward digital services in the last four to five years, and this has been accelerated with the arrival of Tier 1 hyperscalers in Qatar. Before, we were talking about front office-type cloud applications and some minimal cloud collaboration tools. Now, with the arrival of hyperscalers, we are talking about complex analytics tools and data platforms that are served right here in Qatar from our public cloud. This is partially one of the reasons why MEEZA is building and continuing to build more leading data centers in the country. The same demand here in Qatar can be witnessed throughout the world, whereby hyperscalers continue to rely on companies such as MEEZA to build and operate their infrastructure so they can deliver more smart cloud computing services faster to their clients. This becomes evenmore evident when we discuss the fourth industrial revolution services such as the Internet of Things, AI, 5G, and so on.</p><h4>How does MEEZA collaborate with key players in every sector to offer industryspecific solutions in Qatar?</h4><p>MEEZA continues to build a leading ecosystem of market players to help them verticalize their offerings. This means MEEZA has been able to deliver digital and smart solutions into industries such as education and healthcare, tapping into the reach and global knowhow of Tier 1 partners. This maps directly to Qatar's National Vision 2030 whereby education and healthcare continue to play an important part of the agenda. In addition to economic growth, pioneering IT service providers like MEEZA accelerate the government's objective of digitally industrializing society and the different industries within the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the company's main activities in the past year?</h4><p>The Future is unpredictable  and none of us could have predicted the new normal that we would be living through. 2020 was an unprecedented year  and it was challenging on various aspects due to COVID-19. Keeping our goals  and objectives in mind, we worked on overcoming the challenges by revisiting our strategy, identifying the potential issues and developed an action plan. We adjusted our business processes to reduce the risk of staff exposure and mitigate possible effects. Our focus was to continue the success of our existing brands  and increase our market share. As technology and digitalization was at the fore  and customer remained the focus we introduced the E-commerce as a point of sale vs the traditional method. We also introduced new brands  and entered into new partnerships which would not only diversify our revenue but align with the nation's objectives of Vision 2040.</p><h4>Which products and brands did you decide to bring to Oman?</h4><p>Staying ahead of the competition and being able to differentiate ourselves in a challenging market is the key to success as we see changes in the consumer landscape. The Group is working on major expansion plans which are drawn by studying the business environment. Our business model has evolved to the rapidly changing business environment  and in line with Oman's Vision 2040. Whilst deciding on the products and brands, the first  and foremost we look at is the quality  and value that we provide to the customer as we are looking at establishing long-term relationships with our customers. We need to think beyond  and venture into sectors that will continue to lead in the future. Considering this, in the automotive sector, there will soon be a shift to electric cars. We leveraged this opportunity  and have started with stations for electric cars. Likewise, sustainable energy is the future of tomorrow as we look to conserve  and protect our environment  and it's one of the key objectives of Vision 2040. We aim to be the pioneers in providing the green and sustainable solutions  and are working on solar panels project to expand our portfolio. We also see immense potential in Healthcare  and Technology sector and are working on diversifying in these sectors.</p><h4>Where do you see your portfolio diversifying?</h4><p>Oman's vision for the future is Diversification into sectors which show a lot of potential and growth. The consumer market in Oman is growing  and so is the infrastructure  and logistics network. The sectors which show promise are Logistics, Technology, Infrastructure  and Renewable Energy. We have already diversified into the logistics sector  and continuing work on our digital transformation strategy to bring innovative products in the technology sector. Green investments are the future. With increased focus on conservation of natural resources  and preservation of the environment, the focus is trending towards this and we are actively pursuing the solar panel project.</p><h4>What steps need to be taken to prepare students in Oman for these evolving demands of the job market?</h4><p>Youth are the future of any nation. They are the ones who shape it. We have to prepare our students for the changing global workforce. Omani youth do have a lot of potential  and we have seen so many young Omanis scaling the heights of success. What's imperative for the youth  and their development is education, training  and mentorship. Training will boost their interpersonal, technical and critical thinking skills. They also need to be empowered with the right knowledge and vocational skills to tackle the growth of automation. We need to provide more innovative learning opportunities for all students. The youth can achieve their goals with determination  and perseverance. They have to break the boundaries  and work with enthusiasm and passion. They have to embrace new challenges, dig deep in order to emerge victorious. Students need to be able to think critically, solve problems creatively, and innovate in order to take on the problems and jobs of tomorrow. What is also interesting is due to COVID-19 and recent IT advances, the students have new and widely accessible ways to access education around the world and train themselves on different courses which can enhance their knowledge and skills.</p><h4>What can be done in order to see more women in executive roles?</h4><p>Today's women play an active role in society, culture, and business. Omani women have carved a niche for themselves across all sectors. Women in Oman have been given the platform to grow and fulfill their career aspirations as they are considered a pillar of development. It's commendable that we have Omani women at the helm of key positions and they are contributing to the growth and development of the nation. However, to further promote their growth, it's important to provide them with a suitable environment in order to participate in various aspects of economic and social development. They need to come out of their comfort zone, challenge themselves  and be willing to take risks in order to grow continuously. Promoting women's education, training, mentorship and professional development will also pave the way for more women to be in executive roles. I believe that sky is the limit for women and there are no barriers to their success if they pursue their path with determination and believe in themselves.</p><h4>How are you incorporating the priorities of Oman's 10th five-year development plan in your long-term strategy?</h4><p>The Oman Budget for 2021, together with the 10th Five Year Development Plan, represents a focused approach to tackle the challenges faced by the economy. Our long-term strategy  and focus is to diversify our revenue beyond niche sectors  and leverage the opportunities that will arise in the process of further development of Oman. Diversifying will take the business into new territories and help build a bigger reach, but the focus will always remain on delivering value to our customers by providing them with quality products and services from world-renowned brands. Our long-term strategy not only includes diversification of business locally and internationally, but we are committed to the development of Omani youth too which is a national priority. Omanization is a key focus area for the company. We aim to inspire the young Omani generation to surge ahead in their careers  and extend opportunities to them to enhance their skills.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for the coming year, and what challenges do you expect?</h4><p>Our main objective is to grow our business, strengthen relations with our business partners, explore new business opportunities and expand our presence across Oman. We are looking at joint ventures with organizations that can add value and contribute to the growth of Oman. Sustainable growth, increased productivity of people and resources, staying ahead of the competition, innovation are objectives which we are constantly working at. Challenges are not uncommon to any organization. We face range of challenges on a day to day basis  and we embrace them  and find solutions  and also see them as opportunities. A major challenge which is really daunting around the world is COVID-19 as the situation around the pandemic takes a different turn every day. The need of the hour is innovation, agility and resilience. We remain focused on the bigger picture  and our aim is to keep striding ahead. With dedication, focus, and perseverance, I am confident we can accomplish all our business goals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abora, which was founded in 2017, focuses on manufacturing hybrid solar panels. What are the main differences between hybrid and conventional photovoltaic solar panels?</h4><p>It is important to distinguish between solar photovoltaic energy, which generates electricity, and thermal energy, which heats water. A hybrid panel generates four to five times more energy than a photovoltaic panel. Therefore, Abora's aim is to create the most cost-effective solar panel on the market. In order to achieve this, we must improve our performance and reduce costs. To date, renewable energies have been installed on account of legal obligation to comply with regulations, or because of subsidies. However, it is crucial to put aside any kind of external support we may receive and focus on a self-sustainable project. This is the most profitable technology, and, therefore, is affordable.</p><h4>What type of customers can benefit from Abora's projects?</h4><p>Hybrid panels are positioned on top of buildings that consume hot water and electricity, for instance hotels, hospitals, nursing homes, swimming pools, and industrial complexes, among others. Hence, every building that consumes both electricity and hot water can benefit from installing hybrid panels by Abora, since it can benefit from solar energy and an effective cost reduction. For example, in 2008, a photovoltaic panel cost EUR4.50 per watt peak, but this is now EUR0.50 per watt peak. Therefore, it was not cost-effective to start a photovoltaic business, unless it was large-scale, and because of that, all factories were relocated overseas. Instead of reducing the price by relocating factories, Abora intends to improve performance to obtain a greater benefit and create jobs in Spain. Thus, our production line will never be relocated outside Spain.</p><h4>How is Abora doing in terms of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals?</h4><p>Abora forms part of the 2030 Agenda from the beginning. Europe wants to decarbonize its economy by 2050, and many projects will therefore be implemented over the course of this decade. These projects will then be replicated in order to achieve that objective. Therefore, it is extremely important to create a partnership with Solar Heat Europe, where all decisions will be made. In 2020, we were given a subsidy in order to develop our next panel, which is set for release in 2022. One argument that convinced the European Commission was the fact that with hybrid panels, we could exploit 89% of the irradiation that we receive. Photovoltaic technology is not able to fully exploit irradiation, which is why we need other technologies. For this reason, we need to make use of hybrid technology.</p><h4>How has Abora's internationalization process evolved?</h4><p>We were finalists in the Caixa Capital Risk Entrepreneur XXI awards, so we travelled to Silicon Valley in 2016. There, we realized we had the technology to break into the US market, but we had to consolidate our industry in our own market first. Hence, we decided to focus on the Spanish market before entering the international market. Later, thanks to Innoenergy, we got a stand at Intersolar in Munich 2018. This gave us higher visibility, and we were able to expand into Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, the UK, Portugal, and Greece, among others. However, we are focused on the French market, because in 2018, we developed a project with a French customer that wanted to invest in Abora. Abora is currently 42% French, with the remainder Spanish. That said, we also formed an agreement in the Netherlands with the manufacturer Solarus. It is now our main distributor both in the Netherlands and South Africa. In exchange, we introduced its production line to the Spanish market. Abora's core business is manufacturing hybrid technology. This sets us apart from other companies and is where we can share our knowledge, especially in terms of panel manufacturing.</p><h4>What projects are you currently developing in Latin America?</h4><p>We are about to close a project in Mexico, which is an excellent country to carry out our activity, due to the amount of solar irradiation it receives. Moreover, there is high demand in the tertiary sector, particularly in tourism and in terms of the factories that export their products to the US. We are also developing projects in French Guiana and Colombia, where we have been offered some projects, such as hospitals. We are now creating a network of partners across these countries. As well, we have signed projects in Peru related to the hotel and industry sectors. We have an exclusivity agreement in Chile, although we have not started developing projects there yet. In Chile, there is high demand for our services, especially in the building and mining sectors. We sold 50 panels in Ecuador last year to a partner that works in the single-family house sector, and we have recently received another request.</p><h4>What are Abora's objectives for the year ahead?</h4><p>Abora currently has everything it needs to boost business growth: the technology, funding, and so on. In addition, we have credibility in the market thanks to our loyal customers, such as the Iberostar hotel chain, where we installed our first panels in 2019. Our second installation was in 2020, which consisted of 300 panels in a hotel in Cádiz, and we currently have four projects in our portfolio. Last year, Abora had three people working full time, and we now have 14. Therefore, 2021 is a year of growth, and we expect to keep growing over the next few years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>There are many reasons to look forward to 2021 with increased optimism. For consumers and businesses alike, the vastly accelerated pace of digitization of banking and commerce that has occurred worldwide in 2020 is one of them. The digital service carries the imperative of a highly intuitive, convenient, safe, and se-cure client experience. The business winners and losers of the future will be differentiated on this point.</p><p>So far in 2020, five of six of Commercial Bank's clients have increased their usage of digital channels. A key question is the extent to which this COVID-19-acceler-ated change is temporary, or whether expectations for convenience, ease of use and safety have been met, driving more permanent changes. The answer: seven out of 10 of Commercial Bank clients expect to use physical channels less in the future.</p><p>This trend reflects a commitment where providing exceptional customer experience is key to the bank—the customer is at the heart of Commercial Bank's strategy. Delivering on this objective requires focus and sustained effort: embedding the orientation in the bank's DNA takes time to instill and certainly cannot be instantaneously created in a crisis. Living up to our belief that “everything is possible," Commercial Bank has focused relentlessly on delivering its five-year strategic plan to build momentum for a new phase of sustainable growth. The foundation of our ambition to be the best bank in Qatar and the Qatari bank of choice is the five C's of Commercial Bank: corporate earnings quality, client experience, creativity and innovation, culture, and compliance.</p><p>The entire bank's agenda revolves around ensuring an excellent journey for its customers, as well as investing in innovation and cutting-edge technologies to enhance this experience even further. With the right, highly agile operating model, delivering a great customer experience is fundamental to competitiveness and to shareholder outcomes, rather than undermining returns. For this reason, Commercial Bank has invested in its innovation capabilities, its teams, and culture and will continue to do so.</p><p>A positive banking experience is based on what clients themselves see as important and embed within their lives. Accordingly, we measure the adoption of products and services and fine-tune them in ways that meet our customers' expectations and fulfill their aspirations. This however is not sufficient. Building strong relationships and proactively engaging clients via multiple channels is key—listening is an essential component in optimizing experience. Acting on this feedback has enabled a frictionless customer experience: we have equipped our mobile application with face recognition and fingerprint biometric options and have enabled the adoption of Swift Global Payments Innovation (SWIFT gpi), a new standard for cross-border payments, paving the way for fast, safe, and traceable high value international money transfers.</p><p>Customer experience is also dynamic. In recent crises, banks and financial institutions were widely regarded as a main contributor to these crises. In 2020, banks have instead proven to be major solution providers. At the height of COVID-19, when people were required to stay at home and abide by governmental restrictions, the right customer experience became crucial for the sustainability and continuity of economies facing into the global pandemic. This required a scalable, digital experience primarily based on ease of use and transparency, and most importantly delivering support for customers in distress, or those unfamiliar with the digital banking world.</p><p>In response to COVID-19, Commercial Bank worked quickly to enable customers across all social categories to bank safely, simply, securely, and efficiently under pandemic conditions. Our foundation-al Five-Cs and principles enabled us to organize around these imperatives and adapt swiftly under pandemic conditions, as exemplified by our direct response to the needs of the nation in devising a set of first-of-its-kind services for Qatar in just three weeks. We have launched CB Household PayCard, an innovation that allows customers to manage their house-hold workers' salaries and remittances and lets workers transact and shop safely; CB Smart Payroll that helps our business customers manage their employees' pay-roll and remittances online without the need of involving the employees; CB Pay, the first mobile wallet in Qatar that lets customers tap and pay with their mobile phones; and more.</p><p>In 2021, we anticipate clients and financial institutions will continue to need to be both highly resilient and agile, including in responding to global economic uncertainties and to capture new opportunities. Commercial Bank will continue to work with clients in helping them with aspects that add value to them personally and to their businesses by deploying more efficient operating models that leading-edge digital banking can enable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Es'hailSat has been working for more than 10 years already that have been marked by Qatar's steady growth despite external instabilities. As Chairperson of the company, how would you classify this evolution?</h4><p>Es'hailSat was established in 2010 by ictQATAR as an independent operating company to manage and develop Qatar's presence in space. We knew then that the Es'hailSat program would play an important role as Qatar worked towards meeting the rapidly growing communications needs in the region.  With the spotlight on Qatar and the region, we anticipated that our broadcast independence will be of high value for the region, and that Es'hailSat had a huge potential to become a leader in the satellite industry in the Gulf region. Our successes over the past 10+years have vindicated our decision to establish the company. We have been able to operate and support our customers to continue transmitting news and sports channels uninterrupted even during the multiple illegal blockades and other challenges faced by Qatar and Qatari companies. Since the establishment of Es'hailSat, we launched two satellites, which are operating at a high utilization rate, and established our own state of the art Teleport in Doha, from where we monitor and control our satellites and provide services to customers. We have also moved from being a pure satellite capacity provider to a service provider. We started with a focus to operate within the MENA region, and with over 10 years of experience, technical know-how and expertise, we are now looking beyond MENA region and go global as with our aim to be a global satellite operator. I see this a natural evolution for a company like ours, to start small and stay focused, establish ourselves as a reliable partner to stakeholders and customers, be profitable and have a firm footing before we embark on our expansion plans.</p><h4>Qatar has become a hub in the region for news services and the country is becoming increasingly specialized in the sports industry. Which opportunities does this offer to Es'hailSat to keep its development and strengthen its position as a satellite operator in the region?</h4><p>The primary reason to set up Es'hailSat as an independent company was to provide advanced satellite services to strategic stakeholders and commercial customers who valued broadcasting and communications independence, quality service and wide geographical coverage. Our anchor customer for broadcasting when we started operating Es'hail-1, was Al Jazeera Networks. Supporting an independent news network was important for us, as Qatar was and is an important news hub in the region. As Al Jazeera expanded into sports broadcasting with beIN, we were again there to support their growth in the region. beIN now has become a major sports rights holder and have also added movies and entertainment channels to their bouquet of channels.  <br>One of the key aspect broadcasters look for is the security of their content and at Es'hailSat we consider this an extremely important element when provisioning services to broadcasters. We have anti-jamming capabilities built into our satellites, geolocation systems to identify and help overcome any intentional or unintentional interference, and a highly secure Teleport facility. In addition, we actively participate in the regional anti-piracy coalition to address and mitigate all forms of content piracy. <br>In the long-term, satellites will remain the main means of content distribution, especially live news, and sports content, due to its ubiquitous nature and having a wide coverage. With the initiatives we are taking to provide secure services, and investment we are making in satellite assets and teleport infrastructure we are ideally positioned to support the regional broadcasters with their expansion plans, provide best in class service and strengthen our position as the premier satellite operator in the region.</p><h4>Es'hailSat has partnered with the Doha-based international telecommunications company to offer Inmarsat L-band satellite voice and data services. What will be the impact of the implementation of this technology for doing business in the country?</h4><p>Businesses and enterprises depend on reliable communications for mission critical and business critical services. In our region this is especially true given the nature of landscape and terrain, and how important the oil &amp; gas industry is for Qatar and for the world in general. Vastness of the area, combined with the sparsely populated pockets, with harsh conditions makes reliable communication in general extremely critical. Implementing and maintaining terrestrial communications infrastructure can be challenging and, in some cases, economically unfeasible, hence satellite communications complements the terrestrial networks in enabling and managing the communications networks in remote regions and offshore. Qatar has always embraced and has been one of the early adopters of the latest and most innovative technologies. The use of advanced technologies for e-commerce and smart cities are developing and growing rapidly. And with Qatar growing at a steady pace and with increasing population, the need for reliable and secure communication becomes extremely important. We noticed that there was a strong demand for voice and data services on the move and mobility services in Qatar and the region. Working with key strategic partners is an example of how Es'hailSat is delivering integrated and innovative solutions to meet the demands of enterprises in the market.</p><h4>As one of the most prominent figures in Qatar's technological landscape, what would beyour assessment of Qatar's digitalization levels and what would be the priorities for the country in the short term?</h4><p>Over the years Qatar's government has implemented several initiatives to spur the growth of the ICT sector, with major infrastructure projects such as the International Airport, Doha Port, Lusail City, and FIFA 2022 projects accelerating the growth of the sector. These projects enabled the implementation of smart technologies for e-records management and bio-metric systems at the airport, vessel management and operating systems at the port, smart stadiums, and athlete management for FIFA 2022, to name a few. There had been wide acceptance of e-commerce in Qatar and digital transformation has been happening for some time now, and it is growing at a faster rate due to COVID-19 pandemic. There has been a definite uptake in social interactions in terms of online and mobile transactions for food delivery, education, and retail services. In addition to the established e-services and digital platforms like Hukoomi, Metrash, and others, new digital services were needed to support remote workforce and reduce in person interactions as much as possible. In smart cities, having an integrated communication network is important to connect people, machines, transportation, infrastructure, logistics, security, etc. Smart City projects such as Msheireb and Lusail feature digital projects that encompasses building and facility management system, safety and security systems, autonomous vehicles and fleet management, and traffic management system. Digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Qatar (TASMU), drives these smart cities, providing sustainable economic development, and improves quality of life and public service delivery. Qatar has been on the forefront of digitalization drive, and I see this continuing for the foreseeable future. There is a clear convergence taking place between the IT and communications sectors, and with services like Internet of Things (IoT), Machine to Machine (M2M), machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI), people and things are becoming even more connected. With these developments, priority will be given to cybersecurity, cloud security and privacy of data and people. These needs to be prioritized and managed well as work and life move ever closer to online and digital domains.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What visions and goals did you have in mind when you established Geidea?</h4><p>When we began operating as a payments company in 2012, we aimed to enable banks with the technology to provide merchants with the best service for payment acceptance channels. Over time and with advancements in technology, our main goals shifted towards reducing the cash society, and providing the best service and lifestyles for the economy, in line with Vision 2030. We want to equip merchants with the best products for consumers with regards to payments and always employ the latest global technology. We provide SMEs with the suitable acceptance payment tool and value-added services (VAS), such as lending, tools for inventory, and loyalty-based reward systems. Our main goal is to provide SMEs with the best acceptance channels &amp; VAS to facilitate and grow their businesses. We are proud to be one of the only fully privately owned companies that has been officially licensed by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA).</p><h4>How will the granting of this license impact Geidea's international ambitions?</h4><p>Our main objective right now is to participate in Vision 2030. Previously, we were enabling our partners, or banks, to work with our technology, but now we can offer it directly to the market. In 2019 we began work in the UAE, with plans to expand into Egypt in 2020, and further expansion into Southeast Asia and Africa in 2021. Our main objective is to standardise our products and services to make it easier, faster and more affordable  for clients in the region to adopt new technologies . Geidea has two main arms: Geidea Banking Business (GBB) and Geidea Merchant Business (GMB). As GMB is new, one of the main reasons in securing the license was to provide SMEs directly with our products. With GBB, we provide banks with multi-solution tools that can be delivered to SMEs and created huge infrastructure through GMB. We are drawing in talent, creating this ecosystem, and integrating huge infrastructure within the existing infrastructure in Saudi Arabia in terms of payments and the Central Bank.</p><h4>How do you develop a workforce of next-generation leaders when it comes to innovation?</h4><p>Although fintech has not fully matured in the GCC and the Middle East, Geidea is privileged to have  been the only fintech to be granted a license from SAMA due to the innovations delivered from the latest technology from across the world. Our commitment to innovation has attracted some of the best and experienced talent within this space, both locally and internationally. We are also organizing succession planning to enable local Saudis to take up lead roles in the company, supported by the transfer of knowledge from the top leaders to those progressing to the next level.</p><h4>What is the role of fintech in transforming a society?</h4><p>Fintech exists on a global scale to close gaps or solve a problem that has not yet been solved. It is for this reason that each region has special fintech products tailored to their related markets. In Saudi Arabia, we studied the issue closely and used our expertise to identify exactly what are the specific needs and wants of both merchants and consumers. We designed our product using this perspective as a starting point and delivered the best front-end product to cover the gap in the market. The Saudi Vision 2030 focuses on economically supporting SMEs and creating an ecosystem for them. At Geidea, we want to enable SMEs to grow into larger merchants that can play greater roles in the private sector. For this reason, we have invested heavily in products and services that encourage SMEs involvement. Cash still accounts for approximately 78% of transactions in Saudi Arabia, so the opportunity for growth in digital banking amongst SMEs is huge. Our main strategy understands and meets the SME community objectives to help grow their businesses. We do this by creating tailored solutions for their segment, offering a complete value chain, which is combined with the simple and human experience. The agility provided by our services and products enables SMEs to focus their energy on growing their core business.</p><h4>What channels do you use to get SMEs interested in your services and products?</h4><p>In line with Geidea's ambition to support the growth of SMEs within the private sector, Geidea has implemented a digital marketing and content strategy to drive engagement and acquisition within the SME community. To support the digital nature of Geidea's products and services, Geidea has focused on enhancing the digital experience of its customers and potential new customers. This includes digital onboarding and digital marketing through social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, and website content.  In order to drive merchant interest in our technology, the Geidea team attends merchant events where we network with the SME community to further understand their needs and to show them how our products and services can support their business growth. Geidea also produces thought leadership pieces that are distributed in the most technologically up-to-date print and online publications with a strong regional SME readership.</p><h4>How are innovation and market maturity aligned in Saudi Arabia's fintech industry?</h4><p>With Vision 2030, there are huge changes happening quickly, and ensuring integration with the Central Bank is extremely important. Innovation is not the difficult part if the regulation is not yet ready. You could have the most innovative product on the market, but unless the regulation is aligned, you won't get very far. We are always ahead in terms of providing technology, and our goal is to enable merchants to grow and provide them with the best lifestyle from a consumer perspective.</p><h4>What do you expect for the sector within the next three to five years, and how do you position Geidea in this space?</h4><p>I predict the future of merchant banking will transform within the next few years as Saudi Arabia increasingly moves towards a cashless society in line with Saudi Vision 2030. I also expect to see huge changes in the behaviour of banks and their product offers as they continue to recognise the benefits of digital banking- I predict that cash use will fall by 30-40% in the years to come. Geidea's products and services are poised to serve its clients by supporting their transition towards ecommerce and digital banking, ensuring their businesses come out on top in the coming years. Within this environment, I see Geidea becoming the number one fintech player for merchant services in the MENA region by 2022 as we actively contribute to the growth of SMEs within the Saudi economy and the broader market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ING has been leading the sector in Spain for 22 years, standing out as the first digital bank. Can you elaborate on ING's evolution in Spain?</h4><p>ING launched in Spain with its Cuenta Naranja, or Orange Account. Our mission was to make the difficult easy and make it possible to receive payments from one's very first euro without the need to switch banks. We have evolved, but we have continued to maintain that close relationship with our customers. Our evolution has been from telephone banking with a single product to today, where we offer a comprehensive service to cover all our customers' needs. Our purpose is to “empower people to stay a step ahead.“ In short, we aim to help and encourage our customers to fulfill their dreams.</p><h4>ING is today the “non-bank bank,“ for so many years being the alternative to traditional banking. How do you maintain freshness and that distinction with respect to traditional banking?</h4><p>The key is to stay focused the customer and their needs. Product creation, transparency, and simplifying processes are all tools that help us achieve this goal. Assisting customers in managing their finances is a distinguishing factor. Between 2016 and 2020, we set the growth of our customer relationships as our goal and sought to become their primary bank. In addition, we personalize customer service. Of our 450 million digital contacts, 25% are personalized, and our target is for this figure to reach 100%. We are always available to help when the customer needs us. Via mobile, sales have increased from 24% to over 50%.</p><h4>98% of your customers are digital and, of those, 40% only use their mobile phones to interact with the bank. How do you see your customer base evolving in terms of digitalization?</h4><p>There are two tendencies here. First, digitalization, where customers are raising the bar and expecting more from us. Currently, what we see as a differentiating trend is customers that solely use their mobile phones for banking. So, we are developing our ability to generate sales via mobile. It is not just about launching an app, but also managing processes, maintaining communication, and so on. Naturally, expectations continue to rise, and we ensure we always work to stay ahead of the curve.</p><h4>Net profit in 2020 reached EUR85 million, which implies a drop of 54%. However, the NPL ratio stands at 1.08%. What is your assessment of 2020, and why do you have such a low NPL ratio?</h4><p>2020 was an unprecedented year. We have observed the resilience of our business model, in that COVID-19 has had a harsher impact on some of our customers. Nevertheless, we managed to maintain our revenues, with just a decrease of 4%, due to the increase of diversified sources of income such as investment, insurance and consumer loans, which in just 4 years have gone from representing 26% of income to the current 44%. We have been able to make provisions as a result of prudence. In terms of individuals and as a digital bank, our customers have not suffered due to the pandemic, given that they have had access to all of our services on a normal basis. We have gained solidity and future projection through sales, closeness with our customers, and the undisrupted way of managing the pandemic. Nevertheless, many people need to work with a digital bank that can meet their needs. Over half of our customers come through recommendations. In 2020, we signed up an historic record of 200,000 new customers.</p><h4>How are you managing your customer acquisition strategy?</h4><p>Simply, we are being transparent with our offer. We have no small print, and recommendation makes a major difference. In terms of NPLs,our first customers were savers with an extremely low-risk profile. In 2008, when I was Chief Risk Officer, we launched pre-approved quotes, which today remain as the standard quotes. We know our customers extremely well, and we have always acted in an entirely risk-conscious manner. Another very important purpose is the financing of our customers.</p><h4>About 4% of ING's customers will start paying fees for their savings in their accounts. What led ING to change this?</h4><p>We have to start by taking a perspective on the sector and its current situation. A large part of our income came from interest rates, which started to drop in 2008. They then dropped to zero and then below. That source of income is therefore diminished. The second thing to note is that the regulator is becoming increasingly demanding. We are employing more resources and greater effort, and this is coupled with competition in banking digitization and increased demands from customers. This means revenues are falling, and costs are rising. Therefore, either we reinvent ourselves, or we are in for a struggle. The banks that will succeed will be those that can achieve closeness to their customers at an efficient price. This is the direction we are taking and in which we are heading. The second challenge is that of bringing about the custom of paying for value-added services. These were free until a few years ago. The key is to maintain absolute transparency with our clients. When we raised the issue of negative interest rates, we came up with a value proposition that minimized its impact. This measure affects 4% of our clients. If a customer has more than EUR30,000 with us and does not cover all their needs with ING products, they may either begin paying a safekeeping fee or choose to take their money elsewhere. Aligned with our transparency, we have advised our customers several times and with enough lead time to ensure this will not come as a surprise.</p><h4>Thanks to its leadership in digital transformation, ING is able to serve 40 million clients with less than 1,400 offices worldwide. What is its strategy in Spain in terms of its branches?</h4><p>In 1999, we did not have any branches as such. Over time, we saw it wiser to offer a small number of them. They were not set up as offices to draw in clients, but to offer comfort. It is also true that there are certain products, such as a mortgage, where it is important to be able to accompany customers, in person, at a branch. The same goes for investment projects. Therefore, although it is not a frequently used channel, it is relevant and offers proximity. Currently, we plan to keep all branches open.</p><h4>What are ING's main priorities for the rest of 2021?</h4><p>Our priorities are to be here for our customers, continue to grow as a bank holding the mobile phone front and center of this growth, and stand for our opportunity in the Spanish market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of the developments in your business in Oman in 2020?</h4><p>Budget has been in this business in Oman for the last 40 years. It has achieved a good amount of goodwill and respect in the market due to our continuous zeal to surpass our customers' expectations. Initially, we started with two locations, but now we have seven locations spread across Oman. In a way, we are moving closer to our customers to serve them better. Training is extremely important, and we have an ongoing program to train our employees and develop them for the next level of leadership. Moreover, as a small gesture to the frontline workers who have selflessly provided services during the pandemic, we have been offering them 50% discounts on our car rental rates. Budget has evolved with time and partnered with online aggregators. We have partnered with MONAK and Ezhire because it is one of the few online players in the market, thus giving our customers a hassle-free and paperless experience. They can upload their IDs, driving licenses, and so forth, and then pick up their car from a particular location without any physical contact. We were one of the first to start operations in Duqm three years ago, as it is considered to grow and become the hub of business in Oman, and now we have a good yield on the business there.</p><h4>What are the main trends impacting the car rental market in Oman?</h4><p>The trends are always changing depending on time and the market situation. During the pandemic, we have witnessed corporations and individuals becoming more rational and forward thinking when it comes to spending their money, mainly due to the uncertainty that looms over us. They are shifting toward short-term rentals because they don't want to commit for longer terms or bound themselves with a contract. That's better for them also because they know their fixed costs and can plan for a couple of months rather than two or three years down the line. Hence, we all have to adapt to the new normal and build our business around that. We are working to develop a couple of products that will be more adaptable to corporates and individuals, considering the uncertainty at the moment.</p><h4>Have you noticed a difference in the kind of clients you are seeing recently?</h4><p>Earlier, corporations were also reluctant in going with leasing options. They thought probably buying the vehicles upfront and selling them after five years was a better option as asset would belong to them. Now, people are more rational and wonder if it's really necessary to block so much of their revenue upfront. Their initial fixed costs or investment are lower if they rent compared to the huge investments of buying cars. They have now understood that leasing is the best business to do and the best option at the moment. When you know your fixed costs, it's easier for you to manage your cash flow. With that, we see more individuals as clients these days; they don't want to shell out a huge amount of money or take on a liability with something like a four-year commitment to a bank with today's market. I see a lot of inflow of individuals coming for short-term rentals. While leasing cars you don't have to worry about the vehicle maintenance, insurance, replacement stress, registrations stress which comes along with when purchasing cars.</p><h4>How would you assess Budget's fleet in Oman in line with all changes surrounding the pandemic?</h4><p>We do have a fleet ranging from small 1.1-liter vehicle to the high-end luxury cars. We had some vehicles specifically for the tourists such as vans, high-end 4WD cars and so on, however we deflated those products so that it wouldn't affect our bottom line. In this way we optimized our fleet so that we can control our cashflow as much as we can and take less damage. We used to have a lot of luxury vehicles and we still have few but customers are becoming more frugal, not opting for high-end luxury cars at the moment. Thus, we are focusing now on the small to medium segment, where the majority of our business comes from, and we are doing well there. We have purchased a lot of vehicles in those segments at the moment to meet the demand.</p><h4>Is sustainability something you are considering for your fleet?</h4><p>Yes. Today, many people are talking about sustainability and eco-friendly or environmentally conscious initiatives that produce less carbon dioxide. In the future, we are open to electric vehicles in our fleet, though we first need to have a proper infrastructure to be in place in Oman. We are eager to have bicycles and are now in talks with some clients that manufacture bicycles so that we could perhaps start a business here to promote or revolutionize some sustainable business. It might not happen very soon though however we can start working towards it.</p><h4>How would you characterize the opportunities in the Omani market?</h4><p>Despite the crisis situation, we have found opportunities. The term “staycation" has become the new normal, as people want to stay in hotels in Oman. They also choose to visit places like Jebel Akhdar, where they will need a 4WD vehicle. Not all families have one, so we have connected with many two-way travel operators and hotels to provide 4WD. Customers can rent one for a few days, or, if they don't want to drive, we can provide them a driver. We have diversified our business to focus on staycations and hotels. Also, when the flights were not operating from Muscat to Duqm, we saw a surge in business in chauffer drives from Muscat to Duqm and Muscat to Salalah also saw a flow of traffic so did Muscat to various PDO sites.</p><h4>Where do you envisage your growth coming from in the coming years?</h4><p>This pandemic is a passing phase, and once the vaccines are rolled out and completed, we will see tourism return to Oman as Oman is a country with natural beauty and has been the top destination spot for tourists from Europe. Khareef season will start in mid-June, and we expect more people to start coming by June and July and we can return to business, expecting to recover what we lost in 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The past year has been difficult for nearly every company. How have you adapted to the pandemic, both internally and externally? </h4><p>When we reflect about 2020, it was indeed a challenging year to the industry, especially while dealing with the unprecedented consequences arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that added extra stress at work and in our personal lives. At the beginning of the pandemic, I told my team that “We are going to manage this crisis better than anyone and we will recover from its effects faster than others and become stronger than before“. We have turned such aspiration into reality making 2020 one of the best years in KSA's history in terms of performance. We closed the year setting HSE positive records and we were able to sustain our business activities through the deployment of a robust business continuity plan and following the guidelines and recommendations of our Crisis Management Team in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, always aligned with the instructions given by the authorities in both countries. We anticipated the challenges and we executed an accurate plan to overcome those effectively. I am proud with the resilience and the solid performance of my team in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to obtain such achievement.<br>During these challenging times, we maintained a continuous engagement with our clients Saudi Aramco, Tatweer and Al-Khafji Joint Operations in our daily operations. The main focus was the safety of our employees followed by excellence in service delivery. During the peak of the pandemic, we ensured close collaboration with our clients for implementing effective measures to ensure business continuity. During the pandemic, we kept fatigue management of our employees at the top of our agenda, especially focusing in our field population who were working in tough and remote conditions. Through effective management, we secured proper accommodation and procured entertainment to our field population for making sure they were taking breaks in Saudi Arabia during the months in which they were not able to travel to their home countries. The solutions we implemented worked very well and resulted in maintaining safe business continuity in our operations while keeping our employees duly rested and motivated. Another factor that we prioritized was to find solutions to promote the good mental well-being of our employees with the implementation of support programs provided by a team of medical experts. In brief, with the implementation of effective management actions, our staff in KSA remained focused to deliver services with efficiency across all our operations, allowing us to outperform in our industry.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has advanced its IKTVA scheme in recent years, leading to something of a restructuring in the sector. You have recently opened a manufacturing facility here as a result. What does this indicate about the future of the oil services sector in the<br>Kingdom, and what other localization plans do you have?</p><p>Our commitment to IKTVA continued with high momentum during 2020. At the beginning of the year, we inaugurated a new manufacturing center in the King Salman Energy Park (SPARK) in which we started producing downhole tools that were previously made in countries located in Asia and North America. We are proud that Schlumberger became the first tenant in SPARK and, also, the first company to produce locally manufactured oilfield tools in the park. As of today, we are already using tools manufactured in SPARK in our local operations and, also, we are developing the potential to start exporting tools from Saudi Arabia. But maybe the most important highlight from the new center is that we are training (in SPARK and in other manufacturing centers abroad) a good number of Saudi Arabian young engineers and technicians who are trained in the local manufacturing processes. This is as a clear demonstration of our commitment to localization and to the goals of the Kingdom's Vision 2030. In addition, we also have a Center of Reliability and Efficiency (CRE) in Dammam Modon 2 Industrial City that plays a critical role in supporting our operations in Saudi Arabia and the neighboring countries. The center hosts hundreds of our local employees that acquire specialized techniques for the maintenance of a broad variety of oilfield tools. The CRE is a state-of-the-art facility in which we give consistent maintenance to ensure reliability of Schlumberger tools that translates into superior reliability while performing services to our customers in many countries. The CRE currently hosts around 1,000 employees and more than 75% of them are Saudi nationals. The pandemic and the associated travel restrictions represented an opportunity for us to expand the responsibilities assigned to some local employees whose commitment and dedication allowed us to sustain our business while the CRE continued operating at full capacity for providing maintenance solutions that became critical to our business continuity.As many other companies and industries, we also experienced an unprecedented challenge for continuing our operations while the country was in lockdown, preventing us from bringing personnel, equipment and materials required for our operations. However, our IKTVA investments paid off during those tough days as we had (i) local staff duly trained ready to engage our operations; (ii) a strong and reliable local supplier base and; (iii) a local maintenance and manufacturing footprint that, combined, allowed us to deploy local resources to support our operations accordingly.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia has pursued a technology first approach in its public policy. Does this extend to the oil and gas sector, and what technologies do you provide here?</h4><p>Saudi Aramco is constantly looking to explore new frontiers, and Schlumberger is strategically positioned to offer new technologies that are tailored to fit Saudi Aramco's objective to explore new challenges and to ensure improved efficiencies in their operations. We will be celebrating this March the 15th anniversary of our carbonate research center in Dharhan. Schlumberger has historically been the undisputed leader in technology research and development in the oilfield industry, and we will continue to lead in this aspect despite the challenges the industry is facing. I am convinced this will remain a key differentiator in our industry in the years to come. In one of our integrated drilling projects, we used a DrillPlan® well construction planning solution combined with DrillOps®, our automation and orchestration well delivery solution, to achieve consistent and faster drilling rates, reducing costs, and capturing contractual performance incentives. In a recent operation, adoption of this technology allowed us to drill 8.5% faster than planned, delivering wells 5.8 days ahead of schedule.</p><h4>What initiatives does Schlumberger have to create a greener tomorrow?</h4><p>Schlumberger's commitment to protecting the environment has been embedded in our corporate culture for many years and we have developed a robust environment, social, and governance (ESG) program. As part of our HSE culture, we are committed to minimize our impact on the environment through pollution prevention, reduction of natural resource consumption and emissions, and the reduction and recycling of waste. In Saudi Arabia, we have lunched different environmental initiatives. To give an example, we have been collaborating with Saudi Aramco in an initiative named “Green Sites“ intended to identify opportunities to reduce the environmental footprint in our field locations. The initiative has produced positive results through the implementation of goals like reducing the consumption of single-use plastics, installing solar power lighting solutions to replace diesel generators, composting organic solid residuals to be transformed into fertilizers that have been donated to public gardens and parks, among others. The success of the composting initiative allowed us to expand its reach as part of our local Social Responsibility Program in which we will be organizing awareness campaigns in some communities to educate local residents about techniques to recycle solid waste and produce their own fertilizers to be used in local farms. At a global scale, we have increased our focus on low impact technologies and Schlumberger has the ambition to secure business growth with a strong focus on sustainability throughout the energy transition. We are committed in decarbonizing our own operational footprint, as well as deploying technologies that help to reduce the oil &amp; gas industry's emissions. Our business offering already includes investments in what we call Schlumberger's New Energy. Schlumberger New Energy explores new avenues of growth by leveraging Schlumberger's intellectual and business capital in emerging new energy markets, with a focus on low-carbon and carbon-neutral energy technologies. Its activities include ventures in the domains of hydrogen, lithium, carbon capture and sequestration, geothermal power and geo-energy for heating and cooling buildings. Last month, it was announced that LafargeHolcim and Schlumberger New Energy will explore the development of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) solutions. The two companies will study the feasibility of capturing carbon from two LafargeHolcim cement plants located in Europe and North America, using Schlumberger's carbon sequestration technologies. Also, back in Jan 2021, Schlumberger New Energy, the CEA and Partners announced the Formation of Genvia a clean Hydrogen Production Technology venture.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you dealt with this new reality, both internally in terms of workflow and externally in terms of your offerings to clients?</h4><p>In terms of business, the first month was particularly challenging , as we did not know how long the situation would continue. We had to find a way to continue our business operations and like many others, change our strategy to cope with the new reality. However, where there are challenges, there are opportunities and there are three areas that we performed and excelled in. One is when the Ministry of Education closed schools, which created two new opportunities for us. The first area is devices. We usually sell around 20,000 devices a year, but due to COVID-19 and the introduction of remote learning for students across the country, we sold more than 80,000 devices in 2020. The second area is support functions. In many of these schools, the teachers, students, and parents had to immediately switch to a fully online schooling system, and they needed to know how to use the new technology for education. We worked with the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Telecommunications and Information to provide training to education institutes, schools, teachers, and students on how to use this technology. We also helped students manage their time and utilize the device, and we helped parents get the best from the device, to monitor the productivity of the student, and so on. These two areas were extremely beneficial in positioning ourselves as a leader in digital transformation, specifically in the education sector. For the non-education sector, we have developed new tools and discovered new partners that help many organizations to grow amid COVID-19, including automatic queuing systems, automatic air purifiers, and air ultraviolet cleaning with robots. These are some of the products we brought to Saudi and sold to many customers. We have increased our resources by a minimum of 20% in the past 12 months. We have doubled our revenue and tripled our net income, so that was a great achievement for us.</p><h4>Did most of that revenue come from sales of services or some of your other products?</h4><p>Currently, Jawraa has three lines of business: hardware, software, and services. With the pandemic, both hardware and consultancy and managed services have increased. Our third business unit is anything related to software, such as licenses, the cloud, systems, or applications. These are things such as Microsoft Edge, 365, Teams, SAS model, or even developing an ERP system. We have seen tremendous growth in Microsoft Edge, Teams, and the SAS services that we sell to our market. All these three business units saw similar growth trajectories in 2020.</p><h4>What is the outlook for the MVNO license that you were awarded in the Kingdom, and how does that fit into your future plans?</h4><p>This goes back to our digital philosophy when we set up the company as a partner in digital transformation. Digital transformation is a mix of three things: IT, telecom, and media. We have been doing a great job enabling the IT infrastructure and IT services with our customers. We have great experience building telecommunication services. We felt the best way of merging these three along with the new media today is not via TV or satellite, but from mobile phones in terms of entertainment, streaming, and how much time one spends just enjoying the streamlines. These are three particular areas that are combining to create a digital journey. Applying for a license is extremely important to connect these three pieces together and build the story.</p><h4>What changes do you see in a strategic or operational sense in the next six to 12 months to adapt to post pandemic era?</h4><p>I believe life will not return to what it was before. There has been a huge activation in terms of digitalization. With going online and COVID-19, we have seen a number of challenges such as the logistics system. We have seen a huge demand on the logistics system, and that has tested the entire country and perhaps the region. There were many formations in Saudi and elsewhere on how to move the logistics system, make it easier to expand or measure, and so on, and we have seen the results. Most of the local unicorns are either in logistics, fintech, or other services related to the post-COVID situation that help life to continue in a much better way.</p><h4>Do you expect the growth in revenue to continue in 2021?</h4><p>As a leader in digital transformation and management, there are a number of areas you need to work on once you hit a new milestone. You need to build a system and an ecosystem that ensures you can perform better than the year before. When we hit that number, the board agreed to invest more in the company to grow the business in 2021 and grow at least 15% YoY. That is why we invested in the MVNO, which will generate large revenues in the coming years. We are going into investments in many applications where we can serve the market, as we see a gap. We are expanding our consultancy services to support other organizations that need to go into digital. We are hiring more resources in the field and in sales to ensure this new milestone of revenue can offer us another step toward growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you summarize the key responsibilities of NIC and the reasons behind its creation? </h4><p>The National Information Center was established in 1979, with the task of implementing an information system project for the Ministry of Interior. The Center provided IT solutions and services to the Ministry sectors and other government agencies, making it one of the largest IT centers in the Middle East. With the establishment of the vision 2030, a need to join the technology race emerged, the strategy by which NIC operates was updated, and in 2019 a royal decree was issued to create the Saudi Data and AI Authority, which the Center is now part of. The authority has three arms; a regulatory arm (the National Data Management Office), an innovation and R&amp;D arm (the National Center for AI), and an operational arm, which is the NIC. As per the new strategy, NIC operates in four pillars; first pillar is the centralization of all government data through The National Data Bank, this strategic direction will increase cost and effort efficiency, and empower intra-government supervision and collaboration. Another byproduct of The Data Bank is the ability to use data and AI in decision support through the second pillar “Estishraf“ (Arabic for foresight). Through Estishraf we have served over 20 government entities through economic and strategic decision support that has resulted in over 40 billion SAR of potential government savings. The third pillar is the centralization of government technology infrastructure through the Government Cloud (G Cloud), whose goal is to allow government entities to shift their focus towards providing their core services without the overhead of building and maintaining technology infrastructure. The fourth pillar serves the need of developing high-quality national platforms. NIC developed and currently operates multiple renowned national platforms such as Absher, Tawakkalna, and Burooq, the video conferencing service used during the Covid-19 crisis. We are currently developing new platforms that will further progress the Kingdom in its quest to digitization.</p><h4>How does your mandate align with the ecosystem of regulators within the Kingdom, and how do you coordinate? </h4><p>NIC is an operational entity, our main goal is to host data and services, in collaboration with the different regulators in the sector. We are working closely with Yesser in matters of standardization and enabling services between government entity, and with SDAIA's National Data Management Office in matters of data standardization and usage policies. So we are always ensuring the highest level of harmony with other entities and compliance to regulation. However, it is worth mentioning the government is moving towards splitting the responsibilities between the regulator and the implementer, for example the Government Secure Network used to be operated by Yesser, but it has moved to NIC to honor this separation of concerns.  </p><h4>How have you used machine learning to sift through government data? </h4><p>Estishraf Program is the analytical arm to NIC, it leverages the cross-sectoral data in the Data Bank to create a 360 view on different topics in order to support government officials in making informed decisions, measure performance, improve efficiency, and understand socioeconomic impact of changes and policy reform. The program employs cutting edge machine learning technology in creating predictive models that answer to the need of the decision maker. In the span of two years, Estishraf has successfully helped multiple government entities coin their business questions and find solutions using data relevant to their respective domains. The cases presented stem from diverse domains such as education, population dynamics, and labor market, as well as complex problems in non-oil revenue generation, spending efficiency optimization, balance of payments evaluation, simulating socioeconomic impact of policy reform, and the performance of certain sectors like tourism. One example is a case of measuring the spending efficiency in higher education by evaluating the outputs of different degree programs and their conformity with the need of the labor market. The scenario also offers a simulation exercise to showcase recommendations to reduce unemployment by tweaking the educational system to better fit the needs of the labor market. Estishraf has contributed to empowering the economy of the Kingdom through multiple approaches. One approach is predicting export opportunities of local content and respective strategic partners using artificial intelligence with numerous inputs such as the Kingdom's competitive advantage and predicted demand. Other approaches include diversifying import countries to reduce singular dependencies especially in products of national security levels of importance, and identifying potential tourism opportunities to further strengthen the Kingdom's religious and economic stance. We are also currently developing the new national Commercial Anti-Concealment Indicator that aims to size the problem of commercial concealment and identify the levers that could be used to reduce it.  </p><h4>How does the pandemic change your position within Saudi drive to digitalize the government?</h4><p>I look at the pandemic as a test of the extent and quality of digitization in our Kingdom. The pandemic has put the entire world on lockdown, hindering economies and raising serious concerns in critical sectors such as health, education, and trade. The government needed to react quickly to different issues. In healthcare, predictive analytics were necessary to estimate the extent of the pandemic and the necessary infrastructure needed to contain it. In trade and food security, accurate consumption data was necessary to study inventory levels and install necessary contingency plans. The government also needed to plan for the safe return of its thousands of citizens abroad after the borders shut down. These critical cases required vast and accurate data and advanced analytical abilities to produce actionable insights. Furthermore, technical issues of large scale emerged, the Ministry of Interior needed to manage curfew for 30 million individuals and the Ministry of Education had to find other means of delivering classes to 5 million students, such problems may seem trivial but arise to tens of technical issues that require reliable infrastructure, trustable data, and capable talent to develop. Building Tawakkalna, the curfew management app, required cross-system data fusions to validate and integrate medical permits, work permits, and other types of permits. The exercise shed the light on critical digital issues across government systems; lack of standardization of data, legacy systems co-existing with newer versions, and the need of digitization of many paper-based transactions. Under the pandemic, strict social distancing measures were put in place, and virtual solutions had to be sought. In NIC we developed Burooq the video-conferencing service at a critical level of security and reliability that fit its purpose and users, shedding the light on yet another important pillar of digitization touched by the pandemic, and paving the way to a fully functional virtual government.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.subscribepage.com/ada-api-hub"></a></h4><h4><br></h4><h4>Which main areas have you identified to continue supporting the unbanked population?</h4><p>We have identified and worked in three different opportunities over the past 15 years. The first is developing models that do not depend on traditional data. We have been extremely successful in bringing innovative credit scores using sociodemographic variables and our household technology. We create unique files using aggregated address data that helps us identify the payments behavior of the family. Our model allows young family members to be scored using their family's credit history. The second area is in initial credit footprint data. The government has large amounts of information on how citizens pay, do, and collect taxes. Bills such as energy or water consumption are the credit payment behavior available for the most of Mexicans, which turns out to be crucial for creating credit history, as it can be used as positive credit behavior and allow them to acquire more financial products in the future. We are offering our assistance to local and federal governments to increase their data quality and report this information to us, where we can make it accessible for financial institutions in the benefit of the person and their credit score and history. The third area is in open finance and data aggregation. With data aggregation, we can access debit information that helps to measure cash flow and have a better understanding of the consumer profile. This represents a new model (sharing credentials) in México, but is common in the US and Europe. Fintechs are already using data aggregation to paint a more complete picture of consumers. Many of them target people new to credit, who probably only have a debit card for their financial record.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the program Cí­rculo de Crédito is developing with the public sector in Mexico?</h4><p>It is a financial inclusion program, where we have been working with the states and municipalities to report payments on taxes and services to conform credit behavior in a person's credit file. This is important data because it usually is the first footprint of many Mexican consumers. The data is rich, and several aspects can be enriched and inferred about a person; for example: Housing taxes, energy, and water are key to knowing that a consumer's address has been verified, in some of them you can confirm if they are the owners of the house, and even get more information about their lifestyle. For example, through their energy consumption we can infer their socioeconomic status and more. This has turned out to be a difficult endeavor: there are 31 states and more than 2,000 municipalities with autonomy around reporting this data, which poses the main challenge to get the data on all citizens nationwide. We believe this is crucial, as it allows us to create new credit opportunities for those who pay taxes and services, and there is no better place to see the impact of that information than in the credit history file. Once consumers understand the value of having a credit history, credit bureaus become their best friend.</p><h4>How will the digital transformation that banks and other players are going through impact the credit industry?</h4><p>The credit industry in Mexico went from a high concentration of credit in few players targeting the same customer to a much more diversified financial ecosystem. The disruptive models of fintechs such as crowdfunding and digital consumer lending are radically changing how credit is granted. This has pushed our clients to open digital channels in order to continue offering credit. This leads them not only to have a digital onboarding but also reduce digital friction and be alert of fraudulent requests. In order to satisfy the need for digital and the omni-channel requirement, we launched API Hub that contains a sandbox where any developer can have free access to make tests of all our solutions. It reduces time to market and facilitates connections. This is one more reason why more than 95% of fintechs prefer Cí­rculo de Crédito.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you give us a recap of what GDI was up to in 2020, and what some of your biggest achievements were in terms of projects in 2020?</h4><p>2020 was all about adaptability. GDI focused on adapting, and one of our biggest challenges was the disruption of the supply chain for the oil and gas division because of COVID-19. The oil and gas supply chain is interconnected globally, and this was a big challenge we had to address in April-May 2020. This was especially because we completed a project in Serbia to construct a direct pipe river crossing. It was a big challenge to guarantee the safety of all the personnel who were overseas developing the project. We used all the different channels we had available, such as embassies, different airlines, connections, and clients in Europe to make it happen. We completed the project and got all the people and machinery successfully back on Mexican soil. The other major project GDI finished was a hydrocarbons storage facility in Veracruz the largest one in Mexico as of today. The big challenge for us there was having around 2,000 people on one site at the same time when COVID-19 made having people congregate so difficult. We had to manage all the anxiety and uncertainty, and it was five months of extreme, fast, and dynamic learning every day. Just like Darwin used to say, it is not the strongest species that survives, it's the one that adapts faster. Furthermore, the oil and gas industry is one of the industries where digitalization and related technologies were not used at all. We had to learn quickly and ensure that everyone was on the same page at the same time. It was complex, but through daily work, meetings, and actions we were able to establish the necessary procedures to ensure our personnel's safety, the correct flow of the supply chain for the project, and the correct alignment between the port authorities, client, subcontractors, and GDI. The prioritization and correct flow of information became a priority. We completed that project successfully, though it required us to learn how to perform the work in a different and faster way. For example, we had to develop all the sanitation and social distancing procedures, introduce face masks, and identify all the vulnerable personnel while maintaining production level and alignment of subcontractors and clients.Our goal was to create an atmosphere of camaraderie and establishing a clear motto: “In GDI we make it happen“. In hindsight, that achievement was rewarding, but it was also stressful so I would like to thank everyone involved for working daily regardless of the current global context. Those were the major oil and gas sector projects we completed in 2020. In GDI's mining division we completed the development of the Mulatos Mine and we are starting a new mine called La Yaqui Grande.</p><h4>GDI is most well-known for doing construction work in the mining industry, but in 2019/2020 your aim was to focus on diversifying your portfolio. Are you still going ahead with this plan post-pandemic?</h4><p>One definite lesson from before and during the pandemic was the need to have a geographical diversification of the company's activities. We did this successfully. Our project in Serbia was very successful, and the current project we are developing in Nicaragua is also one of the first steps we took down the diversification path. It has been clear to us as a group that develops infrastructure that we also like to verticalize certain aspects of the construction process that are not necessarily construction per se, such as fabrication of certain components that are needed for a plant or certain electro-mechanical works. We created a financial entity called GDI Capital with the goal of identifying specific companies and projects where the company can invest capital. The aim of creating this entity is to diversify some of the operations of the company. A financial company is managed differently from a construction company, but this is one diversification step we took in 2020, and we are moving forward with that goal to identify specific projects and companies that could be helped by our knowledge and capital to foster growth through this pandemic. GDI Capital will function like a venture capital entity and identify projects where money can be invested and returns made as part of the group. The idea is to take advantage of the market right now to put the capital to work in industries that are complementary to our industry. We are currently going through the structuring process for GDI Capital.The idea is to be cautious and conservative while putting some of the capital we have to work in industries that are complementary to ours, but that do not jeopardize the returns we already have at GDI. Mining is one area we have identified as a possible place for some of our capital investment, but also where we can be an active partner in the development of these projects. The aim is to find different partners where we can make a project work because the key is to have complementary projects. We do not want the construction company competing with the financial company. GDI Capital should be up and running by mid-2021.</p><h4>What countries is GDI targeting for diversification in Latin America and globally?</h4><p>Europe is one continent where we really liked to work. The rules are clear for any new company that goes into Europe, and it is easy to do business there. We are currently assessing the opportunity for a project in Ukraine for our mining division. The pandemic has given us a conservative view about what countries will do about the management of their investments in the future. In addition, Colombia is one of the countries where our midstream oil and gas division could have great potential. We see many pipelines that might be needed there. Before being a full EPC for the midstream oil and gas industry, we started as a pipeline contractor in Mexico. We are currently working on green and brown field project opportunities in Colombia. The changes in the North American geopolitical situation are extremely positive for our company. Gas will be the bridge to driving forward the green energy transition we all need and want to happen in the short term. So, I am still positive that there are opportunities in the midstream sector specifically for gas in the US. This is one example of where we should be pursuing opportunities for geographical diversification.</p><h4>What do you envision for the future of the construction industry?</h4><p>I believe the next years will be booming for infrastructure projects. The world has created massive amounts of debt everywhere and, in order to transform such debt into a countries wealth, is important to create infrastructure that will increase productivity in the years to come. Better highways, airports, green energy infrastructure, gas infrastructure, greener data center (today everyone talks about going green but we forget the energy big tech uses is mostly oil and gas). These are the types of things the world needs in order to move towards a better tomorrow and in GDI we are ready to be that agent of change, as I always say, creating successful teams with Clients and suppliers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Grupo Nutresa's main business development ambitions for the short and mid-term future?</h4><p>In 3Q2020, Grupo Nutresa revealed its strategic plan 2020-2030 to the investment community. It is a plan based on the expectations and needs of various interest groups, an in-depth analysis of risks, trends, and global issues, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, the plan centers on identifying those key aspects that the company wants to develop. Our main ambition is to double the company's sales by 2030 by focusing on three key issues: environmental care; innovation and human care; and profitable growth and strengthening our brands. This ambitious goal has a competent and committed team behind it, together with an environment that includes the participation of stakeholders, and that is the result of a multilatina company. However, although Nutresa is founded in Colombia, international sales account for 40% of its total income. In addition, it is an extremely innovative company. In fact, in 2020, 19.6% of its total sales were sales from innovation.</p><h4>What factors explain Nutresa's strong market performance in 2020?</h4><p>In 2020, despite the adverse circumstances, we experienced 11.7% growth. This growth is the result of a combination of organic and inorganic growth. Over the last decade, Grupo Nutresa has experienced 66% organic growth and 33% inorganic growth. In the latter, we are still developing our activity and pursuing new opportunities for improvement. This growth was mainly driven by a proper management of our portfolio. Nutresa has always been committed to understanding the needs of its customers and consumers in order to customize its portfolio according to their priorities. That said, the strengthening of the brand made us more attractive and a first choice for consumers. Last but not least, this development is also due to the many different means of reaching the customer, such as alternative channels, food services and experiences, restaurants, access to traditional channels, retail shops, and so on. To sum up, it was the combination of all these factors, plus innovation, that helped the company to reach its current sales level.</p><h4>In what ways has the company had to adapt due to the pandemic?</h4><p>Nutresa has always focused on enhancing certain key capacities, such as innovation and change management. Taking that into account, we have made a number of advancements and adjustments to our activities. These include implementing new technologies, increasing our adaptability in order to be more flexible and less traditional, and so on. Innovation plays a fundamental role in all this. It is not only about product innovation, but also processes, services, and business model innovation. Our best example of innovation and adaptability to the pandemic is related to our restaurant services. Prior to the lockdown, our restaurant services amounted to 12% of our total sales. However, although sales dramatically dropped due to the lockdown, we were able to take control of the situation, and by April we were back to selling 40% of our products. This is due to our swift reactive response. For example, we created our own call center, those who worked in our restaurants were switched to delivery service, and we boosted our digital channels. We sent the rest of the staff home, while keeping their jobs intact. At Grupo Nutresa, no one was laid off because of the pandemic. In fact, we finished 2020 with more employees than at the beginning of the year, all thanks to the rapid innovation, which helped to propel a steady recovery. Nutresa adapted its portfolio in order to provide the services the consumers needed, especially during the pandemic. For instance, our portfolio now includes personal care products, such as facemasks and hand sanitizer.</p><h4>40% of Nutresa's sales come from outside Colombia. Which strategy made international expansion successful?</h4><p>Nutresa takes a broad approach to internationalization. Internationalization implies having access to FDI and having distribution networks or plants that supplement the ones we currently have in Colombia. In addition, it also implies having access to raw materials in a competitive manner and new technologies that are globally available. Internationalization is not just about exports, but also includes imports. We have followed this approach for many years now, and it has given us extremely solid results. In fact, over the last 20 years, Grupo Nutresa's international sales have experienced an annual growth of between 15% and 16% compared to an annual growth of about 8.5% in Colombia. In 2020, Nutresa's board of directors decided to approve the construction of a new multi-category plant in Santa Marta. This project, known as C3, involves an investment of USD133 million. It will serve different food categories and aims to export 70% of its products and services. We are also working on a project within the Pacific Alliance that would allow the four countries to join forces in order to have access to more developed markets, specifically the US. This would create more jobs and generate taxes in each of these territories.</p><h4>How is commitment to the development Colombia a core component of Nutresa's DNA?</h4><p>The company is governed by a board of directors that believe in its business project and want to generate economic, social, and environmental development to its shareholders and the society. This has allowed the company to initiate projects such as the one in Santa Marta. In 2021, we disclosed the figure of COP430 billion, which will be used for the completion of this plant, so operations are likely to start by 2Q2021. In this case, support from the local government is key. Fortunately, we have received full support from the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Tourism regarding the monitoring of the key aspects of the project in order to facilitate procedures and so that the company can access certain benefits that any national or international client can have access to; however, there are some internal challenges in terms of the development of different activities and the construction of ecosystems around these new plants so that we are able to collaborate with local suppliers, the academy, other business customers, among others. The objective is that companies are profitable while they become key players in regional and national development.</p><h4>What sets Nutresa apart in terms of sustainability, and which campaigns are noteworthy?</h4><p>Sustainability enables us to flourish in a volatile and competitive environment. That is why we are committed to its development and to including it in our strategy. Therefore, it is much more than just a campaign. Last year, we were recognized as the most sustainable food company in the world by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices , and we were presented with the gold medal in the Sustainability Yearbook, powered by Standard &amp; Poor's. The Sustainability Indices include nearly 25 evaluation factors, and Grupo Nutresa was the best in 11 of them. For example, we were leaders in attracting and rewarding talent, social reporting, water-related risks, environmental reporting, and more. Economically speaking, we were the leaders in five areas including matters such as risk management. We were also leaders in information security and cybersecurity, nutrition and healthy lifestyle, and tax strategy, which is related to transparency. Nutresa is extremely proud of these achievements, and it is proof of what Colombian entrepreneurs can achieve.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies did you implement in your business model to adapt to the new economic context?</h4><p>What has been challenging for us is being more efficient, and efficiency is about how we conduct better engineering for our projects in such a way that they are structurally safe and also maximize the resources we use on them. The second part is how the team is being deployed to build our projects and how we manage those teams to not only be more productive but also avoid duplication during the construction process. The third part is adapting our sales strategy to the new reality that has to do with online sales, how we approach a customer via internet platforms, and how we design our processes in such a way that we are able to sell contactless. That is how we have been changing the way we do business for the last six months, and it has worked out well. We sold 20% of all our available units in the last six months. These have been the three main issues facing our company. There are currently two challenges Mexico is facing: its ability to provide certainty and security to investors that want to put money in our country and how it can provide legal protection and confidence to any company in the business environment. If we are able to provide such reassurance to foreign investors, we will be able to attract large amounts of FDI into the country. Two years ago, the government changed, and the message we are sending as a country to our foreign partners is at times not as stable as it should be. As a country that is something that we need to improve.</p><h4>What are the best opportunities for investment in the real estate market at the moment?</h4><p>If we divide the real estate industry into five different asset classes, it is easier for people to understand and invest their money. First, there are industrial assets, and they are mostly used by companies that come here to manufacture their products and use Mexico as a logistics platform to enter the US market. The second is the residential asset, which is what we do, and there are two possibilities: for sale or for rent. The third type of asset is office, which has been hit hard not just because of COVID-19 but also because of the trend of companies using platforms for their teams, resolving issues with suppliers, and so on. The fourth type is retail or commercial assets, and that will also take a large hit because the trend is heading toward e-commerce in the next 10 years. COVID-19 merely accelerated the pace, and retail will struggle, though some areas will still be in good shape because there are some things one just cannot purchase online. The final and fifth asset is a mixed asset, which includes hotels, retirement houses, and beach homes for retirees. Tourism has taken a huge hit around the world because of COVID-19, but that will soon change because people will be more keen to travel after being in their homes for a long period of time. In 2H2021, we will see that asset moving. If one was to invest in one of those assets, it would be residential or industrial. Those are the ones that will always perform well.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2021 when it comes to your business?</h4><p>2021 will be a year of deployment. In 2020, we acquired large plots of land that will help us develop in 2021 and 2022. We will focus on construction and generating 2,500 jobs. In addition, we will develop a foreign market. We have already opened in Houston in the US to develop our residential market there. Texas is an interesting state, so we are deploying investment in the middle house market where rents are around USD2,000-3,000 per month. In 2021, we will construct on the land we acquired in 2020 and develop our residential market in Houston. Houston is a very hot market right now. Tesla just decided to move to Texas because of taxes. Companies are willing to buy and manufacture products from the US and send them back to Mexico and vice versa, so being in Texas gives us that additional dynamic.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have gained a wealth of experience in the private sector before entering politics. What do you believe this means when it comes to governing your state? More generally, what do you bring to the political scene of Oyo State and to its citizens?</h4><p>My private sector background enables me to bring a different perspective to governance in Oyo State. I'll explain this using two examples. First, I recognise that the role of government when it comes to economic growth and job creation. So, I agree with the saying, that the only business government should have in business is to create an enabling environment for private businesses to thrive. We are focused on doing that in Oyo State. This is why we have been seeking partnerships with the private sector for all erstwhile government-owned businesses in the state.  We have been able to extract value from previously moribund businesses like the Pacesetter Quarry and Asphalt Plant, Ijaiye, and the Agbowo Shopping Complex, Ibadan. Both of which were handed over to concessionaires in public-private partnership arrangements. Secondly, as anyone who has worked in the private sector knows, things move at a much quicker pace there. Whereas in the public sector, bureaucracy slows things down considerably. Also, things are done more efficiently in the private sector. So, when we came into office, our priority, after a thorough assessment of the issues, was to make governance processes more efficient. This would in turn, speed up implementation of our policies. So, we are implementing e-governance in the state. I spoke about this extensively in a recent ICAN conference. We started from the scratch, buying ICT equipment like laptops and desktops, laying fibre optic cables in the secretariat etc. At the end of this, we will see collaborations that will make things faster and more efficient. To address the second part of your question, my promise to the people of Oyo State when we were campaigning in 2018/9 was that we would be honest, transparent and implement people-oriented policies. And this is what we have continued to do since we assumed office. We have created several channels to enable us communicate with our people both online and offline and involve them in what we are doing. For instance, our budgeting process includes consultation with the people of Oyo State through townhall meetings. So, we always carry them along.</p><h4>Can you provide some brief background to the reasons behind the four areas you have chosen to be the pillars of your administration? </h4><p>As an engineer, I know that the foundation of any project is very important. Before we assumed office, we created a plan to guide how we would govern. This manifesto, which we named the Roadmap to Accelerated Development in Oyo State 2019-2023, focused on four main areas of governance and this is what became the four pillars of our administration. <br>It is a well-known fact that poverty is endemic in Nigeria. So, it was imperative that our administration focuses on lifting our people in Oyo State out of poverty. This informed our decision to focus on the economy as one of the four pillars. We considered what we have comparative advantage in as a state and decided that we would use those to drive economic growth. So, agribusiness, solid minerals development and tourism are the three main ways we are driving economic growth in Oyo State.<br>Education, which is another pillar is actually driven by my own personal experience. I came from a humble background and it was access to education that enabled me to succeed in life. We were lucky that in our time, education was free up to university level. So, I know the importance of access to education as a means of equipping people for a more productive life. <br>Healthcare which is another pillar is a pragmatic choice. A healthy population is a more productive population. And we know that with poverty levels in our country, access to healthcare is a big challenge. So, we chose healthcare as a pillar to improve access and also improve the quality of healthcare delivery. Security is another pillar of our administration. All of our plans depend on the existence of a safe and secure environment. So, it was important to make security a focus of our administration.</p><h4>Among everything that your administration has achieved within the first two years in office, what would you say are the most important ones?</h4><p>This is a tough one because there are quite a few to choose from. They were all promises I made on the campaign trail. Resolving the decades-long ownership issue of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (Ogbomoso) has to rank as one of the most important things we have been able to achieve. It seemed like an impossible task when I made the promise on the campaign trail but I am glad that we were able to achieve it. Another important one is the 65km Moniya-Ijaiye-Iseyin Road reconstruction. Apart from the fact that it was a promise, the road is strategic to our plans to drive economic growth through agribusiness. As you may know, Oke-Ogun is the food basket of Oyo State so it was an essential project to achieve that aim.</p><h4>Your ambition is to attract people from Lagos and its neighbouring areas to live in Ibadan. What is the competitive advantage of Ibadan offer its citizens compared to other cities like Lagos? </h4><p>We are building a modern city where people enjoy premium quality of life. We are looking at an Oyo State which will be the regional hub in transportation, agribusiness, real estate and more. I must mention that our proximity to Lagos is a plus especially because of the sea port. We are working to take advantage of the dry port in Ibadan and the Lagos-Ibadan rail line which create easier options to commute. We are also working with FAAN to expand the Ibadan Airport and make it a regional hub for air transport in the region. Oyo State offers opportunities to investors and private individuals alike to live in a fast-developing state and take advantage of our business cantered policies and incentives.</p><h4>As for investors, one of your administration's goals is also to open up Oyo State to different kinds of investments from within Nigeria and abroad. What favourable conditions and climate does Oyo State have to offer to the investor community compared to other areas in Nigeria? What message would you like to send to the global investor community about investing in Oyo State?</h4><p>Our aim is to make Oyo State the number one investment destination choice in Nigeria. As I said earlier, we are driving economic growth in Oyo State through agribusiness, solid minerals development and tourism. So, investors in that area can take advantage of the huge opportunities for growth and return on investment that Oyo State offers. The land size in Oyo State is about 30,000 sq kilometres and 80-85% of this is arable. We are offering land at unbeatable rates to investors. Our administration is putting our money where our mouth is by creating an environment for these industries to thrive. For example, we have started the conversion of farm settlements into agribusiness hubs. We started in Ibarapa (Eruwa and Akufo) and an investor is partnering with our administration for the Fasola farm settlement which is focused on animal husbandry. Oyo State has large mineral deposits; Marble, Granite, Tourmaline, Tantalite, Feldspar, Talc, Beryl and even Gold. In fact, we just discovered gold and manganese in the central part of the state. And right now, we are trying to establish if the deposit is in commercial quantities. For the mining sector in Oyo State, we have created a framework for the systematic development of our mineral potentials. It is designed to make our state a mining destination, attractive to local and foreign investors. Tourism in Oyo State offers opportunities for investors in the hospitality industry. Oyo State has one of only two hanging lakes in the world at Oke Ado Mountain in Ado Awaye. We also have several other tourist attractions including Bower's Tower, Agodi Park and Garden and the Eleyele Lake which we plan to partner with investors to develop into a waterfront amusement park. We are also working hard to improve our ease of doing business ranking. Presently, it takes just 60 days to acquire permits and documentation for things such as getting Certificates of Occupancy after purchasing land. The issue of multiple taxation is also being looked into with a streamlining of taxes. We have different business packages with different categories of investors. We are inviting investors in all sectors to take advantage of the business-friendly environment our administration has created to set up shop in Oyo State, especially the tech sector. We have a young population and with several tertiary institutions in the state, there is an able and willing workforce for investors.</p><h4>Where do you envision Oyo State to be by the end of your first administration, and regardless of a potential second term for your administration, what are your dreams and ambitions for Oyo State within the next ten years?</h4><p>At the end of this tenure of our administration, I envision an Oyo State which is once again setting the pace in all areas of governance in Nigeria. We are putting in the work and we are beginning to see the results. For instance, when we assumed office, Oyo State was ranked 26th in WAEC results for all states in Nigeria. The last result, we moved up to 11th but our aim is number 1 and we will keep working towards that. With our investment in infrastructure; roads, healthcare facilities, waste management facilities, sporting facilities etc, I envision a modern and better structured state. I want to leave behind an Oyo State that whoever is coming after me will not have to spend the first two years trying to lay the groundwork for development because everything is in a dilapidated state. My dream is to set Oyo State on the path of sustainable growth and development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Hempel was founded in Denmark in 1915. Since then, it has become a coating industry leader, helping its customers minimize maintenance costs, improve aesthetics, and increase energy efficiency. How has the company evolved? What is Hempel's mission and vision?</h4><p>In 1915, the coatings industry was switching from wood to iron naval material; however, iron oxidizes upon contact with water, so we came up with a solution to protect the hulls of vessels. After World War II, Hempel decided to sell all its shares to a foundation, which is currently the sole owner of the company. Hempel covers almost everything in the naval sector, but not only, so including protective coatings. Around 1970, decorative painting developed. Hempel is one of the largest company of its kind in Europe. We aim to be sustainable, focus on a specific number of sectors, and be innovative. The company's vision is to serve its customers sustainably and innovatively by protecting assets and maintaining service levels.</p><h4>Hempel has been present in Spain for over 100 years. It has factories and offices in various parts of the country. How important is the Spanish market for Hempel?</h4><p>In the last two years, and globally we have billed more than EUR1.5 billion. A third of this in the naval sector, another in the protective sector, and the final in the architectural sector. In the case of Europe, EUR450 million were billed. Europe is the largest regional entity and accounts for 30% of Hempel. In addition, Spain is the number-one market here, making up 13% of total European sales. In 1960, Hempel created an integrated company in Spain with a factory, R&amp;D, logistics, and so on. The company grew substantially because it covered all segments, and all we have done is maintain and grow it. The importance of Hempel Paints is as big as it is profitable. In the case of Spain, half of returns come from the protective sector, and the other two quarters come from the decorative and naval sectors. Recreational sailing boat painting is an extremely niche market, which accounts for about 4%. That said, it is highly profitable.</p><h4>The company has increased its revenues by 3.2% in the last year. What strategy did it employ to achieve this growth despite the pandemic?</h4><p>First, we created crisis committees in each country, as well as a cash protection plan, so expenses were reduced. In addition, special care was taken to ensure that strategic clients were served. In Spain, the factory was closed for nine days, and we experienced tricky sector dynamics; however, no one was put out of work. We provided antigen testing for our employees at our own expense. We have done everything possible to stay one step ahead of the day-to-day reality. Our clients are quite large, so there have been no interruptions in terms of service requests.</p><h4>Who are your main customers in Spain?</h4><p>In the protective sector, green energies manufacturers are of great importance to us. Our main customers are global companies, while others come from the civil infrastructure sector. For example, one type of infrastructure that is being painted is Wanda Stadium, namely large iron structures. We have painted stadiums for the World Cup in Qatar. Apart from such infrastructure, we also paint AVE bridges. However, between 2009 and 2021, the Spanish market decreased around 40% of business in infrastructure. The private sector is easier because, at the end of the day, it is still about a company's willingness to invest. In the petroleum sector, Spain does not have much to offer, but it does have refineries. We also provide paint to customers from the chemical industry. Hempel has always been close to the applicator, namely the painter. There are strategic efforts underway to get closer to those who influence this process. Five years ago, we were looking for a place to build a new R&amp;D center. Thanks to Accií² 10, we were able to set up a laboratory with 35 specialists working to innovate and develop. This is now a center of excellence in terms of R&amp;D for the field of passive fire protection. A global campus was recently launched in Denmark with an investment of EUR35 million. Hempel is next door to the University of Denmark, and it has an agreement to build a campus that helps students studying chemistry to find a professional opportunity in the paint sector.</p><h4>Next Generation Funds provide companies with funds to face the adverse effects of COVID-19. Does Hempel plan to apply for the Next Generation Funds?</h4><p>There are now significant opportunities to obtain funding. It is a means of investing in digitalization and sustainability. Sustainability funding would go directly from our own muscle, but being always informed about the opportunities at a global scale.</p><h4>What are the company's operational objectives for the rest of the year?</h4><p>We want to grow the size of the company, become more sustainable, and embark on a path to digitalization. The idea is that the company grows on sales and the profitability maintained given that we have supply shortages in terms of raw materials. There are manufacturing and production units based on raw materials that are no longer being supplied. China has a tight grip on commodities, so if it closes, the world will collapse. Most importantly, in 2021, we must establish all the plans that will help us achieve this dual impact strategy in 2025. The Spanish market is limited in terms of number of customers. Hence, all these tactical plans must be decided in 2021. In summary, the objectives are to grow, remain profitable, and have tactical plans in place for this dual-impact strategy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>GEFCO, founded in 1949, has become a leading logistics company specialized in industry. What has been the evolution and mission of the company since its establishment in Spain in 1985?</h4><p>Since its beginnings 70 years ago in 1949 as a provider of finished-vehicle transport for Groupe PSA, GEFCO has become a world-class industrial logistics provider, serving customers in 150 countries on 5 continents. Drawing on its expertise as a global automotive logistics expert, GEFCO has successfully expanded its range of skills to other supply chains over the past decade. GEFCO Spain was one of GEFCO's first subsidiaries created after France.  Historically, our mandate was to serve the automotive industry, which is extremely demanding in terms of its supply chain. Previously, design and production were all done at the plant; however, over the years, a great deal has been externalized, including the design of parts, meaning our logistics service has changed accordingly. In this context, we aim to design a transport plan that best suits automotive manufacturing. Due to cash requirements, there are no more stocks at plants but in our trucks and warehouses everywhere. In 2018, we have taken another step forward in our development with the acquisition of GLT, a transport specialist on the corridor to Morocco. This was a major event because it was a way for us to become a significant operator in that market, although we are based in Morocco since 2002. Now, we operate on the corridor where we can propose and serve customers with the best service available. We also decided to create a joint venture with BERGÉ in 2018, a partnership that makes our finished-vehicle logistics the biggest operator in Spain. We have our own fleet of trucks, car carriers, compounds, and presence in different ports. It was a major move for us to bring our finished-vehicle business to a different scale.</p><h4>How did the pandemic affect GEFCO Spain and its revenue?</h4><p>We have been impacted on two levels. First, when the pandemic started in China, we were supplying industries with components coming from Europe and China. In the beginning, we had to find solutions that would not disrupt the supply from China. Second, we participated in transporting masks and PPE equipment. <br>In Spain, lockdown rules were rolled out from March-May 2020, and we saw a massive drop in volumes. Plants were closing, and we had to rapidly organize logistics. For a few months, we also had to adjust our efforts in transport and people to minimize costs. We started to return gradually to more or less sustainable volumes from July 2020. <br>In addition to the pandemic, we suffered from a cyberattack at the end of September. It was extremely difficult and challenging, but the talent, spirit, and engagement of our staff was amazing.</p><h4>What changed for the company after the cyberattack?</h4><p>These attacks are becoming more and more common, but at GEFCO we were prepared for this situation. We were already in the process of transforming our IT solutions and this was the necessary impulse to advance our projects. We have already started rebuilding our infrastructure and IT systems to be more secure and fully digital, continuing the trend we have initiated a few years ago to prepare to the evolution of the market where digital platforms are key and communication tools decisive to facilitate our communication with our customers. We notably launched a new platform for finished vehicles called Moveecar, a digital platform designed to offer car logistics services throughout a vehicle lifecycle for automotive and mobility players, without any paperwork. From first registration to the end of vehicle life, for B2C &amp; B2B, from single car to many, for commercial &amp; passenger vehicles, Moveecar is changing today our customer's experience. We are engaged in this, which has led to plenty of ongoing projects to help us move to more digital solutions.</p><h4>In Spain, in which other sectors are you involved?</h4><p>Our core history is the automotive industry, which remains a large part of our business; however, we also extend our services to other industries. Our core business is industry, namely cars, aerospace, textile, construction, FMCGs, and health and beauty. We are targeting many different industries in order to diversify our portfolio of clients. However, our know-how is absolutely in managing supply chains with all the processes, engineering, and integrated services that can be easily duplicated in other countries. This is what we aim to do. For example, the car industry may be different from textiles, but the needs are the same. There is no stock, you have to move quickly, and you have to deliver solutions rapidly to supply the fabrication chain.</p><h4>What is your main objective for the year ahead?</h4><p>There are a few goals that are global and local. Locally, we are creating a region clusters here, a process that we have initiated in many countries within the company. This new cluster now covers Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, which has a big economic link and relationship. This regional approach encourages us to be more efficient, leaner and to serve our customers better. We will also continue to work on the optimization of our solutions, again to be more efficient, lean, and carbon-impactful. In terms of business, we will accelerate our development outside the automotive industry and propose our know-how to other industries. We will also go more digital, which is vital at the global level. In terms of human resources, it is important because our industry is based on our information systems and the expertise of our people. Like everywhere, Spain had to adjust its resources according to activity. This was not easy for some of our employees, but we took this time to train more and started GEFCO University, an online training program open to every employee. This is part of the digitalization that we are using to continue to have more skilled people. In this context, we will implement the home office concept that came about more after the pandemic. We were pushed to use more digital tools like TEAMS and that will continue as well. We will likely not travel as much as before for many reasons. With the new digital tools, we can reduce the amount of travel we had to do before. For safety reasons and environmental impact, there are new reasons not to travel, and we are becoming leaner in that aspect. As another great example of optimizing our solutions, in our warehousing services in Spain, we provide complex solutions Just in Time, Just in Sequence, storage, and delivery. We are moving toward a digital system using simple applications to be more digital. We increasingly used AGVs in the service we provide, and this is a permanent trend. This is the focus for us in 2021.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main aspirations of the Ministry of Housing, City, and Territory?</h4><p>Colombia, like many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, although having made important progress in recent years, still presents challenges in terms of housing and urban development due to the accelerated growth of cities in recent decades. This dynamic of urban growth generates difficulties, such as insufficient adequate housing, habitat vulnerability, insufficient provision of public services and, in general, disorderly urban planning and not in accordance with the expected population growth. Colombia still must make progress in reducing the housing deficit, which in its quantitative dimension averages out to 9.8% and in its qualitative dimension to 26.7%. Moreover, half of the homes that will exist in 2050 have not yet been built imposing additional pressure on the generation of quality housing. Regarding the universalization of access to drinking water and basic sanitation services, Colombia has made important progress during the last two decades and today has coverage greater than 90%. However, there remains the challenge of reaching people without access, mostly in urban settlements and in rural areas. Thus, the National Government has recognized in these challenges an opportunity to develop a robust and comprehensive public policy, which is based on two fundamental premises: reducing inequality and putting the citizen at the center of politics. For example, in order to reduce the quantitative deficit, we have designed a subsidy policy focused on the demand, making it easier for lower-income households to access a home. Regarding the qualitative deficit, by the program “Casa Digna, Vida Digna“ we seek to improve people's living conditions through proving property titles and through promoting housing improvements and social facilities. In addition, at the beginning of this year we sanctioned the “Housing and Habitat Law“ (“Ley de Vivienda y Hábitat“), which turns the housing policy into a State policy and aims to guarantee continuity of our housing policy beyond legislative periods. This Law allows for better planning of our territory and provides more favorable conditions in order to continue providing decent housing solutions to the most vulnerable families. Finally, in terms of drinking water and basic sanitation, we have developed differential regulatory schemes to promote the provision of these services in informal urban settlements and in rural areas with difficult access. This has allowed us to reach territories, which previously had been impossible to reach at the regulatory level.</p><h4>What are the aspirations of the Ministry of Housing, City, and Territory in terms of housing? On what are you focusing your efforts?</h4><p>As mentioned above, the housing policy of our Government has two main objectives: (i) reduce the number of households in quantitative deficit, and (ii) reduce the qualitative deficit, by promoting dignified living conditions for Colombians who already are owners, but the home is in inadequate condition. First, the government of President Iván Duque has focused on its subsidy allocation strategy, the most ambitious in the country's recent history. As of May 10, 2021, we have already delivered more than 113,000 subsidies for the purchase of social housing (VIS) and about 17,000 Non-VIS subsidies. The good performance in the allocation of subsidies, together with the regulatory modernization promoted by the Housing and Habitat Law, the efforts in digitizing the sector and the initiatives to facilitate access to credit, led to the year 2020 having become the record year in sales, with more than 200,000 units sold. The prospects for home sales for 2021 and 2022 are positive too, as we expect to mark sales levels above the 2020 record level in both years. With respect to the qualitative deficit, the National Development Plan establishes that 600,000 households will benefit from the “Casa Digna, Vida Digna“ program by the end of the four-year term of this Government. This program is a joint effort between the Ministry of Agriculture, the governmental entity "Social Prosperity" and the Ministry of Housing. As of May 10, more than half a million families have benefited from the program's three lines of action: property titles (formalization of ownership), housing improvements and social facilities.</p><h4>What are the consequences coming along with the pandemic in the housing sector? How is the Ministry seeking to expand home ownership?</h4><p>The housing sector has been affected by the effects caused by COVID-19. During the months of March, April, and May 2020, sales of less than 7,000 units of social housing (VIS) per month were registered, and Non-VIS sales reached historical lows in April, with less than 2,000 units sold. Likewise, the employment in the building sector in April 2020 presented a reduction of 47% compared to the same month of 2019. In this regard, the National Government issued more than 10 measures that sought to mitigate the harmful effects on the sector. These measures, which placed housing at the center of the reactivation strategy, promoted employment in the sector and protected home tenure. In this context, aiming to foster the country's economic reactivation, the National Government launched the initiative of 200,000 subsidies for the purchase of VIS and Non-VIS housing. Since its announcement on May 27, 2020, by May 10, 2021, more than 68,000 families have fulfilled their dream of owning a home thanks to these state aid. The success of this initiative went so far, as that in March 2021 the country reached the highest level of sales in its history, with more than 21,000 units sold.</p><h4>What campaigns and policies are worth mentioning and can you give us an update on the successes of Mi Casa Ya?</h4><p>The program “Mi Casa Ya“ was launched in 2015. This Government recognized its potential and strengthened some of its elements in which there were opportunities for improvement. In particular, we decided on amplifying its scope, in order to assign subsidies to a greater number of people and to more municipalities. Besides, we increased the program's progressivity, aiming to allocate aid to the most vulnerable families. The dynamics of VIS subsidies allocation is impressive. While in 2016, 133 VIS subsidies were assigned weekly and in 2017 close to 300, currently we exceed 1,000 subsidies per week. Since the beginning of the program until May 10, 2021, 150,000 VIS subsidies have been assigned, of which 75% have been delivered during our Government (113,000 subsidies). The program's greater scope has allowed us to benefit Bogotá as well as 26 of the 32 departments of Colombia, allocating subsidies in 252 municipalities. We also have managed great progress. In 2017, less than 20% of the families having incomes below two minimum wages  had accessed VIS subsidies, a figure that for 2019 increased up to 63% and for 2021 (as of May 10, 2021) up to 78%. In other words, eight out of every 10 families that access this help from the National Government have incomes of less than two times the minimum wage. These good results in terms of the allocation of subsidies and progress are explained by different policies that we have been implementing during our Government. In the first place, the measure of “concurrent subsidies“, that allows combining subsidies for down payments provided by the Family Compensation Funds with those of the National Government. Thus, a household with an income below two minimum wages can obtain the value of 50 minimum wages for the payment of its initial installment, an incentive accompanied by a coverage of the interest rate on the mortgage loan for the first seven years. The “concurrent subsidy“ has been implemented in 26 departments and 175 municipalities across the country. Second, through mortgage loan guarantees, the National Government now can act as guarantor for lower-income families. This program subsidizes 100% of the guarantee for families with incomes below two minimum wages. Consequently, access to housing credit is promoted for the most vulnerable households.</p><h4>What is the reason for the record in sales of social housing (VIS) in Colombia?</h4><p>Now is the best time for purchase a home. According to "Galerí­a Inmobiliaria", in March 2021 more than 21,000 families bought a house, of which 15,000 units correspond to VIS housing, both numbers representing the highest monthly value on record. As already mentioned, these good results are explained by the positive performance in the delivery of subsidies. March 2021 was the record month regarding the number of VIS subsidies (5,519 subsidies). Likewise, it is worth noting that the record in sales also can be traced back to low interest rates, the digitization and simplification of home buying processes, the new possibility of the Government as co-debtor as well as the facilitation of access to credit by modifications to the “Debt to Income“ ratio (DTI), which increased from 30% to 40% in the case of the purchase of social housing.</p><h4>How does the Ministry relate to the private sector and organizations like Camacol in order to ensure a joint vision in line with development?</h4><p>Guaranteeing a safe and successful reactivation process necessarily implies articulation between the private sector and National Government in their work agendas. In particular, as Ministry of Housing, we have been working with the union that groups together construction companies and companies in the value chain of the sector across the country, as well as with the private sector. Working aligned with the construction union and the private sector has allowed us to move into the right direction and we can emphasize that the construction sector today is the protagonist of the country's economic reactivation.</p><h4>How would you like to see Colombia in terms of housing and urban development in the medium and long term?</h4><p>With respect to housing and employment in the sector, the outlook for 2021 is very good. We hope to exceed the records reached in 2020, by selling 213,000 housing units this year. In the VIS segment we expect to sell 143,000 units and in the No Vis segment the remaining 70,000. In that regard, we expect to launch 200,000 units (138,000 VIS and 62,000 No VIS) and start the construction of 242,000 units (55.3% VIS). This will allow maintaining a monthly average of more than one million jobs within the sector. On the other hand, we expect an average growth of the GDP of the buildings sector higher than 10% in 2021 and 2022. If we continue with the excellent allocation rates observed so far, more than 80,000 families will benefit by our subsidy strategy during 2021. In the long term, according to the estimates of the Ministry, today one out of every five homes that will exist in 2030 has not yet been built. This constitutes an opportunity to rethink the sustainable and orderly urban development of the country we dream of. To this end, we will continue making progress in facilitating access to housing credit, improving the progression of the policy, promoting the orderly growth of cities, modernizing and digitizing the sector's processes, among others.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Considering the economic impact of the pandemic and unemployment leading to increased demand for food banks, how have you changed the structure of BAMX?</h4><p>BAMX is a network of 55 food banks operating for almost 30 years, and since March 2020, we have seen an increase in the number of people coming to food banks. In 2020, we were assisting 1.4 million people, and today that figure is more than 2.1 million. We have developed a special model to rescue food from along the value chain, prepare different food packages, and deliver these to people in need. Because we are a national network, we have the big challenge of not only finding more companies to donate food to as a priority, but also make monetary donations so that BAMX can afford to buy basic food items such as grains, beans, rice, lentils, and the like. We seek more funding to buy staple food items, such as grain.</p><h4>What strategies do you use to rescue food from the value chain?</h4><p>We rescue food from the fields. We have an alliance with more than 600 farmers and producers. We also work with retail chains, hotels and restaurants, and industry, including both SMEs and large companies at the national and international level. BAMX always starts by signing an agreement, so we have a formal relationship in place where a partner commits to giving us donations on a regular basis. Every single day, the 1,200-plus people working in BAMX and our 24,000-plus volunteers working in our network, go out to the fields, businesses, and stores to collect food that is not sellable. This food is fine to consume but sometimes unsuitable for sale, such as faulty packaging or fresh produce that is not of uniform ripeness or color. There is a significant level of food waste for such reasons that make no sense. Since the pandemic we have started working with companies in the energy sector, such as IEnova, Engie, and Shell. We have been innovating to create these new relationships where we work with companies on special projects to benefit particular communities. We work with almost 7,000 communities so BAMX is an extremely experienced NGO for these companies to work with.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the nature of BAMX's collaboration with these energy companies?</h4><p>These are projects where we deliver food to specific communities, for example towns near solar plants or other energy projects or communities requiring flood relief assistance. We have a special national protocol to guide our food banks and help them respond to these emergencies. We have learned a great deal about different sectors with which we could form relationships besides the food industry. We also want to keep working with sectors like energy after the pandemic. We have other alliances with many companies  that donate significant amounts of money to BAMX. Our biggest operational challenge is logics and transportation investment. We would love to have transportation companies collaborate with us through special rates, discounts, or donations.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on BAMX's work with business chambers in Mexico?</h4><p>We have been working with the chambers for the last two years. In August 2019, the most important chambers agreed to start the First Business Council Against Food Loss and Waste. The next step is for the chambers to promote a new initiative in 2021 that we are developing in collaboration with the UK over a 15-year period where they worked with various companies. The companies that sign up to our initiative pledge to reduce food loss or waste by 50% and make changes so they start seeing the multiple benefits of adopting less wasteful practices. The beauty of the concept is that even companies that are competitors in the market can work together toward this common goal—they will sit down together and share good practices to reduce food loss and waste. We will have the assistance of WRAP from the UK and various experts. This is also an interesting initiative because it is not merely confined to the private sector; we will work with the public sector as well, specifically The President's Office. We also want the Ministry of the Environment to be a part of this project so we can collaborate and not only make changes at the company level, but also at the national level through public policy changes. BAMX wants reducing food loss and waste to be part of Mexico's legislation. This is not an easy initiative to carry out, but we have an advantage because the methodology and results have been proven in the UK.</p><h4>What are your main goals at BAMX for 2021?</h4><p>We need to maintain the volume of food being rescued. We also need to grow our number of alliances, and that will be one of our main strategies for 2021. BAMX needs to be better known. We need to raise our profile so that not just the private sector, but also people in the community know about us and trust us as an NGO that has been working for this cause for three decades now. The need is growing, and we need their support and community volunteers. Mexico has a serious problem not only with hunger and food insecurity, but also in terms of food loss and waste. There is not much information available about this issue. We should be talking about this and doing things to be part of the solution because there is enough food in Mexico to feed everyone. We are trying to get more people involved and are working on the solution. The food bank was originally started by a businessman in Guadalajara who had trucks of tomatoes he could not sell; at the same time, he saw a retirement home struggling to find food. He started food banks in Mexico in 1987, and the association BAMX was established in 1995. We are now 25 years old and have 55 food banks. BAMX has 35 employees at its national office, 1,200 staff elsewhere in Mexico, and 24,000 volunteers in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Equinix is a group with more than 220 data centers in 63 markets and 26 countries. What is Equinix's mission?</h4><p>The goal of the company is to develop the digital infrastructure of the world. What moves us is the goal of providing digital infrastructure for every company to be connected. Interconnection is the key in all the services we provide; it is essential today to ensure companies can operate. Today, a data center can be located anywhere, so the value is the ecosystems that it generates around itself and its capacity to be connected to other players. We are talking about digital ecosystems for tourism or finance companies, among others. In other words, the value of the data center is enabling these ecosystems and allowing businesses to access them. We want to be a company that leaves its mark on the world's digital transformation.</p><h4>A report by IDC Research Spain and Equinix indicates that, in 2022, 40% of investment in basic technology will be related to the cloud, increasing to 80% in 2028. What makes Equinix the partner of choice compared to other infrastructure and connection providers?</h4><p>We are the entry gate to the cloud; we are the closest edge to the public cloud. We host most of the cloud services providers. In addition, we have a solution called Equinix Fabric, in which all the public clouds that we host are connected. It is a platform in which every user is connected with equal opportunities, and each user can connect to the cloud that they need. Once a user is in an international business exchange (IBX), a data center of Equinix, they have access to the entire range of cloud, service, and cyber security providers hosted in our data centers.</p><h4>Equinix Metal is now available in 18 markets, including Madrid. What advantages does it offer?</h4><p>Our focus is on boosting businesses' capacities on the edge. It started with the product Network Edge, which was a virtual network distributed infrastructure. It provides virtual network services that run on a modular infrastructure platform. Now, what we have included the services of Equinix Metal. It expands on the services that customers can get. It has many APIs to connect it to the many tools that software developers use. It allows customers to provide their services. In a nutshell, Metal is the fastest digital process to enter Equinix data centers.</p><h4>How was 2020 for the company? </h4><p>The main concern was to protect the health of our employees, while maintaining our business. Also, we were concerned on how we could mitigate the potential impact on our customers. Fortunately, we already had contingency plans that we had never expected to use. We sent all our office employees to work from home, while we implemented a system for our employees in our data centers. There were some limitations to the services that we provided to our clients, though they all understood the situation, and we faced no problems. As for our performance in 2020, it was an excellent year. We recorded again a historic annual growth for the 18th year in a row. Equinix is the capstone that interconnects all the digital ecosystem, and we have witnessed an increase in requests from clients to work with us. We also received new clients who wanted to work with us.</p><h4>Equinix has a long-term goal of using 100% renewable energy. What is its current commitment to the environment and sustainability?</h4><p>Reaching net-zero carbon dioxide emissions is one of our goals as well. We want all the energy that we use in our data centers to come from clean sources. That is the case of our data centers in Spain, which are fully sourced from renewable sources. We are present in more than 25 countries, so it varies. There are some countries where achieving that is more difficult, but we are on track to achieve that.</p><h4>Spain is the southern European country with the fastest growth in data centers. What potential do you see for this industry in Spain?</h4><p>I started in this business 20 years ago. Back then, the sector experienced rapid growth, and right now, I see a similar situation. There were traditionally four markets in Europe: Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, and Paris. However, these markets are heavily saturated, and companies need to seek new locations to roll out data centers within Europe. The submarine cable routes between northern Europe and North America are starting to be extremely saturated. Spain is the bridge between Africa and Europe, and we are the closest country to the Americas, both north and south. I expect Spain to become an important location where a large amount of traffic from many places will gather. It will become a bridge. The same is true for Marseille, which is developing many submarine cables. We recently opened operations in Genoa and Barcelona, which are seeking to become alternative locations to connect submarine cables. Madrid should become a relevant location of interconnectivity within Europe.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see to develop data centers in Madrid?</h4><p>There is a great deal of land available in the region of Madrid; the issue is finding a location where all the routes of fiber optics meet. Also, we need to take into account the electricity infrastructure. That is a big challenge, because when choosing a location, it needs to be connected to the fiber-optic network and the energy grid. The best infrastructure to acquire land is along the highways that go from Madrid to northern Spain and from Madrid to Barcelona.</p><h4>What are your main goals for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our main goal is to continue to help Spanish companies in their internationalization, while also becoming a partner for all the businesses that have data centers' needs. We want to continue growing and being the digital infrastructure of the world. In the last few years, we have maximized the capacities of our data centers. We have expanded our physical locations to include more data centers. The next steps are yet to be defined, though we expect to continue growing accordingly to market needs. Right now, all the data center companies in Spain are thinking of establishing an association to defend the interests of the industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What changes has the Ministry implemented to adapt to the pandemic?</h4><p>We had to adapt to numerous changes this year, however one of the main changes was a having to invent faster and stronger shift towards the use of technologies in carrying our routine practices. For example, some routine clinics started using virtual formats where patients minimize their exposure and don't need to go to health care centers. In Oman, we have a strong disease surveillance system for early detection before this pandemic, thanks to our experiences with MERS and then with H1N1 in 2009, the COVID-19 pandemic forced us to further enhance this system. This culminated in the development of the Tarassud platform, a platform for registering the cases, following up their results, and tracking individuals suspected to be positive. Learning from previous experiences and that of other countries, we also started preemptive action. This started with the establishment by H.M. Sultan Haitham bin Tariq of the Supreme Committee, which brought together the various sectors involved in responding to a possible pandemic. Cross-sectoral collaboration ensured having strong governance in decision making processes.  Additionally, we secured all points of entry, too, as a measure to enhance the surveillance system. Doing so helped us identify and manage cases from the beginning. In line with preemptively securing medical necessities, we also started working on expanding our ICU beds capacity. At the onset of the pandemic, we had 144 ICU beds in the country, but we later added 220 new ICU beds to that, in addition to 30-35 ICU beds provided by the private sector. We also worked on securing sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment for our staff and ventilators. As a result, we thankfully never had a significant shortage, and we were successful despite the many challenges in international trade. We also started working more closely with our partners, mainly the private sector and civil society. And started communicating more frequently, openly, and clearly with the public, because an emergency at this scale cannot be managed by institutions without the public's support. And the public has been largely cooperative. We also fostered new partnerships with civil society, where volunteers helped health institutions in delivering medications to the homes of high-risk groups, such as elderly, or those who are immuno-compromised or living with chronic illnesses. We would not have been able to handle the surge in cases if it were not for our strong network of healthcare institutions. As such, this has reinforced our commitment to further strengthening this network and expanding it. Unfortunately, we have also learned during this pandemic that vaccine nationalism still prevails, and I do not see that changing anytime soon. Due to various reasons, rich countries were able to acquire large shares of the global vaccine production while poorer countries were unable to get sufficient amounts. It is important to remember that no one is safe until everyone is safe. In other areas, international cooperation has been instrumental in stemming the spread of the virus and in accelerating the results to effective vaccines. In Oman, we have decided from the beginning to provide free COVID-19 care to everyone, including expatriates—regardless of their status.</p><h4>How did you continue to provide primary healthcare to patients during the pandemic?</h4><p>During the pandemic, 94% of patients with chronic diseases still managed to get their medications. This was done through the maintenance of primary health services at designated centers (other than those designated to receive COVID-19 patients or suspect cases). The MOH team also came up with new initiatives such as virtual clinics, drive-through pharmacies, and an information call center. In addition, in cooperation with WHO and UNFPA, the MOH also launched a hotline for following up pregnant women and new mothers. With the Ministry of Social Development, mental health support lines were also launched for persons in quarantine, and they provided support in multiple languages. In the first year, we did not notice an increase in death rate for chronic diseases; we even saw a fall in death rates as a result of accidents because of the lockdown. In the end, the increase in death rates were not as high as we expected.</p><h4>Where do you see the greatest opportunities for the private sector to invest in healthcare?</h4><p>Oman offers a unique environment for investment in healthcare, from stability to natural landscapes, and from the well-established and well-governed healthcare system to the coherent and streamlined framework governing the relationships between public and private healthcare institutions. The healthcare system in Oman is strong across the six pillars of governance, and so any new investment will be embraced by this system. The private sector can capitalize on areas of healthcare that still need development in Oman. This includes specialized laboratory testing, which would alleviate the pressure from public laboratories, ad rehabilitation centers. Adding to that, the public health center can only expand so much. In partnership with the private sector, construction is currently ongoing at three hospitals at the moment: one with 700 beds in Salalah; one with 220 beds in Sohar; and one in Khasab. And we will still need to build five more hospitals after that, and we are looking for local and international partners to build them. The private sector can increase the national healthcare capacity and quality of specialization, which will reduce waiting times for patients and eventually reverse the flow of expenses on abroad treatments to local providers. On top of all, the private sector can seize the unique political position of the Sultanate in the region and its stability, and can envision establishing centers of excellence in the various fields, including wellness and metal health centers, to attract patients from across the region. The important thing is to show long term commitment and not to focus on short-term profit. My team would be pleased to meet with prospective investors and guide them through the process.</p><h4>Looking beyond the pandemic, what are your objectives for this year?</h4><p>The main objective is to maintain the achievements of the health sector in Oman. We have learned and are still learning may valuable lessons, and the MOH team has prepared a plan with what has been done and what can be done better in the future. We also want to maintain ongoing projects to expand health services throughout the country, such as the hospitals in Salalah, Sohar, and Khasab. And we will need to continue working towards turning the plans of building five more hospitals after that into a reality with local or international partners. Apart from that, it is of course a priority for us to continue striving towards more achievements for Oman in health. We launched a strategy in March to eliminate tuberculosis in Oman, and we will be the pilot program in the world. Additionally, we will continue working on putting the reduction of chronic diseases rates a priority and enhancing early diagnoses. At the international level, we had also launched the Global Health for Peace Initiative in 2018, through which we aim to leverage healthcare as a catalyst and bridge for peace and stability where there is conflict. Wherever you go, you will see that health professionals work together regardless of their political affiliations, because health is a human right. Our initial partner was Switzerland, but now there are many countries, and hopefully we can resume the work after the pandemic is over.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the pandemic affect the business in the past year?</h4><p>As a Total Real Estate Solutions Company, with businesses and products in different real estate segments, the pandemic has various impact on our business.  For example, the affordable homes sector was impacted on both the supply and demand sides. The supply side was affected by the six-month interruption of construction projects. As a result of this delay, the cost of finance increased, as interest rates kept growing but projects were on hold. Second, after the pandemic, developers suffered from even higher costs of materials. Disposable income generally reduced, and unemployment has increased further. This impacted our sales because people are now prioritizing only essentials: food, healthcare and education over buying a home. Funding is also a challenge. Banks are not able to provide funding to either developers or buyers. The mortgage industry was already challenged prior to the pandemic, the situation  exacerbated it, so people have been more conservative with their money. Finally, uncertainty has brought a shift from buying to rental.</p><h4>How does this shift from buying to renting affect your operations as a facility manager?</h4><p>This is where we are unique. We are not just a facility manager but a total real estate solutions company. We did a great deal of market research and paid attention to our customers and saw where consumer behavior was tilting. As a result, we introduced two key products during that period. One is a service called Rent to Own, which allows one to rent and restructure payments so that if they can manage to make a certain level of deposit, we will give them the keys to their houses. Essentially, as a tenant they can pay part of the equity in installments and own the home.</p><h4>How does your Rent-to-Own program work?</h4><p>We require a 75% deposit to move in, which however is not disbursed entirely by the tenant. We encourage tenants to be a part of the National Housing Fund, where they make a monthly deposit. The Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria will give every Nigerian up to NGN15 million at 6% interest if it is used for housing, compared to 15-20% obtained by banks. We were able to secure that for our customers. If you want to buy a property of NGN30 million, and we already have the development and the land, we ask tenants to contribute 25% over the first 24 months, which is NGN7.5 million. We will also get NGN15 million from the government, which tenants can repay over 20 years or more, depending on her age. The total amount is less than their current rental with the difference that they are now a landlord.</p><h4>Have you ventured into the area of affordable housing?</h4><p>We are entering into that now to support some state governments to access the National Housing Fund for their civil servants. As many civil servants earn low incomes, they cannot afford to own their own houses until they have retired at 55 or 60. The government has the land, so it should stop selling it to developers at exorbitant rates. We can play a key role here if the government provides us with land at lower rates; makes provision for general infrastructure with good access roads to the land; provides a list of people who can afford to buy the houses within a certain price range; ensures that with the land they also provide a title in order to protect our investment; and provide the assurance that those buyers people are pensionable and it will be able to guarantee the repayment of the loan. Once the government can satisfy these conditions, we will spend our own money to start construction. We will also include the facility management for the first two years, getting it ready to then be handed over. That is what I call sustainability in housing delivery.</p><h4>What is the current situation in Nigeria regarding the housing deficit?</h4><p>The so-called 17 million housing gap has been on the table since I started investing. Meanwhile, Nigeria's population has grown, but that figure has not changed. Another issue is that in many small towns across Nigeria, there are many vacant houses as people migrate to cities. Therefore, are we talking about actual housing demand across Nigeria, or just in certain locations? We need to redefine that deficit and contextualize it. There are 40 million houses available across Nigeria, and 30 million needed, but are all those 40 million houses accessible and connected to a point of economic activity? Do they all have good roads, electricity, and water or do people have to migrate to urban areas? We need to provide infrastructure to connect cities, improve transportation links to enable commuting, and increase electricity supply in order to reduce the housing deficit.</p><h4>What are you doing within healthcare?</h4><p>We have a new vertical business in healthcare. People may wonder what a real estate solutions company is doing in healthcare, but it is the same as asking what it is doing in education. People across every single sector require a physical space from which to operate, be it telecoms, oil and gas, education, or any other area. The quality of an environment is a significant contributor to the quality of the service delivered. As a company with facilities management background, we can contribute to every sector. Part of the reason why hospitals in advanced economies are superior to those in Nigeria is their real estate and infrastructure. Every year, Nigerians spend billions of dollars on outbound medical tourism. The main problem is hospitals' physical environments, from the gate and the lawn to the reception, lighting, and bathrooms. The second issue is the quality of the customer service. We realized we can play in that space by bringing the management system to support prime healthcare delivery and help renovate run-down government hospitals. We have two major projects today. We have invested NGN1.5 billion into the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, where we deploy state-of-the-art equipment. What we did there is similar to what we are doing in the housing space. When the patient pays, we work out a percentage. The latest innovative product we are bringing to the market is the modular diagnostic facility. If the building is already in a poor state, the cost of renovating it is huge. At times, within the first three years of an upgrading project, the owner changes his mind despite the contractual agreement. We came up with the modular system, which is a portacabin fully built with all the equipment in there. Rather than renovating a building, we will position that equipment outside and connect it to telemedical facilities elsewhere, such as India or Spain, serving customers here. It also has facility for tele radiography so we can transmit images of scans to a radiologist in London, for example, to look at everything and communicate with the patient. We also want to disrupt that space with a combination of state-of-the-art equipment and technology, and to this end we partner with top global players such as GE.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has the Department of Energy played in the Emirate's resilience in the current situation?</h4><p>As the regulator of the energy sector in Abu Dhabi, our top priority is to ensure the power grid and water as well as wastewater networks are resilient and working at all times. Since the onset of COVID-19, we have been taking all the necessary proactive steps in line with directives from the relevant local authorities. We continue to closely monitor the situation and have worked with all energy sector companies and stakeholders, ensuring uninterrupted supply of water and electricity services and maintained additional capacity above the demand required by all sectors to mitigate swings in peak demand and energy consumption. We issued Covid-19 guidelines to support energy operators and service providers are able to maintain business continuity and adequate manpower safely. We have also invested tremendously on our infrastructure to serve Abu Dhabi and the Northern Emirates. When it comes to capacity, we are already geared up. In the middle of the pandemic, our energy program was com-pleted and was operating safely. We celebrated supplying the first nuclear energy to the grid. As to resilience: it has never been built overnight. Resilience was built a long time ago as infrastructure, and the most important piece is the policy in place and the human capital that is willing to transform and translate those written policies into regulation as well as operations on the ground. When we put all these together, this results in resilience. There is resilience because there is a true bond between the team, citizens, and employees working in the public and private sectors.</p><h4>How much more important and immediate was the need for the energy transition in the face of the pandemic?</h4><p>We are an oilrich country, but we have used the oil revenues to invest in advancing our energy transition. We have been taking strategic decisions to diversify our energy sources and increase the share of renewable and nuclear power because this is key to balancing economic, security and environmental needs. Our policy for the UAE's energy security is designed under a multidimensional strategy to reduce external dependencies and meet growing electricity consumption needs by providing diversification and alternative sources of energy. For example, our 2GW Al Dhafra Solar PV project recorded one of the most cost-competitive tariffs at AED0.0497/kWh on a levelized cost basis. This is nearly 44% lower that the worldrecord tariff achieved for the 1.2GW Noor Abu Dhabi Solar PV project in 2017. When the Al Dhafra Solar PV IPP project is completed by 2022, it will bring the total solar power generation capacity in the Emirate to 3.2GW, and if we add in the baseload nuclear energy expected upon full operation of the four nuclear reactors at the Barakah plant, we are talking about 8.8GW of installed clean and renewable energy capacity within three to four years—more than 31% of the total energy mix in Abu Dhabi. We are pressing ahead in addressing energy security and all other dimensions of the energy transition by deploying diverse sustainable energy generation sources, investing in new energy technologies, and advancing our energy infrastructures, thus improving our system resilience toward an effective energy transition.</p><h4>What are the immediate priorities for the Department of Energy, and what are the major lessons learned from this period?</h4><p>Energy has always been a critical component of Abu Dhabi's socioeconomic development and the quality of life, health, and wellbeing of its people. The government, which owns 6% of the world's proven oil reserves, has also taken proactive measures, including the announcement of a stimulus package to help counter any fallout from COVID19. Initiatives include AED5 billion to subsidize water and electricity for citizens and commercial and industrial activities. However, as we rebuild from the crisis, we need to ensure that lower revenues from oil and gas exports do not disrupt our economic diversification plans or our targets to diversify our energy mix. Investing in sustainable projects is imperative to a healthy recovery. We will continue to leverage our solar resources and boost exploration of enabling technologies such as renewable hydrogen and continue to adapt our regulatory and policymaking frameworks to support the integration of clean and renewable energy into our system. The most important strategic option for us is to increase energy efficiency and behavioral change. The individual and community consumption of energy is one of the most important factors that affect energy use, energy security, and a sustainable future.</p><h4>How is government tackling the energy trilemma, and what disconnects are there when it comes to the environment and economy?</h4><p>The pandemic has magnified the role of energy in today's life—it showed that energy is fundamental to national security and social and economic growth, and there is a nexus approach to water, energy, food, and environmental securities. Energy transition is a journey, and you need to have a reason. Different countries have different agendas for making the transition. Meeting the Energy Trilemma requires striking a balance between the three goals of energy security, social impact, and environmental sustainability, and that will always depend on each country's conditions and socioeconomic interests. I categorize our investment in other sources of energy under knowledge of economy. If you have knowledge of these, you are able to decide how much you can hit them, when, and by how much. The energy transition is all about what you truly want to achieve, and that will serve your country much better. We have been able to maintain our good performance on energy security and equity and witnessed significant environmental benefits, which present us with new opportunities to further strengthen our system resilience and review our policies in light of new environmental possibilities. In particular, energy security is integral to social, economic, food, and environmental securities. We must work in harmony if we are ever to solve the energy trilemma and attain sustainable development.</p><h4>How do you assess the opportunity for Abu Dhabi to enhance its role on the regional and global stage as a leader in renewable energy?</h4><p>Within the GCC region, Abu Dhabi has been the most remarkably successful entity in seizing the opportunities brought about the global shift to renewable energy to address the rise of climate change. The Emirate, in spite of its vast hydrocarbon reserves, has embarked on an ambitious journey to diversify its domestic sources of energy. In 2008, we established Masdar, the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company, and maximized investment in renewable projects locally and abroad as well as R&amp;D, thus cementing the Emirate's position as a leader in clean energy technology. Since then, we have been investing heavily in big renewables infrastructure. Over the past few years our solar PV projects—like Noor Abu Dhabi and the 2GW Al Dhafra project—have been making headlines due to their large capacity and operational and cost efficiencies. Today, the UAE accounts for over 70% of all installed renewable energy capacity in the region. In addition, it ranks top three worldwide in the production of concentrated solar power. The large renewable energy projects not only help to meet our evergrowing local consumption needs but also attract foreign investment and international knowhow to Abu Dhabi, which is essential to developing our local knowledge economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Grupo Aldesa, with 52 years, has consolidated itself as one of the leading construction companies. How has the company developed over this time?</h4><p>We are essentially a construction group that has invested in quality and hired local people in order to develop local employment. We also try to invest in economically disadvantaged regions. The company was founded in 1969 and changed hands in 1991. We went from being a small company to developing all areas of civil works. Roads were part of the company's beginnings, and gradually we began expanding into other areas of activity. We entered the private sector and began working in residential and non-residential construction. In early 2000, we started looking for other companies that could contribute to the development of the company. One of them was Coalvi, from Zaragoza, and this has allowed us to become a leading company in the construction of high-speed railroads, both in terms of tracks and stations. Around 2006, we were presented with the opportunity to break into Mexico through the hotel industry and we decided to acquire a plot of land in Huatulco. In addition, we also began operations in Krakow, Poland, by selling an office building that we had previously built.</p><h4>China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC), the second-largest construction company in the world, entered as majority shareholder for 75% in May 2020. How have your daily operations changed since then?</h4><p>For several years we tried to reach 1 billion euros of annual turnover and it was not possible. We have limits by the type of projects and investment. At that time, we saw the need for and investment partner. CRCC was extremely interested in meeting with us, and we ended up signing with it. It is a macro company with a turnover of USD20 billion with continuous growth. We have found the partner we needed in order to grow. It was interested in us because it found us to be a transparent company that was present in Europe and Latin America. The management of the group has not changed because we continue to manage it. At the company strategy level, CRCC brings a huge financial capacity, and our strategy has changed. Without bank guarantees, our company was not able to operate, and thanks to CRCC, we can access bigger projects with fewer competition and higher margins. CRCC has a large purchasing capacity. Our situation and strategy have changed radically. All this makes us more efficient and forces us to plan more and organize our time well.</p><h4>Grupo Aldesa has a broad portfolio of business lines, such as construction, industrial, technological solutions, investment activities, and the renewable business. How would you describe your current portfolio?</h4><p>The investment part of the company is extremely relevant because they were projects that required a higher amount of capital. We were able to access some of these types of projects, but we now have the financial capacity to cover even more of them. Aldesa is extremely interested in renewables. We also develop our own parks. We currently have an agreement with a company to develop for it a park and do the EPC ourselves. For example, in Portugal the auctions were at knock-down prices. In Latin America, we are building many parks in Chile and Colombia, as well as other places. This is an issue of great concern to governments. It seems as though construction is a polluting business, but this is not always the case. You can do sustainable business by using materials that are better than others at the same price from an ecological point of view. We have ventures in real estate as well as in industrial sector.</p><h4>The group is present in 14 markets. Which ones are your most profitable markets at the moment?</h4><p>For many years, Mexico was the leader, a market that accounted for more than 60% of the group's turnover although it has experienced a small decline. Now, the country is more unstable due to the pandemic. Poland is one of our main markets; it has not been a strong market, but it took advantage of all the European funds it had to continue developing projects. The first wave did not hit Poland too hard, and it was able to continue developing projects. In 2021, Poland will remain one of our main countries. In Mexico, we have an interesting project to build a subway line, although this project will likely materialize in 2022 due to its complexity. In Uruguay, we are working on a highway project; meanwhile, in Chile, we are closing an agreement with a company from our group for the Pan-American Highway. We are now in Peru, but it is more complicated from a public perspective because it takes a long time to make decisions. We also build hotels and are about to complete the Muna Museum, an impressive archeological museum. In Europe, apart from Poland, we have also been present in Slovakia and have already completed a project there. We are also studying some railroad projects in Croatia while in Norway, we have completed a tunnel and tunnel lighting works. In Denmark, we are finishing a project. Our strategy in Europe is to continue in the countries where we are present. Although we have a powerful partner, we are still the same Aldesa we have always been. The strategy is always to grow, though you cannot grow in every country at any price. It is important to move slowly because while expanding into more than one country, it is necessary to control all of them. Growth will be seen in terms of the quality and volume of projects.</p><h4>What impact has the pandemic had on Grupo Aldesa?</h4><p>We have advanced heavily in terms of digitalization in the corporate part of the company. Thanks to this, we were fairly well prepared for the pandemic. The great advantage is that one can telework and improve the quality of their lives. There are sectors that can move to 100% teleworking, but in our case, it would be a combined one because we have people working on building. In civil engineering works, which is what we do mostly in Spain, you have to be physically present. In terms of real estate, there is talk of digitalization and making modules in factories. This will be a breakthrough. The combination of face-to-face and teleworking is positive and is a great for our team.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The pandemic has been difficult, but has driven sales of electronic devices and demand for services. How have you adapted during this unique time?</h4><p>The challenges of 2020 continued, in varying degrees, into the new year. Nevertheless, as a global company operating in 180 markets and with more than 30 manufacturing sites around the world, the outlook for 2021 remains positive. The new global norm of work, study, and play from home will continue to drive long-term and sustainable growth trends in device demand and infrastructure requirements. We have experienced an increase in sales across many of these domains, as businesses and individuals alike seek to invest in PCs, desktops, tablets, and monitors to remain productive from wherever they may be. Our channel partners have been instrumental in ensuring that products and advice reach end customers, helping to guide purchase journeys. At the height of the pandemic, we extended warranties on all Lenovo products, understanding that it was not always possible for customers to visit physical stores. Since then, we have also focused our efforts on advancing digital engagements, through virtual product launches, access to experts via collaboration technology, and more. In terms of services available to enterprise customers, we have Premier Support, an optional add-on that grants access to dedicated 24-hour support, a single point of contact for troubleshooting, and rapid case management. For any individual starting out their business with a single device and the average consumer, we also offer our Premium Care service. With this option, our customers can gain access to assistance on hardware, software, and peripherals to get the most out of their investments. We also provide an annual PC health check to keep devices in optimal condition.</p><h4>What are Lenovo's key lines of business in Saudi Arabia, and which saw the best performance and growth in 2020?</h4><p>Our focus is on creating smarter technology for all, which means having a diverse portfolio of devices to cater to every need. We continue to see growth across specific categories such as gaming, especially in Saudi Arabia, where our Legion series has been well received by local communities. In recent months, we have introduced a series of new features, upgrading our lineup with ultra-responsive TrueStrike keyboards and industry-leading cooling technology, known as Legion Coldfront 2.0. SMBs form the backbone of the local economy, and during the pandemic, no community was more greatly affected. Ensuring continuity and growth for such a sector requires technology that is not only reliable, but also affordable. To cater to such needs, we are also continuing to upgrade our series of ThinkBook PCs. Our premium devices are also receiving great traction locally, such as our Yoga series of PCs. In December, we also introduced a new concept to the Saudi market, with the launch of the ThinkPad X1 Fold, the world's first foldable PC. We look forward to seeing how users across the Kingdom leverage this device to accelerate their own achievements, and we are confident in the positive impact it will make.</p><h4>How has your cloud business evolved over the past year, and what have the Kingdom's regulatory changes meant for this business?</h4><p>For the past few years, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has focused on advancing digitalization, through measures such as a cloud-first approach. As working from home became essential, reliance on multiple workloads reached new heights and caused businesses to invest in cloud infrastructures to securely collaborate with a highly distributed workforce. We witnessed a clear paradigm shift, where cloud investments went from being a best practice and nice-to-have, to a fundamental requirement. A successful cloud strategy must consider the whole lifecycle, from securely and rapidly migrating data to managing it and helping it grow with the business. Cloud solutions may soon be the norm for all kinds of businesses, but there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Every business must consider workloads, infrastructure, and overall organizational needs. Lenovo engineers hybrid cloud solutions from top to bottom, to work as a cohesive system, regardless of whether a business chooses public, private, or hosted solutions and server or software. We are continuing to ensure that our cloud solutions deliver a truly end-to-end approach. We integrate security, scalability, and agility to maintain a seamless IT environment.</p><h4>Technology remains at the center of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 plans, and regulation has moved rapidly in the Kingdom. What key regulatory changes have impacted your business overall?</h4><p>We commend the work of the government in advancing regulations policymaking at a rapid pace, benefiting industry, businesses, and individuals alike. The introduction of a framework to regulate e-commerce and retailers, for example, indicates a clear focus on ensuring that service providers remain transparent and protect customer transactions and data. Such policies are deeply embedded in our practices, but we welcome the formalization of the market as well as more players coming in from onboard. The G20 TechSprint Initiative further echoed the focus on regulatory improvements, designed to showcase the potential for new technologies to resolve operational issues in areas of compliance and supervision. The three winning firms illustrated a clear focus on tackling issues such as information sharing, monitoring, surveillance, and regulatory reporting, backed by the government and Saudi G20 Presidency with cash prizes of USD50,000 for each problem solved. Beyond the G20 Presidency, the national agenda overall also encompasses many investment themes, including the development of digital content and media, expansion of the telecommunications industry, and the creation of new high-tech and smart industries via digitalization. Technology is the ultimate driver in enabling continuity, growth and innovation, and this is true whether we consider education, healthcare, logistics or even startup environments. Lenovo devices are empowering people across these industries and more to maximize their potential, working with greater agility to aid business growth. Saudi Arabia is a crucial market for every technology company today due to the sophistication of the market and the pace at which it transforms and the backing of government entities is driving meaningful change. It is also great to see the government supporting small and medium businesses, which constitute up to 99% of all private sector organizations in the country, account for 70% of employment, and contribute 20% of the Kingdom's GDP. The country has plans to grow this contribution further, and new regulations and opportunities for SMEs will help make this a reality. As a company, we are also focusing on empowering small businesses across the Kingdom.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the successful public offering of Alkhorayef Water and Power Technologies and mean for the company moving forward?</h4><p>The successful listing of Alkhorayef Water and Power Technologies in early 2021 is demonstrated by the strong turnout from investors. The institutional book-building process was 6,320% oversubscribed, while the retail offering was also 1,511% oversubscribed, reflecting investor confidence in the company. Shares of AlKhorayef Water and Power Technologies Co. (AWPT) rose by 30% to SAR93.60 (+SAR21.60 vs. the IPO price of SAR72) on its debut on the Saudi Stock Exchange. Our transformation into a listed company develops our strategy for corporate governance and sets solid foundations for the company's future objectives of sustainable growth and extended foothold in the sector.</p><h4>How will the government's privatization initiatives impact the company's future operations and plans?€¨</h4><p>Water is a vital natural resource to sustain life, and this has propelled the water sector into a top priority sector for development of nations and their wellbeing. In Saudi Arabia, growth in the government's spending on the water sector remains intact despite economic volatility and, most notably, COVID-19. This is evidenced by the water market's CAGR of 7% between 2015 and 2020, as well as the exponential growth of total government expenditure on the water market from 1% in 2015 to 2.3% in 2020. Moreover, the Saudi National Water Strategy 2030 set a clear roadmap that included several strategic programs, namely the privatization of water treatment and distribution, wastewater treatment, and reuse of treated sewage effluent. Alkhorayef Water and Power's expertise across the value chain of water and wastewater gives the company tremendous growth market potential in a sector driven by the national water strategy and Vision 2030 mandates. Alkhorayef Water and Power, with its network of strategic partnerships with global water companies and its qualifications to participate in bids with SWPC and other privatization offtakers, have an unmatched potential for growth with the privatization market forecasted to expand CAGR 44.8% in the next four years. Drawing on the company's wealth of expertise, resources, and leadership, we are in prime position to leverage the privatization efforts and foresee our company to be one of the major developers in utilities in the future.</p><h4>What impact did COVID-19 have on the company's operations and performance?</h4><p>Since the COVID-19 outbreak and to date, Alkhorayef Water and Power Technologies continues to provide reliable and vital water and sanitation services across the Kingdom. It adapted to this extraordinary and unprecedented situation by taking the necessary precautionary measures. The company successfully maintained its top priorities, namely: preserving the health and safety of all employees and citizens and working diligently to limit the spread of the virus. Being a leading water services provider, Alkhorayef Water continues to demonstrate steadfast commitment to providing excellent services in line with customers' expectations. The company is making all efforts to support its customers and meet their needs through maintaining services undisrupted in this core sector. Moreover, the company expanded its operations by starting several full-scale operation and maintenance projects that includes water, wastewater, treated sewage effluent networks, and systems in various regions of Saudi Arabia at the peak of the COVID-19 lockdown during the first half of 2020 and continues to do so to this day. We demonstrated strong immunity against the pandemic implications and the subsequent restrictions. This is evidenced by our 2020 results showing a 23% revenue growth and a 24% rise in net income compared to 2019. The company reported in 2020 a net profit margin of 22% while preserving great value for shareholders by generating return on invested capital and equity at 31% and 39%, respectively, compared to 2019. Additionally, the company maintains a good sector diversification. Each sector in the company posted remarkable growth from 2019 to 2020. The water sector recorded 18% growth. The wastewater and integrated water solutions sectors reported an increase of 36% and 17%, respectively. Alkhorayef Water and Power is committed to the daily delivery of its essential services throughout Saudi Arabia to meet people's needs for water and sanitation. Our company possesses extensive experience, strong organizational skills, and expert teams that allows it to function under intense pressure and fulfill its duties, even in adverse conditions.</p><h4>Can you share details about Alkhorayef Water's growth in the last four years, cash flows, and the reasons behind growth sustainability?</h4><p>In the last four years, the company combined a 28% growth in revenue with an increase in gross profit margins from 16% in 2017 to 28% in 2020. The water sector's profit margins hit 29%, 34% for the wastewater sector, and 10% for the integrated water solutions. During that period, EBITDA rose at CAGR of 54% to SAR134 million in 2020. The EBITDA margin expanded to 26% in 2020 from 15% in 2017. Meanwhile, net profit recorded a CAGR of 72% in the same period. Profit margins more than doubled from 10% in 2017 to 22% in 2020. We were able to strengthen the company's financial position throughout the growth period. We maintained the gearing ratio at 34% in 2020. Collection rates also improved during the same period, with the accounts receivable turnover declining from 202 days in 2017 to 114 days in 2020. In addition, the return on invested capital hit 31% in 2020, rising 16 points, compared to 2017. The return on equity (ROE) stood at 39% in 2020, rising 10 points from 2017. We also maintained a high current ratio at an average rate of 2.8. For cash generation, the company translated profits into positive cash flows from operations, which hit SAR81  million in 2020. This outstanding performance and growth were driven by over 30 years of experience, top-caliber leadership, and management, along with advanced systems including cost and performance control. This, in turn, led Alkhorayef Water to hold a leading market share in the operation and maintenance field. In addition, the company has a strong presence in project services throughout the entire supply chain of the water and wastewater sectors. This offers excellent growth opportunities going forward.</p><h4>What about the company's backlog, expansion, and future plans?</h4><p>Our track record is also evident by the evolution of our backlog, which is the representation of AWPT's portfolio of residual revenue stemming from ongoing works. Our backlog expanded by around three times from the beginning of year 2017 till the end of year 2020. The expansion was driven mainly by the ability of the company to maintain a constant growth in the annual new awards. The backlog at year end 2020 stands at SAR1.1 billion, with 2.7 times growth from the beginning of year 2017. We are also eyeing acquisitions in the future that complements our portfolio to spur the expansion in KSA and regionally as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has Dell played in helping companies adapt to remote work?</h4><p>We envisioned Dell playing a key role as the supplier of all the equipment required for schools, large corporations, and the government to stay connected and work from home. I would define 2020 as a year in which we worked closely with customers to define their digital strategies, because most of them faced many challenges in terms of serving customers, delivering products, and providing solutions and products. Most were also struggling to modernize their data centers, which is another direction we took in order to help customers. The third one is helping them with how to deal with all the data they generate from their customers, industries, and plants. Dell has been playing a key role in the last four or five years integrating with EMC to become Dell Technologies in which we have helped many customers face the challenges of COVID-19 through infrastructure technologies such as storage and hybrid cloud and work-from-home technologies.</p><h4>What steps is Dell taking to become the most essential technology company in the data area?</h4><p>In 2021, it is hard to imagine just how many devices will be connected via 5G technology and how many devices are generating data with technology such as IoT. All this data is now interconnected, and everyone is generating content and data that can be used for many things such as identifying market trends, following up on marketing campaigns, and most importantly change the dynamics of many industries. It will be a data-driven world in which computers will know more about ourselves than we do. In order to do that, they need storage power, the right architecture, and a hybrid model to get the best use of all the clouds and infrastructure. Most importantly is how all this information will be protected in a secure way because of the type of data and how sensitive the information is.</p><h4>What would you consider to be Dell's added value in comparison to other players in the market?</h4><p>The big difference is that regardless of the size of companies and corporations, almost every company manages between two and four public clouds as well as data on premise, or what we call private cloud or local information. The most important thing that we do is define and design architectures in a hybrid way, combining public clouds and companies' on-premise data or processing power. We define an architecture that allows them to get the advantage of every single architecture or model out there.</p><h4>Are you planning to partner with FedEx to create hubs for innovation here in Mexico?</h4><p>We are a global company, so when something works in one place, we replicate it somewhere else. Right now, the company is heavily focusing on transforming most of our solutions and products into a service model. During the pandemic, customers want consumption models in which they can define how long they will use, buy, rent, or acquire those systems based on their individual demands. We have to be extremely flexible in order to offer those types of solutions as a service. Right now, we are focusing on the direction that this company is taking as a service model and learning how we can implement that in Latin America and Mexico.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Dell in 2021? What kind of performance are you expecting in Mexico in comparison to 2020?</h4><p>We will strongly promote the multi-cloud environment or architecture. Customers are willing to focus on this, so you will hear more from Dell on that. You will also hear more from Dell about the work-from-home transformation initiatives, as well as understanding the challenges and, most importantly, the strategy corporations want to take in order to transform their organizations digitally. We talked about data, new processes, and digitalization in which companies need a great deal of help. It is highly related to what companies can do with all the data they are generating. We have also been releasing studies, surveys, and analyses. We recently  released a report on the future of work, education, and the economy and how new technologies will impact our lives and the way we do business. Right now, it is extremely important to have a solid technological infrastructure and the right design in order to be scalable, flexible, and adaptable to one's needs, be it the government, business, enterprise, or others.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the government supporting the development of the mining industry, and what policies are in place to this extent?</h4><p>There are a number of policies focused on making capital-intensive industries much more attractive for investors. One of our main policies is the diversification of the mining matrix. Colombian mining exports are dominated by thermal coal, but we have significant potential in metallic minerals, in particular gold and copper, which happen to be two of the minerals critical for the energy transition. We have a competitive process to award mining blocks or contracts. We started with five blocks for copper in La Guajira and Cesar. They have incentives for investors because the licensing process will be expedited, both for mining and environmental licenses. We started the diversification process last year with the Buritica mine, the largest underground mine in Colombia. It is a gold mine and produces around 240,000 ounces of gold per year. Gold production will increase about 20% as a result. The second important project is the Gramalote mine in Antioquia, whose construction phase will start in the second half of this year. The investment for this phase was roughly USD1 billion, and the mine will add around 180,000 ounces of gold per year, which amounts to another increase of around 22%. The demand for gold has been spiking by about 5% worldwide because it is purchased as a secure asset in times of crises. The production of gold increased by 40% and in 4Q2020 we produced around 13.9 tons of gold, the highest production of gold in the last four years. We also have a strategy of three corridors of gold and copper. There are potential projects starting in the southern part of the country going to Antioquia, Chocó, Bolivar, Córdoba, Cesar, and La Guajira. In terms of the general policies to increase investments, we will gradually reduce tax rates from 33% to 30%, and we fixed the VAT payment on fixed assets 100% creditable to corporate income tax; basically, we eliminated VAT on such investments. Similar arrangements were made to other taxes like the Industry and Commerce Tax (ICA). The copper market will tighten over the next decade as energy transitions accelerate. Copper is needed for solar panels, wind turbines, large scale batteries, and electric vehicles.</p><h4>What is the country's strategy to diversify the energy matrix and reach carbon neutrality?</h4><p>What Colombia has achieved over the past few years in sustainable mobility is remarkable. In 2019, as a result of the national electric vehicle law, Colombia became the number-one country in Latin America in sales of EVs, with almost 1,000 units in that year. We were able to surpass Chile and the Dominican Republic, which were leading the ranks in Latin America. Fast forward to 2020, and despite the pandemic, Colombia increased its sales of electric vehicles and hybrids by 90%, and for the second year we had the highest EV sales in the region. In March 2021, we sold 998 electric vehicles and hybrids, an increase of 206% compared to March 2020. In the quarter as a whole there was an increase of 160%. Colombia has taken off as the leader of EVs and hybrids in Latin America, and we expect to reach about 10,000 in 2021 alone. The fiscal incentives include a reduced VAT rate of 5%, no import duties, a maximum 5% tax on vehicles, commercial discounts on insurance and other services, and exemption from restriction of mobility like Pico y Placa or day without a car. However, electric mobility only works if the electricity that we produce is clean; otherwise, the EVs would not make a difference. Colombia has one of the cleanest matrices in the world because we depend on hydropower, but we have significant potential for solar and wind. This was one of our priorities when we took office, because that potential was unexploited. In 2018, less than 0.5% of the power matrix was made up of renewables. We improved fiscal incentives in the national development plan. We did an auction for variable renewables in October—the first double-sided auction in the world where both generators and buyers of electricity came to a platform and made bids on the price and quantity of energy—because we decided to let the private industry join the platform. We ended up with 2,500MW, which means we will go from less than 0.5% of the power in the matrix made up of variable renewables in 2018 at least 10% by 2022. We multiplied the installed capacity of these sources of energy by seven times, 10 solar farms came online across the country, and in 2021 we will have 37 projects. Our goal is to go to 1,000MW. We will have the first wind project in La Guajira in December.</p><h4>How is the ministry working to widen access to energy resources and bring energy to communities? </h4><p>We still have a significant gap in energy coverage, around 2-3% of the population, which amounts to 400,000-500,000 households that lack access to electricity. It is one of our main policies as well. The goal for this government was to reach 100,000 families that do not have energy in the coming four years. The past administration reached about 67,000, so we increased that significantly. We just reach in April half of the goal: 50,000. We have about 15,000 homes with solar panels, especially in remote, rural places that cannot connect to the grid. Roughly 28,000 are in places affected by the conflict, so it is part of our equity strategy. By the end of 2021, the timeline is to reach 70,000 new homes. This will also be complemented by efforts by the private sector.</p><h4>What is in store for Colombia in the matter of renewable energy options?</h4><p>We will leave the regulatory framework for offshore wind farms. Finally, we are deploying advanced metering infrastructure in Colombia, which will replace the traditional electricity meters in households and businesses. The goal is to reach 75% of all customers by 2030. This is the first to digitalize the electricity market, which will be transformational for the sector, and it will be an investment of roughly COP5 billion. Aligned with the vision to structure reactivation around forward-looking technologies, Colombia will open an auction for renewables in the second half of 2021. We expect more than 5,000MW to participate in this auction, the bulk of them solar farms. We are conducting in 2Q2021 the first large-scale energy storage auction in Latin America. Colombia has significant potential for hydrogen energy provision because it is extremely rich in renewable water resources. We also have the three ingredients for hydrogen: solar, wind, and water. In this roadmap, we are identifying the markets domestically and for exports to build this industry for the next 30 years. We have partnerships with countries like Germany that are already choosing which countries can provide them with hydrogen over the next 30 years. The second investment opportunity is geothermal resources. We started the first pilot in March with Parex resources, which is already using it to power its oil fields. Ecopetrol will also have a pilot project toward the end of the year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies are you using to help your members in times of recession?</h4><p>CAAAREM has been working for many years to strengthen the jobs and security of customs brokers. We constantly propose their professionalization through obtaining licenses and constant training. The most important strategy is through the use of technology applied to customs control and the logistics process. With the technological tools that CAAAREM has developed, customs brokers can provide our clients with a comprehensive offering. Another strategic area is the job that we are doing with the authorities to facilitate foreign trade operations, which in this pandemic is valuable for our clients and the entire logistics chain. The engine of the national economy is foreign trade, which was negatively impacted by this pandemic. However, trade continued to flow because we are in a strategic sector that cannot stop. Communication with the authorities has been good, which allowed us to make important decisions quickly to protect the health of our stakeholders in customs.</p><h4>How have customs brokers adapted their business to the challenges posed by the pandemic?</h4><p>To a large extent, we have achieved a level of technological connectivity in customs that has allowed us to continue to operate under the new reality. Many businesses had to digitally evolve over the last few months, but customs agencies and logistics companies have been successfully working in this area for at least the last two decades. We have to continue to transform and modernize our customs system. We can always become more efficient, and an organization like CAAAREM must foster transformation and innovation and support our country in difficult times. Thanks to the investment in technology, customs agencies continued to operate after we sent our employees to work from their homes. We implemented a hybrid model, putting into place safety measures for warehouse operators, truck drivers, and our workers in the borders. We had to learn to evaluate the performance of our collaborators via other metrics. Innovation always helps us to evolve. Another point is the relations between our clients and suppliers. Before, we had to travel frequently to visit them and understand their operations and needs. Today, we have become more productive by using the internet. We do not waste time with transportation and we are more punctual. We also have to highlight the jobs that never stopped operations. Other customs authorities in the world were shut down or had significantly more difficult processes. Our customs borders have been up to the challenge.</p><h4>What are the most important projects in which you are collaborating?</h4><p>CAAAREM has several goals. Among them is to strengthen the country's foreign trade, and to achieve that we are working with the customs authorities. The pandemic has not stopped, and we must continue down our path. We work with the General Administration of Customs (AGA) and the Mexican Tax Administration Service (SAT) to improve the fight against corruption and smuggling and ensure tax is collected properly. The modernization of customs does not stop, so we have to continue to invest, especially in technology to have the best controls. We are working with other institutions to improve the competitiveness of domestic ports and logistics services.</p><h4>What are your main priorities and goals for 2021?</h4><p>The sector must continue to strengthen the mechanism of the customs agency and the competitiveness of each region where the customs brokers of CAAAREM are represented through our associations. It is important to continue with our processes of professionalization and certifications, such as the licenses to become an authorized economic operator to facilitate operations and make them safer. We also have to work closely with the private and public sectors to strengthen Mexican customs. Our priorities include making processes easier, encouraging more legitimate trade and tax collection, and fighting against corruption. It is essential to create prosperity through foreign trade, which we can achieve by working together.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the goals of the foundation?</h4><p>The foundation was established in 2017 due to the necessity to build a protocol for social projects. Iberdrola has been present in Mexico for the last 20 years, and in that time we have been involved in social programs. Social corporate responsibility divisions are new for many Mexican companies, and the foundation was created to institutionalize our extensive experience in social programs. There are four key areas in which the foundation works: education areas; investigation; climate change; and improving the ecosystems in Mexico. We have another focus on art and culture in Mexico and another area in social support. In social support, we gather all our actions for communities and all programs to support the communities in which we operate. We are closely aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, as well.</p><h4>What are your goals for the Luces de Esperanza program, and how has the foundation evolved in the states of San Luis Potosí­ and Oaxaca?</h4><p>Luces de Esperanza is one of our priority projects. The project started with a company called Ilumexico, a Mexican start-up. The goal is to use the power of the sun through solar panels for rural communities, and this program has been extremely successful and has enjoyed wide-spread acceptance in the communities. The first stage started in the municipality of Tamazunchale, and we installed 50 units in homes, schools, community centers, and health centers. We not only provided electricity to families, but also brought electricity to health centers that did not have them. We started that project in that area with five-year goal. In Oaxaca, we have another five-year goal to install solar panels. In this project, we want to support schools, health centers, and community centers. It is not enough to provide electricity in homes; it is also important to have freezers in hospitals to store the vaccines safely.</p><h4>How does the foundation improve communication between Iberdrola and the local communities?</h4><p>We cannot implement a project without understanding their needs. To achieve that, we work closely with our operative teams in communities because they understand best the problems that they face. We are constantly in touch with the local authorities to understand them and the challenges that they face. The projects that Iberdrola develops in these regions are long term, so we work closely with the local authorities and communities to adapt and customize our projects to meet what they need.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your work in research and development?</h4><p>We have another project that has to be completed within five years, which is a STEM program. We seek to get more young people interested in these areas. These are the best-paid jobs, where there are more opportunities. We have launched that project in Oaxaca, and we are particularly focusing on women in this project to close the gender gap and support more women studying these degrees. For this program, we have a partnership with the Institute of Renewable Energy of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and the Universidad Tecnológica de los Valles Centrales de Oaxaca. With them, we have been able to provide training for teachers in the local schools. Some of the local teachers were not aware of the benefits that these STEM areas can bring to students. In addition, we launched a program of student grants to ensure they continue with their studies. This is an offer of 100 student grants during the next five years.</p><h4>What are some of your programs for 2021?</h4><p>We have another program in the area of Oaxaca as we are heavily focused on the Southeastern region in Mexico. The program is called Construir para Educar. The region is still experiencing the aftereffects of the 2017 earthquake, and more than 4,000 schools in Oaxaca still require some sort of support in terms of reconstruction. Our goal was to rebuild several schools in five years. To achieve that, we are working with the local authorities to improve the educational infrastructure in the area. The goal of this project is to benefit 10,000 students to ensure they continue with their studies.</p><h4>Are you collaborating with other private companies in the regions?</h4><p>Not for this project. We have worked with local and federal authorities. This is how we have always worked, though we are always open to collaboration. We are members of different chambers in an attempt to find partners; this is really important for us.</p><h4>How did the pandemic affect you?</h4><p>The technological transformation has been massive. Most of our programs are done in-person with the communities, and we had to reinvent that and do them digitally. Many of the procedures in the company are being done digitally, for example. We have also implemented measures to provide gloves, masks, and other equipment to doctors in the regions. On top of this. we also implemented a program to distribute disinfecting gel and other equipment in communities. We have also delivered food items and cleaning products. Our company donated many supplies and goods to these communities in response to COVID-19.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on your Smart Solar program and the business model behind this project that makes it profitable for Iberdrola and the companies that use it?</h4><p>Iberdrola has been present in Mexico for more than 20 years, working in line with the development of the country. Before Smart Solar started, our business model was to build power generation plants and sell the energy to our commercial and industrial clients. With Smart Solar now, we do the same, though the electricity generations units are built within the facilities of our clients. We use a roof, the parking space, or a piece of land close to the facility, and we install some photovoltaic units that are directly connected to the customer's grid and will constantly generate electricity that we sell to the client. By doing this, Iberdrola invests in the photovoltaic system. We run the financial risks, and the client does not have to make an investment. The client gains savings through the energy that we generate through our solar panels, which are sold at a competitive price. That price does not include additional rates for the use of the grid because the energy is being generated and consumed in the same place. We developed the company in 2018, drew up all the contract schemes and the entire internal process that would be related to the business in 2019, and started offering our services in 2020. By the end of the year, we were able to sign our first contracts.</p><h4>How many companies in Mexico are using your services?</h4><p>We signed five contracts in 2020, and these projects are currently being executed. We expect them to start generating electricity for our clients by mid-2021. For 2021, we have signed agreements to install 30 units that will represent 15MW of generation capacity. Each system will have 500kW. We want to add more clients and power plants to these Smart Solar projects in 2021. We provide these services in every location in Mexico. We are focusing on manufacturing companies, companies that offer storage service, firms in the logistics sector, and food and beverage companies, among others. Such firms can install our solar panels in their factories or distribution centers.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on the bureaucratic processes to develop these projects?</h4><p>This is an additional advantage of Smart Solar; projects that are under 500kW do not require a change in the energy supply or the issuance of a license for energy generation, which speed up the process. It can take up to nine months to develop each project after the contract is signed. We are focusing on SMEs in the industrial area, including chemicals, automotive, and manufacturing, as well as companies that offer commercial services. We could include retail stores, hotels, or any other company that consumes energy.</p><h4>There were some power outages in Mexico in early 2021. Will companies increasingly seek alternative energy suppliers because of that?</h4><p>A photovoltaic solution will not resolve the issue of a power cut, though we are more likely to see clients seeking alternatives for cheaper and cleaner energy. We are talking about energy being generated from solar power, and it will not only bring an economic benefit, but environmental benefits as well. For every MW/h generated by a photovoltaic system, there is a reduction of half a ton of CO2 emissions per year. Many companies are focused on the reduction of CO2 emissions, so we help them to achieve that goal without requiring the client to make an investment. Iberdrola makes the investment and runs with the financial risks connected to the program. We also cover the maintenance works of the assets during the contract duration so that clients can focus on their businesses.</p><h4>What strategies are you implementing to promote this service in Mexico?</h4><p>Before the lockdown, we were conducting presentations at industrial events. With the pandemic, that turned into webinars to talk about distributed generation and renewable energy. Smart Solar is operating under the distributed generation scheme. These webinars have been extremely useful to let clients know that there are different options. They no longer need to invest in these systems; it can be done with an investment from Iberdrola, and they pay a more competitive price for the energy that these panels generate than the current rates.</p><h4>What are the most common questions or doubts about the program?</h4><p>One of the most common questions is if Smart Solar can solve power outages; this is not the case. Another question is if the energy generated will only supply a part of an industrial unit, though that is also not always the case. The panels generate electricity and supply it to a specific area of a factory, but if they are not using that energy, it can be sent to other parts of the industrial units. Another possibility is to sell the energy that has been generated to the grid under different schemes. Many think the energy will only be consumed where the generation facility is located, but that does not have to be the case. It can also be a revenue source for companies if they sell their energy to the grid.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2021?</h4><p>We want more companies to discover these schemes. More companies are realizing there are different options to access energy. We offer a power purchase agreement (PPA) under a solar power generation facility installed in their factories. Our expectation is to see an increase in the demand for these solutions, which do not require a change in the energy supplier, are easy to install, and will bring economic and environmental benefits.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What main opportunities did Santander identify in the Mexican market, and what motivated it to launch Getnet?</h4><p>Mexico is still a market with a significant opportunity because 85% of all transactions involve cash. In Mexico, we have an electronic payment penetration of around 15-16% while in Latin America it is 25%. We have an opportunity for growth in Mexico with our new brand Getnet, which we launched in 2020. With this new technology, we are certain we will make a difference in payments. We will have major opportunities within Mexico because the market is not yet mature.</p><h4>What is your main differentiator or added value in Mexico?</h4><p>In the payments market, you need to look for different kinds of clients, such as small payments from the SME segment rather than just the corporate clients. We have an offer that reaches out to three segments: the corporate, the middle level, and SMEs. Getnet's objective is to connect all merchants no matter their size and help them achieve their goals through payments technology. We have a strong offering for the corporate and middle segments, with not only an omnichannel solution that we can give to our clients in all fronts but also an administrative way of consolidating all their transactions. We have a complete offering in Mexico right now for this segment. We are working on delivering the same quality and experience for small merchants. For example, we launched a new solution in which we will offer our SME clients a webpage that pays for an e-commerce solution that we will grow for them end to end. It will cost MXN299 per month, and all customers have to do is call us and provide us with some information. We can create the entire webpage for them in a few days, with not only the e-commerce landing page but also the payment terminals.</p><h4>What were your main priorities for 2020, and were you able to achieve them?</h4><p>Our main priorities for 2020 was first to launch the brand, and we have done a great job. Now, we will launch the first phase of marketing of our brand in Mexico. Getnet is the new solution for payments that Santander is delivering to the market, and its goal is to solve all the payment solutions of clients all around the world. We have many plans for e-commerce solutions but will focus on corporate and retail clients that have our solutions with our platform.</p><h4>What role do you envision for Getnet within the e-commerce market in Mexico?</h4><p>The market in Mexico has changed significantly as a result of COVID-19. When something like this happens, it hurts small merchants the most. I always ask our sales team to help SMEs, they are the base of our economy, and we need to help them grow; if they grow, we all grow. We need to give them solutions that are out of the box to help them sustain their businesses. Our first priority is to ensure we provide them with suitable merchant services so that they can have new solutions, for example delivery and e-commerce payments, which most of our small clients do not currently have. I also want to consolidate our current clients who are extremely familiar with our service. Our net promoted score is 80, and service is one of the most important things that we want to ensure. This includes working from home, as we need to take care of our people. 2021 will not be the same as 2020 but will be better. The first quarter will be difficult and perhaps so will the second, so we need to analyze that and make the correct decisions to give our clients the right e-commerce solutions to give customers at home the things they need.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights of Qatar's financial system last year? How has the pandemic affected stability and what measures have you taken to counter its impact?</h4><p>The banking sector, with a high level of capital and a low delinquency rate remains safe, sound, and solid. The proactive regulatory and supervisory approach of QCB ensures smooth sailing of the financial sector during the challenging periods. Enhanced macroprudential regulation and introduction of IFRS9 standards, necessitated banks to increase the holding of high quality liquid assets and provisioning for non-performing loans. Moreover, the banking sector has improved its funded liquidity by lengthening the maturity structure and expanding the geographical diversity of its external sources of funding. To mitigate the impact of the COVID19 pandemic, the government had implemented a stimulus package of over 11% of GDP. Within this framework, market liquidity is ensured through QAR50 billion zero REPO facility. New credit facilities through a national guarantee scheme and deferring the repayment of loan installments assisted the affected business units to mitigate the business losses due to restrictions imposed to contain the spread of COVID19 to a greater extent. Digital financing and other financial innovations are other focus areas for the banking sector during this period. Social distancing measures, shifting customer preferences and continuously changing the technological environment provided necessary momentum to these activities. QCB on its part is in the process of providing an enabling regulatory infrastructure, which defines the environment under which the financial sector should operate, while ensuring protection of customers. Needless to say, to enhance digital financial transactions and to support the social distancing measures, QCB has launched the Qatar Mobile Payment System during the year, which provides a new and safe method for fast electronic payment.</p><h4>What key policies and circumstances will determine the evolution of credit flow in Qatar in the next few years?</h4><p>Qatar was quick to respond to the blockade and the economy sailed through the challenging macroeconomic environment successfully. The financial sector returned to normalcy after an initial period of capital outflows. Qatar pursued various reform measures to meet the needs of international investors. The major thrust of the measures has been to strengthen and increase the space for the private sector, create an environment conducive for attracting foreign investment, and ensure the development of a knowledge-based economy by leveraging technology. A new Strategic Plan for Financial Sector Regulation was published in 2018, in close coordination among the three domestic regulators. The strategy provided a roadmap to guide the financial sector in its future endeavor towards building a sound and resilient financial sector.</p><h4>What would a consolidation wave mean for Qatar banking sector's profitability and efficiency, and how will this process develop in the next few years?</h4><p>The merger of two banks in 2019 originated from the individual banks, where the banks came with the consolidation proposal and QCB provided the necessary approval after conducting legal and financial due diligence. The feasibility study conducted showed the merger would be beneficial with lower cost and higher efficiency. The latest result published by the merged banks indicated the same whereas the merged entity reported increase in profits for the half year ended 2020. The possibility of further consolidation of banks depends solely on the individual banks business strategy. It is not desirable for the central bank to stifle the creativity and drive for efficiency of the banking sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the pandemic impacted your operations over the past 12 months, and how have you adapted to the new reality?</h4><p>Everyone was forced to adapt, some successfully and some not so much. Among the first things we did was to invoke our contingency planning, but no rulebook had a chapter on pandemics so a lot had to be adapted as we went along. Being part of an international group helped, as we benefited from lessons elsewhere in the world and resulting guidance. Given our systemic position in the local markets, our focus was to continue supporting our clients' needs and keeping the markets functional, while of course also keeping our staff safe and able to deliver even on remote basis. We intensified communication with our clients, including the government, and ensured our deliverables to the clients — big or small - and markets did not suffer. Our operational support turned out to be extremely resilient, and we were able to achieve full working-from-home while still being fully available to our clients and counterparties, and able to channelize our local and global resources as needed. Support of our local and global shareholder-partners ensured that our automation and digitization was accelerated, and clients were not impacted with the shift to our modified way of working. So for us, we were able to adapt to the pandemic and achieve business-as-usual very quickly. Apart from continuing to seamlessly execute some of the strategic transactions we have been involved in, this included sponsorship and speaking at key Saudi-focused events, such as the FII and Euromoney Saudi conferences.</p><h4>Was the impact contained, or was there a significant dip in activity due to the volatility in markets?</h4><p>We actually spotted many more opportunities as far as investment banking goes. Given our on-the-ground model supported by local and global network, we were better able to support large clients and the government in their Vision 2030 targets, and continued to support transformational activity without a blip. For instance, in the very first month of the outbreak, the Kingdom was involved in issuing a large multi-billion-dollar bond. We were leads on the issuance, and were able to guide it to success, including then issuing one in a tranche with the longest issued tenor of 40 years, which held up well in aftermarket. We also participated in a large syndicated loan financing for a GRE (government related entity) totaling USD10 billion. Having spotted the market opportunity, we pitched to key bank clients on the advantage of Tier 2 issuances. We did a few of those across the local and international markets, such issuances augmenting bank capital in addition to raising financing. We did the first 'green' sukuk out of Saudi Arabia, for Saudi Electricity Company, and the first 'green' ECA (Export Credit Agency) loan for the Kingdom's Ministry of Finance - in fact, the first for a sovereign in the entire MENA region. We advised PIF (Public Investment Fund) in an M&amp;A situation, co-investing with a Chinese investor into a port operator locally. We also advised on the largest-ever trade in the history of the Saudi Arabian market: the sale of SABIC shares by PIF to Saudi Aramco, and being the sole bank to cross the trade in the market. Similarly, we advised on the first government-led privatization for Saudi Grains Organization (SAGO), in line with the timeline put in place prior to the pandemic. We advised Saudi Electricity Company also on the conversion of its government liabilities, about USD45 billion equivalent in terms of size, into an equity-like non-dilutive shariah-compliant financial instrument. We also handled a number of cross-border M&amp;A deals and successfully completed the first wave of the government NCP (National Centre of Privatisation)-led PPP (Public Private Partnership) transactions for the construction of circa 60 schools. HSBC also helped kick-start the derivatives market on the exchange, and was the only foreign institution to be part of that initial set of banks at launch, and having provided a great deal of support to the market participants to reach that stage. We continue to help the market push developments on several fronts, for instance having done the first securities borrowing and lending trade, and more recently the first short selling trade. All these were done during the pandemic, and we hope to continue trailblazing on many other firsts as well while supporting the Kingdom's Vision 2030 agenda.</p><h4>Will this open up a myriad of opportunities for you in the post-pandemic era? What strategic visions have been brought to the agenda because of it?</h4><p>The pandemic has brought out the wisdom of Saudi Arabia's transformation and diversification agenda; to some extent, it even further solidified the country's intent to continue down this path. In terms of strategic shifts, it will accelerate privatization and financings across the board, whether in PPP, debt, or corporate modes. We will continue to be involved and support with a longer-term approach, and we are conscious of not being seen just as transactionally-focused. We are conscious that ultimately, the objective of privatization in the Kingdom is not so much to raise financing, but to be transformational and achieve diversification and acquire capabilities and technology via the transaction. We are approaching it in that spirit as well, engaging globally with our teams to attract the right kind of partners and investors. We see a great deal of transformation in the sector around fundraising, privatizations, and PPPs —across hard as well as soft infrastructure, across healthcare and education among others. Privatisations and PPP transactions are accelerating financing diversification as well, whether for buyout or leveraging. From a long-term and strategic perspective, we can absolutely add value in all these areas. And we have a great deal of value to add: for instance, on the PPP front, we are the only investment bank, local or international, with a dedicated infrastructure advisory team based in the Kingdom.</p><h4>What are your expectations over the next year?</h4><p>I do not expect things to return to the pre-pandemic “normal.“ Digitalization has 'tasted blood', as they say, and will accelerate. We already have a policy in place that allows for remote working, even post-pandemic: if the employee wishes and manager allows, they can work entirely remotely. As such, post-pandemic, there will certainly be a different way of working, although we do not see any signs of returning to anywhere near normal on the horizon and will continue to adapt. For instance, for the first time in more than a decade of running an investor conference physically in Saudi Arabia, we ran it fully virtually this year. We matched corporate clients with global investors, which took place at the end of March 2021. In the last year, the standout activities out of everything we did was debt financing and the retail equity market which was literally 'on fire'. People globally had been locked-in during the pandemic, and with nowhere to spend, they put their savings into the retail markets. The same happened in Saudi Arabia as well. On debt financing, large corporations and governments wanted to beef up their liquidity buffers ahead of an uncertain period. Apart from these two products, in other products also, we performed extremely well, executing on several equity, M&amp;A, and custody landmarks. After stripping out certain one-offs that happened in 2019, we saw and capitalised on growth in our business. Going forward, we expect growth in all of these products. There will also be other enablers for growth in the future, beyond the next 12-month period. Tadawul is going through a massive change program now, the PTTP (post-trade transformation program), the largest upgrade to its system, and aligning more with international markets, as well as supporting more product depth and diversity. When that kicks in in the latter half of the year, there will be growth in products, and we are extremely well-placed between the brokerage and custody products to capture that, notwithstanding the increase in competition. In investment banking, given our scale and the market position, we are already active in the key sectors that have equity and debt raising needs, whether it is in oil and gas, chemicals, consumers, energy, infrastructure, housing, or real estate. Moving forward, we see new sectors becoming more Vision 2030 thematic. Technology will certainly be one of those, and renewables will be another.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[fernando-lledo-managing-director-bupa]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision as Bupa's director, and what are you looking forward to achieving in this role?</h4><p>My goal is to improve what Bupa Mexico is today. We are leaders in the sector we work in, and we have done a great job so far. Our growth strategy is based on how we identify our capacity to generate health in the country. That is why Mexico was named, along with Brazil,  a priority country for the company. My vision is to become the number-one company in terms of generating health in the Mexican market.</p><h4>What position does Bupa have now in the Mexican market?</h4><p>Bupa is placed seventh if we group together health and accidents; however, we work with a specific segment, which is IPM. This product is for people who, in addition to treatment here, want to be treated in the US or in other countries throughout the world. We are leaders in this area, and we have experienced 5% growth. Bupa's vocation is to cover the largest possible number of people. We have carefully identified our target market, how to approach them, and, above all, with which products. Bupa is fairly sophisticated on the international side, and now we are complementing our capabilities in the Mexican market with other items. Now, in addition to being able to go to the doctor you choose, we recently acquired Vitamédica, which will allow our users access to its network of hospitals and medical providers. The services we now offer are more integrated and we can cover more people.</p><h4>Mexico has an extremely low percentage of people with medical insurance. What will Bupa do to increase this percentage?</h4><p>Even though there is a large population, the insurance market is small, and medical insurance companies have not been able to increase its market share in the country. Therefore, many companies are settling for people they already know and fighting for a slice of cake within this small market. In our case, we wanted to target people without medical insurance. The key to this challenge lies in prevention, namely how we can help people improve their health and reduce the number of times they have to go to the doctor to treat a serious illness. In addition, we will make sure they see the best specialists and are offered the best care. Medical insurance has two main sides that need to be constantly worked on and improved. The first is related to the operational side, that is, when you go to the doctor. This part of the process is crucial. We have invested MXN250 million to create a network that makes sure doctor visits are agile and efficient. The second one is the assistance side, namely when patients see a doctor and receive treatment. The doctor has to work within a series of protocols, and we make sure that happens.</p><h4>Does Bupa have medical centers? Are you looking to acquire existing medical centers?</h4><p>We are not acquiring existing medical centers but plan to create them for the exclusive use of our customers. These are non-profit medical centers that seek to offer quality and would not openly compete with other health providers. We aim to provide quality care for our insured people so that we can take care of their health in the best possible way. Bupa has about 13.6 million customers in the sector where we are the supplier. Not all Bupa countries have their own doctors, but we do offer these services in Spain, Chile, Poland, Brazil, and Peru. On the insurance side, we have 17.9 million customers worldwide.</p><h4>What is your vision for the medical insurance sector? What role will Bupa have?</h4><p>Regarding COVID-19, the market has an average expenditure of MXN420,000, but we are at MXN1.2 million. Our medical insurance is fairly wide, meaning we cover everything. In Bupa en Casa, we manage a patient's health without them having to go out or to the hospital. Almost 40% of the medical consultations we have had have been psychological. We always protect ourselves from physical illnesses, but lockdowns have also made psychological care a necessity.</p><h4>What are Bupa's main goals for this year?</h4><p>We will focus on the evolution of our products. In addition, we are working heavily with SMEs in order to insure their employees. We are also working to be medical providers. In two years, we have to double the number of medical insurance policies with Bupa. If right now we are at 250,000 insured people, in the next few years we should reach 350,000.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Jaguar decide to do a full circle model?</h4><p>We were able to attain 11 blocks in the 2.2 and 2.3 bidding rounds, which means that the size and scope of Jaguar are not normal for a start-up company. We are talking about over 2,000sqkm, a massive prospect inventory on the exploration side; however, of the 11 blocks we received from the government, five had legacy assets from Pemex that we were able to reactivate and start production. From day one we have been working on the exploration portfolio, though we were already a producer. When we started to look at developments in Mexico's natural gas industry, we realized there was a massive shift of focus and attention being placed on natural gas in Mexico. All we needed to do was be competent and efficient enough to displace imported gas from the US, so it seemed like a great opportunity to look at the whole cycle. We want to provide cost-effective energy and clean energy to Mexico, and the path we need to take to make it scalable to a significant size is exploration. We were always focused on developing the resource to the point of production, and in the last two years, we have learned that Mexican consumers are desperate to buy gas from Mexican suppliers. We realized there are market demand and a fundamental need in Mexico to displace electricity production with bunker fuel.</p><h4>What steps are you taking become the biggest and most diversified private company in onshore exploration, development, and production in Mexico?</h4><p>2020 was about becoming a competent operator, and this year is about starting to have a significant impact on the natural gas space. We are proud that our single-biggest achievement during the pandemic is to start drilling operations in March 2020 and operate the entire year with no accidents. One of the things we did this year, which is new in the industry, is implementing remote camps at all our drilling sites to reduce the commute and minimize the rotation of personnel on and off location. We were able to drill six wells successfully during the year and started a second rig at the end of 2020. We have been drilling exploration and delineation wells to date predominately. We plan to pick up a rig to start development activities in the northern part of the Burgos Basin, where we have existing gas resources, and ramp up production significantly over the next 12-24 months. In parallel, we will keep working on the exploration portfolio, which is of a caliber and size that can significantly impact on the total amount of reserves in Mexico. We will have two parallel tracks—one more focused on increasing production today and another generating the reserves we can produce in the coming years. That is the plan for this year.</p><h4>Why are few companies venturing into the natural gas supply segment?</h4><p>As a national oil company, Pemex needed to focus its energies on the areas that would be the most profitable in the short term, especially given the pressures it is under financially for the last five to 10 years. It was logical for it to look at large, oil-rich opportunities offshore where the profitability is more of a short-term issue. The lifecycle of a natural gas project is longer, from discovery to commercialization of the gas. There was an abundant supply from the US and existing infrastructure to bring gas into Mexico relatively easily. As a result, it is not a question of whether the gas resources in Mexico were attractive but the prioritization of Pemex. There is another factor here, namely the strategic decision made in the late 1990s in the Burgos Basin—where most of the large gas resources exist in Mexico—to turn over many of the operations to service companies. Unfortunately, that was not as successful in developing cost-effective production as everyone had hoped. There was the mistaken perception in the market that one could not produce gas in Burgos cost-effectively. However, there is a huge amount of opportunity in natural gas. Moving forward, relying on the US as a source of gas given the US market dynamics is a dangerous prospect for Mexico. We are making a significant investment, and there are also other operators making smaller investments. We see a greater willingness to invest in transport and power generation from natural gas in areas where the consumption side of things would be facilitated. The challenge with natural gas is that scale is important, even more so than oil.</p><h4>In what ways has Jaguar prioritized the social benefit of its projects within its business model?</h4><p>What is close to the heart of Jaguar and the reason we were established is that we believe we have a small but essential role to play in positively transforming Mexico. We do not measure our success on production metrics but on the number of Mexican families we provide power to. We look at how we can do things to have the best possible impact, whether socially or environmentally. Recently, we worked with the ASEA on the first-ever compensation program that does not need to be co-located with the operations to be much more effective with how we benefit the environment if we can concentrate our efforts into more vulnerable areas. We started monitoring everything we do, whether it is CO2 emissions, water use, or land impact, with the idea that we want to measure Jaguar's total benefit and positive impact based on our four pillars: Social, Environmental, Economic, and Professional Development. The way the industry's talent has worked in the past was appropriate for a massive national oil company. However, it is not for the type of work that smaller independent and even international oil companies will require from Mexico to succeed. Our challenge is to create a competitive staff to make sure the industry moves forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your strategy behind working with the Green Climate Fund, and how would you characterize the strength of Morocco's green economy?</h4><p>Morocco's green economy has a huge potential, particularly with the COVID-19 impact, which is accelerating the need for a greener, more sustainable, and inclusive growth. The EBRD aims to support the government of Morocco's National Sustainable Development Strategy in guiding the actions of both public and private actors towards a green and inclusive economy. Back in 2015, we deployed our first green financing package called the Morocco Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (MorSEFF), together with other international financial institutions: that was a EUR110-million financing program designed to support businesses investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, through two partner banks in the country: BOA and BCP. It incentivized MSMEs and corporates to invest in green equipment. This program was a huge success and contributed to the creation of a green financing market. That was our first step in 2015, and since then other local banks have requested more green financing from EBRD because we have enabled the creation of a market, by addressing market barriers and entrenched behaviors that hinder the uptake of green technologies and solutions. Our financing package includes several key components, one of which is money through credit facility, technical assistance to the partner bank that allows it to design a dedicated offering, as well as incentives to the end-borrowers. That was a winning formula that helped us attract more clients and since then we followed up with new programs such as  the Green Value Chain, co-financed with the Green Climate Fund and the EU. We have also partnered with the Green Climate Fund to support the modernization of the irrigation system in the Saïss area, through the provision of EUR 120million loan to the Saïss Water Conservation Project and EUR32 million grants from the Green Climate Fund. This project is 100% a green. We have also launched recently a third large program, which is a green economy financing facility II (GEFF-II) that provide intermediated finance of at least EUR 150 million which may include up to EUR37.5 million of co-financing from the Green Climate Fund and EUR 18million grant from the European Union to financial institutions in Morocco. These funds will be for on-lending in green investments, contributing to the estimated EUR32 billion of additional finance needed to meet National Sustainable Development Strategy's targets for Greenhouse Gas emission reductions.</p><h4>Do you continue returning to Morocco because you see signs of promise and potential in its green economy?</h4><p>Yes, there is definitely great political will here. The authorities are committed to making Morocco greener through the launch of similar financing programs. Moroccan businesses are also wiling to grow or stay competitive through reduced operational costs (particularly energy, material and water costs) and production capacity expansion; we are encouraging them to adopt high-performing technologies and best practices, and we are assisting them with access to dedicated green finance. We also have a strong policy dialogue with the Ministry of Energy that supports the deployment of its renewable energy strategy, in particular opening up the sector to private developers. We have a number of technical assistants at the ministry and with all the different key stakeholders. Morocco has a great potential thanks to its natural resources, a diversified economy that relies on highly granular players of micro and SMEs, as well as a strong and resilient banking sector.</p><h4>What were the main lessons learned during this past year, and how has EBRD demonstrated resilience?</h4><p>The Bank was one of the fastest development financial institutions to deploy a solidarity package to its existing partners at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020; Morocco was the first one to receive it in April 2020. The idea of the solidarity package was—and still is—to support our partners in meeting liquidity needs. Bank of Africa (BOA)—and later other banks—expressed the need for short-term financing in anticipation of the upcoming economic crisis. Our support was composed of a short-term, EUR100-million liquidity loan to BOA and an increase in the uncommitted multi-currency trade finance limit by USD50 million. This package helped BOA to address the challenges and the difficulties faced by many of its clients at the time and truly anticipate market needs. We were the only development financing institution able to provide working capital, cash financing and guarantees, and short-term liquidity.</p><h4>What is the importance of the SME sector in Morocco, and what role do you see them playing in the country's economic recovery?</h4><p>Locally, MSMEs represent the bulk of the economy as well as the backbone in terms of job creation. We are a strong believer that they play—and will continue to play—a key role in the post-COVID-19 economic recovery should they be supported well during this period. The government has launched a number of initiatives to support them. We also support them through both direct and indirect financing and our advisory business. Caixa Bank is one of the many examples with which we signed some financing to support SMEs. In addition, we signed a loan with CIH dedicated to SMEs and as well as a trade finance limit with others. We also provide them with technical assistance; we have a fantastic program financed by the EU called the Advisory for Small Business, which offers technical assistance to SMEs. We finance local consultants or international experts to meet the specific needs of SMEs.</p><h4>What have been your strategies and challenges for assisting women in Morocco?</h4><p>The existing finance offers for women are not in line with the demand, and there are limited products in place that do not require collaterals. Second, there is a need to increase general awareness about gender inequality and design a specific offer that targets female entrepreneurs. It should not only be about financing but also about advisory services. Third, there is a low banking penetration of women; approximately 17% of women in Morocco have a bank account versus 35% in the MENA region. We have rolled out the Women in Business program with a number of banks in the country that features a package of financing similar to the green offer; however, here we also have a first-loss risk cover that allows banks to take on greater risks when financing female entrepreneurs. We also have a full package of technical assistance for female entrepreneurs in terms of coaching, mentoring, and skills enhancement to provide solid advisory services for female entrepreneurs to better run their daily businesses.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for EBRD in Morocco this year?</h4><p>2020 was a record year for the Bank in Morocco since it started in 2013. We signed and committed EUR750 million of investments in the kingdom. It was a record year because we were able to deploy the solidarity package and meet our clients' needs during a severe systemic crisis. I expect 2021 to be a great year for us as well, though it is difficult to predict. We will continue to remain close to our clients and partners to truly understand their needs and help them be innovative to remain resilient. The green agenda will remain high, and we are starting to deploy a new green financing package for banks and MSMEs that will likely be successful. We will continue to support public and private companies with innovative financing packages. Also, this year will be important for us, as we will define and approve our new country strategy for the next four years. That will be in line with the new economic development model that Morocco is working on right now.</p>]]></richbody0content>

How has the company evolved over the years?</h4><p>The company was founded with an international name and approach. We were established in Madrid, but immediately started looking into different ways to internationalize ourselves. We had offices in Tel Aviv, two offices in Latin America, another in Brussels, and others. About 50% of our clients are in the private sector, and the other half are in the public sector. We had to concentrate on our international investments and core business, which allowed us to survive during the 2008 crisis. Those were tough times, but it was one of the most important experiences of my career. We learned a hard lesson, but it helped us prepare for the future and the crisis in 2020. Last year, we grew around 18%, and we expect to grow by 21% in 2021 and around 20% in 2022. These are extremely impressive rates, given the crisis, and demonstrates we have prepared ourselves to respond to this recession.</p><h4>Grupo Avalon has had an international vision since the beginning. Can you elaborate on the company's international plans?</h4><p>We have always had an international spirit. We like to mitigate every risk that could arise and focus on being diversified. Spain is extremely stable, but economic recessions are global, and they affect some countries more than others. Thus, we want to diversify ourselves away from mature markets and seek many different opportunities. We have our commercial markets, which include the US. We have opened a consulate of sorts in Miami, through which we have started to explore some projects along with Spanish companies Iberdrola and Santander. Another market that we find extremely attractive is Europe. We already have two separate framework contracts for EUR45 million and EUR50 million with the European Commission. These contracts have motivated us to open an office in Poland. Another of our objectives is working for the UN, with whom we have experience working. All these should allow us to generate up to EUR300 million in revenue in the medium term. In the short term, we expect to generate EUR60 million in revenue. In the defense area, we are currently participating in bidding processes with NATO. Our goal is to generate 60% of our revenue abroad and 40% in Spain. Right now, we are generating 90% of our revenue in Spain, and the other 10% overseas.</p><h4>Your clients include Iberdrola, Caser Seguros, Vocento, and the Ministry of Defense, among many others. Who are your most important clients, and what sectors are the most important for you?</h4><p>In the public sector, there are four categories. The first is large multilateral organizations, which are public institutions. We also work with government agencies and ministries. Other categories are autonomous communities in Spain and the two autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla, while the fourth category includes large city halls. We have done some projects, for example, in Italy with its food security agency, or many projects in cooperation.</p><h4>What differentiates your company from your competitors?</h4><p>We were born with a brand that differentiated us. We have always sought to be an independent brand, which means we seek not to be influenced by others. Another important aspect is our economic independence. When an investment fund holds a relevant stake, it might influence how the company is administered. So we are completely independent, and that independence has enabled our growth. We exclusively pursue customer satisfaction, because we want them to be satisfied. In 2020, we were the second-largest provider in terms of volume. Talent attraction is one of the most important areas for us. We want to attract and also retain talent in the company, which is why it is extremely important to keep our workers happy and satisfied. As a result of all these efforts, we have extremely high levels of employee retention.</p><h4>What are your main priorities for 2021?</h4><p>Right now, we are seeking to win a EUR5-million project that would last for two years. We expect extremely large growth for 2021. The goal is to satisfy all the agreements that we sold last year at the maximum quality. That is the brand that I want Avalon to have. We want our clients to repeat their business with us. Some of our clients are part of the IBEX35 group, so we want to provide them with the best service.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The company was founded by Juan José Martí­nez in 1984 and has become an international leader in various sectors, notably aerospace. How has GMV evolved, and what have been its milestones?</h4><p>GMV was founded in 1984 with the vision of becoming an important company in the European space sector and with a strong technological element. The company has grown from a working group at the Polytechnic University of Madrid, led by Professor Martí­nez Garcí­a, to a multinational technology group. We are now a point of reference and leader in the space sector not only in Spain, but globally. In addition, the company's strategy aims to diversify technologies developed in the space sector to other sectors of activity. This led to the initiation of activities in the defense and security sector, as well as in intelligent transport systems, information, and communication technologies for the digitization of public administration, finance, and large companies. In fact, in recent years, this diversification of space technology to other sectors of activity has turned around and spin-in of technologies developed in other industries have been applied, for instance, cybersecurity. Aerospace, which was the origin of the company, remains the most important, although the company has grown significantly in all its business lines, this sector accounts for 65% of annual turnover. Defense and security make up around 10% of our annual turnover, while intelligent transport systems account for 15% and ICT for public administration and large companies make up the remaining 10%. Currently, GMV has subsidiaries in 11 countries, including Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the US, Colombia, and Malaysia. In addition, we have operations and projects in over 70 countries. Last year, we become the sixth-largest European employer space industrial group. Currently, GMV is the world's number-one independent supplier of ground control systems for commercial telecommunications satellite operators and the European leader in the ground segment of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (EGNOS and Galileo). In 2018, we were awarded our largest-ever contract. It was also the largest contract awarded to a Spanish space company. It concerns the maintenance and evolution of the ground control segment of Galileo in its operational phase. Another important milestone was the award in 2019 of a contract for development of a GNSS based precise and integral system for the new generation of autonomous vehicles of the German carmaker BMW Group.</p><h4>Before the pandemic, GMV had growth forecast of 10%. How did the company close 2020?</h4><p>In 2020, we grew by 9%. We closed 2019 with EUR237 million in turnover, 6% EBITDA, and 2,170 employees. The 2020 accounts have not yet been approved, so we cannot provide much information, though we have almost EUR260 million in turnover and more than 2,300 employees. The sectors we trade in have not been heavily impacted by the pandemic, as demand has remained strong. In January 2020, we launched our business continuity and crisis management plan in all our worldwide offices and began deploying what we were using in current operations. First of all, we already had a large part of the IT infrastructure deployed, because some employees were working from home. Secondly, we have an infrastructure that connects to all the computer networks in all the countries in which we are present; we leveraged this and began monitoring the situation afterwards. Although the pandemic has had an impact, the understanding of customers has helped significantly, as several activities have been carried out remotely. However, the planned 10% has been reduced to 9% due to the impact of the pandemic on other sectors and travel restrictions in some cases: we have to deploy our systems in different locations and we have found some limitations delaying the completion of some projects.</p><h4>An expansion in Brussels has been announced, with new headquarters to support European space activities. What is GMV's strategy to support Europe's space initiatives?</h4><p>The European Commission is key for us, since GMV's technological component and R&amp;D investments are particularly important. Our developments in technology and research are largely supported by our own investment and resources, though we also use national and international resources and initiatives. The European Commission plays a relevant role for European countries, and, since our beginnings, we have placed a great interest in its initiatives. The second aspect is that the European Commission is playing an increasingly important role in different economic areas, particularly in the space sector, and GMV is a European benchmark in this sector. The importance of those aspects and the roadmap for the future are clearly shown in the approved EU's new multiannual financial plan 2021/2027, in which there are very important R&amp;D initiatives such as the Horizon Europe program and, in addition, the  new European Space Program, with an important financial package for key programs such as Galileo or Copernicus. These programs provide the space infrastructure which is needed and important in other sectors, such as transportation, communications, and weather forecasting. It was time to have a permanent presence in Brussels in order to increase and improve our dialogue with the European institutions.</p><h4>As a result of Brexit, British industry will not be able to participate in the EU's space programs and will instead allocate the investment it was making in the EU on its own sector. What strategy does GMV have for this market?</h4><p>GMV has had a subsidiary in the UK since 2014. It is an extremely important country in the space field, both when it was in the EU as well as a previous and current member of the European Space Agency where it is the fourth-largest contributor. We will have to see how the Brexit agreement turns out. The UK will not be able to access EU programs, but it will continue to be a member of the European Space Agency, as they are different entities, and with a very important contribution. We have been thinking of increasing our presence in the UK for a few years, both because of its relevance and trying to grow a subsidiary there. Furthermore, we aimed to consolidate our position and to become a more relevant player in the context of British market. NSL was a company with a solid and recognized prestige and track record in high-tech projects and we knew each other well since we have been working together for about 20 years. Finally, we reached an agreement in line with the GMV's established objectives and it was found also of interest for NSL.</p><h4>Is GMV planning any new subsidiaries or acquisitions in Europe or other markets?</h4><p>At the start of the century, GMV rolled out a far-reaching internationalization plan for its longstanding business lines. Then, we set up companies in different countries during the first decade. We began our acquisitions in 2005 in Portugal and launched an important international deployment in 2009. Then, some other companies in different countries follow:  the US in 2015, , Germany in 2016, and the UK in 2020. We continue to pursue our growth strategy and are always looking for acquisitions or mergers. However, our objective is not growing for growth's sake. First and foremost, our strategy is to carry out inorganic operations that make sense from a technological point of view and generate important synergies. The next step is to see if the other party is interested in a transaction.</p><h4>What are the main objectives of GMV for 2021?</h4><p>In the current circumstances of global uncertainty our objectives are mainly to keep our employees safe and to fulfill the commitments with our customers. In addition to that, we aim to return to double-digit growth based on technological and innovative projects and to strengthen our position as a global benchmark in the sectors we trade in.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Founded in 1946, Zamora Company has become one of the main groups in the sector, not only in Spain but in more than 80 markets with more than 15 brands. How has the company evolved over the years?</h4><p>Zamora Company is a family-owned business that is now in its third generation. It is based in Cartagena. At the beginning it was local, and then it went regional and national. In 1970, it finally went international. Currently, more than 85% of its billing is generated outside of Spain. We have slowly enhanced our basic catalogue of premium spirits with those from other countries. In 1999, we joined the world of wine. Today, Zamora Company is the number-one brand from La Rioja and one of the most recognized Spanish brands in the world, being one of the 50 most recognized wineries. Moreover, we entered Rí­as Baixas with Mar de Frades, which is the second-most recognized albariño brand. Our mission is to offer quality experiences to our customers. We do not sell products, but rather experiences and moments. Moreover, we do it in a responsible and sustainable manner.</p><h4>How to you add that sense of experience to your product?</h4><p>We sell products that people do not need but want. Customers want to share moments with people who are important to them. We understand the consumer and adapt to them. The 30-year-old consumer is entirely different from an older one. There are also customers who want exclusivity and sophistication, for example, on their anniversary. Other moments are the everyday happenings, for example, a normal Wednesday dinner at home. We want our brands to induce a moment to relax and enjoy.</p><h4>The 85% of the sales comes from the brand Licor 43. In general, what is the percentage of sales between local and international, and how does your strategy work?</h4><p>The percentage is 50/50 approximately. If we compare Spain to the global consumption of premium wines and drinks, it does not reach 4%. We are setting up companies in the most relevant countries to strengthen development. For example, we have our own company of about 40 people in the US. Our main markets are Germany, Mexico, the UK, the Netherlands, and Australia.</p><h4>In 2019, Zamora Company closed with a turnover growth of 6.3%. How did you close 2020? </h4><p>There was an impact in 2020 due to COVID-19. We grew by 18% in March, but in April we fell by 76%. We closed the year with a 17% loss. Our target group is people that get together to have fun with their friends and loved ones. If there is no catering industry, these moments do not occur, and, therefore, there is no consumption. The impact was caused by three main variables. The first is geography; places where the catering industry is relevant suffered heavily. In Spain, 80% of our business is dedicated to the catering industry. Second, in uncertain times, consumers seek brands that give them security and are less willing to try new things. That is why in the markets where we had more established brands, our strategy has worked better. Third, consumption was higher in countries where citizens had greater peace of mind in terms of the handling of the pandemic.</p><h4>You were appointed FEV president in November. What is your vision for the sector in terms of the importance of sustainability and digitalization?</h4><p>Wine is an essential sector, and it is particularly important for the creation of the Spanish brand. We have a fully capitalized sector with many small wineries. In Spain, we have 4,600 wineries with excellent quality but little ability to create brands. Brands are in the mind of consumers when they see a product. In a sector as fragmented as the wine industry, the most important thing is to offer value. The objective is to add value to the high-quality Spanish wine and promote the brand and the value of the Spanish wine brand. This has a great deal to do with price. Wine is the solution to many problems, such as that of the abandoned areas of Spain, rural Spain, and the economic value chain. Spain has more vineyards that any other country in the world. Spanish wine needs Spanish food, brand, and digital transformation. The two most important words are digital transformation and sustainability.</p><h4>70% of the company's energy comes from renewable sources, and 99% of its waste can be reused for other uses. By 2025, Zamora Company commits to 90% of the energy used coming from renewable sources. What is your view and strategy in terms of sustainability?</h4><p>It is clear to consumers that their consumption has an impact on the environment. Each consumer values certain things. Young people are highly conscious of all this. Companies have no choice but to listen to consumers and act. We want to reduce unsustainable uses, for instance, changing plastic labels for biodegradable ones, making lighter bottles, and using recyclable cardboard and less ink on our boxes. We started with all of this a year and a half ago, and it is becoming less difficult than expected because workers, just like consumers, are aware. The lack of water is a reality. If something does not change in Spain, we will be significantly worse off in 50 years' time.</p><h4>What is Zamora Company's main priority for 2021?</h4><p>2020 has been the most uncertain year since the Civil War. In 2021, we have two priorities. The first is to achieve a sense of health security and recover in terms of consumption. It is a turning point toward efficient stabilization. Digital transformation is a unique opportunity to interact with the consumer. Consumers want information about the brands, and if you do not give it to them, they will not buy. We want digital transformation, efficiency, a focus on building branded products and on our fundamental markets. Our markets will be the US, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, the UK, and Australia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022„¢ is the first to be held in the Arab World and just the third to happen outside of Europe and America. What does this milestone mean for Qatar beyond the obvious impact on the sports industry? </h4><p>To us, the FIFA World Cup is more than just a football tournament — it is a celebration of our common humanity. This celebration is even more important in 2022 given the post-COVID-19 world we will likely be operating in. When we bid for the tournament over ten years ago, we realised the enormous potential of the region's first FIFA World Cup and the opportunities it would present us with to showcase our culture, talent, humour and passion for football. Today, as we edge closer to 2022, we are excited to share our country, culture and region with millions who will travel for the tournament in less than two years' time. More importantly, Qatar's geographic location provides an optimal central global platform that will bring people together, bridge cultures from East to West to enhance mutual understanding and break down long-standing misconceptions about our beautiful region. In the context of COVID-19, the tournament is likely to be one of the world's first truly global gatherings that fans and teams will be able to confidently travel to and enjoy. This outlook reaffirms Qatar's vision for the tournament as a platform that will bring people together in 2022, and adds further significance to our efforts to ensuring the success of the tournament. We hope to deliver a 28-day celebration that the entire world can embrace and are confident we are on track to do so. Beyond the tournament, we have always maintained that the power of the FIFA World Cup transcends beyond the action on the pitch and the stadiums and infrastructure. We consider the tournament a unique tool to accelerate positive and sustainable economic, social, environmental and human development not just for Qatar, but the region as well, leaving behind a lasting legacy. The tournament has already positively impacted the country and the region, two years before it is set to begin. Whether it is increased economic activity directly or indirectly through preparations for hosting, increased participation in sports leading to healthier lifestyles, or developing and accelerating innovative sustainable building practices and standards, 2022 has already had a profound impact on the country and will have a lasting impact for generations to come.</p><h4>We are already starting to understand the impressive delivery the SC will achieve in late 2022; however, the legacy of the 2022 FIFA World Cup is a long-term process that will probably reach its peak in 2030 with the culmination of Qatar National Vision. How will the 2022 FIFA World Cup help set a precedent for future events in terms of legacy? What is the fit of the event in the process that will lead to the culmination of the 2030 Qatar National Vision? </h4><p>Being the first World Cup in the Arab World and the Middle East, and recognising the power of sport — and football in particular — as a catalyst and driver for positive change, we wanted to make sure the tournament left a long-standing legacy not just for the people of Qatar, but the region as a whole. The State of Qatar's National Vision 2030 addresses four key pillars — human, social, economic and environmental development. In planning for the tournament and curating our legacy programmes, we ensured everything we do supported the realisation of that vision — thereby placing sustainability and legacy at the heart of every project we undertake. From an economic perspective, Qatar has always viewed the FIFA World Cup 2022 as a catalyst for accelerating not only the growth of the local economy by providing opportunities for local businesses, companies and contractors, but also wider infrastructure and nation-building projects. This has already had a significant impact on Qatar and helped accelerate a number of existing national infrastructure projects that are transforming the country into a modern and connected nation — a legacy that will be felt for generations to come. For example, the Doha Metro — which opened in full towards the end of 2019 and will be one of the main modes of transport during the tournament — is already today a critical method of transport for the people of Qatar, helping take cars off the road, reducing carbon emissions, and supporting the realisation of the country's environmental development goals. We are also utilising the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 as a platform for several legacy programmes aimed at supporting the realisation of the National Vision 2030, specifically a knowledge based economy and economic diversification. For example, Challenge 22 — our flagship innovation programme — supports the small and medium enterprises sector by opening the door for entrepreneurs and innovators to explore solutions that directly enhance or address the challenges related to hosting mega events, such as the FIFA World Cup, and bring benefits to Qatar and the wider region. We offer local and regional projects grants and mentoring to help innovators take their ideas from concept to market realisation and have a number of success stories to date that will live long after the last ball has been kicked. Josoor Institute, our education and training arm, is helping with the country's economic diversification and human capital development efforts. It aims at building the capabilities of the sports and events industries in Qatar and the region in the run up to the FIFA World Cup through education, training, professional certification, consultancy and research. Tourism, property, media, service and manufacturing are just some of the sectors that will rapidly grow while Qatar's successful track record in hosting first-class mega events continues to expand. From a modernisation and preservation of traditions perspective, our state of art stadiums echo the spirit and essence of Arab and Qatari heritage and culture. One example is Al Thumama Stadium, which is inspired by the gahfiya — a traditional woven hat worn by men across the GCC region and a symbol of dignity and independence. This venue will be utilised by the people of Qatar long after the tournament concludes — post 2022, once its capacity is reduced to 20,000 seats, a boutique hotel will replace the stadium's upper stands, while a branch of Aspetar clinic will open on site. In addition, the stadium's precinct can be utilised by the community for a variety of sporting activities — as well as the establishment of a number of retail and commercial units to ensure the area becomes a bustling hub of exercise and activity. The same can be said about Al Bayt Stadium, our northern-most tournament venue. This sporting arena takes the shape of Bayt Al Sha'ar, which is the tent used by the nomadic people of the desert in Qatar and the region. The tent exemplifies the Arab region's hospitable and welcoming nature. After Qatar 2022, the upper concourse of the stadium will be converted into various facilities. The skyboxes will be turned into a 5-star hotel, while a shopping centre, food court, gym and multipurpose hall will be incorporated into the stadium building. When it comes to social development, the power of this FIFA World Cup to deliver a true social legacy is perhaps most visible when one looks at the deep and far-reaching labour reforms implemented by the Government in Qatar over the last decade, which has seen numerous improvements that have set new benchmarks locally and across the region.</p><h4>An event with the dimensions of a FIFA World Cup has the potential not only to impact local and regional realities, but also to become a universal phenomenon that can set international best practices. Can you briefly guide us through the most important points of the following legacy programs: workers' welfare, environmental neutrality, and Generation Amazing? How is the SC working to maximize the global impact of the event in terms of best practices?</h4><p>For the first time ever, a joint FIFA World Cup Sustainability Strategy was developed and launched jointly by FIFA, the host country and the Local Organising Committee. The multifaceted policy document looks at several functional areas, including human, social and environmental sustainability — and guides much of the planning and delivery for the tournament by all three entities. Sustainability has sat at the heart of all planning for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 since we started our journey in preparing for the tournament over ten years ago, and is a central tenet of the legacy we are working to ensure the tournament leaves. When it comes to workers' welfare, ensuring and protecting workers' rights is a long-standing area that we are helping the State of Qatar tackle — both on our projects but from a wider country perspective as well. I am proud to say that our efforts in developing, fine-tuning and implementing our Workers' Welfare Standards across our projects is one of the key legacies Qatar's World Cup is leaving. While a lot of progress has been achieved — more remains, but I am confident that the positive momentum achieved to date will continue to have a positive impact on the local labour market and Qatar's international standing and attractiveness to talent around the world. One of the key issues we have recently tackled is the topic of ethical recruitment and the reimbursement of recruitment fees — a global issue that migrant workers face in many parts of the world. Recruitment fees are illegal under Qatari law, and addressing the matter is a complex issue with fees often paid in 'sending countries.' In collaboration with our local contractors, we have been able to return these payments to more than 40,000 workers. The total figure is in excess of USD30 million, and is second only to Apple on a worldwide scale. We also have a series of initiatives to support the wellbeing of workers across our sites, including a nutrition programme, a mental health programme, in addition to the development and use of innovative wearable cooling technology to ease summer working conditions. Looking at the environment, with climate change increasingly becoming a global issue, we clearly commit in our Sustainability Strategy to deliver the world's first carbon neutral FIFA World Cup — a pledge that will not only directly benefit the environment, but also raise awareness of the importance of environmental sustainability locally and regionally, leaving a lasting positive legacy. Our approach to achieving this includes four phases — raising awareness of the importance of sustainability; measurement of the tournament's carbon inventory; mitigation of emissions in the lead up and during the tournament; and finally offsetting any remaining emissions. In planning for the tournament and after discussions with FIFA, we identified that eight venues would be the optimum number to ensure that they meet Qatar's post-tournament needs and that no “white elephant" venues are left behind after 2022. Demountable seating will also support this, which will see Qatar donate over 170,000 seats to projects and countries lacking sporting infrastructure as part of the tournament's legacy. This will ensure many of the venues 2022 leaves for the local professional leagues are fit for purpose and have a reduced operational impact post-tournament, both sustainability and economically speaking. When it comes to construction, we aimed to mitigate the environmental impact of the tournament as much as possible, and followed the Global Sustainability Assessment System by the Gulf Organisation for Research &amp; Development as the environmental certification system to guide the process. With thanks to a collaborative approach, we have been able to deliver the infrastructure required for hosting the tournament according to the highest of standards of sustainable venue construction. On FIFA World Cup stadiums, this involved Qatari entities partnering with international partners to achieve sustainable design, construction, operations and management — setting new benchmarks that we hope the rest of the industry locally and internationally can benefit from. At this juncture on the road to 2022, as we transition from delivering the tournament's infrastructure to refining its operational planning, maintaining this green momentum will be of crucial importance, and we are working with all sectors that have a part to play in delivering the tournament to ensure sustainable operations across the entire country. The tournament's compact footprint will also be a major sustainability advantage, as it will completely eliminate the need for internal air travel throughout the competition. No doubt, due to the nature of energy that is used in our current day, there will be emissions that will be unavoidable. These will be offset through investing in carbon credits across a number of a good quality projects in Qatar and the region, helping support environmentally conscious projects and raising awareness on the importance of sustainability. Branching away from the environment and moving into social development, we always affirmed our commitment to utilise the FIFA World Cup as a platform to launch unique solutions to difficult global issues. One of the ways we are doing this is through Generation Amazing — our flagship social responsibility programme, which we launched during the bid. It uses the power of football to positively impact lives, create sustainable social development in communities in Qatar and around the world and encourage social cohesion. Targeting schoolchildren and migrant workers in Qatar, and vulnerable and displaced youth abroad, the programme empowers new generations of young leaders to transform their communities through football and create sustainable programmes that will generate exciting social development opportunities long the final whistle in 2022. The programme already has over 500,000 beneficiaries and is well on the way to achieve its ultimate goal of positively impacting the lives of a million people by 2022.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 1990, IVECO acquired 100% of the shares of Spanish industrial company ENASA, and since then it has positioned itself as the sector leader. How has the company evolved since then?</h4><p>ÁNGEL RODRÍGUEZ LAGUNILLA: Within IVECO, Spain is an important country; it is the second-most important country in terms of market. In addition, it is also important in terms of our industrial presence. We have two factories in Spain, one in Madrid and the other in Valladolid. In Valladolid, we manufacture our light vehicles, while the heavy vehicles are produced in Madrid. We have more than 4,000 workers in Spain. The company constantly invests to adapt to technological changes. We include all the technological updates in our manufacturing line. We want to be a sustainable business for all our partners.</p><p>RUGGERO MUGHINI: Having two plants in Spain is not only a matter of pride, but also a matter of responsibility because we have to position the brand in the right markets. This brand has the responsibility to be the market leader, a position we have maintained for many years.</p><h4>IVECO exports around 90% of its production in Spain. What are your main markets?</h4><p>ARL: Our main market is Europe, mainly Italy, France, and Germany. The UK market is more important for the Valladolid factory, compared to the one in Madrid. The Valladolid plant serves France, Germany, and the UK, while Madrid is the only factory for industrial vehicles in Europe for the group. We have other factories in Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, and Australia that manufacture heavy vehicles.</p><h4>The factory in Valladolid received the Award for Best Company 4.0. What's the importance of digitalization for IVECO?</h4><p>ARL: In terms of the digitalization of processes, and from an industrial point of view, in the next 10 years we will experience a radical change compared to what we have seen in the last 50 years. In the industry sector, the leap will be massive. IVECO started with this process several years ago. In 2019, we received an award from the Ministry of Industry as the best 4.0 industry. This year, we received another award for digitalization, which demonstrates the effort of IVECO to improve productive processes. The challenge is to find practical uses for new technological developments, which is not always easy. There are many developments in areas such as robotics, AI, and augmented reality, but sometimes it is difficult to find practical uses for them.</p><p>RM: Industrial digitalization is an extremely broad concept. We will also witness the digitalization of transport. Cars will evolve significantly, as will trucks. The same evolution that we have seen in mobile phones will take place in vehicles in the next 10 or 15 years. If we connect vehicles to the internet, they will gain access to additional services, allowing the transportation industry to be more efficient and productive. Now, our trucks can connect to the internet. We will have a network in Europe that will help our vehicles record a better performance.</p><h4>What differentiates IVECO from its competitors?</h4><p>RM: We clearly differentiate ourselves to have a complete range of alternative energy vehicles. We started with gas nearly 25 years ago where we are leaders of sales in this segment. Today, we are in deep of the develop of next generation vehicles; electric and hydrogen vehicles.</p><h4>How has the pandemic impacted your operations?</h4><p>ARL: The impact has been severe, and the first thing we did was to protect the health of our workers. When the state of emergency was declared in March 2020, we immediately decided to shut down our operations in our factories. We communicated with our workers what they had to do to stay safe and the conditions we had created to ensure the health of our workers. To sum it up, we put in place everything to prevent the spread of the virus. We are proud to say that none of our workers were infected within our plants.</p><p>RM: We launched a new truck, IVECO S-WAY in July 2019, and the figures we recorded in 1Q2020 were spectacular, and we had a great start to the year. Then, the pandemic occurred in March, and we sent all our workers to work from home. Some of our clients with trucks came to a halt, while demand for goods in supermarkets boomed. We maintained all our workshops opened in order to ensure the service to our customers. Workshops, however, were not deemed an essential industry, so we had to communicate with the authorities to modify the regulations and allow trucks workshops to operate. In the summer, things started to improve, and the market slightly recovered. We launched a campaign targeting customers with difficult circumstances, allowing them to start paying for the vehicle six months after they purchase it.</p><h4>What were your financial results in 2020 compared to 2019?</h4><p>RM: We gained market share in heavy vehicles. 2020 was not as successful as originally predicted, but it was not as bad as expected in March. Some 95% of our dealers ended the year with positive figures.</p><h4>Can you elaborate the company's strategy in terms of sustainability?</h4><p>ARL: For us, sustainability is part of our DNA. We started to develop vehicles in natural gas 25 years ago. In buses, we are pioneers in electric buses as part of our portfolio. Sustainability is essential for us. We signed a joint venture with US-based start-up Nikola to develop electric trucks. About 75% of the energy that IVECO consumes comes from renewable energies. We also have an important program to reduce CO2 emissions within our production process. We believe the entire production chain has to be sustainable.</p><h4>Are you planning to present projects to the Next Generation funds from the EU?</h4><p>ARL: Yes, we have done that. We presented some projects as part of the Next Generation initiative and are working with the authorities to develop these projects. We want to help the Spanish authorities make the industry more competitive. Spain is the second-largest manufacturer for automotive in Europe, and we have to create the conditions to ensure it remains competitive.</p><h4>Can you talk about your hydrogen projects?</h4><p>RM: The 2030 roadmap developed by the EU mandates all manufacturers to reduce gradually  CO2 emissions till 30% in 2030. In order to reach that goal, the 20% of the vehicles will be either electric or hydrogen-powered. We, IVECO,  will launch the first electric vehicle in 2022 and the hydrogen vehicle in 2023. Therefore, IVECO will be ready to carry out the roadmap assigned by the EU.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2021?</h4><p>ARL: The first priority is worker safety. We have to guarantee the health of our workers, and our perspectives are positive. We also want to maintain the industrial growth we have witnessed. If everything continues as usual, we might return to the results of 2019. We could even surpass the results of 2019. It is a year in which we are seeing a great deal of hope with the announcement of the European recovery funds.</p><p>RM: Our goal for 2021 is to be the leader in the sale of industrial vehicles in Spain.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the pandemic and lockdown restrictions impacted your business in Nigeria?</h4><p>Like many organisations, the pandemic came to us totally unexpected. It was, however, an opportunity to us to realize how resilient and agile we are. This helped us recover quickly as we went through the storm. We managed to run operations throughout the shutdown, never shutting down manufacturing and supply chain, having been classified as a business providing essential services. Many of our business units refocused remarkably. The personal care business, for example, was hit hard, as it is extremely sensitive to disposable income; however, the demand for hygiene and disinfectant products dramatically increased, so we rapidly adjusted our supply chains to meet this demand. The human nutrition segment grew because of the increased need and demand for vitamins and micro-nutrients. The hardest-hit businesses were infrastructure and industrial applications, as many companies shut down because they were not considered essential. The fact that we operate across many different segments and industries helped us significantly.</p><h4>What strategy did you adopt to come back strong, and what is your outlook for BASF in Nigeria?</h4><p>Keeping operations running at all costs and focusing on our customers proved to be a good decision.Most segments are now back to pre-COVID levels. Most consumers have been locked down for months and have saved money, so as soon as things open up they will start spending. We are not there yet in Europe, though demand in China is stronger now than it was before COVID-19. Nigeria is a unique ecosystem and does not necessarily follow global rules. We have our own consistent set of problems here, namely the port congestion or the foreign exchange topic but once we account for them, the outlook is cautiously optimistic.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your groundbreaking waste-to-chemicals project?</h4><p>Despite the pandemic, it was paramount for us to keep investing in innovation capabilities, and, therefore, our laboratories and related projects got a lot of attention. Our flagship project is the waste-2-chemicals project which aims at repurposing plastic waste towards chemical value chains. We succeeded in commissioning the waste-to-chemicals laboratory in Lagos in  2020, despite the pandemic. This facility, which is unique in Africa and likely beyond, provides a research &amp; development platform to study the relationship between waste plastics streams such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene and their conversion into pyrolysis oils for use in the local chemical value chain. We are currently running our first demo unit, which is the prototype of how this system will be in the future. This will allow us to validate all the parameters for us to go live later in the year. We intend to deploy three more recycling hubs up in strategic communities across the state, demonstrating the level of commitment we have towards enabling value creation in Nigeria.</p><h4>How does inflation and a weak naira affect your business?</h4><p>Inflation is a real concern, as it runs as high as 20% for some items, while  disposable income unfortunately does not increase that fast. This is hitting people's incomes hard, and driving poverty up. Access to Forex  is undoubtedly an issue for us, as we do not have an export business, and we need a large amount of dollars due to the fact that we still have to import a large portion of what we use here. Perceived risk is high, making investment decisions difficult to make, and  I do not expect this situation to improve anytime soon.</p><h4>Do you expect value chain localization to improve this situation, or will you import raw materials in the long term?</h4><p>Except for our waste-to-chemicals project, which is entirely localized besides being still relatively small, we still import most of our materials, as the chemical value chain yet in Nigeria is still in its infancy. We see change coming as initiatives such as the Dangote refinery for upstream petrochemicals will help seeding further downstream value chains including chemicals.</p><h4>Will the Dangote refinery make Nigeria self-sustainable and able to export?</h4><p>Aliko Dangote should be lauded for his vision. It is an exceptional achievement which is expected to be up and running by 2022, as most of the assets are expected to be commissioned by the end of this year. This is will trigger a massive transformation overnight. BASF is very extremely proud to be supporting this project, as it  is an absolute game changer. The fact that  a solid upstream chemical value chain is being built will accelerate development, and we will see further moves in the direction of downstream petrochemicals, which is positive. This will create a very large massive amount of jobs which are badly needed in Nigeria and may contribute to restore some balance in the Forex space.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the impact it will have on manufacturing in Nigeria?</h4><p>There cannot be any discussion, free trade is good, however it is important to protect markets which are not ready. I am pleased Nigeria has ratified the treaty, but we must allow some time to execute it without putting the  economy in danger. While agriculture can be a major income earner, more agro-transformations have to be localized. Take the example of shea butter; 60% of shea butter trees are in Nigeria, but Nigeria does not produce much shea butter as most seeds are exported. There is a great deal of work to do in Nigeria in terms of local value addition, but it is not yet ready to open up its borders in a number of segments. It has to be careful not to kill the small Nigerian entrepreneurs who are trying to create local value. If it opens up too fast, it may face stiff and even lethal competition from its neighbors. Free trade is great, but some industries need to be protected for a while as they are not ready.</p><h4>How will BASF fit within the new economic realities?</h4><p>We will keep reinstating that for us, it is all about enabling value creation. We will continue to operate in and contribute to sectors where we know we can deliver on all dimensions. Economically as it makes sense in terms of profitability, environmentally as sustainability is now a crucial success factor, and socially through job creation, upskilling, and vocational training.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2020 was certainly an interesting year, especially for the payments sector and all kinds of digital products. How have you seen volumes at Visa change since 2020?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia was making steady progress toward achieving a 70% cashless economy by 2030, as part of the goals for Vision 2030, and the pandemic has accelerated this shift toward digital commerce. As the pandemic began to impact daily life in Saudi Arabia, card payments (both face to face and online) saw double-digit growth while cash withdrawals declined. This trend is set to accelerate, as more consumers and merchants become used to these cashless options. International volumes have been hit, particularly due to travel restrictions, which has affected Saudi residents since April 2020. However, online shopping has increased sharply, and even the acceptance of digital payments has increased massively over all the different merchant sectors. Another trend is contactless payments, wherein nine out of 10 in-store transactions are tap to pay versus less than two out of 10 before the pandemic. Debit has been the biggest growth driver across all portfolios as opposed to credit and prepaid . That is another global trend we have seen in Saudi as more people spend their own money rather than tapping into credit lines. The pandemic has accelerated several years of change in a matter of months.</p><h4>What have these new trends meant for Visa in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>From a volume perspective, today, face-to-face was a big chunk of our business and a main driver because of travel and high-ticket items. We are not seeing that growth of volumes because of travel restrictions; however, domestic spend across all categories has grown massively.</p><h4>Will this shift be permanent, and is the drop in face-to-face volumes at risk of continuing?</h4><p>The changes that we have seen definitely are long-lasting. The use of contactless payments was always in the best interest of public health, and we have no reason to believe things will return to the way they were. We see consumers demanding payment options that are more secure and do not necessarily require physical contact, and that was driving the preference for contactless. When it comes to in-person and high-ticket payments, there was definitely a drop. However, the transformation to digital payments created a new behavior in the market that will shift cash to digital in every sector. As part of the expansion, POS payments and financing platforms are each undergoing a huge transformation to make sure digital options are the first choice and digital wallets become the preferred method for consumers to make purchases. Sellers that still use cash on delivery as their primary method will need to quickly implement a contactless system to survive. Across even smaller sellers, the transformation is moving rapidly, and we have seen it across the board.</p><h4>Did Visa see a huge uptick in business with STC Pay coming on to the market to provide these digital wallet services?</h4><p>STC Pay, Hala Pay, and digital wallets in general serve a segment that was not served by financial institutions before. Now, there is a shift even from the financial institutions to serve these segments. The customer journey was different. Today, from home one can apply for a card from their phones, and within minutes everything will be on the mobile, and they can start purchasing. Wallets are sometimes serving specific use cases that were not catered to before. That is why the market is transforming quickly. The increase in transactions and volumes was significant, and STC Pay certainly played a part in that. In terms of our financial performance, Visa's revenue worldwide has not been immune to the pandemic. However, while other industries have struggled with financial decline, we are fortunate to operate in an area where the shift from cash to digital is still high, which helped us remain profitable in our fiscal year and definitely contributed to our global income of USD11 billion.</p><h4>€¨When we look at the regulatory changes and policy decisions over the past year, what have been key and will have a big impact on the future?</h4><p>The Saudi government has always been progressive in its thinking; this was even driven by Vision 2030. It recognized the importance of cashless payments and the value they offer, whether in digital commerce or supporting economic recovery. This is evident by the Saudi Arabian goal of achieving a cashless economy and for 70% of transactions to be digital. While changing consumer behavior and the preference for contactless payments presents huge opportunities for the digital sector, we live in a region where cash culture is deeply entrenched. COVID-19 has pushed contactless payment adoption, but there is definitely room for greater growth. Fortunately, the government's incredibly progressive approach to creating an environment suitable for digital transformation also ensures that the acceptance of adoption of digital payments by merchants and consumers and continues to grow. Introducing the sandbox through the central bank to allow wallets and digital players to come in was also a key initiative. Another key initiative that has paved the way for rapid adoption was the mandatory acceptability of electronic payments for all commercial activity, including petrol stations, introducing digital mobile wallets, and even when it comes to tapping to pay and the increase in transactions from SAR100 to SAR300. Another major development was the framework that was introduced for open banking, a move that will change the way merchants, customers, and financial institutions can increase the value they drive from access to financial data. It will also open up opportunities beyond financial inclusion by placing more emphasis on increasing financial literacy and helping people be more in control of their finances, specifically Saudi Arabians across the different segments. All of this that was done by the government across the board has helped the sector. Yesterday, wallets were not able to be licensed or operated; today, everyone is welcome, there is a sandbox, and there are many layers in the government that support these developments through the different ministries, be it the Saudi Central Bank, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Telecommunication, and others.</p><h4>How do you foresee the dynamics in the market changing, and what are your expectations for Visa for Saudi Arabia for 2021?</h4><p>The shift of SMEs to digital commerce and changing consumer payments habits show strong signs of becoming permanent in 2021. In fact, according to our latest study on SMB recovery, two out three KSA merchants established digital presence in response to COVID-19 and 80% plan to invest in new digital payment technologies. As we reach the one-year mark of COVID-19, more consumers are opting to tap to pay with their cards in stores and clicking to pay online instead of paying cash on delivery, while the businesses that serve them are increasing digital payments faster than ever before. These changes in consumer behavior are expected to become the new normal as more consumers gain confidence in digital payments. 54% of consumers believe they will continue to use contactless payments in stores, and 44% said they would continue to choose online or digital wallet payments after COVID-19 according to a study we conducted recently. Furthermore, more than one-third of consumers have switched to e-commerce offerings as a direct result of COVID-19. Due to the high penetration rate for tech-savvy Saudis, there are many opportunities for online and e-commerce in the future. Building up on that, if we look at restaurants or shops that had never considered offering any online services before the pandemic, today more merchants see digital payments as necessary investment in recovery and critical to future proofing their business. We believe economies won't recover until SMBs recover — the swift adoption of digital payments by KSA businesses and recognition of what their customers want can only be a positive thing for the country's economic growth and return to normal.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the new company, SAL, bring more support to the aims of Saudi Vision 2030?</h4><p>SAL was created as an independent company in 2020 with the mandate of being a leading logistics provider in the country, derived from the country's Vision 2030 of being a logistics hub in order for SAL to participate and support the vision, encompassing sea, air, and land transportation. The Company is fortunate in the sense that it can seamlessly draw on its broad network and deep expertise built over decades as the cargo handling unit of the national flag carrier, Saudia. SAL is therefore well positioned to support the logistics and transportation agenda of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 economic strategy, fuelled by the Kingdom's youthful demographics, rising consumption and digitalization, and increased global connectivity in trade and investment.</p><h4>How is the growth of e-commerce regionally and globally affecting the logistics sector, especially in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The global rise of e-commerce, accelerated by the global pandemic, is very much evident in Saudi Arabia and is a key driver for Saudia Cargo &amp; SAL's growth. The Kingdom has embraced a rapid transformation in retail, for example by significantly increasing courier company licenses in the last year to meet rising demand and announcing new Integrated Logistics Bonded Zones to facilitate access for global e-retailors to the rapid growth and spending power of the Saudi market. Both Saudia Cargo and SAL are not just a beneficiary of the increase in e-commerce but in fact, we are actively driving its progress. For example, Saudia Cargo recently signed an agreement with Cainiao, which is part of the AliBaba Group, to handle its e-commerce into Riyadh and Liege, providing improved connectivity into two key regions for the Chinese company. Partnerships such as these are built on the provision of high-quality service and close collaboration between SAL and Saudia Cargo and drive higher volumes for both companies. Fulfilling the increasing e Commerce volumes from infrastructural requirements is where SAL comes into play with its facilities. We have a dedicated operational courier facility in Riyadh whilst a similar facility is being evaluated for Jeddah.</p><h4>Would you tell us about your diversification strategy?</h4><p>SAL's purpose is to be a leading logistics provider and act as a growth catalyst in the sector. While continuing to build our core business of cargo handling, SAL is furthering its diversification through the logistics sector increasing its portfolio of activities to include e Commerce fulfilment, 3PL solutions and further supporting the pharmaceutical industry. In the air cargo handling business, we have built a strong track record in managing diverse cargoes that require specialised attention. For example, in the last year, our large-scale cargoes included equine, Formula-E cars, pharmaceuticals and entertainment industry equipment. This necessitates close attention to detail and to customer requirements, in addition to a high level of customer engagement. We will continue to develop this core offering through horizontal and vertical business integration, both inside and outside of airport premises.</p><h4>Would you tell us about the recent infrastructural development at SAL that is contributing to Saudi Arabia becoming a global logistics hub?</h4><p>We are investing heavily in both our infrastructure and technological capabilities. In 2018, we initiated two multi-billion-riyal investment projects at the Riyadh and Jeddah airports, building state-of-the-art cargo terminal facilities. The first phase in Riyadh has been completed operational since April 2020, while the first phase in Jeddah is scheduled to be completed and operational by the end of this year. By 2023, when both projects are completed, we will have the capacity to handle over 3.5 million tonnes of cargo annually. The developments include dedicated e-commerce, cold-chain, export and re-export facilities, which will support our ambition to attract larger cargo volumes into the Saudi Arabian hub, both for the domestic market and as transshipments into the Middle East, Europe and the Americas.</p><h4>Saudia Cargo is transporting the coronavirus vaccine in the Kingdom. What were special arrangements needed to achieve this milestone?</h4><p>SAL worked seamlessly with Saudia Cargo to carefully plan and execute the transportation of COVID-19 vaccines into the Kingdom. The process involved close coordination with concerned international and local authorities to facilitate the smooth and safe handling of these highly sensitive shipments. Locally, we have partnered with the Saudi Customs Authority and Saudi Food &amp; Drug Authority (SFDA) to expedite clearance with special training provided to SAL operational staff, handling the vaccine shipments on the ground. Our dedicated climate control organization and team, as well as our GDP trained staff, have ensured a flawless operation to move vaccines. We are also in constant communication with world leading providers of active temperature-controlled containers, such as Envirotainer, Dokasch or C-Safe active containers. These sophisticated aircraft unit load devices (ULDs) are designed to maintain specific temperatures tailored for pharmaceutical products. Saudia Cargo on the other hand is well-experienced in handling vaccines for many years and this is an advantage given the massive scale needed in transporting COVID vaccines to different countries. Collectively Saudia Cargo and SAL are able to maintain an effective cold chain throughout the cargo value chain.</p><h4>Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Saudia Cargo continues its operations. How did you manage to maintain the supply chain? </h4><p>Demand for air cargo services has risen during the global pandemic, with air freight providing the most reliable and efficient means of transporting medical and healthcare supplies. This was especially the case given the disruption to supply chain stemming from lockdowns and travel restrictions. To ensure continuity in transportation, especially of essentials, we needed to respond rapidly and with a high degree of flexibility to fast-changing circumstances. We proved our agility to adapt in an ever-changing environment through altering the global freighter and increasing the passenger freighter network around the globe and within the region. Alongside initiated 5th freedom rights and maximised asset utilization of our freighters to beyond 400 block hours per month, beyond the industry practice. In view of the customer and society requirements during the pandemic, Saudia Cargo emerges out as a champion in Saudi Arabia for line haul cargo, setting record number of flights, tonnages and impeccable on time performance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you managed the COVID-19 crisis internally and with your customers whose credentials you manage?</h4><p>Since 2018 we have been internally diversifying our service delivery model, change was needed, and the industry had to evolve. We can proudly say that we have successfully created a distributed team model, moving away from just having our team based in Saudi Arabia. We established our UAE team in 2013, however, it was limited in size, and in 2018 we started expansion into Kuwait and Bangalore, India. These functional teams and offices were just an extension of the base team here in Saudi rather than performing back-office activities. Allowing us flexibility as the SOPs and work delivery modules we had were all very modular and technology-based. With humble beginnings, we were able to fine-tune, adapt, grow, and up-scale our model in 2019, and when our offices opened in Bangalore and Belarus, our team almost doubled in size. Our diversification strategy unknowingly prepared us for the pandemic we are still facing now, fortunately, the model was already in place when Covid hit. A remote work model was no longer a foreign concept, and the team was comfortable working in the new norm of WFH. Technically speaking, nothing much changed internally for our Riyadh office since they collaborated with their teams using virtual workflow tools from the start. Overall, from a service delivery perspective, we were marginally affected, however, adjustments were made to account for the productivity losses, and we had to modify the way we interacted from sector to sector. The change was to our advantage and allowed us to be better prepared and resulted in a far lesser negative overall business outcome.</p><h4>What was your experience in terms of business demand during the pandemic?</h4><p>Most of our IT services sector clients experienced growth in this period, however, there was a lesser growth seen with our specialized services clients such as audit and consulting, but progress was still visible. Therefore, services that can be delivered remotely were faring much better than those who may have had multi-projects frozen due to budget constraints and the current situation's implication. The first half of the year was tough on the revenue stream, but many of our clients are retainer-based, and it was business as usual for most of them. However, new business was essentially frozen for the first half of the year as per our projections in March, highlighting some clients as high risk. Proven functions on a partner model rather than a service provider, this allows us to adjust our strategy with the help of real insights from our direct and regular client interactions, understanding where their pain points are. One of the ways we tried to help, was to put some of their operations under freeze while waiting for things to clear up. Once business levels started to level out and the demand was returning around September, we got back on with deliverables in Q4, as projected. In this Quarter, we saw a surge in mobility and the PEO deals that we closed. From a consulting perspective there were no surprises. Still, there has been an immense amount of regulatory changes and updates this year, so most clients were trying to get back on track in Q4 to line things up in January when flights and projects would open up again.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the development of your business offerings?</h4><p>We projected 2021 or 2022 to be a starting point for our new business efficiency service offerings, but the market is already there due to the WFH experience. Productivity gains from new working models for the Saudi and global economy, in general, will start materializing over the next 2 to 3 years. If you have an employee base of 80 employees and 50 of them can be based as your core structure/team, then the remaining 30 can either be booked out as a scope of work, or better yet the team can be efficiently scaled up in markets where there is a deeper human capital pool. Recruiting and cross-checking the best talent is a function we perform by building you a team without barriers to any specific locale. Your new team member joins without the hassle of recruitment, onboarding or getting them operationally prepared. They will arrive ready and in line with your policies and procedures. Our HR advisory service will help if you are struggling with managing or administering your remote teams and can work with your HR to get the best out of the team members in terms of productivity. Your service delivery model's quality levels will rise with low up-front risk and a more efficient cost structure. Due to the maturity of the current BPM model, we will see an increase in these service models. Meanwhile, there is an acceleration and an emphasis on decentralization of operations. Since 2018 we have received a high volume of queries from prominent large family offices, with shared services being a major focus area. This kind of distributed offshore team will allow clients to scale up and build that capability and capacity bandwidth required to tackle tomorrow's demands.</p><h4>What are your business expectations for 2021?</h4><p>The Saudi government's reaction to COVID 19 was exceptional, their swiftness and strict regulations allowed businesses some level of positivity for a COVID-free future. The strict policies and regulations were necessary, and the results speak for themselves. Due to the measures taken, the Kingdom was and still is one of the better countries to live in during the COVID crisis. The impact on business was felt in the first half of the year but the positive results of their decisions materialized in the latter part of last year. Given that there is a very effective plan afoot for disseminating the vaccine and effective management of returning to business and projects, overall, from the second Quarter onwards, we will see quite a volume of business return to the Saudi market. There should be business to capture on the table, however, the global economy is where the tricky part will come. If you are a firm solely dealing within the Kingdom on internal deliverables and your value chain is limited to the Kingdom, you stand to have a good year. There is a lot of pent-up demand from last year, and a push from the top down at a macro to the micro level to get things moving. However, if your value chain stretches beyond the Kingdom, there is general positivity within the North American business landscape due to the new administration and hopefully less centralization of policy. Yet uncertainty inevitably remains, and it comes down to when Europe and North America's economies recover as they are ailing from a core structural perspective, which is not helping with quantitative easing and the financial markets being wholly disconnected from the real economy. The real impact for those markets will be felt in 2021. Any firms or companies operating in Saudi Arabia whose value chain spans out to those markets need to be better prepared to tread through a choppy 2021.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SUANFARMA was established 28 years ago and has become one of the leading companies in the development, production, and distribution of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for use in human and animal health. How did the company establish itself in this position? </h4><p>After 15 years in the pharmaceutical industry, in 1993, I decided to develop a new business model. There was a generic drug law enacted in Spain in 1991, and an opportunity came about because there would be a paradigm shift in the Spanish pharmaceutical world. The product patent was also accepted in Spain as a result of its entry into the common market. SUANFARMA responded to this new environment and succeeded with the business model required to navigate this new situation. Our success is due to the fact that we have always been fortunate to have a great team on board, and we have had a global vision from the beginning.</p><h4>What is the company's vision?</h4><p>The company's vision is to serve the world with effective and affordable therapeutic remedies, namely generic drugs. In the pharmaceutical world, big companies are able to develop innovative treatments, which, on average, cost EUR2.5 billion, in addition to 10 years of research. When someone is able to develop an innovative drug, they get access to patent protection that lasts between 15 and 17 years. When this patent expires, the product becomes available to the world of generic drugs, and there is a possibility for smaller companies, such as ours, to encourage or address the concerns of laboratories and commercialise this product in competition with other generic drug manufacturers. This means drug prices can be reduced by up to one tenth and, in many cases, even less than what it cost under patent. This makes it affordable for public healthcare systems to access to these drugs in order to prescribe them to the general population.</p><h4>Your main products are intermediates, human and veterinary APIs, and nutritional ingredients. SUANFARMA also has an industrial segment. What products do you offer and what do you focus on?</h4><p>SUANFARMA focuses on the development of active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are the raw materials for making drugs. There are two worlds: prescription drugs, or medication that require a doctor's prescription and are strictly regulated; and non-prescription drugs. We have raw materials for prescription drugs that have active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as raw materials for nutraceutical products that are nutritional ingredients and do not require a prescription. In recent years, we have mainly focused on being a supplier of raw materials to pharmaceutical or nutraceutical laboratories so that they can manufacture drugs. SUANFARMA, through the Suanfarma Biotech fund, was recognized as pioneers in biotechnology investment funds in Spain in 2008. We raised EUR9 million and invested in nine Spanish research projects. We were able to make the fund 60% profitable, but, above all, we pushed ahead some of the most remarkable projects in the country in biotechnology.</p><h4>How have you managed the pandemic, and what strategy did you follow to mitigate the impact?</h4><p>For SUANFARMA, the most important thing is the people who make up the team and the main objective has been to take care of their safety. On the other hand, SUANFARMA is in the health sector and during the pandemic we have made an outstanding contribution to avoid shortages in the markets in which we operate. Some of the APIs we manufacture and/or distribute have been of great importance. This is the case of chloroquine or retrovirals which are used to help mitigate the effects of the virus. In addition, our medical adviser warned us of the importance of corticosteroids or heparin to prevent lung inflammation and cerebral thrombus, which were causing most of the deaths from COVID-19. We hope that we have contributed to help in their supply.</p><h4>SUANFARMA has an international presence, exporting to more than 75 countries and with subsidiaries or representative offices in some of them. What are your main markets and your expansion plans?</h4><p>Our main markets outside Spain are mainly the US, Mexico, and Central Europe. With our product offering, we have the ability to set up our own structure in countries with populations over 10 million. We are in particularly important countries such as Brazil, with more than 200 million inhabitants, where we have not been able to build a significant presence until now. We are strengthening our local structure with the idea of having a local subsidiary. We have made attempts in Bangladesh and Pakistan, though they do not yet have relevant consumption of the products in our range yet, so we have had representative offices with just one person.</p><h4>How much do you invest in R&amp;D, and how important is innovation for the company?</h4><p>In the innovation department, we have several focuses. We have a company in Pamplona that develops pharmaceutical formulations for our customers, we have a unit in Madrid that works on alternative production routes, and we have a research center in Portugal. In the world of drug development, there are three basic technologies: fermentation, chemical synthesis, and extraction. In fermentation and chemical synthesis, we have a development unit in each of the areas in Portugal. Our intention is to be the only company in the world that covers these three basic technologies to develop drugs.</p><h4>What is SUANFARMA's goal for 2021?</h4><p>SUANFARMA's goal for this year is to increase our industrial capacity, develop our production capacity for innovative or existing generic drugs at better prices, and expand our facilities to meet demand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>P3 logistics park, controlled by a Singapore fund, began activity in Spain in 2014 and now operates in a total of 13 countries. What have been P3 key milestones?</h4><p>The origin of P3 was in the Czech Republic, where it was a relatively small company that grew in Europe. Until 2014 or 2015, it went through several stages of development and mainly grew in Eastern and Central Europe. We were incorporated into the company when it was owned by TPG and Ivanhoé Cambridge, and at a different stage of development. The company was then buying portfolios and growing in Eastern Europe. We started operations in Spain in 2014 with the purchase of a portfolio of four industrial units. The first office was established in 2016, but after 2016, we started with full operations in Spain buying other portfolios and developing turnkey projects, whereupon the company was acquired by GIC. GIC is an important partner at a financial level with a long-term ownership view. Since then, we have grown in every country, but fundamentally in Germany, Spain and Italy, and we have consolidated our position in the Czech Republic. Meanwhile, we have also increased our investment in the Netherlands, and opened operations in Austria. In Spain, we have established a structure from scratch. We have developed 250,000sqm of new logistic platforms, making for a total portfolio of around 625,000-650,000sqm.</p><h4>Currently, how many square meters does the company manage? </h4><p>6.2 million sqm, given that growth has been rapid. This year we have conducted certain large operations in Central Europe, mostly in Germany, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Austria. We have realized certain operations of over 1.5 million sqm, which again, has translated in to rapid growth. In Spain we have the aforementioned 650,000 sqm, and are developing an additional 100,000 sqm on top of that.</p><h4>Can you share some of your main projects? </h4><p>Most of our new developments in Spain have been built-to-suit projects. In Illescas, we developed our logistic park in three different phases: the 1st phase was a building for Amazon, 2nd phase for Airbus and the 3rd phase was compounded by 2 speculative projects, one of them occupied by Correos Expres. Part of the space in the park is already rented, and others will be over the coming months.</p><h4>Are you undertaking speculative or turnkey projects?</h4><p>We are going to continue with a mix, with a number of tailor-made projects for certain clients. Meanwhile, we will continue to launch speculative projects for mature markets with a high level of demand.</p><h4>COVID19 has affected many sectors of the economy. The logistics sector, due in part to the increase in the food or e-commerce sector, has managed to overcome the crisis. How has 2020 been for the company?</h4><p>The pandemic has been a challenge for every sector. However, we should not forget that logistics is related to everything that we consume on a daily basis. In that regard, logistics is related to the supply of many items, from cutlery for hotels to the components for car manufacturing. So everything that impacts consumption and sales has an impact on our clients. Our tenant mix has some clients that have not been affected, while others have been. It has been a challenging year, but has not been a negative one in terms of results.</p><h4>Logistics is a very attractive, profitable, but also highly competitive sector. What is P3's differentiating strategy compared to its peers?</h4><p>I think that what makes us different is our long-term strategy. All our investments are for the long-term, including the acquisition of land or assets.</p><h4>P3 has a presence in Zaragoza, Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia and is looking at the Mediterranean corridor as an area of expansion for the next few years. What are your expansion plans?</h4><p>The Mediterranean Corridor is one of the hubs in which we are seeking to expand. That includes all Catalonia, from Gerona to Tarragona, and Valencia including Castellón and Alicante, Malaga, and there are new logistic spaces that are being open that continue to increase the demand of companies, so we perceive much growth potential in the Mediterranean Corridor.</p><h4>Operations related to e-commerce have increased in 2020. There is an increase in urban logistics centers, which allow last-mile distribution. Are you working on last mile projects?</h4><p>We have a different view of the last mile, compared to the rest of the sector. We are seeking projects with a large plot of land, where large vehicle traffic can be handled. One of the characteristics of last mile is that it generates a lot of traffic. We are seeking large plots of land within cities that offer large spaces able to manage that high level of traffic and that are well connected to the main highways.</p><h4>How are you working to change the public perception of the sector?</h4><p>I think that traditionally there have been some stereotypes related to logistics. It has been seen as an industry with negative externalities, due to pollution, the traffic it generates and because it allegedly generates low paying jobs. I think that vision is changing. The pandemic has somewhat contributed to that because it is essential to have a strong logistic sector to overcome the adverse situation that we have experienced. Logistics have demonstrated to be very important during the pandemic. The jobs that logistics creates have more added value.</p><h4>The pandemic has also shown the importance of having more manufacturing in Europe, and not relying quite so heavily on Asia. How can this benefit your company?</h4><p>This is more of a gradual process that will reflect in certain strategic projects. Now we are better aware of the problems that can emerge if we bring everything from Asia. We have seen that some supply chains can be broken in light of an emergency like the one we are experiencing. I think that we will probably see an increase in storage capacity. There could be more storage capabilities close to consumption points. We will probably see a lower dependency from the manufacturing perspective, as a result of an increase in storage capacity. I think that this will be a step taken before industries relocate to Europe. This increase in the storage capacity will improve emergency response.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2021?</h4><p>We still plan to grow, with continued investment in the logistic sectors, which we see as one of the core industries of the next year's economic growth. We want to develop our own parks, and that's something that we will continue to look into. And meanwhile, we are evaluating the possible purchase of new portfolios.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>GLP Spain Management started operations a little over a year ago, but it was already in the Spanish market before, under the Gazeley brand. Can you elaborate on the presence of Gazeley in Spain and the acquisition by GLP?</h4><p>GLP is a Global company that is focused on real estate for logistics. We started our activities in Spain in 2002 with developments in Madrid and Zaragoza, having a profile of a trader developer back then. We are known as a company that has an excellent customer service. GLP is present in Asia and the US, and we are also present and market leaders in Brazil and India. Europe was the piece that was missing, so GLP acquired Gazeley in 2018. We retained the name of the brand for two years to demonstrate our clients that nothing would change, and we have continued to demonstrate that our customer service experience continues to be the best in the market. We have reinforced our position in Europe by the acquisition of Goodman Eastern and Central Europe , which allows us to have a presence on those markets. Currently, GLP is present in 12 markets in Europe. We have offices in the biggest Markets,we are a global business with a local approach.</p><h4>How many assets do you have in Europe, and what is the importance of Spain in your portfolio?</h4><p>Gazeley in the past was a company that systematically traded their assets. In 2016, we sold all our assets in Spain and Italy. As a result, most of our presence was in Germany, the UK, and France. Now, since 2018, we are developing a strong investment strategy to diversify our portfolio. The strategic plan is to grow in promotion by promoting our own products or the acquisition of buildings. We are long-term investors not traders. We have not acquired a portfolio in Spain yet, though it is something that we are looking at, and we will invest when the opportunity arises. We will not invest at extremely high prices.. We continue to look at opportunities in Spain, but we will not invest if we do not see a solid opportunity. In Europe, we have around 4,5 million sqm of assets under management, and in Spain we have 140,000sqm of finished buildings and a land bank of 600,000sqm. We have presence in Madrid, Castilla la Mancha , Catalonia, and Valencia, and we plan to develop in the markets of Andalucia and Euskadi. We will alternate big projects in strategic logistic locations, such as the municipality of Illescas the city of Guadalajara and prime areas like a project in Villaverde near Madrid and others in Prime areas of Barcelona market.</p><h4>GLP operates in an attractive, profitable, and also competitive sector. What is GLP's differentiating strategy with respect to its competitors?</h4><p>We are long-term investors, not opportunists. We see several investments in the market at this moment that are moving in short-term operations and many aggressive trading operations. There is currently risk in some real estate balances that project rapid increase of the rents, which is extremely dangerous. The margins of our clients cannot afford very high rent increases, and some balances are projected very high increases in the revenues.. We have been in this market for 30 years and if we invest, we are doing it based on a fundamental analysis that tells us if the investment is resilient and resistant to cycles. Each organization is very respectable, but we should not forget the essence of the business, the warehouse, and be careful on investments guided by an Excel spreadsheet.</p><h4>GLP has closed the rental of its first warehouse in Spain to DHL Supply Chain, which will manage the logistics of the European Zalando fashion platform in Spain. What does this project entail for the company, and what are its main characteristics?</h4><p>It is an important project for us that shows that quality is paramount to GLP. We talk about one of the best warehouses in Spain, which is one of the reasons why our clients decided to join this project. This project shows the essence of our business, which is our outstanding customer service and quality. The agreement was almost closed in March and has continued despite the pandemic. Another significant project during this past year was the acquisition, in the municipality of Sagunto, of a plot of land measuring 140,000sqm, where we could build a 180,000-sqm warehouse on two floors or 90.000m2 on single level buildings. The project can be built immediately. Rent prices in Sagunto are extremely affordable compared to other areas, excellent location on the Mediterranean corridor, which is why many companies are eying the area.</p><h4>The pandemic has shown the importance of having local manufacturing companies. What's your stake in that?</h4><p>I agree; it has been proven that is important to not to depend completely on one provider, specially overseas providers. We have realized with the pandemic that problems might crop up. We are in a geopolitical context, and the logistics chain might sometimes be prepared for contingencies. We fear this might not be the last pandemic, and we have to be prepared. In addition, more trade wars might occur, so we have to be prepared as well. More companies are seeing the value of having a local storage facility as buffer and to be able to respond to urgent customer needs.</p><h4>How do you differentiate yourselves from your competitors in terms of sustainability?</h4><p>We were pioneers in Spain to systematically have environment certifications in 2003. Back then, investing in these areas in Europe was a plus. Today, it is essential to invest in environmentally friendly buildings. It is paramount to have sustainable buildings if a company wants to stay in the sector for the long term. Some of our buildings are at the top in terms of sustainability. Today, many skilled workers also work in warehouses, so we need to provide them with a comfortable environment. Having warehouses with comfortable insulation or natural light are small factors that help companies retain employees. Workers truly value working in comfortable environments, and we are pioneers in that area. We are working heavily on well-being policies, and we are already implementing many strategies for the people working in our buildings.</p><h4>What is your main priority for 2021?</h4><p>We are focused on sustainable growth. We are in an expansion process in Spain but at sustainable level. That is the guarantee for our clients that we will not dramatically increase the price of rents. This will help us build a long-term relationship with our customers. We are looking at responsible growth for the long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the mission and vision of GW pharmaceuticals over the past 20 years?</h4><p>GW Pharmaceuticals (GW) is a global biopharmaceutical company that over the past 23 years has established a world-leading position in cannabinoid science and medicine. GW's mission is to unlock the potential of the cannabis plant through rigorous scientific investigations and extensive clinical trials to improve the lives of seriously ill patients. Founded over two decades ago in response to significant unmet patient need, patients remain our key focus and improving their quality of life, our motivation. GW's pioneering work has led to the regulatory approval of world first, potentially life improving, cannabis-based medicines. Our continued dedication to research and development in this field has resulted in the treatment of thousands of patients with our medicines. We have partnered with regulators, legislators, payors and the medical community to find a way forward for these novel medicines. By catalysing change within the current system, we have made our cannabis-based medicines more accessible and established a roadmap for a new area of medicine that others could follow.</p><h4>What prompted the decision for GW to enter the Spanish market?</h4><p>Formally establishing our presence in Spain underscores our long-term commitment to Spanish patients and physicians and furthers GW's mission to bring innovative cannabinoid medicines to patients with high unmet need. Spain continues to be one of Europe's best environments for research and clinical development and is an important hub for GW Pharmaceuticals. Multiple Spanish hospitals have participated in GW clinical trials and we're proud to currently be conducting significant levels clinical research with key health centres in Spain to investigate the potential for cannabinoid medicines in a range of rare disease areas.</p><h4>How much does GW invest in R&amp;D to keep discovering and promoting the benefits of cannabinoids?</h4><p>Globally, GW has invested over EUR1.4 billion in research and development and the infrastructure needed to bring novel, innovative medicines to patients, and we employ over 1,000 people worldwide. Much of what is known about the medical uses of cannabis was discovered by GW — we have led the way in understanding cannabinoid science and how, if harnessed correctly, it has the potential to improve the lives of patients and their families. Consequently, we have initiated a robust pipeline for clinical development, pioneering significant advancements in the development of cannabis-based medicines. Through collaboration with world leading specialists, institutions and research organisations, we will continue to invest heavily in the research needed to accelerate the development of medicines that address serious unmet medical needs and could help thousands more patients. As a world leader, we understand that we have an important role to play in informing and shaping the external environment to realise the full medical potential of the cannabis plant, while considering patient safety and the protection of public health. We take this responsibility very seriously.</p><h4>What are the main applications of cannabinoids? </h4><p>Cannabinoids are a broad group of three types of molecules (phytocannabinoids, endocannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids) that have an effect on or are related to the endocannabinoid system — a system in the human body that regulates many different physiological processes. Plant cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids) are unique to the cannabis plant and more than 100 have been identified. The two best understood plant cannabinoids are cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — both are known to have medical benefits, but for most potential indications, further research is needed to establish their efficacy and safety. Despite the pioneering work by GW to unlock the medical benefit of cannabis through rigorous scientific investigations and extensive clinical trials, there is still much we don't know about its true potential and the impact of CBD and THC on the human body, including potential side effects. We also know from our research that the cannabis plant contains a number of other phytocannabinoids and compounds that are or could be pharmacologically active at different levels and that need to be properly investigated for both their positive effects as well as their side effects. GW believes passionately in the potential therapeutic benefits of the cannabis plant and firmly believes that cannabis-based medicines have potential to improve the lives of patients and families. Over the past two decades we have established extensive experience in researching, developing and delivering novel, breakthrough medicines. By applying scientific and medical rigour to our understanding of the cannabis plant, we have already been able to bring two potentially life improving cannabis-based medicines to patients. Currently, we understand the evidence for the potential use of one of our medicines in certain types of rare epilepsy/seizure syndromes and another in spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis (MS).</p><h4>The medical cannabis sector is growing at pace among investors. What has GW's strategy been for attracting investment in such a new and unique industry? </h4><p>Over the past 23 years, GW has played a significant role in raising the profile of and shaping the medical side of the cannabis sector that we see today. We have individually established  a new market segment by proving that complex botanically-extracted cannabis-based medicines, whether complex or 'single' cannabinoid in composition, can be successfully routed through the established pharmaceutical regulatory approval pathway in the same way that all other medicines are. This dedication to research and development has broken new ground (unlike other cannabis-based products, our medicines have known and accepted safety, quality and efficacy profiles independently assessed by medicines regulators) and made GW's offer unique and therefore market leading within this field.   Consequently, our positioning as a patient-centric and science-led pharmaceutical company undertaking pioneering work to unlock the medical benefit of the cannabis plant has attracted long term investors to GW, drawn to our scientific and medical credibility, focus on unmet patient need in rare diseases and successful generation of high-quality data and evidence. We are proud to have paved the way for others to follow and now develop medicines via the established pharmaceutical regulatory approval pathway, and we encourage other companies to follow our lead in the best interests of patients.  The more substantial, high quality evidence that can be gathered before subsequent assessment via the existing regulatory route, the better for patients and clinicians.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for 2021? </h4><p>Our immediate priority in Spain is to collaborate as closely and swiftly as possible with relevant Spanish agencies to ensure access to our medicines for the patients and clinicians who urgently need them. Looking to the future, GW remains committed to leveraging our deep scientific knowledge, regulatory know how and extensive body of research in cannabinoid science to treat other diseases where our medicines could help address significant unmet need. These include autism, spasticity associated with spinal cord injury (SCI), neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (NHIE) and schizophrenia. Given our experience and leadership, we also feel it is our duty to educate on our findings and experience to promote better understanding of this emerging area of medicine and ensure accurate and evidenced based discourse on science.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The group began operations in 1891, operates in more than 100 countries, and has become a leader in its segment in Spain. How has Scania evolved in Spain?</h4><p>We have evolved from Scania Spain and Portugal, with private capital, to Scania Ibérica. Nevertheless, in Spain 50% of the commercialization network is private. However, Portugal's distribution and retail are 100% Scania, while Spanish retail is 50% Scania and 50% private. This has changed as a result of client requests. Currently, all the technology of a vehicle requires the brand to be more present. For example, one of our current trucks has four computers, so we must be connected to the central control unit and monitor the process in the event of an emergency. All this technology has been under development for 10 years. In addition, the current client knows the transport well, and we provide them with fleet availability. We are introducing new technologies such as electric and gas trucks, and that needs a brand presence to monitor and use and train drivers. All this has allowed us to become more client focused. Next, we will focus on infrastructure.</p><h4>What main services and products do you offer in Spain?</h4><p>The main services are the new truck division, which has the highest turnover. We also offer urban, commuter, and long-distance buses and industrial engines, which, in terms of services, make up 30% of our turnover. The size of the company expands with the market. During the pandemic, because we had such a well-developed service system, we had no downtime. For example, comparing 2020 to 2019, we were at similar levels in terms of revenue. We only saw a 30% reduction in new trucks' revenue, though the other divisions remained the same. The objective of Scania is to accompany client activity, which is why we put in a significant amount of effort into our services. We seek to offer the best on the market in terms of products and services. We also focus on sustainability. All our plants are sustainable and, in one year, we will have solar panels.</p><h4>In terms of sectors, who are your main clients?</h4><p>In the Iberian market, our main clients are long-distance distributors. In Spain, there is a great deal of agricultural industry. Transport across Europe is ongoing; therefore, we are taking products all over Europe, translating into thousands of kilometers driven.</p><h4>What strategy did Scania implement to mitigate the impact of the pandemic?</h4><p>Our business plan for 2020 was to grow, though we had to modify and change the structure in order to overcome the pandemic. We had to determine if the entire fleet would remain the same or be reduced. At first, it dropped 5% along with buses. In terms of strategies, we extended leasing and renting in close collaboration with clients. We did not have any type of layoffs, so we were able to maintain similar levels of activity. We have adapted well to the pandemic and expect to have a solid ratio of people vaccinated by summer. This will generate more tourism and, therefore, increase transportation services. Currently, the trend in transportation is already up two to three points from the non-pandemic months of 2020. In addition, on a production level we have a sales estimate of 3,080 trucks for 2021. The positive thing is that we offer an essential service—transportation—and do not depend as much on teleworking as other companies dedicated to other services.</p><h4>What is your strategy in terms of sustainability? How will your new center differ from your existing ones?</h4><p>In all retail centers, we will measure electricity consumption for a year in order to determine exactly how much we need. In the new facility that we will build in Madrid, we will work alongside the distribution company, the training center, retail and service operations, and the communication center for the entire Iberian Peninsula. That equates to 40,000sqm. In these centers, we will conduct electrical consumption tests and analyze the investment plan to install solar panels. We want to determine the investment that is most convenient for us, bearing in mind the center in which we will install them. Once we have carried out the corresponding analysis of each center, we will start a bidding process for the use of clean technology. We already have solar panels for hot water consumption, but the workshop operates 12 hours per day and consumes large amounts of electricity. Therefore, we must choose the company that best suits our needs. This is not only in Madrid but across all the brand houses in order to become more sustainable.</p><h4>Another notable novelty of the Scania facilities is the creation of a connectivity center. What is the importance of innovation for Scania?</h4><p>Connectivity is mostly about knowing where a truck is and how much it consumes. We have been developing connectivity for 20 years and have reached a level of innovation in which the system informs us of any failure in a vehicle. Through this, we can repair vehicles with minimal inconvenience. In addition, we offer 24-hour assistance. The most important thing in terms of connectivity is that the truck interacts with the client. For example, it tells you whether to brake or accelerate. Then, we collect this information and analyze it to verify that all parameters are being met. When these parameters are not met, training is conducted. Although sometimes we have cases in which a client does not want us to have that control, they must accept it so we are able to provide a better service. There are two effects, which are truck care and client benefit. In Spain and Portugal, we have a 55% compliance with these parameters and we want to increase this to 80%. Every 10 points supposes one liter of fuel, so it ends up benefiting us and the client. We must continue to innovate in terms of technology to improve the transport of the future.</p><h4>What are the main objectives of Scania?</h4><p>We want to adapt ourselves to the post-pandemic world and study how to adapt to the new technologies in the market, new regulations, and the needs of clients and, in addition, continue monitoring these technologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Established 44 years ago in Spain, the US multinational BD has become a leader in medical devices. Can you provide an overview of the company's evolution in Spain?</h4><p>The company was established in Spain 44 years ago. We first opened offices in Madrid, and soon after that we opened the manufacturing facility in San Agustin de Guadalix. Then, we acquired an existing manufacturing plant in Fraga, in the community of Aragon. We are also present in Portugal, and in 2015 we acquired CareFusion. Through that operation, we went from a USD8-billion revenue to USD12 billion. We then acquired Bard in 2017, with which we entered the world of surgery. These two companies provide products and services that are complementary to ours so we can offer more integrated solutions to patient care.</p><h4>BD has a wide range of services and solutions. How would you divide this portfolio? </h4><p>Broadly speaking, we have products and solutions in healthcare covering all the continuum of patient care, including research about diseases and treatments, diagnosis, treatment, and the monitoring of these treatments. For diagnosis, particularly, we have solutionsfor infectious diseases and for in-vitro testing. In cancer, we have products for the diagnosis of lymphomas and cervical cancer. And for treatment administration, we have many devices to administer drugs such as syringes, catheters, and infusion pumps. We have devices that are involved in the entire process to supply medication to patients. And finally, we have legacy Bard® products, mainly for chirurgical/surgical treatments. We have syringes for biopsies, as well as several products for chirurgical interventions. One area in which we are stronger in is patient safety; BD has excellent solutions to prevent and control infections in hospitals and for medical errors prevention. As well we have very advanced solutions for sepsis and diabetes, among others.</p><h4>What impact has the pandemic had in your operations?</h4><p>We have been operating 24/7, at full tilt. We have had some COVID-19 cases among our employees, though we did not disrupt our manufacturing processes. We have seen an increase in demand for some products due to the pandemic, such as infusion pumps, for example. On the other hand we also saw a decrease for some surgeries what impact us negatively. As well there has been a huge increase in the needs of syringes due to the vaccine, and we are investing to meet the demand for these products. We are developing new products, hiring more teams, and increasing our manufacturing capacity. We are also being flexible and doing things faster than before. We are an international company; therefore, our factories manufacture to provide services worldwide. We also implemented a policy for remote work for office employees as soon as the virus began to spread in Spain. However, our workers that had to visit hospital staff continued to go to hospitals, and we are implementing personal protection measures to prevent infections.</p><h4>BD produces the most efficient syringes for the COVID-19 vaccine. Can you provide some of the characteristics of your syringe?</h4><p>This one was developed based on  the characteristics that the syringe should have for massive vaccination campaigns defined by the CDC. It is a syringe that is easy to use. The needle is integrated into the syringe, so healthcare workers do not need to manipulate it too much. Other key feature is that there is a piece in the top of the plunger that allows that all the vaccine is injected into the patient do there is low dead space and it facilitates the use of 15% more of vaccine that it is not discarded once the syringe has been used. It is a useful product that has made a difference during this time, because it can be used quickly and makes more efficient use of the vaccine possible.</p><h4>BD has invested EUR1.5 million in the Fraga factory in order to fulfill orders. It will increase its capacity from 24,000 to 38,000 pallets. What are your production plans?</h4><p>Our investment was made for a line of production of that syringe. In Spain we have three plants: in San Agustin, Fraga, and Almaraz. In the last five years, we have invested EUR140 million in Fraga, and there are many large projects that we are trying to bring to Spain, especially now with the European recovery funds. We have invested EUR40 million in the last few years in the plant of San Agustin, and we will invest EUR20 million more in the coming years. We have some products in Spain that are only manufactured here for the entire world, so we are very proud of that. We also have a heavily automated warehouse. We expect to continue increasing our production in Spain and bring more products into the country.</p><h4>What are some of your key priorities for 2021?</h4><p>The main thing is for the entire team is to continue to remain healthy. These are difficult times, so we are implementing programs to maintain high levels of safety. We want to increase our current levels of production to be able to comply with the growing demand. In addition, we want to remain flexible. Apart from the syringes, we also have COVID-19 tests and other products such as infusion pumps that are helping to contribute to resolve this pandemic. Those products are our focus on the short run. In 2020, our revenue was EUR220 million, and in 2019 it was around EUR250 million.. Even though if during 2020 we have had success with many products that deal with COVID-19, such as our syringe, these are cheap products and the slowdown of other medical procedures has affected our other business. We have many products and solutions prepared for the future that focus on digitalization and achieving better results for health.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are SCR's mission, vision, and major benchmarks to highlight in the last six decades?</h4>
<p>Historically, SCR was created in 1960 through the political initiative of the former Prime Minister Abderrahhim Bouabid just after independence of the kingdom of Morocco. He wanted to create a national reinsurer to ensure capacity in the Moroccan reinsurance market to support the kingdom's major projects and protect Morocco from the turbulence of the international market. We have become a regional player and bound by our trade to diversify risk. While remaining strongly established and anchored in our original market where we are a leader, international business now constitutes an important part of our activity with 44% of net written premiums. In 2021, we are set to see a turnover of EUR200 million. SCR's mission is to be anchored in Morocco in order to establish a connection between Africa and the Middle East. These are our two main markets for expansion. Beyond this, we have expanded into other markets, primarily in Asia, though we are committed to our expansion in emerging countries. We feel confident about the future over the next three or four years, for which we have a solid economic model and a business plan that offers us a certain degree of security. Our monitoring is carried out by international credit agencies that determine the solvency margin, which is vital for reinsurers. We enjoy a local rating of AAA by Fitch rating and our AM Best rating is B++.</p>
<h4>What are the main strategic objectives and missions of the African Centre of Catastrophe Risks (ACCR)?</h4>
<p>ACCR is a technical center whose purpose is to undertake and coordinate joint actions of the African Insurance Organization (AIO) members to develop the insurance and reinsurance of catastrophe risks in Africa and leveraging the insurance as a mitigation and risk reduction instrument. Our work consists of building awareness among the African public about the importance of catastrophe risks insurance to the long term sustainable development of the society. The awareness effort shall stimulate the demand for insurance products in general and expedite the growth of the African Insurance Market.</p>
<h4>How do you plan to respond to the risk resulting from cybercrime?</h4>
<p>This is one of the challenges for the future of the SCR. We are confident about the importance of emerging risks and we will work to be a market aggregator. The basic rule that we want to deploy is to put forward a geographical diversification as well as a diversification by targeted activity branch. For this, we are negotiating with an international reinsurer with expertise in this area. We are looking at a scenario where we will keep some of the risk and cede the rest.</p>
<h4>What trends are you seeing in the Moroccan insurance market, and how are you adapting to these developments?</h4>
<p>The insurance market is heavily tied to the economy. Right now, we are seeing an economic downturn across the world, and in Morocco as well. There are, however, opportunities to be taken. The reinsurance world and people in general are becoming more demanding in terms of certain strategies or types of risks that they no longer cover in their investment strategies, and, therefore, we are seeing opportunities arising or already existing for regional reinsurers. If we look at global economic growth, the insurance industry has not grown in the same way.</p>
<h4>What are the objectives of the SCR's internal academy now and into the future (SCR ACADEMY RE)?</h4>
<p>We created this Academy two years ago as part of our previous STRONG II strategic plan. We have just given it new impetus as part of the new strategic plan &ldquo;We Transform Tomorrow Together&rdquo; that we have just launched during the pandemic. This new orientation of the Academy aims to offer to our clients in the insurance market in Morocco and Africa training in insurance and reinsurance. We are also evolving, integrating new soft skills development programs and giving it a broader dimension by integrating internal training components. Currently, we are working on the framing of a digital space for knowledge management and also in the creation of partnership with several specialized institutions and with universities to propose end of study projects for the doctorate.</p>
<h4>SCR has announced a new 2021-2023 transformation plan. Could you tell us more on this, and what your top priority is for 2021?</h4>
<p>The We Tomorrow Together transformation plan has been developed throughout the pandemic. With all the SCR teams, we are proud to have taken up the challenges of this period and to have deployed a new strategic plan. Indeed, this is a new 2021-2023 roadmap made up of four pillars. The first pillar is dedicated to Business Growth &amp; Profitability considered as one of the pillars of growth, business development and financial performance. The second is much more focused on risk management and improving ratings. The third focuses on process improvement and service engagement, and the fourth pillar concerns strengthening the employer brand and the marketing policy we need to adopt vis-&agrave;-vis customers in our markets. These projects were framed with the various project managers. We will endeavor to ensure that we are sufficiently solid to meet the expectations and objectives of our shareholders, and to maintain a solvency margin in line with regulatory requirements.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Capital Energy, founded in 2002, describes itself as the first vertically integrated 100% renewable electricity company on the Iberian Peninsula. What is its mission and vision?</h4><p>Our mission is to make a decisive contribution to an ecological and just transition of both our economy and society through the energy sector transition under way. The five values that define Capital Energy are commitment, innovation, agility, digitalization, and sustainability. Within this mission, our vision is to become a leading 100% renewable energy company and an integral part of the entire value chain of the sector.</p><h4>What have been the main milestones for Capital Energy over these past 20 years?</h4><p>The company has gone through several phases. It was founded in 2002 as a developer of offshore wind energy. It then moved into different technologies, keeping pace with the evolution of industry regulation and policy. In 2008 and 2009, regulatory changes led to an effective moratorium on new renewable developments. Up until that point, the company had been growing on the development side. It was able to put several renewable projects into construction and operation, though these regulatory changes meant that a large part of its portfolio became unviable overnight as these technologies were not competitive at the time. In 2015 the company renewed intensive investment in new developments and professional talent, anticipating the needs of the market, and in 2018 it opted for a more ambitious strategic design change, more aligned with the industrial and long-term vocation of our shareholders to move toward integration across the entire value chain. Since then, growth has been exponential.</p><h4>What is the strategy of Capital Energy for the future?</h4><p>We have developed a huge development portfolio, both in terms of the number of projects and the potential megawatts to be installed. We have a solid positioning distributed across the territory. We also have a highly diversified portfolio in terms of technology that focuses primarily on wind power, but with a significant contribution to growth coming from solar PV, especially through hybridization. We are also taking our first steps in new technologies like energy storage and green hydrogen production. Leveraging on this, our strategy is to create value in the long-term in a sustainable manner, moving ahead with all these projects, building them and keeping most of the assets in operation. We will manage their energy output in an integrated manner, both in wholesale markets and in the retail market, capturing most of the value along the chain and leveraging on our digital capabilities. We are currently studying all the options available to raise the additional capital we need to this end in the most efficient and prudent manner.</p><h4>What is the intention of Capital Energy regarding the European Next Generation funds?</h4><p>We are highly active, as we have presented more than 40 initiatives of varying kinds. Some are related to renewable hydrogen generation, and others to the field of digitalization and communication systems associated with our portfolio of renewable assets.</p><h4>The renewables sector is currently one of the most attractive though also extremely competitive. What sets Capital Energy from other companies?</h4><p>Our foresight has given us a leading position on the development side, with one of the largest portfolios and a differentiating factor in terms of our technological offer. Initially, we based our growth on wind power technology, and this sets us apart from the whole market. We have also focused on the Iberian market, which is one of the markets with the greatest potential. All this is in addition to an integrated model, end-to-end which is unique, and a team of highly-experienced professionals from the sector that we have brought together to carry out this project.</p><h4>What is the Portuguese market like for Capital Energy?</h4><p>We are following a similar business model in Portugal to the one in Spain. We are seeking to develop a portfolio of greenfield assets and exploring various options offered in the Portuguese market. Our project in Portugal is less mature than in Spain, but we are generating a portfolio of more than 40 projects.</p><h4>How has the pandemic affected Capital Energy, and what strategies have been adopted?</h4><p>From the beginning, the objective of the company was to ensure the health of all our people and stakeholders associated with our business. Under that premise, we adapted our processes and operations, leveraging on our digital capabilities to ensure that we continued to push the business forward. Once these two areas had been secured, we also pitched in to alleviate, as far as possible, the negative effects of this crisis. We purchased medical supplies for distribution to various medical and geriatric centers. We also helped to promote the development of OxyVita, an innovative low-cost respirator. Together with other energy developers, we launched the Energí­a Positiva Call to support startup ventures that had projects that would help alleviate, at least in the short term, the impact of the pandemic in terms of energy and sustainability. The renewable sector has shown great resilience within this framework and has become one of the driving sectors of today's economy.</p><h4>What is the main objective for Capital Energy for 2021?</h4><p>The main objective is to continue to accelerate the company's business lines. We will build and put into operation more projects and attract more customers. We will continue to contribute to sustainable growth and prosperity in the areas where we operate. This is a crucial year for Capital Energy since we will finish laying the groundwork for the next three years, which will be the most intensive in terms of capital and asset construction.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Doing that will involve a great deal of work; however, our goal for GDCME under Vision 2030 is to be a conduit which will help realize the Kingdom's objective of localizing 50% military expenditure through the development of national engineering solutions, capable of supporting military platforms now and in the future to the highest standards and quality.</p><h4>In the next 10 years, how do you envision international partnerships between the Saudi local defense and the global defense companies?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia has been working with international companies like: Boeing, BAE Systems, and Lockheed for nearly 80 years. Now the Kingdom focus is on: technology transfer, localization, and in-country manufacturing which will ultimately lead to endogenous growth. Vision 2030 came at the right time, Saudi Arabia has the third largest defense budget in the world and the efforts to localize at least 50% of that by 2030 are strong and aggressive.</p><h4>How is know-how transferred to the local workforce?</h4><p>Initially by identifying required and available local capabilities provides a baseline and understanding the required capabilities through a capability gap analysis provides data on what is required. Through this the correct level of investment, training, and education can be planned which will lead to the development of new capabilities and local 'know-how'. This in turn provides the baseline for activity, initially on simple components, gradually developing activities into more complex components  then sub-assemblies, and finally full assembly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved over the last few years?</h4><p>The last two years have been fairly intense. At a national level, 2019 was a record year for us in terms of sales volume and market share. In 2020, the vehicle market was hit hard by the pandemic. For Mazda, 2020 was a year of two halves. The lockdown in the first half of the year shut down dealerships, thus halting business. However, the easing of restrictions in the second half of the year lessened the pressure on the economy. In the latter period, business activity began to pick up, so things worked out relatively well. We broke our market share record by 1.67% once again. That said, the year as a whole was no doubt affected by the pandemic.</p><h4>What is your view on the subsidies and incentives offered by the government such as Renove Plan or Moves to stimulate demand?</h4><p>The car industry is the most important sector of the Spanish economy, in terms of both its contribution to GDP and the trade balance. It is the country's biggest export sector and has a great infrastructure of suppliers, pieces, dealerships, workshops, and more. It also generates quality employment and significant wealth, with training standards and salaries above the Spanish average, and is a driving force for other areas both directly and indirectly. Substantial government support for the sector is logical. It is necessary to drive forward improvements in decarbonization and emissions reduction and to combat climate change. Mazda has an extremely ambitious program to reduce emissions through the vehicles it sells between now and 2050. However, the tremendous effort that companies are making in terms of investment and technology in order to reduce these emissions is met with minimal subsidies from the European Union, and penalties for those manufacturers that fail to meet CO2 emission targets. The MOVES program has been poorly structured. Some regions have launched the scheme in different years, while others have failed to use the funds apportioned to them in 2020 or used up their allocated funds in just a few months. This is the only assistance manufacturers have received to promote the sale of electric cars, the demand for which is relatively low in Spain. It has been announced that the RENOVE scheme will not continue this year, and that the excess funds from 2020 will be redistributed. A new MOVES plan with similar features has been announced. I hope lessons have been learned from previous mistakes and that improvements have been made. On January 1, the WLTP came into force as a homologation system that produces a tax increase of between 5% and 60% on cars sold in Spain. There isn't another sector in Spain that is not currently receiving financial support and also receiving a tax increase in the current climate.</p><h4>What are the features of the Mazda MX-30?</h4><p>The Mazda MX-30 is designed for its primary purpose, which is to contribute to emissions reduction. Mazda believes that CO2 emissions should be assessed and measured via the well-to-wheel process. Electric cars produce less CO2 emissions than a conventional car when in use, but more emissions in their manufacturing and final recycling process. Therefore, using a battery that is the right size is fundamental. The issue is that the desire for large batteries for greater autonomy is becoming widespread, and the weight of the battery itself works against efficiency. Considering the electric car as an eminently urban car or an intercity car with a close-range is the best option. For those customers who need to make regular long-distance trips, the electric car is not the best solution. They should look for other alternatives. At the end of 2021, we will be presenting a new version of the MX-30. This version will include a rotary engine that will function as a generator and will serve to extend the autonomy of the car if necessary. We can use that rotary engine to recharge the autonomy and make a slightly longer trip. This engine uses Mazda technology, and we are the only manufacturer that uses it.</p><h4>What are the sales expectations for 2021?</h4><p>It is difficult to make predictions right now, but our latest forecasts are for 17,000 car sales. This would represent a growth of 21% on 2020.</p><h4>Mazda intends to use existing technologies to reduce emissions. What strategy will be followed to achieve this objective?</h4><p>We are working with hydrogen, but it is still years away from being a viable, widespread, and cost-competitive industrial energy force. In the more immediate term, we are working on electrification. By 2030, all our models will be electrified. Within this process, we are using different formulas, from pure electric, electric with autonomy extension, plug-in hybrids, and so on. In addition, we are continuing to work on improving the efficiency of our internal combustion engines, as most of the cars we sell will continue to have one. In 2022, we will launch a new generation of the product, which will incorporate a new generation of engines. These engines, combined, will produce extremely low emissions.</p><h4>What is the main objective for 2021?</h4><p>Aside from 21% growth, we have ongoing objectives. We have had a clear and well-defined strategy for years, which we have been working on steadily. For example, our digitalization and our dealer network digitalization, which has been accelerated by the pandemic. We also value loyalty and the customer experience. We want to continue improving in these areas, both in terms of car sales and after-sales. Often, all these go hand-in-hand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main highlights for QRDI in 2020?</h4><p>Between late 2019 and early 2020, we finalized the QRDI 2030 strategy, which came  after a great deal of engagement with stakeholders, academia, industry leaders, and the government. This is a 10-year strategy in line with Qatar National Vision 2030, and we see it as a transformative agenda that will have a positive impact on Qatar's economy in Qatar and our ability to address national challenges over the next decade. During this period, the strategy was endorsed by the QRDI Council and reviewed by the highest levels of government. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has allowed us to see first-hand how our lives and economy can be affected by unexpected challenges, and the critical role research and innovation has to play in both the response and recovery to such challenges. This has energized us even more, and reaffirmed the importance of this strategy to Qatar.</p><h4>How does QRDI contribute to the fulfillment of Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>One of the important elements of Qatar National Vision 2030 is that it called for Qatar to progress toward building a sustainable, diversified, knowledge-based economy. It outlines how this goal can be achieved in several ways, including enabling and expanding the private sector and leveraging innovation, entrepreneurship, our educational infrastructure, talent, and our existing competitive advantages. Leveraging our competitive advantages is exactly what we need to focus on. When we study the journey of many other countries and advanced economies, those that were successful in building an innovation ecosystem did so because they leveraged their advantages. There are many examples of this globally, but Norway and Singapore especially come to mind. Norway's petroleum industry contributes significantly to the country's GDP, but it is strategically diversifying and using technology to build a bridge from oil and gas to other connected industries. The lesson is that innovation ecosystems are not built in a vacuum, but on a nation's strengths, and that technology allows the transition to other 'adjacent' industries. Qatar has many competitive advantages that can be leveraged for expansion into adjacent industries; the primary example is Qatar's investments to build one of the largest and most sophisticated integrated LNG supply chains in the world. Others include Qatar's investments in logistics and transport infrastructure through Qatar Airways, Qatar Rail, Milaha, Qatar Port, and Doha Port; in telecoms with Ooredoo and Vodafone; in media, such as with Al Jazeera and beIN Sports; as well as in its state-of-the-art free zones. All these investments now represent 'platforms' for new technologies to be tested and deployed, in a small geographical space that can open up huge opportunities for synergy. In this pathway, the entire nation essentially becomes a platform for new innovation-driven businesses to test new-to-market technologies and create new solutions. Qatar has everything it takes to build an innovation-based economy and fulfill its vision of building a knowledge-based economy in the next 10 years.</p><h4>How can QRDI boost the industrialization of the country, which is one of the main targets of Qatar National Vision 2030, and help fill the gaps that are not covered by the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>Rather than a gap, it is an opportunity. We have incredibly well-organized industrial space in Qatar, and this can be leveraged to allow all kinds of innovative businesses to test and pilot technologies. This is the opportunity at our disposal. We have built a core competence that we are now beginning to use to diversify into new innovative knowledge-based industries — and the most important ingredient in this is talent. By focusing on the opportunity for the country to be a platform to pilot technology, we can attract and develop a new breed of talent that has the capability to design and develop new products. Qatar has various strengths and capabilities in terms of research and the procurement of existing mature technologies, but it is now time for us to ramp up our efforts to strengthen our capability to design and develop innovative products that can compete in the local, regional, and global marketplace. This capability will come from talented individuals and teams within our local ecosystem, through our fantastic universities or those who are attracted to come to Qatar from abroad to conduct such activities. In the end, new industries will emerge based on new businesses that are themselves based on a new breed of talent, working on things we cannot even imagine. So talented people are the foundation; talented people are the key. </p><h4>What is your partnership strategy, and how does QRDI articulate the ecosystem for innovation in the country?</h4><p>We have many of the components of a vibrant innovation ecosystem in Qatar - large state enterprises, scientific research institutes, universities, SMEs, government agencies. However, to have a meaningful and truly national impact, these pieces have to come together in a new dynamic that is characterized by three elements. The first is government agencies and large state enterprises acting as innovation platforms and test beds for new technologies. These technologies are developed by the second element, which are innovation-driven businesses — SMEs, start-ups, or multinational companies. Finally, all of this is served and supported by the third element: talent, services, and infrastructure made available by excellence and relevance in our universities and research institutes. For this dynamic to occur, we have to build new capabilities, remove longstanding obstacles, and create new incentives for new collaborations between different entities. This is where the QRDI Council plays a critical role, enabling this process to happen by creating partnerships between different actors, and supporting the development of Qatar's national RDI ecosystem.</p><h4>How does environmental friendliness and sustainability fit into this ecosystem?</h4><p>Environmental sustainability is extremely high on Qatar's agenda, as it drives itself toward significantly improving its environmental performance across many industries and activities. In Qatar, many entities and all our industries are heavily focused on improving their environmental footprint. We can procure existing technology and solutions to improve this performance and environmental sustainability, but there is also a recognition that not all challenges that may be unique to Qatar can be addressed by off-the-shelf solutions. This is where innovation comes in. Our plan for sustainability is to work with government agencies and large state enterprises to develop in-house capabilities that enable them to identify and articulate environmental challenges that are sufficiently unique to represent an opportunity for innovation to solve. To support these entities in building their capabilities, we would have 'sandboxes' allowing R&amp;D-based businesses to test their environmental solutions in the facilities of government agencies or large state enterprises. Our hope is that this will result in a wave of new sustainability-based businesses emerging from Qatar, capable of  addressing local and global problems and exporting their solutions worldwide.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you coordinate with other parts of the government on the pandemic response, and what role did SIDF play?</h4><p>SIDF was established in 1974 with a capital of USD133 million, thus SIDF has been supporting the Saudi manufacturing industry for 46 years by providing medium and long-term financial loans, advisory solutions and human capital development of the ecosystem. Today, as a financial enabler of the industrial transformation, SIDF has expanded its bylaws to extend its support to several promising sectors, raising its capital to USD28 billion in 2019 which allowed the fund to provide new tailored packages of financial services that meet the needs of the private sector in industry, mining, energy and logistics sectors under (NIDLP) the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program. SIDF is the financial enabler of NIDLP, which is one of the largest programs of Vision 2030, aiming to attract investment and transform the kingdom into a leading industrial powerhouse and a global logistics hub. When the pandemic occurred, the government was quick to respond and took decisive safety measures. We see the commitment to human life today in the low infection and fatality rates. In terms of economic measures, the government also acted quickly and early by launching urgent financial stimulus packages to ensure companies sustainability through the crisis. In line with these efforts, SDIF proactively supported small, medium, and large companies and offered financial initiatives tailored to their specific needs during these difficult times. These efforts resulted in three urgent financial initiatives aid that exceeded USD1.3 billion; the aid was in the form of restructuring installments of 546 loans due in 2020 amounting to USD1 billion. The financial liquidity of the companies was augmented by credit instrument to finance the operating expenses of the companies, especially the ones impacted by the lockdown, out of which 86 companies have benefited from the initiative for a total amount of USD127 million. Finally, launching an accelerated working capital loan amounting to USD172 million directed to finance the raw material requirements of the companies involved in the medical sector to help in boosting the local medical content and kingdom's pharmaceutical security. We have also focused on investing in human capital SIDF Academy has managed to train around 2,000 participants from employees, clients and employees of other entities serving the industrial ecosystem from both the private and public sectors. These specialized training programs are organized with leading international organizations such as Stanford University, London Business School, and Fitch Learning.</p><h4>Does your recent capital increase reflect a strategic reorientation in line with the Vision 2030 goals?</h4><p>That was exactly the point; pre-2015, our capital was USD11 billion, in 2017 it has been increased to over USD17 billion, then two years later it got raised to USD28 billion. The successive increases of capital show the government's commitment to the sectors we serve. In order to transform the Kingdom and have a vision destination, SIDF had to change in three ways. We delivered and introduced new sectors in late 2019 and 2020, as we had focused mostly on manufacturing for more than 40 years. In 2019, we expanded our sectors offerings to include the whole mining process, logistics, and renewables with project financing. We also introduced the working capital loan, which proved to be extremely useful in 2020. We also introduced acquisition financing to support companies to consolidate or bring technologies into the Kingdom. To create packages and programs that proactively nudge the private sector, so we introduced packages on competitiveness and created programs that fund digitalization, automation, energy efficiency, and increasing local content. We signed with the likes of Aramco, Ma'aden, and SABIC to localize their supply chains in addition to having curated programs to help SMEs scale up.</p><h4>SIDF recently completed a far-reaching digitalization drive for its internal processes. What did this achieve?</h4><p>Our process had not changed significantly since the 1970s, so in 2019 we introduced a major overhaul. We rewrote the process, changed the organizational structure to align with that process, and built a new digital system. We also anticipated the need to embrace the idea of working anywhere and shifted to laptops. The process of digitalization took a long time, as our activities, such as project finance, do not look at the financials of a company but their business plans. Asking a private company to only communicate online a system is difficult, but it is essential if we are to address the need in the market. Now one can apply for and sign a loan on an online system, even factory visits can be carried out through our app. This provides transparency on the challenges and issues we have with the process and address clients' needs.</p><h4>What technologies are you prioritizing in the manufacturing sector, and where do you see that effort in the broader goals of Vision 2030?</h4><p>We took a path where our efforts should be guiding the private sector to where that industry is heading. For Industry 4.0, we created financing programs that provide additional incentives in terms of the tenure, loan terms, or amount we finance. Instead of financing up to 50% of CAPEX, for example, we finance up to 75% and give a tenure of 20-30% longer if companies get into specific projects or improve the way they manufacture. One example would be a smart warehouse that was built recently. Because it was utilizing robotics and automated processes, we financed up to 70% and gave the company a grace period of at least 10 years. This is a crucial direction for Saudi Arabia, as cheap labor is losing to automation globally. By automating, we create better jobs and can hire more Saudis even though the number of overall jobs might fall. We will not have the resistance other countries have, and we have the capital to support that transformation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a Mexican spirits company, what has your experience entering international markets been like?</h4><p>I studied in Spain for a year during my university degree, and I made many friends. I noticed that   Mexican spirits were not being represented adequately in the international market and I felt that there was an opportunity to develop product that was not a cliché. This project was born as an international project meant for exportation. I did not like how national alcoholic beverages were being exported, so I wanted to developed a product that shared my view of Mexico. That's how the Mitre project was born. We developed a bottle that is shaped like a jaguar's head to represent a fusion between the traditional and modern side of Mexico in an elegant manner. The first years were spent on positioning the brand in the domestic market. We realized we could position ourselves strongly in Mexico and also enter other markets. We have the market position we sought before the pandemic. We were signing contracts that were not affected by the pandemic, and that opened gates for us. We have also started to find opportunities abroad, in the US. We have been making some headway. It has not been the ideal year that we thought, but we are maintaining our international contracts.</p><h4>What strategies did you use to differentiate yourself in the Mexican market?</h4><p>In terms of wines and liqueur, a company can position itself in the segment for alcohol consumed in cafeterias, bars, or restaurants. This is on trade. Or, one can position themselves in off trade, which is when you purchase the product in a store to consume it elsewhere. Normally, you would develop a 360-degree strategy. Thankfully, we have a product that is disruptive in terms of image, and that helped us to get the doors open for us. Our image has always been extremely impactful and stands out. However, image alone is not enough. We had a team behind us that specialized in tasting events and promotion. I realized the importance of marketing for organizations after I read a book on the person who founded Nike. This was at the end of 2019. We wanted to be strong in marketing, so we hired an individual for public relations, a strategist on digital segmentation, video, and content. Today, huge campaigns can be conducted on social networks, and we invest heavily on digital content and advertising. We love being an artistic brand and take great care of our image. We try to do things right; there is a great deal of competition, and the difference between success and being irrelevant is not doing things well. We have two bottles with jaguar heads, but we also have a cheaper brand called Origen. Even though it is cheaper, it is still very artistic and of excellent quality.</p><h4>How important is online marketing with e-commerce?</h4><p>We started on Amazon in 2019, but we are not that heavily focused on that. We have three labels on Amazon. We also have the three labels in Mercado Libre. My father lives in Spain, and the pandemic hit there first, and he warned me in advance of what was to come to Mexico. I thus focused our efforts on e-commerce. We have excellent reviews on Amazon; there are more than 300 mezcal   labels on Amazon, and we have   one in top 10 and other in top 20.</p><h4>How did you prepare for the pandemic?</h4><p>We were already working on raising awareness for the brand. We realized stores could close down so we decided to focus on e-commerce. On Mercado Libre, we are the second-best ranked mezcal. The digital space is a challenging environment, with users having short attention spans, so we had to focus on making ourselves attractive to clients. There are mezcal brands that have been in the market for 20 years and might be among the bestsellers in stores and restaurants, but are not well positioned online. The key to being successful is to have a good budget and content. We do not have a huge budget, but we spend every peso well. There is a generational divide in the industry between boomers and millennials. The vision of each generation is completely different. It is essential for a business to have its own digital marketing division to boost their brands.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2021?</h4><p>I am very focused on the off-trade side, meaning stores. I am focused on selling at a national level. We expect to grow by 100%. We also want to have a presence in 100 relevant restaurants and bars in the gastronomic business. Mexico City is extremely important because if you are well established here, you can go to other cities on the outskirts. We also want to have a solid contract in the US next year. We have more than 1,000 selling points at a national level. In 2021, we will focus on consumption centers, namely restaurants, among other businesses. At an international level, the priority is the US market.</p><h4>What are your views on expanding in Europe?</h4><p>Before we expand in Europe, we first have to be in the US. Once we have grown the most we can in the US, then our quickest growth will be in other regions, including Europe. However, currently the potential is in the US. It does not make sense to go to other markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors are driving the automotive industry in Colombia, and where is Motorysa placing its bet?</h4><p>In 2020, the automotive sector fell by 28%, and the development and performance of the Colombian market was not good due to the lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic. However, the few segments in the whole market that saw growth were new energy vehicles including hybrids and electric vehicles. This is a new market mover and relates to around 4,000 vehicles sold in the EV segment. The growth is more than double digits and counts in some segments along with non EV vehicles as almost 100%. Colombia is one of the first countries in Latin America in terms of the sales of the EV segment. We held the number-one position in 2019 and 2018, and we also expect to be top within Latin American countries in 2020 in the sales of pure hybrid and electric vehicles. Motorysa has always looked to the future, and our portfolio is one of the most complete in the Colombian market. We are the distributors of the Mitsubishi Motors brand from Japan and were among the first electric vehicle sellers in Colombia in 2012. We have great experience in that electrical mobility vision with more than eight years' experience. We also distribute the brands of Mercedes-Benz including Freightliner, Fuso, and all the line of heavy trucks and premium vehicles.</p><h4>What factors drove your decision to establish a partnership with BYD?</h4><p>We were looking for a partner that could complete our portfolio and allow us to have the best one for the Colombian industry. Some five or six years ago, we started conversations with some brands, among them BYD, which is a Chinese company that started developing electric vehicles in 2006. Since 2013, it became one of the most important manufacturers of new energy vehicles NEV in the world, not only hybrid but also electric vehicles. BYD is one of the most complete and biggest conglomerates in that new energy vehicle segment and clean transportation systems in the world. When we met with BYD, we saw how the possibility of electrification was already realized in China and wanted to participate in that vision and technology in Colombia. We signed a deal to be the exclusive representatives of the BYD brand in Colombia at the end of 2019. Our strategy and business plan were to open the first showrooms in March 2020; unfortunately, due to the pandemic we had to stop everything, though we were able to launch the brand in July with a completely new digital format. At the end of 2020, we ended up with three new showrooms—two in Bogotá and one in Medellí­n—with some sales; already, the BYD brand is number one in sales in electric vehicles in Colombia. With the BYD brand along with Mercedes, Freightliner, Fuso, and Mitsubishi, we have one of the best offerings for the Colombian automotive market. In 2021, we are certain Motorysa will become the number-one seller of electric vehicles EV in Colombia.</p><h4>Why is there so much interest in Colombia for electric and hybrid vehicles?</h4><p>The vision of the government is extremely important; the last president also had a vision to make Colombia one of the most developed countries in Latin America in electric transportation. Since 2016, we have had one of the strongest regulations in getting incentives for importing and selling electric vehicles. That means the Colombian government already has, for example, zero duties, VAT, and consumption tax for electric vehicles imported into the country, which is great for customers and brands like Motorysa to import vehicles. Many believe electric vehicles are expensive; however, with those tax incentives, they are becoming similar in price to a normal internal combustion engine. Secondly, there is a clear vision and roadmap for electrification. For example, tier-one cities, such as Bogotá, Medellí­n, and Cali, must have a number of charging stations by 2023, and tier-two and later tier-three cities will subsequently have charging stations as well by law. New buildings being built in tier-one cities must have at least one or two charging stations for residents, and new commercial centers must have around 2% of total parking spaces completely dedicated to electric vehicles. By 2030, almost 100% of the replacement of the total government fleet must be electric. This is the perfect storm for having electric vehicles in Colombia. In Colombia, almost all the brands that are present worldwide can be found here. Importers are making a great effort to import the latest technology, and along with those incentives and media coverage, we are leading the way in Latin America. We are far ahead of Brazil and Mexico, the largest automotive market countries in the region. We are extremely pleased that some of the customers are starting to be more aware of electrification and clean energy missions.</p><h4>What is your mission toward sustainability, and are you a Certified B company?</h4><p>A Certified B Corp. company (B Impact Assessment, along with United Nations) is one of the most important certifications a company can receive. It is a brand that accounts for sustainability, equal gender rights, the environment, ethics at work, and financial responsibility. The company is evaluated in many areas, and when it reaches a particular score, it will get a badge and certification. We launched this process in 2019, and even during the pandemic we continued working toward the certification. At the moment, we have surpassed the minimum score for a Certified B company and hope to receive our certification this year. This is extremely important not only for Motorysa Colombia but also for our international relationships.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DETASAD is the first and only Saudi Arabian company to export cloud services. What does that mean for the company at a time when the government is working to promote Saudi companies?</h4><p>We are doing it because it makes business sense and we really believe that we have a unique offering. We get amazing support from the government, the Ministry of Telecommunications (MCIT), Yesser and from other partners helping us in achieving our objectives and be the first Saudi company to export technology internationally in 2020 as part of the Saudi Vision 2030. In many cases, government facilities here are more advanced than in Europe or other places. You really feel that the entire country is standing behind Vision 2030 to make Saudi a technology hub in this digital era we live in. Everything is pushing in one direction, and there is a clear way forward. That is why we are optimistic that Saudi Arabia and DETASAD will come out of this crisis stronger than before. Technology will emerge as an accelerator that will help the country and economy emerge from the COVID-19 recession. Being positive about the future is key; if a leader doesn't believe that their organization can survive, they may as well close-up shop. This crisis is a huge opportunity for digital companies who are being forced to become more efficient in terms of cash management, resource management, and processes. If you build relationships now, your company will have a reputation that will draw business in for years to come. We offer our customers to work together in terms of cash management, commercial management, services, or payment services, for example.</p><h4>The pandemic has pushed the entire economy online, creating new challenges but also new opportunities. How has your business changed in the past year?</h4><p>We see that in order to be prepared for the current and coming crisis, we need to focus on the automation side of remote work and remote access. Increase our Cyber Security investments and Cyber knowledge as millions of people switched almost their entire activities to the virtual world and therefore, we launched DETASAD Ultimate SOC Solutions, hosted locally in Riyadh to maintain and keep our businesses and economy secured, protected 24/7 and disruption free. No company in Saudi Arabia that I have spoken with was truly prepared to send everyone to work from home. No technology company was set up that way, much less a construction or facility management company. The smart city platform and block chain technology will support people to be better prepared the next time. The integration of drone management technology, digital train technology, and remote metering and remote management technology are some of the innovations that we are focusing on. That is what we see as key drivers for our customers, aside from traditional cloud services. Being able to offer a full clone of our customers' environment in a secure way will be a key differentiator for everyone. It has to be done by a joint exercise, building partnerships that transcend even traditional competitive environments. Nearly all the companies in Saudi Arabia will have to work together to build this kind of ecosystem. One of our key partners in this aspect is Saudi Electric, which also gave us the go-ahead to be part of their health initiative and fund, which has distributed significant amounts of money to health workers in the Kingdom. These kinds of partnerships allow you to build a framework that makes us much more resilient as a society. I don't think anyone as a company or individual will be returning to the status quo. Things are about to change forever. The way of working, the way of meeting customers or working on a daily basis has already changed and I believe will not go back to the way it was before. 90% of our office is working from home now as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. We had already built fully resilient remote working facilities before the pandemic, and we are now able to share this expertise with others.</p><h4>What should businesses be looking for in a partner to implement these new technologies and innovations?</h4><p>You need a partner who understands your business. If someone approaches you with a solution and tells you what you need during your first meeting, it is hardly a partnership that will help the company. It is about tailoring what should be done because there are so many factors to consider besides resilience. There's data integrity and storage, analyzing where data is currently being stored and where it may need to be stored in the future. You need a partner that can go through all of this with you. If in the end the decision is that you go with an international partner, you'll find advantages and disadvantages. Building a relationship with a trusted partner rather than shopping around for the cheapest provider is the way forward. The same goes for cloud services and digital services. If you are not in a digital environment, there is no way that anyone is able to do everything, even if you are Huawei, Nokia, or Amazon. You need someone who knows the end-to-end picture and can help you enter a relationship with multiple partners and go through the journey with you. When you do a cloud expansion, you go to different providers and look for the best price; there are individual purchasing decisions and strategic frame agreements. Moving forward, people will take more of a partnership approach.</p><h4>Why do you believe we need to be optimistic in present circumstances?</h4><p>First, this is a crisis that will ultimately pass. We have all the technology and will to overcome this crisis. That is one of the key criteria. As leaders, it is absolutely mandatory to send a positive message, and to live by it. It is critical for any company to come out of a difficult situation. There will be many opportunities for companies who are doing their homework now and taking all the steps to preserve their business and build strong partnerships. You need to know who you can rely on and how you can rely on them. I believe we will overcome all the challenges that come toward us. It will be a different world, but we will make it together, definitely. As we focused during the quarantine and beyond to maintain all of our obligations towards our partners, as their survival means ours as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the reason behind the acquisition of the Qatarat Desalination Company, and how does it represent your strategic priorities in Saudi right now?</h4><p>Our business model is focused on acquiring assets or operating the concessions that have been offered in the Saudi market since 2018. The only way to grow for us at this time is through M&amp;As. The acquisition of this asset, the desalination plant at Jeddah Airport, is in our growth strategy. It allows us to avoid the time-consuming process of bidding for tenders while still gaining scale. It is a different business model than some competitors, which shows our interest in and commitment to Saudi Arabia and that we are well financed, because this is a foreign investment. We did not only acquire Qatarat, but also the other company that operates it. We are using this platform to grow the business and we are trying to be selective to avoid entering into the tricky market of tenders. This was our first acquisition in the Kingdom, but we have been working on that model for some time.</p><h4>In the past, did you work with concessions or primarily by contract?</h4><p>The work we did on Riyadh's water system in the past was all contract work. It was leak detection and other key services. We have participated in six concessions, and we have been the leader in three of them. However, Saudi Arabia is extremely competitive, and we are not taking that many risks. There is a bottom line, and with the level of prices on the table so far, we cannot bid on many contracts and maintain our standard of quality. We are conservative and prefer not to enter the business unless there is a good profit and a solid risk assessment. This was not the case with recent tenders.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the management of the impacts of the pandemic internally and with your operations?</h4><p>It has been challenging. We have seen limited cases, with around three or four cases over the whole year. We introduced extremely strict measures, and all our contract services have been working without any stoppage. We have been delivering everything on time. The headquarters issued extremely strict guidelines based on global safety regulations. We also adapted to our local market, and it worked without imposing any additional costs. Many people are saying COVID-19 affected their costs. We took some basic measures to buy masks and all those things, but in the end we want to avoid losing people or duplicating positions. It is a case of organizing yourself much better than before, and we have done this so far.</p><h4>Has the pandemic affected the demand for water or any other metrics related to your business?</h4><p>No. Other than the operational aspects things have remained relatively the same. Some areas in industrial production went down, but in Saudi Arabia the real lockdown was roughly one month. Apart from that, it has been managed much better than Europe.</p><h4>How has your use of technology in the water sector come into play in recent months with your concession and acquisition?</h4><p>You cannot replace the manpower in the water sector with technology. You can improve deficiencies through some digitalization, but in the end you need operators and people to solve things. You can get more information through computers to make decisions, but normally in the water sector there are no computers making decisions. Based on that, we are trying to apply the latest and most efficient technologies in the market to reduce costs and improve performance for more challenging water areas, sewage, or potable water. Unlike other sectors, there is no fully digital system in the water sector; it does not exist and will not.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>PSAA is essential within the Kingdom's flight and aviation ecosystem and is in a sector that has been particularly impacted by the pandemic. How has PSAA managed the crisis both internally and externally?</h4><p>The aviation industry has been the most heavily affected in terms of dealing with the pandemic. However, it was mostly passenger flights were affected; cargo flights are actually moving much more than they ever were before. Safety in the pandemic has been our main concern because if we did not have the proper safety procedures at the academy, we could shut down the entire aviation industry, since we train almost everyone in the sector. We had to be stringent in all of our safety efforts. Whether it is sanitizing our simulators or looking at practical areas for safety training, in all our procedures we take into consideration the Ministry of Health guidance and that of our sister companies. Like the rest of the industry, we moved forward with online education. The positive thing for PSAA is that we were pursuing this prior to COVID-19. We were ahead of the curve and did not require any major adjustments in our training provision methodology when the pandemic hit. Training is one of the things that is more cost-effective and easier to do online for airlines rather than scheduling and sending staff to training centers during their layovers. For certain classes where we felt there should be interactions between the instructors and participants, we had virtual online classes with limited class sizes to facilitate interaction. For certain courses such as CPR and opening aircraft doors and slides, we put enough stringent procedures in place to ensure safety when people needed to physically attend.</p><h4>Did PSAA have all the technological pieces it is using today in place before the pandemic or did the pandemic accelerate your adoption of technology?</h4><p>When we speak about technology, we see the significant gains that constantly occur. We are constantly in the process of evaluating new companies coming in with innovations for the training community. During the pandemic, we were also going through a major integration at PSAA. Saudia has 11 different strategic business units (SBUs), and because of that, everyone had their own training entities. All those training entities are being integrated into one, and PSAA is working through those projects now. So far, we have integrated all the inflight service training, where previously PSAA only had the safety portion. We also have ground operations training, aviation marketing, and general marketing for sales and ticketing. We are currently working with Saudia Aerospace Engineering Industries (SAEI) on integrating all the maintenance training and all the other general education items we teach, from finance to English-language courses. We have been extremely busy during the pandemic. We have to incorporate all these other entities into the technology support we already had in place but could not do this with our current platform. We are also using another platform that was used by airlines, and we are shifting to a new platform in the future. This was one of Saudi Arabian Airlines' long-term strategic plans to make it more economically feasible, and the pandemic merely expedited the restructuring and reorganization process.</p><h4>Did PSAA grow significantly in 2020 due to the restructuring of the SBUs' training delivery?</h4><p>Yes, in 2021 it will make a major difference. PSAA is the oldest training academy in the Kingdom and the Middle East; we have been here for 61 years. Right now, we are bringing all these entities under one umbrella. All training will now be given under one roof by one training entity to all the players in Saudi Arabia. It is not about Saudia; it is about supporting the government and its 2030 Vision to support the growth in the aviation industry for all aviation entities. Previously in some areas of training, PSAA's doors were closed; we did not train other personnel except our employers employees. With this new vision, all of Saudia Group's training is under one roof, plus we are opening our doors to the rest of the market. This is really a gamechanger in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Will PSAA offer training programs to the rest of the region or private entities as well?</h4><p>As an academy, we have been providing training to all other private entities in Saudi Arabia and outside for years. We deal with many customers locally and internationally. However, the training areas that have been transferred to us now by Saudi Arabian Airlines' SBUs will be open to everyone. This includes competitors of Saudia, newly established airlines, and the small aviation players that were previously going overseas for training. This is part of the government's initiative as ultimately Saudia is owned by the government of Saudi Arabia, and we want to provide these services to everyone in the industry.</p><h4>What are your expectations at PSAA for the remainder of 2021, and what do you hope to achieve by year end?</h4><p>During these times, it is difficult for anyone to say exactly where we will be. I am hoping for the best, but we have to plan taking into consideration all the different possibilities that could occur. We have a great deal of work ahead of us with the integration and providing training. Our main goal at PSAA is to build that base to support the aviation industry once it recovers. The methodologies will change based on how COVID-19 affects us. We will have to cope with the changes and fluctuations in the pandemic on a case by case basis, as we did in the previous year. However, during this difficult transition, we all seek and hope for stability in the aviation industry and for the world in general. In the meantime, we will build on what we have now to support our government's vision, and based on the demand we are seeing in Saudi Arabia, we expect it to emerge strongly in the coming years. We are truly optimistic that once this pandemic slows down, we will see a real jump in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East for aviation travel. PSAA wants to ensure we are there to support it. It is a time for reflection, restructuring, and reenergizing the training industry to make sure we have the full capabilities ready to advance the industry in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was your organization's response to COVID-19, and what have been the lessons learned?</h4><p>The pandemic took everyone by surprise. We had a good response and immediately took action, testing all our workers in batches. Since then, they have all now been tested several times. We put in the necessary precautions such as masks, gloves, and sanitizer everywhere. We had teams going to our labor camps on a daily basis to sanitize and organized the work in such a way that we reduced the number of people working in the same area, applying social distancing in our factories and sites, and having people work from home unless they were essential onsite. We minimized the impact as much as possible while continuing to work, as in the UAE construction was considered a vital activity. I am pleased to say that today we are almost working as per normal. Although we have suffered economically due to the downturn, we have not suffered as a result of COVID-19 itself.</p><h4>How would you describe the government's response, and how did it affect your organization?</h4><p>There were two types of government interventions, one of which was reducing mobility between the Emirates and labor camps and curfews preventing us from working at night. However, these measures were critical in minimizing the effect of COVID-19. The other side was economic packages and asking banks to be more lenient, though this did not go as far as we would have liked. For example, we have had disputes with banks to get deferment on loans, and they are still charging high interest rates. Many also refuse to provide loans. The central bank gave banks funds but did not control how it was spent and left the banks to deal with it themselves. We have suffered economically from COVID-19 in many ways. First, we lost many contracts and had an order book of AED350 million that was reduced to 220 million. Most of these contracts that were put on hold or canceled were mostly in the residential and oil and gas sectors. Those that we still have are mostly construction projects for schools and so on. We were also expecting to sign contracts with Etihad Rail, which has been deferred, and ADNOC, which has been postponed for six months. We have also not been paid for jobs that we are doing, including government contracts. We also suffered in terms of mobility, as we have many people in Dubai and a shortage in Abu Dhabi. We are at the forefront of those companies that are entitled to the package the government implemented but we did not get as much as we were expecting.</p><h4>What measures did you take internally to mitigate some of these challenges?</h4><p>We had to make redundancies and put people on unpaid leave. Instead of paying salaries every month, we are now only able to do so every two months because of cash flow. We were paying suppliers within 60 days but have now deferred to between 90 and 100 days because we do not have the cash.</p><h4>Have you implemented any innovative technologies or sustainable building methods to potentially get more business?</h4><p>For those projects that we are negotiating for, we have thought outside the box and have been more efficient, as everyone wants to produce more and be more efficient with better planning and better use of raw materials since the margins are lower. We need to make do with what we have. We have improved in many areas and will continue to do so. We are implementing a system of continuous improvements to reduce costs and make the company more cost effective.</p><h4>How does the current situation put more importance on individual accountability, and how did this affect your organization?</h4><p>With reduced costs and revenues, we were seriously considering reducing everyone's salaries, but we instead decided to pay employees 80% of their salaries, with the remaining 20% linked to performance with KPIs. If our employees can prove themselves and demonstrate that they can help the company survive, they will earn possibly more than what was expected. We are still working on this and hope it will be effective. We seek to find the best solutions for our people and do all we can to retain them.</p><h4>What are your expectations and strategic priorities for the next six to 12 months?</h4><p>We have three very important priorities, one of which is to continue to have new projects. We have not reduced our sales team but in fact grown it, as there are now less projects, and competition is fierce. Our factories are like hungry wolves that need to be fed all the time. The second is reducing costs through better planning, innovation, thinking outside the box, and being more efficient. Number three is keeping our core business of concrete, GRC, and construction so we are trying to convince people that we are experts and they should come to us and not someone else. We have faith in the UAE, and when this pandemic is over, I am sure things will start again, and we will be there to help it rebuild. The only thing now is surviving the next six months, which will be difficult due to cashflow. If we do not overspend, things will improve, and we will survive just as we did in previous crises.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2021 marks CESCE's 50th anniversary. How has CESCE evolved in the last two years?</h4><p>In June 2021, CESCE will turn 50. We would like to celebrate our 50th anniversary in style, but due to COVID-19, we will be forced to celebrate virtually (but in style, as well). The last two years have gone very well. We have earned the trust of more customers, and we currently have around 11,200 on our books. We have also increased our market share in private insurance by two percentage points. This is the 12th year we have succeeded in obtaining benefits. The level of customer satisfaction is high. In addition, we have launched new insurance products. In our activities as the Export Credit Agency (ECA) of Spain, we have continued to structure complex operations in emerging markets, which is our specialty. COVID-19 has completely changed the rules of the game. We had to transform overnight a traditional company, such as those of the insurance industry, into a digital company with 100% teleworking. We did extremely well, because we bilt this transformation on two pillars: 1) We already had 15% of the staff teleworking part-time, so we had some experience in this field; and 2) we already had a Business Contingency Plan (BCP) to overcome any major contingency that may affect our activity, as dictated by our authorities. We ran a simulation on how to operate in a COVID environment and we resolved the major issues that we found. When the first legislation on urgent economic measures was passed, only three days after the declaration of the state of alarm, CESCE contributed with a EUR 2billion COVID line, divided in two tranches, which is the largest operation that we have ever carried out. We have designed and executed this line under very difficult conditions. To acknowledge our response, our staff has received, together with ICO and COFIDES, an award from the Exporters and Investors Club. And this makes me very proud. We have taken care of our staff during this crisis, and they have been incredibly dedicated to the company and our clients. Our achievements are their achievements.</p><h4>What is the analysis of the CESCE COVID-19 line, and what are its results, and what was the agreement between CESCE and the Official Credit Institute (ICO)?</h4><p>The CESCE COVID-19 line was complementary to the ICO line. The ICO COVID-19 line is much larger, by far, with EUR100 billion. Both are targeted to providing liquidity to businesses. However, ICO´s line is broader and ours was focused on exporting companies. With the first line, which was closed in September, we provided EUR1.3 billion in working capital financing. In November, we launched the second line, with which, as of today, we have granted around EUR500 million. But our measures go beyond this line. We are also insuring on behalf of the State short-term export finance operations in developed markets, to make up for possible failures in the private market. We implemented a comprehensive flexibility package to be able to restructure operations that were facing problems due to COVID. We also launched an IT platform so that documentary credits and the COVID-19 line could be contracted entirely online. We launched a revolving line of guarantees for small companies and non-listed companies. These are only examples. A whole battery of measures was introduced. The most important is one that nobody talks about. We did not reduce our risk exposure. We are the ECA, and when others step back, it is our duty to step forward.</p><h4>How is CESCE's plan to expand in different markets developing?</h4><p>We have postponed our four-phase plan. The first phase, almost completed, was to strengthen our capacity to control and direct our subsidiaries from Madrid; the second was to exit those subsidiaries where we face serious difficulties, as we did in France and Argentina, and we our about to do in Venezuela; the third and current phase consists of consolidating our presence in those countries where we are already present; and finally, the fourth phase is to expand our business into new places, both physically and digitally. This is crucial, as the new 2021-2024 strategic plan we have approved focuses on digitalization. COVID has dramatically accelerated the digital transformation of the business environment and we desire to be in the forefront of our industry.</p><h4>CESCE has accelerated its digital transformation by making the leap to IBM's hybrid cloud. What is CESCE's intention in terms of digitalization?</h4><p>We need credit insurance to become more digital. It is on the way, though it will not be fully digital anytime soon. We have already digitalized the process; now we need to digitalize both marketing and products. Credit insurance relies on updated data. With INFORMA, we have a first-class data supplier that will assure us a lead in this field. But we need to go beyond this. Our customers must be offered the entire menu of products, and they have to be able to compare, chose and contract them by simply clicking on their screens.</p><h4>What are CESCE's main objectives for 2021? </h4><p>Our main objective is to continue to provide the best service to our clients, something that sets us apart and is what our customers value the most. We want to offer our clients a customized solution for their needs and a fast, high quality service that is increasingly more digital and comprehensive. And we are also a socially responsible company. The company's entire energy is renewable, 0.7% of our profits finance our corporate social responsibility, for which we have received several awards. We are here to make a difference, not only in business, but in the lives of many people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the past 10 months of the pandemic affected NAI/JIPCO? </h4><p>2020 was a rollercoaster ride for us. After a strong start, we were affected by the lockdown. This situation changed everything, as we were not able to work in our service operations and factory. Like others, we were obliged to work from home. Daily, we virtually discussed the best ways to deal with the situation among the Management Team. We optimized our cost position in various areas. Saudi Arabia's tripling of VAT to 15% from July 1, 2020 also impacted on our sales last year. The new tax boosted our results directly before VAT increased, as everyone rushed to purchase necessary equipment before the deadline. This caused a slow-down in 3Q2020, followed by strong demand in the last quarter of 2020. Taking the overall circumstances into consideration, 2020 was a successful year for NAI and JIPCO.</p><h4>Did JIPCO benefit from the government stimulus to ameliorate the effects of the shutdown?</h4><p>We applied for government support, which has helped us greatly. The Government of Saudi Arabia introduced the right measures to cope with the effects of the pandemic. Today, we are operating even better than normal. We have had a strong start to 2021. I treat this as a positive economic sign, based on my experience in the global commercial vehicle and truck business over the last 20 years. Whenever there is demand for trucks and commercial vehicles, it is a reliable indicator of a strong economy and vice versa. Currently, we have high demand for trucks. Accordingly, we have a strong order book. We are benefiting from the realization of Saudi Arabia's mega-projects, as this is creating increased demand in the construction segment. We are facing high demand overall in the logistics sector. As a result we decided to extend working shifts on our assembly lines.</p><h4>Have you seen a significant change in JIPCO's customers and their demands and use of your products?</h4><p>We are witnessing a level of increased professionalization. Purchase criteria are changing. As a consequence of last year's lockdown, JIPCO decided to set up an e-commerce channel for spare parts. This is one of the ideas that emerged out of the pandemic, and we will launch this platform in 2021. Initially, this will target our customers who typically run their own workshops and require spare parts for their trucks and commercial vehicles. We want to test the waters and find out whether these customers are open to ordering online. Placing an order is a matter of selecting the right parts, as well as availability and delivery terms. Currently, the majority of the parts business is conducted by sales agents, who visit customers or authorized resellers. In addition to COVID-19, the generational change is also changing the way people want to do business. Even if decisions lie with the founder of a family business, the children often have different ideas about how to do business and what the priorities should be. This is a change we see in our industry.</p><h4>Are spare parts a significant part of JIPCO's annual revenues?</h4><p>Spare parts are an important part of JIPCO's revenue. However, spare parts do not contribute significantly to our profits. Mercedes-Benz Trucks are decades in the market leading role. Accordingly, Mercedes-Benz Trucks is the highest among all brands in the Kingdom. These trucks are causing a constant demand for spare parts. Due to the fact that this market is huge, you can find Mercedes-Benz Truck parts in every corner. This is good for the customer but challenging for the distributor. We are facing a tough competition with several suppliers offering Spare Parts for Mercedes-Benz Trucks. Unfortunately, from our perspective, not every customer requires genuine Mercedes-Benz parts. Other OEMs, distributing parts, take their share. This makes it a competitive environment. It is tough, to generate profits out of spare parts sales in the Kingdom. The customer is benefiting from this competitive situation. The attractive spare parts pricing and availability is one of the arguments to decide for Mercedes-Benz Trucks.</p><h4>What are your expectations at JIPCO for the next year, including your e-commerce ambitions?</h4><p>In terms of overall business development, I am extremely positive for 2021. There is a certain dynamic in the market; there is demand. Therefore, I am extremely optimistic about this year, as well as for the medium and long term for the Kingdom. I believe that everything described in Vision 2030, with all the ideas contained in the mega-projects and the initiatives being realized, for example related to Riyadh City, will all have a positive impact on the country. Whether it is tourism, localization, or other economic activity, we will clearly benefit from this. JIPCO's new e-commerce business will be launched in 3Q2021. The challenge is that the parts business is not that simple. Parts need to fit in individual truck types and models from specific years. If you want to avoid customers having to return parts because they are not compatible, you need an intelligent selection and description process. This makes it more challenging to implement an e-commerce channel for such a complex product. Because of our positive medium to long term view for the Kingdom, JIPCO made the decision to build a new factory in KSA. Our current production facility in Jeddah has been established in the 1970s, so it is nearly 50 years old. We decided that rather than renovating the old factory, it is better to invest in a completely new one. This will give us the opportunity to not only produce and assemble Mercedes-Benz trucks locally but also do the same for another products from Daimler Trucks, which also owns the Mitsubishi Trucks brand. These are light- and medium-duty commercial vehicles, used for example, as refrigerated grocery delivery vehicles. We will also assemble these units locally. In line with Vision 2030 and the requirement to localize more, it is an advantage for us in the long term to offer trucks assembled and localized in the Kingdom. The Juffali Group will create a kind of Industrial Park, which will contain the assembly of Mercedes-Benz and Mitsubishi Fuso trucks. We also have the Arabian Metal Industry, which is also a Juffali company, and this produces all sorts of vehicle bodies used on trucks. We will be able to show certain competencies by being present in one place with three companies. JIPCO's headquarters is currently in Jeddah, but Riyadh is the place for us to be. We will build our new headquarters there in two years' time. This reflects our overall message that even though everyone has thought about cost savings and what can be done to survive and keep their companies profitable, JIPCO believes it is a great time to invest and be ahead of the wave in Saudi Arabia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the pandemic shifted the core priorities of development finance and how has ICD adapted to this new situation?</h4><p>I think what we are going to emerge from this era with a stronger focus on our business, this means reaching out and understanding SMEs which are the best fit for our resilience targets, and ensuring SDG compatibility. Islamic Development Bank Group (IsDBG) has set a USD2.3 billion of funding target focusing solely on COVID related transactions, of which we as ICD have earmarked a total of USD250 million. This includes our line of finance that are currently being provided as funding for financial institutions for on-lending to SMEs, which have been affected greatly by the pandemic. We believe in partnering with local financial institutions because they are on the ground in the countries that we operate in. In this regard, they do a much better analysis and are more well-versed and equipped in understanding their local markets. These local financial institutions ensure that lending is monitored correctly, undertake collections and facilitate redistribution to other SMEs that can benefit the most from our funding.</p><h4>How has the attitude towards Islamic Finance changed during the crisis?</h4><p>Shariah-compliant or Islamic banking has witnessed significant growth over the years and will continue edging toward the mainstream moving forward. There is a growing demand and a pressing need for Shariah-compliant financial solutions in our member countries. Globally, interest toward ethical and impactful investments focused on serving the needs of inclusive and sustainable economic development has also increased, specifically in 2021—in essence, this is the crux of Islamic finance. Increasingly global financial institutions, such as JPMorgan, Citibank, and others, are now also focusing more on SDG- related transactions. Nowadays Green Sukuk are also becoming an attractive source of funding, as the willingness of many investment funds to invest in these instruments confirms that environmentally friendly transactions are gaining popularity. By doing so, they reduce the cost of funding that they are willing to accept, which makes a great difference. Also emerging now is the understanding of how Shariah-compliant trusts work. For example, the city of Riyadh has more than USD100 billion worth of trusts, and this can provide additional support and funding as needed. The other thing is the Zakat, which is the Shariah-compliant taxation is also now becoming more and more active. It will be interesting to see how it could become more of a support during a pandemic as the one we are in the midst of currently in certain member countries.</p><h4>When you make loans to financial institutions in member countries are those loans to SMEs labeled Shariah compliant financial products?</h4><p>Yes, our partner financial institutions mainly focus on Shariah-compliant funding. They announce to the client that they are providing the financing as a Shariah compliant structure because that is what clients are demanding in our member countries.</p><h4>Where does the Sukuk fit in your overall financing strategy and how have you planned to use those funds?</h4><p>The Sukuk which that we have issued recently is the largest in ICD's history. It was successful despite being in the midst of the pandemic, and the demand was high. The book was oversubscribed three times, including orders from joint lead managers. It attracted participation by 37 international and regional investors, and this is a testament to the strength of our business. Investors are confident regarding ICD's credit story and our initiatives in promoting private sector activities, as well as our new strategy which we have been working on diligently over the past three years. Additionally,, the capital raising will support ICD's development activities including advisory projects which create competition, entrepreneurship, employment opportunities and export potential among our 55-member countries; while, encouraging the development of Islamic finance activities such as debt, equity and capital markets. In the future, we look forward to engaging in blended finance transactions, given its potential in supporting the global development agenda. For example, let's say we target USD100 million in funding, and meanwhile a project in a member country required one billion. We would be part of a syndicate and provide one billion to those transactions by issuing a Sukuk. Our USD100 million becomes one of the subscribers and this ensures that the transaction is known globally, and that there is continuity in the relationship, in turn making sure also that we have a bigger impact with our USD100 million. That is what we would like to focus on more in the future, and with that approach we will be increasing our fee income as an institution, and we as ICD also then become much more sustainable.</p><h4>What are your thoughts as an organization on the rating changes from Fitch, which issued a downgrade recently? </h4><p>We, as an organization, throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic have been active in providing the right funding. We wanted to make sure that we restructure the credit rating of our clientele base and ensure that we enhance our overall rating. I believe Fitch is comfortable with that approach, and if we can show them a strong outcome next year then they might consider raising our rating. The good thing is that Moody's and S&amp;P have maintained our rating, and that we have been able to ensure that the global view of our organization is stable. On the other side, I personally believe we are in a high-risk business, we are supposed to do our job and we are supposed to go out and provide funding for SMEs and really support the market the way it should be. So, I am not that concerned that we will see a major slide in the rating, although we are not complacent. It is worth taking care of the markets that we are supposed to take care of, but we also plan to continue supporting higher risk SMEs. It is a challenge not just for us, but for the countries that we are active in and for countries all around the world.</p><h4>Is there a fundamental shift in strategy for managing risk in the future?</h4><p>Non-performing loans are an important consideration for us and we have enhanced our relationship with institutions that we are dealing with, and who now have a better rating themselves. We remain keen to support SMEs as it is an important part of our mandate and therefore will not shy away from that strategy. It is important for us to look at transactions that are found throughout our member countries, and which are PPP. We also make sure to consider certain beneficial equity transactions. This ensures we are investing our money where we believe it will be a best fit for some of the member countries we operate in. We are more careful now than before by not engaging in greenfield transactions, instead focusing more on brownfield initiatives. This means private equity, where the proposition is proven and sustainable. When we come in, we can quantum leap them to the next level, thereby adding substantial value.</p><h4>What projects are you looking for and what do you hope to accomplish in the coming year?</h4><p>We have revisited our business plan and made sure it is aligned with the potential outcomes of the Covid-19 Pandemic, both in terms of the positives and negatives. People think Covid-19 has only been negative but the positive side is also there in cost savings on travel, while we have also become much more efficient, with much more targeted funding and a sharper evaluation of potential transactions to meet actual needs. Our effectiveness, then, is set to increase and reach more of our targets. The pandemic has also advanced ICD's digitalization aspirations, whereby we have meaningfully transformed the way we do business. The post pandemic way of life will involve the continued support of SMEs and we want to make sure that we help those countries which are in greatest need.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>EDPR opened its first plant in Spain in 1997. How would you describe the evolution of EDPR in the country, and what have been its main achievements?</h4><p>EDPR is a global leader in the renewable energy sector and the world's third-largest wind energy producer. It is noteworthy that we are present in 15 countries with an installed capacity of more than 12GW, but our headquarters are in Spain. Our company is mainly focused on the development of renewable energy, and it aims to provide value both to its shareholders and to society. Nowadays the company is focused on wind onshore and off-shore, solar PV and hydrogen. In terms of business, we are very pleased with what we have achieved this year and the execution of our business plan has progressed satisfactorily.</p><h4>How has the pandemic affected EDPR?</h4><p>Throughout the Covid-19 crisis, EDPR has demonstrated that it has a solid business model based on sustainability principles and a strategic agenda that positions the company well to take advantage of the potential economic momentum towards green energy.   It is clear that 2020 was a difficult year but our company reacted extremely well and our full-year results, with the highest net profit ever, proves this. On March 10, we decided all staff would be working remotely to reduce risks, and all the necessary security measures were taken. We could not stop working because we produce energy, so within about a month all protocols were established to ensure we could work in secure conditions. It was important to continue to follow the growth plan we had set out, and this was achieved in the end. Moreover, 2020 was an extremely intense year in terms of regulations so we tried to adapt, stay up to date, and follow the requirements. In fact, we were capable of building new generation. We started up the wind farm of Quintanilla II during COVID-19. We also managed to sustain the business plan that was scheduled to start at the end of March and ended in October. All our employees carried out excellent work under the new rules and we fulfilled our business plan as well as our budget for the year.</p><h4>At the end of November 2020, EDPR began commissioning the Quintanilla II wind farm, with 10MW of power and the largest wind turbines in Spain. What does this project mean for EDPR?</h4><p>The Quintanilla II wind farm in Burgos was not planned for 2020, but it has been the challenge of the year. In early 2020, we decided to make an effort to determine if we could start it up. The farm has three G137 wind turbines and each has 3.3MW of individual power. One of the major challenges was the transport of components. The assembly of machines was done during summer, in September we carried out the function testing, and in October we received the start-up documentation. It has been generating electricity since the end of the year for more than 10,000 families. It does not consume water, and we avoid CO2 emission. The objectives we set ourselves as a company have been more than fulfilled.</p><h4>How has the hybrid system that sought synergies between an onshore wind farms and a solar energy installation evolved? What is the expected percentage of wind power?</h4><p>From EDPR we always have to go slightly further in terms of innovation. We put together a pilot to try out the combination of wind and solar energy. It is worth noting that renewable energy is not constant throughout the day; we depend on the wind and the sun. We saw that wind and photovoltaic power complemented each other very well, and we decided to implement the project in Andalusia, at the Janda III facilities. The administration supported us in our endeavor, and we saw that it performed well. From that point on, we began to work hard with the administrations so that it could be put in place. Moreover, new legislation was obtained to regulate hybrid projects in Spain, and this can be seen in the possible law on Climate Change and Energy Transition. The ministry decided to support it through a Royal Decree on access and connection that was published at the end of the year and gave us the final push to do so. In the last auction of Spain, in which we participated and were the successful bidders of 143MW, four of the projects that won will be hybrid. It is an opportunity in terms of optimization in the use of the network and the reduction of the environmental impact. It is a tool that can ensure that the government's PNIEC objectives are achieved more quickly and efficiently. We hope to have them operating by 2023.</p><h4>One of the main problems that the private sector faces is the slowness and complexity in obtaining permits, as well as the cost of the same. What is your vision regarding the ease of processes and permits?</h4><p>In Spain, we have to comply regulations at a national, local and autonomous community level. Our projects are located in rural towns, which we see as key regarding the issue of “emptied Spain.“ There must also be network access in order to obtain the access and connection permits, the development of evacuation works, and network connection. Administrations often do not have enough resources to deal with many requests. In this sense, there are investments pending to be reviewed, and they will be approved, but for various reasons it has not happened yet. This is a burden that could be minimized.</p><h4>What are the main objectives of EDPR for 2021?</h4><p>The main objective of EDPR is to grow in terms of wind onshore and offshore, photovoltaic and hydrogen. We secured long-term purchase contracts and more than 400MW in Spain. We were awarded with 143MW in the auction that allows us to consolidate our growth plan. We have covered and secured our business plan and want to continue growing. Our other objectives include meeting the project delivery plan and continuing to be leaders in renewable energy, always with the assistance of innovation and our employees.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Lantania evolved since our last conversation in 2019? </h4><p>2020 was a difficult year due to the pandemic, which has seriously impacted the construction sector. We should keep in mind that this sector has been in crisis since 2008, with an accompanying drastic fall in public procurement. This hit bottom in 2012 with an 80% market contraction. It seemed that things were beginning to pick up in 2019, given growth at the time, but in March 2020 the pandemic hit and affected us both in terms of demand and profitability. In terms of demand, if we consider the public bidding figures, there has been a drop of over 30%, and if we look at the figures that were already dented across various segments such as the central administration there are drops close to 60%. This is public data from the National Construction Confederation or the Labor Foundation. The impact on the private sector is even more drastic. In a study by the real estate consultancy firm JLL, they concluded that there has been a drop of 86% compared to 2019. In addition, the construction sector is much more volatile than other sectors. In terms of profitability, I would highlight four areas. Firstly, there are the measures we have had to adopt for the health of our employees, such as schedule changes, on-site restrictions and teleworking. Secondly, there is the shortage of materials at the beginning of the pandemic. Thirdly, there are logistical issues, since many construction sites are not in the center of the cities, and even if they are, there is a displaced construction team, therefore, the closure of hotels and the limitations in mobility within the vehicles seriously affects productivity and profitability along with the paralysis of non-essential activities due to local lockdowns. This has had a negative impact on productivity and, therefore, on development. Despite this situation, at Lantania we have met all objectives set in 2019 both numerically and strategically and, for this reason, we should be extremely satisfied. We will close 2020 on growth of close to 20%, despite the pandemic. Although that was the forecast, until March 2020 we were way above this target, but in the end, our revenue has grown. near to 20%.</p><h4>In 2019 we discussed the breakdown of your revenues among energy, infrastructures and water. What is the current breakdown?</h4><p>We are going to close 2020 with 60% of our revenue coming from infrastructure, 10% from conservation and services, 20% from energy and 10% from water. We have grown due to the company's own growth and as a result of two acquisitions in this sector, namely the purchase of Soil Tratamiento de Aguas Industriales and of Deisa Industrial Water Solutions, which was part of the COMSA group, dedicated to industrial water activities. This has placed us in a leading position in this sector.</p><h4>Three of the four founders of Lantania come from the telecommunications sector. With the pandemic we have seen the need for companies to start digitizing. Would you consider this a competitive advantage?</h4><p>Without a doubt. When the pandemic hit, we were in a good situation in terms of liquidity and already had the necessary technology in place. This meant that we were able to start working remotely without affecting the activity and all the information is in the cloud. When the company was created, we immediately implemented these changes, and because we are relatively small, it was easier and faster. From the beginning, we implemented a digital document exchange tool with all our contractors and providers. We use a digital platform to verify the accuracy of all contracts and invoicing, thus eliminating inconsistencies.</p><h4>Past year you acquired the Soil Group's water line, which also includes the businesses in Colombia and Morocco. What are your intentions in these markets?</h4><p>Part of 2019 was dedicated to establish our internationalization strategy. We defined our target markets in three phases. The first was EU-based and involved selecting a series of markets. These included Sweden, where we are prequalified and applying for work, the Baltic corridor with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and several Balkan countries, including Bulgaria, Croatia, and Serbia, where we have a series of projects underway. In Bulgaria, we have two projects, one of which has already been signed off and is being carried out in conjunction with a local partner, and in the second case we are also in the process of signing the contract with another local partner. The second phase is Latin America, where we are entering the Colombian, Peruvian, and Chilean markets. The third phase involves the mature markets, the US and Canada, where we have already incorporated a branch.</p><h4>Lantania today has four wind farms in Galicia, which will add up to an investment of Euro 146 million. What are the main characteristics of this project?</h4><p>We have experience in the construction of solar and wind farms, and as Lantania in 2019 we  have built 126MW of solar farms, and in 2020, 130MW. We are being pretty active in this front, with new awards like the solar photovoltaic installation in the City of Justice in Valencia. Regarding our role as developers, we have initially focused on the wind sector because there are higher entry barriers than in solar, and in Galicia because our transmission and distribution team is located there and our staff know the local distribution grid very well, as well as the orography. In addition, the administrative process of the Xunta de Galicia gives us many guarantees because it requires the submission of a detailed project and the demonstration of ample working knowledge in order for plans to be approved. There, we have a portfolio of 250MW, with 150 MW being in the pipeline, and we are performing all the required engineering and studies in order to get the projects ready for construction. We are also analyzing the possibility of developing solar projects because the regulation is changing to avoid speculation and there are now obligations both for the public administration and the developer that make us feel more comfortable with the process.</p><h4>The Ministry for Ecological Transition awarded Lantania the expansion and improvement of the Wastewater Treatment Plant of Almansa, in Albacete. What does this project mean the company?</h4><p>We have a very highly qualified and competitive technical team specialized in water treatment plants. This project means that we have two axes of growth in the water sector. Firstly, in the industrial sector, where we have become the third largest company in the domestic market in terms of industrial water projects, and secondly, in the public sector, where we have one of the most important hydraulic projects in Spain (the Almudevar dam, in Huesca), in addition to other developments, like the WWTP of Nerja and this new award.</p><h4>What are your objectives for 2021?</h4><p>Our goal in to keep our path of development and consolidation, combining our natural organic growth with other potential M&amp;A transactions and investments, especially in the water, energy and rail markets. If I had to highlight a specific project, I would mention that we are currently working with our partner Gestilar in the largest “build-to-rent“ deal in Spain, with the development and construction of more than 1,100 homes in southern Madrid.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ICU Medical, founded in 1984, has become a benchmark in the development, manufacture, and sale of medical devices used in vascular therapy, oncology, and intensive care applications. How has ICU Medical evolved since its founding, and what are company's mission and vision?</h4><p>ICU Medical was founded in San Clemente, California, in 1984. In 1979, I joined an American multinational with several divisions where I developed myself professionally until 2002, when ICU Medical contacted us to distribute its products in Spain. At that time, I was manager of the medical devices business unit, and I put my faith in ICU Medical because it had highly innovative products. In the end, we became the exclusive distributors of ICU Medical in Spain. In 2004, we separated from it and set up a fully independent company in Spain called Hospina. The company, which was dedicated to medical devices, started to grow exponentially to the point that, in 2016, we caught the eye of Pfizer for the biosimilars and biogenerics business, which eventually acquired us. I joined Pfizer as a member of the steering committee, but Pfizer focused primarily on Pharma  and Medical Devices business unit was acquired by ICU Medical in 2017. <br> We are a small company, with 32 people in Spain.</p><h4>What is the general breakdown of products and solutions you offer?</h4><p>In our business, one-third are infusion pumps, which is an Abbott product that ICU Medical acquired. 70% of the device comes directly from ICU Medical. They are closed systems for the administration of hazardous drugs, not only for patients, but for health personnel, pregnant women, and so on who need special protection. ICU Medical was one of the pioneers in both the manufacturing and selling of intravenous administration closed systems, which are gravity systems.</p><h4>ICU Medical was named one of the 100 Most Trusted Companies in America by Forbes Magazine. What differentiates ICU from other companies in the industry?</h4><p>Safety, though above all our commitment to intravenous therapy from the point of view of innovation and manufacturing. In addition, what we have brought to the table is marketing. ICU Medical's board of directors consists of nurses, doctors, and so on; they are people who work with the product. However, if I had to pinpoint what makes ICU Medical different from other multinationals, it would be its innovation, product quality, and commitment to the people who work at ICU Medical in the field of intravenous therapy.</p><h4>How has ICU Medical faced the pandemic, and what strategy has it followed?</h4><p>In that first week of March, I was starting to worry because the data was disturbing, and no measures had been taken. I thought it was time to make decisions. I cancelled meetings and stopped people from going to hospitals or the office. We rolled out a remote work plan. What happened thereafter were rewarding experiences, both positive and negative. On the positive side, our strategy worked. In other words, virtual meetings were possible, and the company's invoicing, customer service, and distribution system worked flawlessly. From the outset, we continued to supply products to our customers. However, one challenge was our sales network of 20 people, of whom 90% are in contact with customers. Now that we had time, we decided to reinvent ourselves and further analyze our ways of working, analytical skills, and knowledge of the products. From there, we structured a global program that would provide content to eight hours of work. Then, from a business point of view, we realized the critical care, infusion pump business had skyrocketed. Our competitors were also trying their best to supply pumps, but there were not enough pumps on the market. The priority, therefore, was to satisfy critical infusion pump needs, because it was related to patients who needed intravenous therapy urgently. The other part of our business, related to surgery, resuscitation, and so on, dropped because the pandemic came first, and surgeries were put on hold. In the end, there was a balance. We closed 2020, from a results perspective, as we had planned.</p><h4>4.5% of ICU Medical's sales gross income goes toward R&amp;D. How important is innovation for the company?</h4><p>What sets this company apart from others is its impetus to innovate and provide clinical solutions. That 4.5% that is set aside for R&amp;D is transformed into new products, and right now we are focused on infusion pumps. It is not a device that can be programmed for drug administration, but it helps prevent medication errors. We want to focus on minimizing medication errors in intravenous therapy. In that regard, ICU Medical is much more advanced than the competition in terms of smart pumps. These devices come with a software called MedNet, which is connected to a drug library. Ultimately, it issues reports locating the errors in order to try to correct them. Another issue that we are extremely interested in, and in which we are pioneers, is cybersecurity, which is highly undervalued. When everyone thinks of cybersecurity, they think of bank accounts, Facebook, or Instagram accounts. However, the pumps can be monitored, and a hacker can alter a patient's dose with a cellphone and kill them. Cybersecurity also applies to patients' medical records and protecting the health of the most critical patients who are attached to a machine. We have been making considerable efforts in this area for many years, though the problem is that there is still a lack of understanding as to what this could mean as far as administration is concerned. Currently, we are the only ones that are certified. Right now, the main priority in terms of infusion pumps is the safety of the device, ensuring they are accurate in terms of administration, easy to use, and so on.</p><h4>What is ICU Medical's main priority for 2021?</h4><p>Safety is the main priority for us all in the industry. This pandemic has showed us that our work really matters. Now, people realize the importance of having these systems because they help healthcare professional to save lives. The primary goal is to save lives. The second, from a business perspective, is to continue consolidating the ICU Medical brand in Spain as one of the most widely recognized.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Founded in 2003, GAM has had sustained growth, first through acquisitions, then in 2006 with an IPO and in 2007 with its international expansion. How has GAM evolved, and what are some of its main milestones?</h4><p>GAM was founded in 2003 within a disintegrated sector in Spain. It made sense to create a larger, more global project, influenced by the construction sector. We went public to raise more capital and shareholders, and in 2008, we began our international expansion. Starting from 2014, the company began to offer new services for a far more industrialized world, with longer-term and predictable contracts, but with more complex services. This is the way things were moving until 2018, when we experienced an important change with the entry of Francisco Riberas. The growth stage we were going through was an important value proposal for customers, and we wanted to have a strong and healthy balance sheet to be able to face this stage. The internationalization aspect stemmed from the fact that we had to leave Spain out of necessity, and we learned a great deal from this. It led to us modernizing certain aspects of the company.</p><h4>GAM offers a wide portfolio of products and solutions covering sectors such as the metallurgical industry, automotive, agriculture and food, aeronautics, ports, mining, logistics, and more. What are GAM's main solutions?</h4><p>Supply is one of our most important solutions. With regards to machines, we offer machine rentals. We have some 20,000 machines around the world, plus another 5,000 managed by customers, so we can provide a service. We also have a particularly important training department. First, we train staff to operate the machinery as well as how to maintain them. This is crucial because we have 25,000 of our own machines and many technical staff. We have a buying and selling portal for machinery for when our customers need to dispose of machines or need machines from us, as we have many customers in purchasing. Many brands have entrusted us with their distribution. We have also closed deals that have led the world to adapt to the new parameters that the industry requires. We have a robotics project that makes driverless machines, in which we have drones that we use for work carried out at a height. We have departments specialized in industrial ecology, energy generation, events, and so on. In terms of events, we have a division that covers everything from the microphone to the screens for production companies such as El Hormiguero, concerts, or festivals such as BBK Live, among others. Every time there is an event, the organizers need people to set it up, provide a power supply, and many more things, and we supply that engineering role. Now, we have a number of corporate events.</p><h4>The pandemic has pushed industrial and construction sector toward digitalization. How important is digitalization for GAM?</h4><p class="quote">In 2021, our aim has been to digitalize all our processes, and for that we need better data quality and better practices in order to manage it. We want a company that makes its own management decisions and does things digitally, more efficiently, and with fewer errors. We want to make data an asset. This is undoubtedly the biggest challenge for us if we want to become a more sustainable company.</p><h4>How has the pandemic affected GAM? What strategies did you employ?</h4><p>We have shown ourselves to be a resilient company, as the industry never stopped moving. If you have a problem, you look for efficiency; this is what GAM does. During the pandemic, we performed well. We have made our costs and structures more flexible. We knew customers were going to suffer, and our strategy was to be more aware of them every day and let them know we were there to help them with whatever they needed. On top of this, we provided flexibility and relief regarding payments and collections and so on. We stayed close to our customers and tried to interpret what they needed at all times.</p><h4>How did GAM close 2020, and what are the company's revenue expectations?</h4><p>GAM closed the year with a 6% drop in sales. However, if the company lost EUR5 million in the first half, it gained EUR6.5 million in the second. That is the efficiency of our model, which took us many years to get right. I do not think we will open in new countries, though we will grow in the ones in which we are already present, homogenizing the service more in foreign countries to standardize them and make them more complete.</p><h4>Which market offers the most revenue, and how important is Spain in the global market?</h4><p>Geographically, we are divided into two large areas. One is Europe, where we are present in Spain, Portugal, and Morocco. We use the same machinery in all three countries, and they account for 70% of our activities. The remaining 30% is Latin America. We will grow in all countries in the coming years, although Latin American countries will likely grow slightly more in percentage terms. This is a major challenge in Latin America's macroeconomy. We are present in countries that are highly dependent on raw materials, such as Peru and Chile, and this could work well in the short term. In Portugal, we work independently. Portugal is one of the most interesting countries for us and is a big commitment for us this year. There, we have focused specifically on the automotive business.</p><h4>Are there any projects planned that have been allocated European funds?</h4><p>Yes. We are taking part in five or six projects. In some projects, we are the main players, and in others we simply are the guests. Some projects are related to the digital world, and in others we are partners, such as that of the National Shipyards Association. That said, the projects are well focused on what the industry needs.</p><h4>What is GAM's main priority for 2021?</h4><p>We want to become a more sustainable company. We do it out of conviction and social commitment, though we do have to keep up with the competition.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did your business respond to the COVID-19 pandemic?</h4><p>Overall, we have managed to keep our production largely stable, which is predominately because we produce in extremely remote regions such as Siberia, or relatively isolated spots with offshore platforms on the high seas. In addition to that, we also benefit from the fact that we have invested a lot in digitalization and a number of our production platforms in Norway or the Netherlands are unmanned and operated remotely. On top of that, we also established several programs to make remote working easier last year. Together, these investments helped to make our business more resilient, especially during these difficult times. Our portfolio is well balanced; we produce in 13 countries with production costs that are almost half  of average of our competitors'.  Here in the UAE specifically, we tried to utilize the expertise and experience we have, especially on our Ghasha concession as an important part of our growth plans. In times like these, strong partnerships and collaboration are even more important than ever. It is about being aligned and sharing best practices. We have always been an ambassador in this sense, supporting and aligning with partners, and we will continue in this manner.</p><h4>What kind of cost efficiencies do you provide to ensure cost reductions?</h4><p>It is about being as remote as possible since there is  no compromise on health and safety or utilizing the latest technology wherever possible. Our production portfolio is broad:we are onshore in Siberia in remote arctic areas, in the desert in North Africa, on remote offshore areas in South America, and offshore in the North Sea. There is always a focus on optimizing production by taking advantage of digitalization by advanced completion technologies and production optimization measures. Many things come together to help us producing our assets in a low-cost environment, which is remarkable, and we are very proud that our costs are lower compared to other producers'.</p><h4>How resilient are you to oil price shocks?</h4><p>We  have a 70% gas-balanced portfolio, which helps in terms of environmental and business sustainability. We believe  that will be a part of the solution and in that sense, we are aligned with the UAE and the approach of ADNOC. We are committed to producing in the most efficient and responsible way, and  to living up to the highest standards of environmental sustainability. We have good examples  where we have showcased that: our 100% own operated oil production in the Wadden Sea in Germany. Our artificial island named Mittelplate, is an  example, where we produce in a heritage area in an extremely organized manner since over 30 years. We have a resilient portfolio and the company is very solid when it comes to the balance sheet. We are also taking the pandemic seriously. We have reduced capex and our exploration activity, but we have not reneged on our project commitments and have maintained stable production, and even grown, during these difficult times.</p><h4>Did you have to do any reskilling and how did the pandemic affect your human talent and capacity building?</h4><p>The oil and gas sector has been an industry with a male-dominated workforce, however the proportion of women employed at Wintershall Dea totals about 27%, with over 20% leadership positions held by women, which we intend to increase further. Diversity contributes to business success and we also promote an inclusive company culture with over 60 nationalities represented in our workforce, since we feel employees tend to be more motivated when their individual backgrounds are perceived and valued. In the UAE we have around one-third local employees as well as 10 other nationalities. We take our partnership with Abu Dhabi very seriously and we are proud to be part of this community. We are not only investing money, but are also working hard to bring value to the UAE's economy and society. Therefore, we are working on in-country value as well as contributing in certain domains such as with our sour gas expertise or sharing our experiences from technologies and digitalization. We were really looking forward this year to establishing the Wintershall Dea Study Tour, where we take a group of young Emirati students to Germany to get them acquainted with our operations and how we do things. That has been a great success and a valuable opportunity to students in the past, but unfortunately this year it hasn't been  possible due to COVID-19. Therefore, we are looking forward to it even more next year.</p><h4>What is the significance of Abu Dhabi for the company portfolio?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is a very significant part of our Wintershall Dea portfolio since  the Middle East is one of the world's most important centers of production and we have seen it as an important growth region for our business, so that will remain. The signing of the Ghasha agreement in 2018 was an important milestone for our business in the region and it will add to the production of Wintershall Dea. We are a proud partner of ADNOC which is part of the DNA of the UAE's economy. This year, we are happy to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Wintershall Dea's presence in Abu Dhabi, so we are very much looking forward to that. Abu Dhabi is a forward-thinking economic center in the Middle East with a clear and proven commitment to technology, innovation, and excellence in oil and gas as well as the wider economy. We  see that in the investments in digital technology and artificial intelligence, for example. With that forward-thinking mindset, I see clear potential for Abu Dhabi to continue being a leader in the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<intervieweelist0description><![CDATA[<p>Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, is one of the most recognisable figures in the global aviation industry. His vision and commitment enabled the ground-breaking development of Qatar Airways from a small regional carrier into one of the world's leading global airlines in the span of just 20 years. Under his leadership, Qatar Airways has become one of the world's most highly-respected airlines, competing on a scale very few airlines achieve. As a result, passengers have recognised the airline's commitment to the values of safety, security, innovation and quality of service by awarding it the 'World's Best Business Class', 'Best Business Class Seat,' 'Best Airline in the Middle East,' and 'World's Best First Class Airline Lounge' at the 2018 World Airline Awards, managed by international air transport rating organisation Skytrax. In 2019, H.E. Mr. Al Baker received the Airline of the Year award for the fifth time at the 2019 Skytrax World Airline Awards — a first in the competition's history. Widely known for his ambition and passion for innovation, H.E. Mr. Al Baker introduced the award-winning Qsuite in March 2017. Featuring the industry's first-ever double bed available in Business Class, with privacy panels that stow away, the unique and patented design allows passengers in adjoining seats to create their own private suites. He also ensures Qatar Airways leads the way in showcasing the best possible product, with the airline being the proud launch customer of the A350-900 in 2014 and A350-1000 in 2018, as well as being the regional launch customer for the Boeing Dreamliner 787 in 2015. H.E. Mr. Al Baker placed a ground-breaking order with Boeing in 2016 for $2.16 billion. In 2018, a purchase agreement signing ceremony between Boeing and Qatar Airways finalised the airline's order for five 777 Freighters, a deal valued at $1.7 billion at current list prices.</p>]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have the main highlights been for Qatar Airways (QR) between late 2019 and the third quarter of 2020? How have you been preparing for the reactivation of the economy and the resumption of flights during the pandemic? </h4><p>Since the beginning of the pandemic our main focus has been to take people home safely. Qatar Airways is one of the few global airlines that never stopped flying during the crisis. Our network never fell below 30 destinations and 150 weekly flights, with continuous service on five continents. Right now, we are operating more than 700 weekly flights to just over 100 destinations worldwide. We are proud to have reached this significant milestone in the rebuilding of our network. Our focus is not only on resuming destinations, but also on serving as many connections as possible to enable our passengers to travel where and whenever they want. One of our greatest assets in these challenging times is our highly flexible fleet: a mix of fuel-efficient aircraft and strategic network management has enabled us to resume operations quickly and to expand our service in response to passenger demand. The strategic investment in a variety of fuel-efficient twin-engine aircraft, including the largest fleet of Airbus A350s, has enabled us to operate continuously during the crisis and put us in the optimal position to play a leading role in rebuilding international travel. Entry restrictions around the world are the biggest impediment to many people resuming travel. As entry restrictions around the world begin to ease, we expect passenger demand to increase gradually. We believe that travel will steadily return, limited by entry restrictions rather than customer confidence. People will want to travel again, experience the world, and meet friends and family as well as business travel restarting. Since the onset of COVID-19, Qatar Airways has taken over 2.8 million people home, flown more than 237 million kilometres, operated over 47,000 flights (including over  430 special charter flights), carried over 250,000 tonnes of medical supplies and aid, equal to roughly 2,500 Boeing 777 freighters, set new flight records operating over 180 cargo flights in a single day, provided 100,000 free tickets to medical professionals around the world and 21,000 free tickets to teaching professionals, and worked closely with governments and the maritime industry to operate hundreds of chartered and scheduled flights to help bring home over 150,000 seafarers. The airline has introduced the latest safety and hygiene measures during the same period, making it one of the few international airlines that is fully equipped to resume operations. We introduced PPE coverings for cabin crew that are fitted over their uniforms, along with safety glasses, gloves and a mask. Passengers are also required to wear facemasks in flight and we provide them with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits that include a face shield visor, facemask, disposable gloves and hand sanitiser. We apply the highest standards of cleanliness on board with our aircraft thoroughly disinfected and equipped with industrial-size HEPA filters that remove 99.97% of viral and bacterial contaminants for re-circulated air, and thermal screening of our crew. In September 2020, Qatar Airways became the first global carrier to operate Honeywell's Ultraviolet (UV) Cabin System, further advancing its hygiene measures onboard. In clinical tests, UV light has been shown to be capable of inactivating various viruses and bacteria when properly applied. On ground, Hamad International Airport (HIA) is implementing innovative solutions to maintain the highest levels of hygiene including the use of disinfection robots, advanced thermal temperature screening, and ultraviolet luggage disinfection. Additionally, all passenger touchpoints are sanitised every 10-15 minutes, and all boarding gates and bus gate counters are cleaned after each flight. I have every confidence that the Qatar Airways Group will emerge stronger from this difficult period and continue to innovate and set the standards that our competitors can only hope to emulate. We will continue to be the airline millions of passengers can trust and rely on in good times and bad, and proudly fly the flag of the State of Qatar across the globe.</p><h4>As your Excellency explained during our last meeting for the Business Year: Qatar 2020, QR and Hamad International Airport (HIA) prioritize customers to be named year after year as the best airline and top-5 airport in the world. What is your strategy to keep leading rankings during the “new normal“? How do you plan to increase security and time-efficiency to the benefit of your customers?</h4><p>We will gradually reinstate suspended destinations and additional frequencies in line with expected relaxation of entry restrictions around the world with a focus on key global destinations and partner hubs. By the end of the IATA Winter Season, Qatar Airways plans to rebuild its network to 126 destinations including 20 in Africa, 11 in the Americas, 42 in Asia-Pacific, 38 in Europe and 15 in the Middle East. Many cities will be served with a strong schedule with daily or more frequencies. From the experience we have gained throughout the pandemic, we have further established ourselves as one of the world's most trusted airlines. We have gained a lot of favour with our customers and I believe we will come out of this crisis stronger.<br>Since February 2020, the airline has reported extremely low numbers of COVID-19 cases on board its aircraft after operating more than 4.6 million passenger flown sectors and over 33 billion revenue passenger kilometres on more than 37,000 COVID-19-free flights across the globe. The success of the airline's robust COVID-19 monitoring, detection and hygiene programme has resulted in more than 99.988 per cent of passengers travelling COVID-19-free on board, with significantly less than one per cent of passengers confirmed to have tested positive by local authorities following a Qatar Airways flight. In addition to this, significantly less than one per cent (0.002%) of operating cabin crew have been affected on board to date, with no new cases recorded since the airline introduced its full PPE in-flight uniform in May 2020, as well as the inclusion of passenger face shields on all flights. These latest statistics are a clear indication that, with the adoption of the right measures such as meticulous on-board safety, hygiene and social distancing procedures in place at airports, and compliance with the testing and entry requirements of local authorities, air travel does not need to be a source of concern to passengers. In October 2020, we extended our commitment to offering passengers flexible booking options, for all tickets issued before 31 December 2020. For passengers who would like to change their travel plans, they can: hold their ticket value for two years, benefit from unlimited date changes, and exchange their ticket for a future travel voucher with 10% extra value. And if passengers have had their travel plans impacted by factors outside their control, they can: change their destination — within the same continental region for Qatar Airways Privilege Club members or within the same country or a 500 mile radius for non-members, swap their ticket for Qmiles and refund their ticket with no fees applied. Premium customers can also continue to enjoy the Qsuite's enhanced privacy, including sliding privacy partitions and the option to use a 'Do Not Disturb (DND)' indicator. Qsuite is available on flights to more than 30 destinations including Frankfurt, Kuala Lumpur, London and New York. In December 2020, Hamad International Airport (HIA) became the first airport in the Middle East and Asia to be awarded a 5-Star COVID-19 Airport Safety Rating by Skytrax. The audit evaluated how effectively COVID-19 policies are implemented at Qatar's airport against the Skytrax COVID-19 safety rating standards. The award-winning airport has also recently been ranked the “Third Best Airport in the World“, among 550 airports worldwide, by the SKYTRAX World Airport Awards 2020. Rising from fourth position in 2019 to third in 2020, HIA has been steadily rising in the 'World's Best Airports' rankings since the start of its operations in 2014.</p><h4>Your Excellency not only heads QR and HIA, but also the Qatar National Tourism Council, which makes a lot of sense since you take care of visitors since the departure of their home country until their return. How do all these institutions cooperate to achieve the National Tourism Strategy and ultimately, the National Vision? What is your partnership strategy with other institutions and companies to enhance your positive impact on visitors?</h4><p>Qatar's National Tourism Strategy 2030 charts the next ten years of the tourism sector's growth and defines the long-term goals for the country providing a framework in which national strategies and implementation plans can be developed in conjunction with stakeholders. Service Excellence is one of the key pillars of our tourism strategy.  These measures outlined in this strategy align along the central goal of ensuring an exceptional guest experience across every touch point of the visitor journey. While working together as a cohesive group; Qatar Airways, Hamad International Airport, and QNTC can facilitate interactions and shared experiences between Qatar's residents and its guests to achieve this end. The overarching strategy unites public and private sector entities in the development of products, services, and experiences for the promotion of the destination on an international scale, showcasing Qatar as a vibrant country offering the best of Middle Eastern hospitality, with new and undiscovered experiences.</p><h4>How will flying with QR or having a layover at HIA be during the 2022 FIFA World Cup? What is your strategy to make sure that you are part of the event beyond the transport of passengers?</h4><p>Qatar Airways, Official Partner and the Official Airline of FIFA, recently unveiled a specially-branded Boeing 777 aircraft painted in FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022TM livery. Qatar's readiness to host FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022TM is evident all around us. At Qatar Airways, our network recently expanded to 100 destinations, and we plan to rebuild it to 126 destinations including 20 in Africa, 11 in the Americas, 42 in Asia-Pacific, 38 in Europe and 15 in the Middle East, enabling our passengers to travel when they want across the globe, safely and reliably. At Hamad International Airport, Official Airport Partner for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022TM, preparations for the expected traffic growth are well underway. The airport expansion project will increase capacity to more than 58 million passengers annually by 2022. Moreover, Qatar Airways, in partnership with Qatar Airways Holidays, will soon launch bespoke travel packages to visit Qatar for FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022TM. As the Official Partner and the Official Airline of FIFA, we will also be heavily involved in the event. We will be activating the partnership on-ground across stadiums and fan zones in Qatar, ensuring we provide interactive and family-friendly activities for all fans.</p><h4>It seems that COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies and other innovations in every sector of the economy. What has the impact of the pandemic been for the aviation industry in this regards? Can you brief us about the new trends that you expect in the next few years?</h4><p>During these unprecedented times, the health and safety of our crew and passengers continues to be of the utmost importance. Since the start of the pandemic, we have been regularly introducing new and effective safety and hygiene measures onboard our aircraft, based on our unparalleled expertise of flying consistently throughout. In September 2020, we became the first global carrier to operate Honeywell's Ultraviolet (UV) Cabin System, further advancing our hygiene measures onboard. In clinical tests, UV light has been shown to be capable of inactivating various viruses and bacteria when properly applied. Approximately the size of a beverage cart, the Honeywell UV Cabin System, which is operated by Qatar Aviation Services (QAS), has extendable UV arms that treat aircraft seats, surfaces and cabins without using cleaning chemicals. Some new trends that we can expect to see in the aviation industry include the adoption of digital health pass technology, so air travel may safely resume. Government-imposed travel and entry restrictions continue to significantly impact global travel demand. Meanwhile, COVID-19 testing has emerged as an important part of an end-to-end solution to enable the safe restart of international travel by potentially reducing the reliance on blanket quarantines. The recent digital 'health pass' trials, such as Common Pass, are presenting a strong case for using digital technology to deliver harmonised standards in the validation and verification of accredited passenger health data. At Qatar Airways, we support technical solutions that provide a consistent and affordable way to declare passenger health data that is simple to implement as part of the customer journey, with processes initiated pre-travel to reduce passenger inconvenience at airports.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for the remainder of 2020 and 2021?</h4><p>Our priority for the future is to ensure the recovery of commercial aviation by encouraging passengers to feel confident that they are safe and protected, from departure to arrival, with all airlines. We will continue to improve and introduce the most rigorous and stringent virus monitoring, detection and on-board hygiene programmes.We also aim to establish and cement ourselves as the leading airline in the Middle East and among the best in the world in regards to our loyalty programme. Recently, Privilege Club has cut the number of Qmiles required to book award flights by up to 49 per cent in a major development in its transformation to provide more and better rewards to its loyal members. Privilege Club's Qmiles requirements have been reduced for award flight for all members travelling with Qatar Airways on connecting flights through the Best Airport in the Middle East, Hamad International Airport (HIA), as well as those travelling to or from Doha to Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Privilege Club members booking flexi award tickets — which require twice the number of Qmiles as award flights — will also benefit from these reductions. Earlier this year, Qatar Airways Privilege Club revised its Qmiles policy to offer more flexibility — when a member earns or spends Qmiles, their balance is now valid for 36 months. Additionally, Privilege Club recently removed booking fees for award flights. The airline has also lately launched a global programme exclusive to students worldwide. Student Club is powered by the airline's loyalty programme, Qatar Airways Privilege Club, and offers a range of benefits curated for students to support them throughout their educational journey. Members of Student Club will enjoy great savings and bespoke benefits such as special fares on flights, extra baggage allowances, the flexibility to change the dates of their flight, complimentary Super Wi-Fi onboard, and more. They will also be automatically enrolled to Qatar Airways Privilege Club — unlocking even greater rewards — and will receive a tier upgrade as a graduation gift as well as the opportunity to earn 5,000 Qmiles if they refer a friend to Student Club.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights for Milaha in late 2019 and the first half of 2020? How have you prepared for the reactivation of the economy and supply chains during the pandemic time?</h4><p>There is no doubt whatsoever that the period from the end of 2019 to the middle of this year has been more than challenging for many companies, not just for Milaha in Qatar, but for firms all over the world. This, of course, is due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Milaha has been extremely proactive during this extraordinary time and we have successes to report. Our incredible workforce has risen to all the challenges set before them, going further than the extra mile. We were delighted to report strong financial performance. Our operating profit in particular, continues to perform well. We are also seeing strong core-business performance. Again, despite the changes and uncertainty over the past months, we continued operating and serving our clients. One of our major priorities is and will continue to be keeping a safe working environment for our employees. In April, we held our first-ever virtual town hall meeting for all employees to reflect on our business operations and most notable achievements over the past 12 months. We made full use of our hi-tech capabilities and proficiency in digital developments to bring our leadership and staff members together online, becoming one of the first firms to play host to such an event. It was a tremendous success and our ongoing resilience in such trying times is something we can justifiably be proud of. With regard to the reactivation of the economy and supply chains during these past few months, we have been highly active in making changes to how we operate as a company, which will be beneficial to all stakeholders and entities who have dealings with us, whether they are long-standing friends of many decades or new customers. We introduced a brand refresh and new digital systems to reflect the realignment of our overall business strategy. We continue to chart our path towards our vision, despite the challenges.</p><h4>The country has a lot of infrastructure developments in the pipeline which are very relevant to the logistics industry, such as the ports and airports expansion projects, QFZA's growth strategy, long Distance Rail, etc. What are your expansion plans to capitalize on these relevant developments? How do you assess QFZA focus on chemical, oil &amp; gas, and pharmaceutical sectors in the sense of Qatar becoming a logistic hub for the middle East, and even for Asia and East Africa? What will be the impact for the achievement of this goal of the disruptions caused by Covid-19 crisis over international supply chain?</h4><p>Setting aside all the challenges caused by the pandemic for just a moment, it is right to say that exciting and profitable times for Qatar lie ahead. This is an extremely significant decade ahead of Qatar National Vision 2030, and everyone here at Milaha is determined to play their part to ensure it is a tremendously successful one. The various developments and expansion schemes across our nation truly are exciting, while the idea of Qatar becoming a logistics hub for the Middle East, Asia and East Africa is an ambition that we all want to make a reality. Of course, the COVID-19 crisis will undoubtedly impact international supply chains, but we at Milaha are determined to work to the best of our abilities to ensure our loyal customers receive the very best from us at all times. Going back to our new Marine &amp; Technical Services pillar, this includes both current activities (ship management, shipping agency, shipyard, bunkering) and introduces new services, such as ship chandlering. We have also combined our truck sales and distribution activities with our land-based asset maintenance and servicing activities. Meanwhile, our existing Maritime &amp; Logistics pillar now focuses on enabling trade and providing end-to-end supply chain solutions for commercial customers, through our Container Shipping, Ports, Freight Forwarding, Warehousing and Land Transport business units. I am certain that all of these will neatly dovetail with the various projects lined up across our country.</p><h4>Milaha has recently entered into a partnership with Microsoft to drive operational excellence and transform supply chain industry. How will this partnership help to achieve those goals? Can you provide some examples on how are disruptive technologies transforming your industry by increasing efficiency and safety, while reducing the environmental footprint? How are you working to become more sustainable in line with the latest Qatari and international trends?</h4><p>Our partnership with Microsoft is something everyone at Milaha is extremely excited about. It is helping to transform our workplace into a modern, secure and digitally enabled environment, and that underpins our digital transformation.Microsoft's Power Platform has really shown its value during the pandemic. Our workforce was able to collaborate and securely share files. We could also create and connect our business applications, especially to harness the complex data sources across the organization to deliver business intelligence to inform decision-making. Microsoft Power Apps also helped us develop an emergency communication app to keep all our employees connected and up to date on COVID-19 from trusted sources. Adopting Microsoft's Threat Protection solutions will continue to help us better detect and respond swiftly to any cyberattacks. We really believe that this partnership will be a great success for both parties and Milaha looks forward to developing our collaboration with Microsoft further.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for the remaining of 2020 and 2021?</h4><p>We look at COVID-19 as an opportunity to both further solidify the foundation of our business as well as to launch new service offerings. This is in addition to tackling the priorities that were already identified as part of our medium- and long-term strategy prior to the outbreak. As a first step, we are focusing on mitigating the impact of the pandemic in the short-term; however, it is important that these initiatives make us structurally stronger for the coming years as we anticipate further disruptions to the global economy, whether due to trade disputes or black swan events. As part of this, we are doubling down on our efforts to digitize the business in order to both become more efficient as well as to target new digitally-enabled revenue streams. We want to take this opportunity to fundamentally reshape the business model in some of our sectors. Beyond the digital push, in most of our core businesses, we are accelerating our expansion of products and services for both existing and new customer segments. We are investing in our capabilities to provide a more comprehensive set of services across the oil and gas sector. That is across the commercial supply chain (for example, freight forwarding services) and across the marine services lifecycle (for example, in shipyard and ship chandlering services), in order to position Milaha as a strategic partner of choice for customers in these sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you ensure SYKES's impact is always greater for companies and that the suite of services available is always wider as well?</h4><p>At SYKES, we want to be recognized for creating intelligent customer experiences. We have been a leading provider worldwide in multichannel demand and customer engagement services for over 40 years.  In November 2020, we formally launched Sykes digital services that combines the digital transformation capabilities we have been acquiring and developing in past years. The focus is on transforming business operations with attention to customer experience; we are being true to our core. We design or redesign a company's digital strategy to guarantee an excellent user experience. SYKES counts on its methodologies, tools, expertise, and skill sets. Collaboration with our clients is paramount and ensures we understand the customer journey map and company processes that show where we can add value to the end user.</p><h4>Where are companies falling short in their efforts to strengthen their digital presence?</h4><p>It is important for a company to have clear objectives for their digital transformation strategy. We want to ensure that whatever we do in digital transformation goes toward the core of the business and provides value to the end user. By partnering with SYKES, our clients benefit from the expertise we have built during the last five years in end-to-end solutions. We understand the whole customer journey and can identify where opportunities can be created. End-to-end solutions incorporate aspects of automation, marketing, sales, and customer care. We can ensure that teams, systems, and technologies are streamlined; our added value is optimizing the customer journey. Creating intelligent customer experiences is our impact</p><h4>How is training and education a permanent component of the company's culture?</h4><p>Part of our culture is having a team that works, learns, and grows together; we want to make sure we continue to replicate our culture to our employees work from home experience. With regard to recruiting, we launched SARA, SYKES Automated Recruitment Assistance, which uses AI to help us maximize the candidate's experience. SARA has been an innovative tool that incorporates digital transformation and adds value to one of the most important processes in our industry.  We need optimized processes that ensure we stay efficient through growth. Regarding training, we have adapted active learning to the virtual environment, which required updating tools and methodologies to ensure we continue to capture the attention of trainees. Keeping on-screen attention for six to eight hours of training is a big challenge. Gamification is something we have been incorporating that has great potential to be part of our virtual training and learning methodologies, especially in making our self-study modules more attractive.</p><h4>What role does the company have within the Latin American and global operations?</h4><p>SYKES Colombia began in 2013 with training classes and went live in 2014; it has been seven years of a successful story out of Barranquilla. We started on one site, and, despite the pandemic, we have grown and are in the process of opening a second site in Barranquilla. We are also evaluating a second city in Colombia, which speaks highly of our success story in the country. The service and delivery that we promise is high quality and leans on the quality of the Colombian workforce. We will definitely continue to grow in Colombia.</p><h4>Why does Colombia have an advantage in the provision of BPO services, and what potential is there for the sector?</h4><p>One of the synergies that Colombia can continue to leverage on is the country's technology know-how. The government is committed to investing on skillsets related to technology and software development. Today, 50% of SYKES' services in Colombia is focused on technology, and it continues to be one of the areas we prioritize for Colombia, especially with the country's large youth population. Still, Colombia needs to ensure it accelerates English proficiency, and it is important for the local workforce to have strong handling of the English language.</p><h4>Where is SYKES Colombia focused on business development, and what strategies are at the forefront?</h4><p>From a strategy perspective, technology is central. Colombia is considered an attractive nearshore location to the US and has demonstrated stability. Technology and Software development continue to be an area of growth and new opportunities, as part of the near future strategy for Colombia. We are focused on ensuring the sustainable capabilities to build medium- to long-term strategies, which requires a country-coordinated effort. There has to be a single country strategy to ensure we have the right skillsets, technology, and language skills. SYKES has been successful in its efforts to promote English and technical education in Colombia through different social responsibility initiatives, as the SEED, SYKES Education and Employability Development program, SWIT, SYKES Women in Technology program, and our own internal English and Technical Academies. We need to keep that in mind that as a country, we need to make sure we are sustainable for all the different industries. The more people who speak English, the more opportunities we can bring to the country.</p><h4>What differentiates SYKES, and what added value can you provide for the Colombian and international business ecosystems?</h4><p>SYKES offers innovation in the subject of digital transformation as well expertise in end-to-end solutions. We have the knowledge, skillsets, technologies, and methodologies to identify areas with potential for automation and optimization. Helping our clients optimize lifetime value with customers contributes to the long-term business relationships we have built. Clients continue to trust us to attract, convert, engage, and retain customers. For Colombia, the BPO industry is experiencing a great momentum that allow us to explore new markets, verticals, and technologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the bank evolved in the four years since you took office?</h4><p>The bank has always had a strong franchise and brand, with a 45 year history. What we have done over the last four years is re-energize that franchise by focusing on a number of key client experience and creativity projects primarily in the digital environment. We have won several awards for our digital innovation in the Middle East and we believe that more and more transactional banking will be done on a self-service basis through automation and digital access. We have also transformed our core operations and technology engine and created our own dedicated subsidiary, namely Commercial Bank Innovation Services, to manage our technology and operations in a unified manner to enhance our digital capabilities so that we can come to market very quickly with new innovations and products. We believe the agility this provides a long term competitive advantage The third area of focus is making sure everyone understands that risk control and compliance is everyone's responsibility and has to be embedded in the DNA of the Bank. Part of a prudent risk approach is diversification by sector and we have increased our business with the public sector from less than 6% to currently 12% of our loan book, the target being 16-20% in the next four-year period. We also have subsidiaries and associates in Turkey and Oman with whom we work much more collaboratively today. Finally, four years ago we had a cost-income ratio of 45%, which was higher than the market average, but today we are at 28%, which is much better and closer to the market average. We will continue to focus on each of these areas.</p><h4>How has COVID-19 accelerated digital initiatives within the banking sector?</h4><p>COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of digital technology, products, and services by clients across all age groups. For example, we have implemented an online appointment system that allows clients to say what service they need in advance and what date and time is most convenient for them. This helps us to become more efficient and better manage peak hour traffic, and has reduced waiting times for our clients and has brought about a rise in client satisfaction. We would have not taken this measure so soon if COVID-19 hadn't forced us to innovate. We will also introduce more digital capabilities related to wealth management, brokerage and fund investment services.</p><h4>What is the role of the banking sector in the recovery of the economy and the protection of vulnerable clients?</h4><p>The implementation mechanisms for the government support package are channeled through the banking system. For example, we were the first bank to defer principal installments for six months for SME clients. Second, the government came out with the National Response Guarantee Program loan program guaranteed by the Qatar Development Bank, which allowed loans to be taken by companies for rental and wage payments for a period of time. This was also dispersed through the banking system. Similarly, the government, working through the banking system, has given deferment of principal and interest payments for a number of months for affected sectors such as hospitality, tourism, and retail. We have given a reduced rate of interest and also a deferral of loans for a period of six months to allow these sectors to manage this difficult period and get back on their feet soon. We collaborated with the Qatar Central Bank, which acted as the apex controlling institution with regular meetings with the Governor and the other bank CEOs. To us, this is an important time and we must work collaboratively for the benefit of the economy, our clients and the overall banking sector, which is of key importance to the country.</p><h4>What are your growth plans in terms of new products and services to enhance your retail and corporate experience in Qatar?</h4><p>Digital adoption is going to continue, so we will also continue to roll out new products and services to make transaction banking easier. For example, we have been the first in Qatar to launch digital deposit of cheques, where you just have to take a front and back photo of the cheque to be deposited into your account. Our goal is that the customer should be able to do 100% of their banking tasks without having to visit a branch. As people diversify their investments and wealth from real estate they are now looking at alternate forms of savings and investment options, whether it is, equities, bonds or annuities through insurance products. We have to be ready for this type of customer behavioural change. In Qatar, we have one of the highest concentrations of high-net-worth individuals, but we also have a lot of expatriates working here for 20 years who have built up savings. We have to focus on this diversity in demographics with different needs. Regarding corporate clients, COVID-19 will drive changes in capital structures and they may be looking at longer maturity dates in bonds and other issuances, which will change their focus from only bank debt.  Across both retail and corporate, people are going to look at their cashflows, wealth, and investments more carefully and we are there to support them with a better understanding of their needs and relevant new products and services.</p><h4>How would you assess your association with the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters and the larger local sport industry?</h4><p>Qatar has a vision to build a diversified economy with sport as one of the key focus areas. Golf is a very international and high economic value sport so Commercial Bank is a sponsor of the Qatar Masters, which has been a European PGA event for the last 15 years. In doing so, we are supporting the National Vision as it highlights and showcases Qatar's strong travel and hospitality infrastructure, excellent golf courses. Secondly, we have started supporting Al Shaqab, a very high-profile local equestrian event. Horsemanship is a core part of the local culture so again, we are in compliance with the National Vision through sports. Both of these events have huge visibility and profile and are a great partnership supporting Qatar's visibility as an attractive sports and hospitality destination.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What did 2020 mean for you, and what changed in terms of volumes and patterns?</h4><p>The biggest impact for us was the acceleration of awareness at the consumer, corporate, and merchant levels. Awareness of the benefits of electronic payments versus cash has exploded. Many businesses realized their current setups were unsuitable for a zero-contact economy, while consumers realized how convenient, quick, and, more importantly, hygienic it was not to handle cash and to use electronic payments instead. We did a survey in Saudi in 2Q2020, and 90% of respondents had already used contactless in April and May 2020, many of them for the first time. Around 80% also said they would continue to use electronic payment features such as contactless as much as possible, regardless of COVID-19. From the merchant perspective, it was more a case of survival as they had to accept payments through a secure, seamless, and safe way online so they could deliver goods to customers. Interestingly, these are solutions that Mastercard has been working on for the last 10 years. The biggest win for the digital economy was the crucial need at this point in time to change behavior. This will have far-reaching implications.</p><h4>Has the volume of individual transactions risen while the amount of money spent in each transaction has fallen, and what other trends have you seen?</h4><p>This pattern is what we call cash displacement. When cash moves from bank notes to electronic, you see vastly increased transactions, but lower individual amounts because small purchases are being converted to digital from cash. While cross-border spend plummeted in 2020, actually electronic spend on domestic categories shot through the roof. All the volumes that we lost in Q1 2020 because of the systemic shock to the system started coming back. We definitely saw a massive boost that will continue because consumer behaviors will not return to where they were, and all indicators say they will continue to be the way they are now. This cash displacement has set up a new baseline, so once the second recovery starts to take place, and economic activity returns to 2019 levels, this new baseline will be set to the new level of spending and will take into account new behaviors that will no longer happen at cash points going forward.</p><h4>What is your strategy in a market that is so innovative and changing so quickly in terms of regulations and new products?</h4><p>In Saudi Arabia today, we have cashless payments, cross-border remittances, account-to-account transfers, QR payments, which are quick response code payments, and e-commerce. We have done about 85% of all e-commerce flows in the market across all schemes. These are all different payment rails that we have brought to life in these markets in the Middle East and the GCC specifically. When regulators like the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) open up to embrace the future and bring all these multi-rails, they are so hungry to unlock the digital economy across all levels and provide choice to consumers. It makes us excited because this is the ecosystem that we have contributed to globally. In terms of regulatory change, when we look at the upcoming open banking regulations that have already been announced, those will bring a new layer that will enable many use cases that will fit with other innovations, such as QR and real-time payments, which we are rolling out in Saudi with Saudi Payments. We will have a market that has so much to offer and we will be up there with the likes of Singapore and London in being at the forefront of pioneering new technology. We shed our legacy skin many years ago as a company, and we are really embracing change. Instead of being afraid of the future or betting only on one technology or rail, you have to bet on a future that has choice.</p><h4>How will you shift your strategy to deal with this new reality in the coming year?</h4><p>The pandemic has taught us to be resilient in the way we operate at Mastercard, both globally and in markets. We have already gone through significant changes that allowed us to accelerate the way we think about our business. The whole organization has really accepted the fact that you cannot survive on one kind of technology. This year has justified the challenge we took five years ago and believed would reap dividends in the next 10 or 20 years but has instead happened now. What we are trying to do is learn to be a multi-rail company instead of only focusing on the one thing that we have been doing for over 60 years. We offer a plethora of assets ranging from loyalty to data and analytics to cybersecurity. Our new portfolio of business also pushes us to engage differently with different stakeholders. We do more work with governments, especially on smart cities, transit, and G2C or C2G heavy sectors, as well support many commercial flows. The entire B2B space is ripe for disruption. It is about how to support all of our partners across government and different segments of merchants and private sector, as well as the banks that we have served for the last six or seven decades. That is the biggest challenge and is what we are trying to change.</p><h4>Where do you see growth coming from, particularly for the Saudi market, in the coming year?</h4><p>With the digital economy, you have to think about how things are connected because a digital economy means more transactions. We have not even started talking about IoT and other transaction flows that will happen eventually. Typically, the ticket size of transactions will go down, which is an indicator that you are really displacing cash. When these little payments start getting out of the ecosystem, that is when we will see a large uplift on the number of transactions. The average transaction size will go down, and the number of transactions will go up. If we look at data from the US in 2020, fraud outpaced transactions by four times, which means every time you grow 20% on transactions you grow 80% on fraud. That is why we invest so much in cybersecurity, which is essential because you cannot have a sound, secure, seamless, and safe transaction ecosystem for consumers to trust in if you cannot offer security and safety. Services becomes increasingly important because with more transactions there is more data, and with more data there are more insights. We are no longer just a network connecting point-to-point; we help our partners by smartening and protecting the network and our partners. We cover all the bases, and 2020 has vindicated us, establishing a strong foundation for future growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>During Spain Investors Day, you mentioned internationalization will form part of the solution to the current situation. What plans have you put in place in order to continue supporting the internationalization of Spanish companies?</h4><p>The Spanish Government places internationalization as a priority in its political agenda. In order to this, our plans form part of a 10-year strategy called Strategy for Internationalization of the Spanish Economy 2017-2027, a battery of measures for all organizations and departments to promote internationalization to work in a coordinated and efficient manner, taking advantage of potential synergies and involving the private sector in the execution of the Plan. We insist on this because the best thing for the private sector is having a stable framework and commitment as a country, since it is a strategy undertaken with public-private cooperation. As the international reality is always changing and moving, this strategy must draw up every two years with consultation from different administrations and the private sector. For instance, last period was a scenario marked by Brexit uncertainty and commercial tensions whereas now is marked by COVID-19 pandemic.. As an exception, in 2020 we were forced to launch an additional action plan to support the external sector. This was because during the pandemic we saw a significant decline in international commerce, exports, and investments. Therefore, we had to move everything over to virtual formats and make the best use of our economic and sales offices. In addition, we also strengthened our financial tools and international policies. We are currently preparing our Action Plan for the Internationalization of the Spanish Economy 2021-2022. Now, the international market forms a large part of the growth strategy of a company, even small businesses. And that is extremely important, because it means a culture related to international markets is being consolidated.  This strategy involves making the foreign sector a pillar of growth and employment, through the diversification of exports and the establishment of our companies in strategic sectors and destinations, paying attention to the opportunities that may arise from the crisis.</p><h4>Which factors boosted the Spanish exporter sector growth in mid-2020?</h4><p>In the current context of global trade, Spanish companies maintain a solid position within global value chains. For this reason, as soon as the foreign markets activity began to reactivate, the export activity of our companies began gradually their recovery. These solid expectations are also reinforced by the evolution of our target markets.  In December 2020, Spain's exports increased by 0.9% year-on-year in nominal terms to 22,761.7 million euros, more than in December 2019. The export sector has already fully recovered its pre-pandemic level of activity. These data confirm that our export sector has proven to be resilient and very competitive in a year marked by an unprecedented health crisis that impacted directly on trade flows.</p><h4>EUR524 million of European funds will be assigned to SME commercial projects. How will these budgets be distributed in terms of internationalization?</h4><p>We have a significant budget for internationalization through various financial instruments such as CESCE portfolio and COFIDES funds. Apart from that, new programs will be included aimed at reinforcing the policies and tools that we already have with ICEX and, above all, attracting productive foreign investment, especially in innovative sectors. Namely, we want to reinforce foreign companies' participation in our country and professional greenfield projects with capital. This process is what we call opening market funds. These are non-refundable funds for feasibility studies and strategic planning so that Spanish companies and other companies from overseas have the opportunity to participate.</p><h4>In 2021, there are plans to create a technology fund  for domestic trade for which EUR100 million has been allocated. What is the aim of these funds?</h4><p>These funds, along with others, are part of The Domestic Trade Plan 2021- 2023 that includes new measures and is structured in 5 pillars:</p><p>1) "Digitalization of the sector"<br>2) "Social and environmental sustainability.  <br>3) "Governance and competitiveness " <br>4) "Capacity building, Training and Information":<br>5) "Recovering consumer confidence and awareness"</p><p>These technology funds provide direct assistance to integrate technology into any small business. In this sense, they are addressed at capitalization, digitalization training and the development of digital solutions.. You can use e-commerce to sell a competitive product or meet a demanding client.. Even for the provision of a good physical retail service, you need to incorporate technology, smart fitting rooms, communication, apps, digital marketing, and so on.</p><h4>Joe Biden has signed an executive order opting for American supplies and suppliers to boost the industry and support employment. What dangers does the Made in America policy pose to Europe?</h4><p>What we have learnt from the pandemic is the importance of international cooperation. The fight against a global pandemic can only be achieved through open markets and political cooperation at every level.  In that sense, EU vision is focused on building a solid relationships with main commercial partners, including the US. For example, in important areas such as commerce, medical products and accessibility to vaccines to less developed countries, we will need the US as a partner, and we want to lay down the foundations for global cooperation. We have to count on the US because it is our natural ally. In a few weeks, we will try to negotiate and bring an end to the controversies in the WTO.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the current situation regarding negotiations between the EU and China?</h4><p>We have been negotiating with China for seven years, and in 2019 it seemed as though the conclusions of this agreement were set. These investments have taken a long time to bring to fruition. Apart from this, last year was also signed a bilateral agreement between EU and China to protect a long list of European Geographical Indications (GIs) into the Chinese market.  GIs agreement was a milestone and we closed 2020 with this agreement that is important too:  because it consolidated China's commitments as it is taken part into  WTO, the agreement opens up new markets in China and a list of sectors that were previously closed off to foreign investment.. Important topics are addressed with regard to China, for example, the forced technology transfer, the role of public companies, and subsidies. What is more, China assumes commitments related to the environment and social and labor rights. The entire international community benefits from this agreement.</p><h4>Mercosur is another milestone. What are your thoughts on it?</h4><p>We are present in 10 countries in Latin America and Mercosur is extremely important because we have been negotiating for 20 years. It is a great deal. These are state-of-the-art agreements that bring tariff savings and therefore substantial benefits for European companies. It facilitates improved integration of value chains in key industries. And, if that were not enough, the environmental theme includes for the first time a highly developed and extensive chapter on sustainable development commitments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With the COVID-19 pandemic affecting all areas of the economy, how has LG evolved over the last year?</h4><p>We ended 2019 extremely well, and in 2020 things were going well until March. We then suffered heavily right at the beginning of the pandemic due to the lockdown. We managed to balance our sales through e-commerce, though these did not make it up for the loss of in-person sales. After the lockdown, we saw a change that helped us end the year in good shape. People realized they are spending more time at home and that their home is an investment, and they are changing their habits. They are buying larger TV sets and better appliances, and there is growing interest in companies that are socially responsible. We have experienced double-digit growth every month after the lockdown was lifted. If we had had 10 more days to sell, we would have surpassed our 2019 figures.</p><h4>Has remote working impacted sales of your products?</h4><p>Yes, everything related to remote working has grown exponentially. Screens for computers have boomed; everything related to computers has grown as well. We have also brought in more products from Asia. We are selling a mask from LG, and air purifiers are also selling well. On top of this, we have products that sanitize via steam. We invented a washing machine that uses steam and ensures that clothes are properly sanitized.</p><h4>LG PuriCare Air Purifying Mask is a next-generation mask with 2 HEPA filters, fans, and an ergonomic design. What sales estimates does the company have for this product?</h4><p>I have been testing it for three months, and we have recently obtained the certification. It has two HEPA filters, which protects users from almost every virus, including COVID-19, because the molecule of the virus is bigger than the filters. It is not yet certified for COVID-19 because every single manufacturer is seeking COVID-19 certification, so there is a long waiting list. If the mask is used 10 hours a day, the HEPA filters can be used for an entire month. Another advantage is that it is possible to do sports with it. This mask can significantly protect users from viruses. Our mask is the one in the market that offers the most protection, and it is extremely comfortable to wear.</p><h4>During our talk two years ago, you mentioned that B2C business is larger than B2B, the latter occupying 20% of the total. The company's goal is to reach 50% by 2025. What is your strategy to achieve it?</h4><p>We are implementing several strategies. We are entering some businesses, such as vehicle component, and we are already the largest manufacturer of batteries for electric vehicles, having 27% global market share. That is a massive business. The B2B segment is focused on consumer electronics, including solar panels, and we have a strong portfolio of products to digitalize business. We are the leaders in the use of air-based heaters for homes, which are a new evolution in the portfolio of products to keep our houses warm. This can heat water for showers or used to heat homes. This helps us significantly reduce the carbon footprint and generates savings of up to 60% in monthly bills. In Spain, B2C is 25% of our sales, and by 2050 we want it to represent 50%.</p><h4>What differentiates LG from its competitors in B2B?</h4><p>In terms of R&amp;D investment, the main developer of air conditioners records sales as high as our total R&amp;D investment. That R&amp;D investment allows us to obtain a significant advantage in the market. We have been present in Spain for 25 years, and that differentiates us, because not all companies have been present in this market for this long. On average, in each Spanish home there are about four LG products; that is how big our market penetration is. People have refrigerators, cellphones, or TVs from LG. LG has a strong market position because it offers better guarantees than others. We are radically against the so-called market obsolesce; the best product is one that lasts for years. If someone buys a refrigerator that lasts 30 years, that means it is a great product.</p><h4>Smart Green is an LG initiative to plant 47 million trees, using drones, smart seeds, and big data. How has Smart Green evolved since 2019, and what is the support of public administrations?</h4><p>LG is one of the five largest companies in the world in terms of green investment; we invest heavily in developing electrical products that are efficient in energy terms. Our goal is to ensure that all electrical products in the market are energy efficient. Our products are among the most efficient in the market in every single category. If you compare our portfolio of products with that of our competitors, we are the most efficient. We also sell some solar power panels, which also have storage capacity. The principal element to protect the environment in the short term is to remove the CO2 currently in the atmosphere, and that will be for the next 20 years. To remove that CO2, we need to plant billions of trees, and that would give humanity time to change the economy into a more sustainable model. We will have to make that change as soon as possible; the more time we take, the worse the conditions will be. One of the steps that we must take to reduce CO2 emissions is to reduce consumption; we are consuming at an unsustainable speed, so we should give nature some room to recover. I have been saying we need to make these changes since 2017. We will experience dire consequences because of our current consumption rate model. I hope the CEOs of other companies will start to take action within their businesses to collaborate in this area, which has been traditionally done by social corporate responsibility efforts. Social corporate responsibility should be a core part of a company, because firms should provide products and services for customers that improve the world. Technology-related companies have the capacity to move fast, so we are an important player to achieve this change. We should not just develop products, but contribute to create a better world. I would like more of my competitors to join me in this change. The time is now. I hope that more companies will start to develop initiatives to heal the environment. It could be planting trees or protecting wildlife, for example.</p><h4>What companies are part of the Smart Green initiative?</h4><p>About 180 companies are interested in participating. These companies have come to our headquarters. And 10 companies participated in our last tree planting project, which took place in Extremadura. The Smart Green project seeks to plant trees by using drones in order to reach areas that are difficult to access. In addition, the movement calls for city halls to individually participate in a tree planting day. Right now, if we want to mitigate the effects of climate change, we should start by planting trees.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main highlights for Al Faisal Holding in 2019 and the first half of 2020 and how do see your businesses evolving in the medium-term?</h4><p>Over the past year, Al Faisal Holding has conducted a transformation process to redefine our corporate roadmap, introducing a new organisational and operational model which is aligned with our evolving business requirements and which should ensure continuity and growth. In terms of operational development, Al Faisal Holding has achieved organic growth within its existing businesses and has successfully expanded into new sectors. For example, ARTIC, our fully owned subsidiary focused on investments in the hospitality sector with a portfolio of over 28 hotels worldwide, opened six hotels in 2019. Three of these are in Doha (Swiss-Belinn Doha, JW Marriott Marquis City Centre Doha, and DoubleTree by Hilton Doha Al Sadd), two are in Turkey (Sheraton Istanbul City Center and JW Marriott Istanbul Bosporus) and one is in Hurghada, Egypt (Hilton Hurghada Plaza). Our Trading Cluster added Djula Jewelry Qatar to its portfolio, while our Project Management and Construction Cluster welcomed The Qatari Modern Maintenance Company. Elsewhere, our Manufacturing Cluster saw an increase in our investments in Frijns Structural Steel Middle East and other entities. Al Faisal Holding will always seek to fulfil growing market demands by introducing innovative services and products.</p><h4>Last year you shared with us your commitment to 2030 Qatar National Vision, which is at the core of all Al Faisal Holding's projects and activities. What will be the most exciting projects for Al Faisal Holding in the next few years and how will you contribute through them to the achievement of the four pillars of 2030 QNV?</h4><p>Throughout our journey over the past 55 years, our commitment to being a leading contributor towards the progress and wellbeing of our community through promoting innovation in education, culture, health and business has remained an unwavering, fundamental objective for me personally and for Al Faisal Holding as an organization. Within our operations are embedded the four pillars of QNV 2030 (economic development, social development, human development, and environmental development). For example, through our Culture, Education, Leisure, and Sport Cluster we focus on promoting high quality education, sports and culture through Stenden University Qatar, Gulf English School, FBQ Sports Academy, Al Faisal Without Boarders Foundation, Al Samriya Riding School, and Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani Museums. We are always looking to empower the people of Qatar to be able to support our country's growth, an approach which requires continuous efforts and investment.</p><h4>The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted international supply chains and has forced many businesses to turn their backs on international opportunities and focus instead on their local markets through digital channels. What digital and innovative strategies have you adopted to maintain business as usual during the crisis and how do you balance your expansion strategy between the local Qatari market and international markets in the short-term?</h4><p>Our businesses have adapted well to the current situation, applying the right measures to protect employees and all stakeholders through social distancing measures, sanitization and increased awareness of safety guidelines. Several businesses under our Company have shifted to online operations, such as hotels where customers have been able to continue to order their preferred food, and Ebn Sina pharmacies which were able to join an online application (Rimads) where customers can order the medicine from the comfort of their own home. In addition, it was truly a pleasure to witness how our education institutions, Stenden University and Gulf English School, were able to deliver a digital education. It is also worth mentioning that we are applying Oracle software technology throughout all our operations.</p><h4>What in Al Faisal Holding's assessment are the sectors that should lead Qatar's diversification efforts and what will be the role of big private conglomerates to push this strategy forward?</h4><p>The sectors to lead Qatar's diversification efforts are the non-hydrocarbon industries such as industrial manufacturing, technology and innovative services. Through delivering excellence and innovation, as well as high quality products and services, Al Faisal Holding's diversified business model across eight clusters will continue to contribute to Qatar's diversification efforts as the private sector plays a significant role in diversifying the country's revenue streams and acts as a strong partner to achieve the Government's objectives.</p><h4>What are your most immediate strategic priorities for 2020 and 2021?</h4><p>Our immediate strategic objectives for the coming period are to conduct digital transformation among our business operations to ensure efficiency, continuity, and safety. We will also continue as well to explore new opportunities that can add value to Al Faisal Holding and all our stakeholders. I am confident that we will be able to mitigate the undesirable effects of the pandemic by having the right strategies in place. We have a solid foundation and a strong financial position that will help us to navigate the rest of 2020 and 2021 with confidence and resilience.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have things changed for SEU since the pandemic began?</h4><p>SEU was established nine years ago as an electronic university, and adopted e-learning strategies, methodologies and technologies in education with the mission to provide flexible and quality education to students, efficiently, and to scale education beyond time and geographic barriers. So we have always invested in building digital infrastructure, faculty member e-learning skills and strategies. We already had courses that are digitalized and electronic. We have been doing remote learning for years. The sudden halt of face-to-face activities due to COVID-19 was not a huge disruptor for SEU, and we seamlessly switched to a completely virtual environment. During this period, we saw a sudden increase in demand for our programs and services, and trust in the resilience and reliability of this new model of education and its ability to ensure education continuity during crises. Our role has not only been to provide services to students, but also to other educational institutions that have always had a traditional environment and are now moving toward a virtual one.</p><h4>SEU has significant expertise in e-learning that gained new relevance when lockdowns became a way of life. How have you worked to share knowledge to benefit the nation?</h4><p>We have been working with the universities as well as the Minister of Education on assessing the online learning experience through providing daily reports on the performance of universities in this new digital environment. We have also worked with the technology companies and commissions on increasing the communication bandwidth and the number of servers to meet the sudden increase in usage. When it comes to students, our students were already familiar with a remote learning environment, so we did not face issues. One issue that yet to be resolved to date is online assessment. Assessing students electronically while maintaining a reliable proctoring system that ensures there is no cheating is a challenge. However, we are currently working on testing best practices in this area, which involves both human and AI proctoring in a hybrid model. Recently we have launched a center of innovation in e-learning to gather and package our nine years experience in e-learning and offer services to others in the form of training, technology, and consultancy.</p><h4>How has the pandemic affected demand for your courses?</h4><p>SEU was always providing high quality learning. 84% of SEU graduates are employed, 85% of employers are highly satisfied with SEU graduates, more than 40% of graduates received promotion after graduation, are ranked second place in KSA standardized exams. E-learning and distance learning can achieve high quality learning, affordable and reliable when controlled with the proper quality criteria. With the pandemic, trust and acceptance have significantly changed, while the quality of our systems have persisted. Government, students and employers are now perceiving electronic learning as the future of learning, which created an increase in the demand for SEU programs and services translated in many and various strategic partnerships with government and semi-government institutes, and positioned SEU as an electronic learning house of experience and center of excellence in KSA.</p><h4>How has the uptake in demand for your services and courses changed your strategy? Are you in the process of scaling up to accept more applicants? </h4><p>SEU has developed a completely new strategy to adapt to the new normal. The strategy focuses on expanding horizontally to cover new market segments and regions, and vertically to offer academic programs that meets the fast changes in labour market driven by emerging global and local trends and the pandemic. SEU is taking a firmer stance on promoting quality e-learning, adopting advanced technologies and innovation in learning to ensure education sustainability and support economic development of KSA various regions, and building international and local partnerships to support delivering quality education efficiently and effectively. In addition, our new business model focuses on increasing SEU revenue streams and optimizing current operations to achieve financial sustainability.</p><h4>Do you believe that the future of education will be more digital, and what does that mean for your business?</h4><p>Prior to the pandemic, the education sector was one of least disrupted by technology. COVID-19 has accelerated the digital transformation in almost all sectors including higher education, and it will redefine the mission of the university and the philosophy of education. There is no doubt that digital transformation in education is here to stay, and there is no better time for rethinking the future of higher education than today, as the world seems to have realized that quality and affordable education are not associated with buildings but with the digital infrastructure that supports scalability, efficiency and resilience and reliable , and with the global and local partnerships that supports sharing, producing and exchanging knowledge and skills. The pandemic has created awareness and trust in electronic learning which will shape SEU's new strategy and change its role from being only a digital consumer and service provider of education, into a digital creator and enabler to other educational institutes in their transition to online learning, and the importance of staying ahead of the curve in digital education, to fulfill its mission in providing access and guaranteeing opportunity to quality and efficient education to all market segment.</p><h4>How much of this shift on e-learning will be permanent?</h4><p>The world after COVID-19 is unlikely to return to the world that was before. The rise of digital behavior such as remote learning, working, shopping, socializing, telemedicine, and delivery services, will most probably shape the society and businesses. Businesses have learned a big lesson during COVID-19. The economic impact and the change in user behaviour caused by COVID-19 will force business to rethink their business models towards being more productive, efficient, accessible and sustainable.  Adopting fully featured, enterprise-wide and resilient reliable technology strategy is no longer an option for businesses. We are doing the same. The future carries many opportunities for SEU, and we plan to capture them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the pandemic shifted the core priorities of development finance and how has ICD adapted to this new situation?</h4><p>I think what we are going to emerge from  this era with a stronger focus on our business, this means reaching out and understanding  SMEs which  are the best fit for our resilience targets, and ensuring  SDG compatibility. Islamic Development Bank Group (IsDBG) has set a USD2.3 billion of funding target focusing solely on COVID related transactions, of which we as ICD have earmarked a total of USD250 million. This includes our line of finance that are currently being provided as funding for financial institutions for on-lending to SMEs, which have been  affected greatly by the pandemic. We believe in partnering with local financial institutions because they are on the ground in the countries that we operate in. In this regard, they do a much better analysis and are more well-versed and equipped in understanding their local markets. These local financial institutions ensure that lending is monitored correctly, undertake collections and facilitate redistribution to other SMEs that can benefit the most from our funding.</p><h4>How has the attitude towards Islamic Finance changed during the crisis?</h4><p>Shariah-compliant or Islamic banking has witnessed significant growth over the years and will continue edging toward the mainstream moving forward. There is a growing demand and a pressing need for Shariah-compliant financial solutions in our member countries. Globally, interest toward ethical and impactful investments focused on serving the needs of inclusive and sustainable economic development has also increased, specifically in 2021—in essence, this is the crux of Islamic finance. Increasingly global financial institutions, such as JPMorgan, Citibank, and others, are now also focusing more on SDG- related transactions. Nowadays Green Sukuk are also becoming an attractive source of funding, as the willingness of many investment funds to invest in these instruments confirms that environmentally friendly transactions are gaining popularity. By doing so, they reduce the cost of funding that they are willing to accept, which makes a great difference. Also emerging now is the understanding of how Shariah-compliant trusts work. For example, the city of Riyadh has more than USD100 billion worth of trusts, and this can provide additional support and funding as needed. The other thing is the Zakat, which is the Shariah-compliant taxation is also now becoming more and more active. It will be interesting to see how it could become more of a support during  a pandemic as the one we are in the midst of currently in certain member countries.</p><h4>When you make loans to financial institutions in member countries are those loans to SMEs labeled Shariah compliant financial products?</h4><p>Yes, our partner financial institutions mainly focus on Shariah-compliant funding. They announce to the client that they are providing the financing as a Shariah compliant structure because that is what clients are demanding in our member countries.</p><h4>Where does the sukuk fit in your overall financing strategy and how have you planned to use those funds?</h4><p>The Sukuk which that we have issued recently is the largest in ICD's history. It was successful despite being in the midst of the pandemic, and the demand was high. The book was oversubscribed three times, including orders from joint lead managers. It attracted participation by 37 international and regional investors, and this is a testament to the strength of our business. Investors are confident regarding ICD's credit story and our initiatives in promoting private sector activities, as well as our new strategy which we have been working on diligently over the past three years. Additionally,, the capital raising will support ICD's development activities including advisory projects which create competition, entrepreneurship, employment opportunities and export potential among our 55-member countries; while, encouraging the development of Islamic finance activities such as debt, equity and capital markets. In the future, we look forward to engaging in blended finance transactions, given its potential in supporting the global development agenda. For example, let's say we target USD100 million in funding, and meanwhile a project in a member country required one billion. We would be part of a syndicate and provide one billion to those transactions by issuing a Sukuk. Our USD100 million becomes one of the subscribers and this ensures that the transaction is known globally, and that there is continuity in the relationship, in turn making sure also that we have a bigger impact with our USD100 million. That is what we would like to focus on more in the future, and with that approach we will be increasing our fee income as an institution, and we as ICD also then become much more sustainable.</p><h4>What are your thoughts as an organization on the rating changes from Fitch, which issued a downgrade recently? </h4><p>We, as an organization, throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic have been active in providing the right funding. We wanted to make sure that we restructure the credit rating of our clientele base and ensure that we enhance our overall rating. I believe Fitch is comfortable with that approach, and if we can show them a strong outcome next year then they might consider raising our rating. The good thing is that Moody's and S&amp;P have maintained our rating, and that we have been able to ensure that the global view of our organization is stable. On the other side, I personally believe we are in a high-risk business, we are supposed to do our job and we are supposed to go out and provide funding for SMEs and really support the market the way it should be. So, I am not that concerned that we will see a major slide in the rating, although we are not complacent. It is worth taking care of the markets that we are supposed to take care of, but we also plan to continue supporting higher risk SMEs. It is a challenge not just for us, but for the countries that we are active in and for countries all around the world.</p><h4>Is there a fundamental shift in strategy for managing risk in the future?</h4><p>Non-performing loans is an important consideration for us and we have enhanced our relationship with institutions that we are dealing with, and who now have a better rating themselves. We remain keen to support SMEs as it is an important part of our mandate and therefore will not shy away from that strategy. It is important for us to look at transactions that are found throughout our member countries, and which are PPP. We also make sure to consider certain beneficial equity transactions. This ensures we are investing our money where we believe it will be a best fit for some of the member countries we operate in. We are more careful now than before by not engaging in greenfield transactions, instead focusing more on brownfield initiatives. This means private equity, where the proposition is proven and sustainable. When we come in, we can quantum leap them to the next level, thereby adding substantial value.</p><h4>What projects are you looking for and what do you hope to accomplish in the coming year?</h4><p>We have revisited our business plan and made sure it is aligned with the potential outcomes of the Covid-19 Pandemic, both in terms of the positives and negatives. People think Covid-19 has only been negative but the positive side is also there in cost savings on travel, while we have also become much more efficient, with much more targeted funding and a sharper evaluation of potential transactions to meet actual needs. Our effectiveness, then, is set to increase and reach more of our targets. The pandemic has also advanced ICD's digitalization aspirations, whereby we have meaningfully transformed the way we do business. The post pandemic way of life will involve the continued support of SMEs and we want to make sure that we help those countries which are in greatest need.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What distinguishes Tamkeen Technologies from other Information Technology (IT) companies in terms of services?€¨</h4><p>One of the key things that distinguishes us from our competitors is that we hire as many Saudi nationals, male and female, as possible and give them an environment where they can be productive and empowered. In recognition of this we are now independently classified as one of the best places to work in Saudi Arabia. We understand that our society is going through a transformation to achieve Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, but the major part of any transformation is technology, and without it, most of these ambitious initiatives will not be possible. Our role is to help our clients achieve this goal through the use of technology. We brand ourselves as the “Trusted and Preferred Digital Technology Partner for Sustainable Growth“ for our clients and Tamkeen Technologies is proud that an essential part of our mission is to be: Innovative, Committed, Passionate, Transparent and Empowering to our employees, clients and customers. We are well-known in the market for our ability to rapidly create innovative technology solutions built primarily on open-source technologies, combined with our talented workforce of Saudi IT professionals, makes Tamkeen Technologies a trusted and preferred IT partner. Since we are a government-owned company, our primary mandate is to help the public sector reach its goals, however, we also are also committed to help the local private sector grow and prosper.</p><h4>What are Tamkeen's efforts in developing the young talent that are now arising in the sector?</h4><p>We are committed to developing talent. We understand that exceptional talent is rarer than capital and that's one of the reasons, why we have a generous budget for training and upskilling all of our employees. Generally, employers seek people with experience, and Tamkeen is no different in this regard, however, we believe in the talents of our young Saudi fresh graduates and to this extent we have developed and launched an On The Job Training (OJT) program in the summer of 2019. This allows us to train new graduates in a manner that treats trainees are as actual employees and given real tasks and responsibilities. After three to six months, they acquire real work experience and new skills and those that perform well are offered full time contracts. As part of this program , each of the trainees receives a certificate of experience upon successful completion of the training program. </p><h4>How does Tamkeen try to empower women in the sector?€¨</h4><p>We currently have a female employment rate of 37% and plan to keep or increase this rate in the coming years. We have also developed programs that allow women to work from home by using them as tele-workers, or Customer Care agents. We entered the Customer Care sector not only to provide superior service for our products and services but also to provide quality sustainable jobs in rural areas; which is one of the ways we balance business results and corporate social responsibility. We have found these women to be quite dedicated and talented. Additionally, we have participated in the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development's program to develop a new generation of women leaders in the IT field and a number of our talented female staff have participants in this great initiative.</p><h4>€¨What is Tamkeen's main focus today in accordance with the Kingdom's Vision 2030?</h4><p>€¨IT is a key element in most of the Vision 2030 programs. Without the use of the latest technologies, you will not be able to build affordable homes, provide high quality jobs, or create a striving tourism industry. IT is everywhere, and that is why Tamkeen Technologies believes it can help the sponsors of these programs to achieve their goals. We are working with all government agencies that need our IT services, especially those agencies who are interested in creating self-sustainable program which leverages our ability to build robust IT solutions at no cost to our clients in exchange for allowing us to offer commercially viable paid value-added services. </p><h4>€¨How do you keep up with innovation trends, progress, and development in the IT sector, with its growing competition? </h4><p>We actively participate in local, regional and international industry events. Additionally, due to the large number of talented young employees in the company we are lucky to have a constant supply of creative new ideas, which we gladly encourage and support. Although we haven't gone into incubators officially; we do, however, try to identify problems in the sectors we target, then look for creative solutions to solve these problems by building solutions to test them within Tamkeen Technologies and at the premises of our clients to determine if they are suitable on a try before you buy basis. Using this approach, we have developed a Smart Attendance system, an Appointments System and even a Strategy monitoring tool to name a few. In addition, we try to leverage previously built solutions, systems, and components such as our marketplace solution or our licensing tool to address the needs of new clients in new sectors. </p><h4>€¨What are the sectors that Tamkeen has identified as an investment opportunity to expand?</h4><p>€¨While we currently work heavily with Labor, Human Resource Development, Health and Culture, we are also expanding our offerings in the areas of Social Development, Education, and Housing with a specific focus on developing our own products in these sectors.</p><h4>What will cloud technology and AI bring to the Kingdom's productivity?€¨</h4><p>These are high potential technologies which we believe will flourish in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, hence we are working under the guidelines of the regulatory bodies such as: the Commission for Information Technology and Communication (CITC) and the Saudi Authority for Data and Artificial Intelligence (SADAI) to develop solutions for our clients using these technologies and as a result have obtained a Cloud Service Provider license from CITC. €¨What are Tamkeen's next strategic steps for the year ahead?€¨We will be introducing more Tamkeen-branded products in 2021, with a specific focus on helping our clients reduce their IT budgets by fully utilizing our self-sustainable programs, migrating to open-source technologies, and replacing inefficient internal or outsourced IT activities with our “Managed Services“ offering which spans Application Development, Infrastructure Operations, and Customer Care. In 2021we plan to radically enhance how we interact with our clients and customers by making excellence and delighting our customers the core of what we do. </p><h4>The pandemic has pushed the entire economy online, creating new challenges but also new opportunities. How has your business changed in the past year?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia started working to build its digital economy a long time ago. Its citizens enjoy the benefits of numerous e-government services. Government agencies that have a robust and advanced online offering have been able to engage more efficiently and actively with citizens during the Covid-19 pandemic, which further exerts pressure on areas in which improvements in e-government services can be made. Having said that, citizens have become more tech-savvy and demanding in both the public and private sector and have been pushing them to provide even more of their services online in a secure and user-friendly manner. As a leading technology solutions provider in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Tamkeen Technologies has been approached by many government agencies and private sector companies to help them cater to this new demand.</p><h4>What are your expectations and ambitions for 2021?</h4><p>At Tamkeen Technologies we expect there are numerous opportunities ahead to further development and innovation in providing local products and services. As an IT leader we believe we have a clear responsibility to play a key role in making the Saudi Arabian society a leader in the use of information technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>
