		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Level 5 Holding evolve into the advertising empire that it is today?<br></h4><p>I started in 1992 with an ad agency, while I was in my second year at  the American University of Beirut (AUB), and then shifted in 1996 to a media house, Espaces. In 1999, I founded Tree Ad with my former partner and up until then, we were doing classic regular media sales, and nothing else. Then, in the early 2000s, we ventured into retail when we acquired the franchise for Lebanon of Eden Park, the renowned French clothing, accessories, and home decoration brand. In 2004, we started consolidating the business, and established the holding company that would connect all the dots and allow us to grow further. We, therefore, founded Level 5 Holding and the latter fully acquired Tree Ad and Ligne Bleue (the franchisee of Eden Park), and then served as a legal and financial platform for our other ventures.</p><h4>How did you look to broaden the activities of the company?</h4><p>I am a firm believer in seizing opportunities and focusing on the “who" before the “what." Following the consolidation process, we got the opportunity to develop a beach resort in Jiyeh. We knew very little about beaches, but it looked like a great opportunity financially. So we branched out, adding hospitality to advertising and retail as a third pillar of Level 5 Holding's scope of work. We opened Orchid Beach Resort in 2006 one month before the Israeli-Lebanese War; nevertheless, it quickly became a success story. It might be the entity of the group that I am most proud of, as we have succeeded in making Orchid more than a beach resort; it is a destination and a franchise-able concept. We are now working on a new beach resort Orchid Batroun with a total investment of $1.5 million.</p><h4>How is the advertising side of the business progressing?</h4><p>From 2007 onwards, we started consolidating Tree Ad, our main advertising business. We succeeded in less than seven to eight years in increasing Tree Ad's revenues over 10-fold, mainly by venturing into the outdoor industry and afterwards in print. Lately, we also moved toward TV as well. When we started the outdoor business, we had around four or five major suppliers that were under exclusive contracts with us. Between 2008 and 2009, we started acquiring these suppliers, and founded a company called Viacom that today owns the majority of the outdoor panels that Tree Ad sells, a kind of vertical integration for our business.</p><h4>What are the most important emerging markets for you?</h4><p>Our strategy is to look for opportunities irrespective of where they are. However, the natural evolution of our advertising arm is in the Levant region, whereas we aim for the Gulf for our retail operation. In 2007, Iraq was emerging from the war, and it did not have a structure for advertising flows. Noticing that there were international and multinational clients in Iraq that nobody was serving, we established Tree Ad Iraq. We started our operation there as a media-buying unit, although this is not our core business. We succeeded in doing business in Iraq for three or four years, but things slowed down as the political situation got worse. We now focus on outdoor advertising and have transformed the media-buying unit into a regular media representative, the way we do in Lebanon and Syria as well.</p><h4>What is the future for Tree Ad, and how do you intend to maintain your share of the market?</h4><p>Thanks to Tree Ad's credibility we are always being approached by media looking to expand their business. We are brand builders who focus on the positioning of the medium and its image, we also help develop and implement new marketing strategies for each medium to ensure its utmost success and growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the responsibilities of Ashghal in advancing the country?</h4><p><span></span>Ashghal was established as an autonomous body in 2004. It is responsible for delivering and managing infrastructure and public buildings of national importance in order to transform the country, drive socio-economic growth, and enhance Qatar's position as a developing global destination. Aligned to the Qatar National Vision 2030, Ashghal's 2011-2018 corporate strategy sets a clear vision and mission, and it aims to develop a more dynamic, responsive, and customer centric organization. That strategy saw the appointment of consultants who have assisted in starting three key Ashghal programs: the Expressway Programme, which will deliver more than 30 expressway projects; the Local Roads and Drainage Programme, which will deliver more than 200 roads and infrastructure projects across Qatar in the next five to seven years; and the Inner Doha Re-Sewerage Implementation Strategy (IDRIS), which will upgrade and expand the sewerage infrastructure to accommodate the projected population growth in the south catchment area of Doha. These programs are well underway and making steady progress. Over the last year, the authority has been working to convert roundabouts to signal controlled intersections. In addition, various existing roads are being upgraded across the country to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion.</p><h4>Outside of infrastructure, what are some of the significant projects that Ashghal is currently working on?</h4><p>Ashghal is not just involved in infrastructure projects of national importance. Its remit also includes a number of buildings projects that serve local communities. Ashghal has been working with the relevant Qatari authorities on significant building projects that include healthcare, educational, and general sector projects. Ashghal is currently constructing educational buildings distributed across the country's various villages and suburbs. At the start of this academic year, Ashghal completed 13 schools and eight kindergartens in Doha and surrounding areas. The authority is actively contributing to the development of the healthcare sector with more than seven healthcare centers under construction, in addition to Hamad Medical City, which is scheduled for completion in 2015. Back in 2013, we also announced some key projects for construction, including the final concept master plan for Qatar Zoo, which will position Qatar on the global stage.</p><div class="quote">“Ashghal's 2011-2018 corporate strategy sets a clear vision and mission."</div><h4>How do you organize your business to maintain an overview and ensure efficiency?</h4><p>Delivering on Ashghal's strategy depends on its people and processes. I am very glad that over the last few years we have put more attention and investment into developing and enhancing the skills of our greatest assets—our employees. We began a Corporate Succession-Planning program, and also started an Individual Development Plan in addition to our scholarship program for employees and students. This is further to our strategy of knowledge sharing to gain the best out of our partnerships with industry leaders and apply best practices. We have also made significant progress internally in terms of streamlining Ashghal's business processes and improving our systems. We started using an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to automate processes, in addition to launching our Inteqal Programme, which focuses on people, processes, technology, and business. We are truly transforming as an organization to meet our strategic goals of being more responsive, dynamic, and customer centric, and our recently launched new brand encapsulates the heritage of our past, the achievements of our present, and the aspirations for our future. To capitalize on a more customer centric approach, we also launched our new Contact Centre and revamped website, which both serve to ensure Qatar is informed of all that we are doing.</p><h4>Ashghal partners with world leading international firms in its projects here in Qatar. What are the requirements that a foreign company needs to comply with in order to be considered?</h4><p>"Qatar Deserves The Best" is the slogan that Ashghal has adopted as its mantra. The process of selecting contracting companies is done based on certain conditions and criteria that take into account important factors such as quality, safety, expertise, as well as capability and commitment to implementation within the set schedule. Ashghal operates an open and transparent compulsory competitive tendering process whereby tenders are advertised on its website and in relevant publications. With major projects, Ashghal also holds pre-tender briefings to ensure companies are aware of the tender requirements for each stage of the project. Based on the value and scale of the projects, our tendering process includes clear categories for eligibility of companies who can apply. Currently there are four categories that include eligibility for Qatari companies only, for joint venture companies, non-Qatari companies, and international and local consultants. Ashghal's requirements for companies to be eligible to tender are determined by value and a quality based assessment system. We do and will continue to encourage all international, regional, and local firms to take part in our project bidding process and share their knowledge, expertise, and technical know-how in implementing some of the biggest infrastructure projects in the world.</p><h4>What trends and evolutions have you noticed in the public works sector over the past few years?</h4><p>In recent years we have seen much more collaboration between the public and private sectors, and more partnerships with private, local, and international companies. As our construction works expand across roads, expressways, drainage and building sectors, there are a lot more opportunities becoming available for infrastructure companies. More and more international consulting and contracting companies are entering Qatar, which is now home to some of the largest and technologically advanced infrastructure projects not only in the region, but worldwide. With this increase in the pace of construction, there is a major emphasis on the safety and quality of projects being implemented. Starting from design, construction, and delivery, to the operations and maintenance stage of projects, stringent and comprehensive safety measures are being applied and adhered to. Another recent trend in the Middle East is a growth in the application of global best practices. Everyone is trying to learn from different markets and apply the best practices they find, and Ashghal is no different.</p><h4>What opportunities exist for these partnership projects in Qatar during the run-up to the World Cup in 2022?</h4><p>Our current model is easier than the conventional PPP model. Many opportunities exist to partner with private sector companies and we have already done this with many local and international companies. Ashghal is working on projects worth approximately $30 billion in the coming five to seven years. Therefore, we are always looking to partner with the best companies in Qatar and the world to deliver state-of-the-art projects and infrastructure for Qatar ahead of the FIFA World Cup in 2022; whether this is in terms of design, construction, or the operation and maintenance of our projects.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Even though the Dominican Republic is one of the fastest growing economies in its region, with average 5.7% GDP growth over the past two decades, poverty remains a core issue. What initiatives have to be taken to improve the conditions of those in greatest need?</h4><p>If there is one message regarding the Dominican Republic, it is that it has truly been a high flyer and an achiever in terms of economic growth for the region. From 1991 to 2013, it has been growing at 5.7% per year. In 2011, GDP per capita was 50% above that of 2000 whereas in Latin America, on average, GDP per capita rose 26% over the same period. The Dominican Republic, along with Panama and Peru, has been among the most rapidly growing economies in the region in recent years. The difference between the region and here is that the Dominican Republic's high growth rate has not led to the same level of poverty reduction. Whereas in Latin America more than 70 million people have been lifted out of poverty since 2003, here in the Dominican Republic we have a poverty rate today exceeding that of 2000. Four out of 10 Dominicans still live in poverty, and almost one in 10 live in extreme poverty. Therefore, there is still clearly much work to do in spite of the high growth rates to generate more and better jobs for faster poverty reduction.</p><h4>What is the World Bank's role in supporting development in the country?</h4><p>We have many roles as the World Bank, the first being a trusted advisor and a provider of knowledge services, that the government can turn to and count on, bringing insights from experiences in other countries that the government can then use to determine the program it wants to put in place. The second role that we play concerns financing development projects with a focus on better services and opportunities for the poor. Third, we provide support in such areas as bringing together or convening different actors, both nationally and internationally, to exchange ideas. Development is about new ways of thinking and it is about change; hence we often focus on supporting governments in achieving reform and thinking through how to go about that. The Bank, therefore, aims to bring a blend of knowledge, financing, and convening services, as a trusted advisor and support to the government. The World Bank Group's key mission is the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030 on a global level, meaning no more than 3% of people around the world living in extreme poverty by 2030. This is consistent with the government's own vision of just 2% or less of the Dominican population living in extreme poverty by 2030. Our second objective as the World Bank Group is to support shared prosperity. It isn't enough for us for average GDP to rise; it is important that the income of the poorest 40% in the economy rises too. All our work is aligned to achieving these two objectives.</p><div class="quote">“The Dominican Republic is one of the two economies that introduced the most reforms in the Caribbean region in recent years."</div><h4>What is your assessment of the achievements of the Dominican government in that regard?</h4><p>The vision for 2030 is a state vision, a vision of the people, and a vision that has been developed in consultation with thousands of Dominicans. It is a vision that has been enacted into law and goes beyond any given government, and hopefully will guide all administrations between now and 2030. I think there are certain areas where clear progress is being made; one important area is social protection. If we go back to 2003-2004, there was no social safety net in place at the time of the severe banking and macroeconomic crisis. Inflation rose, real wages did not keep up, unemployment rose, poverty climbed from 32% to almost 50%, and there was no safety net to protect the poor. Yet, today there is a social safety net in place that reaches over 800,000 Dominican households, and at a reasonably low cost as a share of GDP. Moreover, an increasing share of this program is being carefully targeted, and more importantly being conditional on actions that increase the human capital of the poor and strengthen their health and the education of their children, so that it isn't just a handout but rather an investment in human capital.</p><h4>In the newly released Doing Business Report, the Dominican Republic was in 84th place. Could you interpret the result of the rankings as well as the country's performance over recent years?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is one of the two economies that introduced the most reforms in the Caribbean region in recent years. Only Jamaica has done more. The Dominican Republic advanced significantly during the 2005-2009 period and has again taken several steps recently to strengthen its position. The Dominican Republic ranks 84th in the world among 189 economies. It is encouraging that the Dominican Republic is focusing on strengthening the investment climate, and indeed it has a dynamic program underway to continue strengthening its reforms, particularly through the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development, but also through several other entities within the state and the private sector. In fact, it took steps in the past year to reduce the number of forms needed for importing and exporting and that contributed to its strong position. There are other areas where it took steps this past year; for example, to protect personal information through Law 172-13, which was important because that affects credit information and, therefore, access to credit. In addition, the country has taken steps to strengthen the laws relating to transparency, governance, and the protection of minority shareholders. In the area of trading across borders, the Dominican Republic is now in 24th, and, therefore, among the top countries in the world. It is also among the top 50% in the world in 6 out of 10 indicators. The new Doing Business report 2015 introduced an important concept this year called 'distance to the frontier.' In 'distance to the frontier' you are looking at an absolute measure of how far you are from the best practice in the world on a given Doing Business indicator and on aggregate across all 10 indicators. The Dominican Republic is among the top one-third of countries in the world in 2014 in terms of its improvement on the aggregate Distance to the Frontier. At the same time, even in some of these areas in which the Dominican Republic ranks among the top 50%, such as protecting investors and getting access to credit, the distance to the frontier of best practice can still remain quite far; hence, further reforms could be undertaken to continue strengthening the investment climate. In terms of the reform agenda, there are other areas where the Dominican Republic does not yet rank as well as other economies; for example, on the costs related to insolvency or the time involved in getting access to electricity or the costs in terms of the capital requirements for starting a business, and the government is taking some important steps to strengthen these areas.</p><h4>What sectors of the Dominican economy hold the most potential for further development?</h4><p>From the perspective of poverty reduction, if we achieve growth but we are unable to improve the wellbeing of the poorest, we really have not helped as much as we might. One concern over the past decade was that in the rest of the region around 42% of people were upwardly mobile, rising from poor to vulnerable, from vulnerable to middle-income, or from middle-income to upper income, while in the Dominican Republic only 2% of the population moved up an income class. In fact one in five, 19%, moved down an economic class. So the real challenge is addressing the underlying cause of that. What we observe from Central Bank and other data is that there had been a large increase in productivity, which is 40% higher today than in 2000, but this has been accompanied by a decline in real wages. There are sectors that have done well in growth terms, such as telecommunications, which rose from 8% to 23% of the economy, and mining, which is been significant in terms of its contributions to growth and to improving the country's export performance. Yet, neither of these sectors has generated significant employment, while many jobs have been lost since 2004 in the Special Economic Zones. We have found that at the Latin American level, 70% of poverty reduction in the region was due to more and better jobs. The question for the Dominican Republic is, therefore, how one can generate more and better jobs here. This is what it comes down to fundamentally. The country has a number of areas of potential beyond the above-mentioned sectors, including tourism and agriculture. For example, the Cibao Valley is highly fertile, and there is tremendous potential for adding value to that agricultural production and generating more jobs by linking it more to global markets. This involves strengthening phytosanitary standards, grading, cold chains, storage facilities and financing for agriculture to get more high quality Dominican products into a global value chain, as well as investing in agri-business to generate greater added value and employment here in the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The new showroom was opened in 2012 and the expectation was to sell over 100 cars per year. Were these expectations fulfilled?</h4><p>Of course, we were very excited to open the showroom. In 2013, we met our expectations in sales. In 2014, we are on the same road again, and, naturally, we have brought some additional things to the market. For example, in 2014 we brought online a new service center, which contains state-of-the-art technology. It is enough to cope with all of the UAE's business and more. It provides fantastic expertise and facilities, and this is all new for the UAE. At the end of the day, it was one thing bringing cars in to sell; however, the most important thing is that the customers who have those cars know that they will be looked after. They need that piece of mind. Our expectation is to continue growing as we build up our reputation.</p><h4>What is the significance of the after-sales part of the business for the luxury car sector?</h4><p>It is an extremely significant part of business. As more cars are sold in the country and the region, it becomes even more important. People want to know that there is a business that can fix their car with fully trained technicians and genuine parts. They are looking for somewhere where they do not have to wait, they will be dealt with in a nice manner, and they are going to enjoy the experience. You are spending a lot of money on this car, and you want to be sure that the whole package is there. By making this investment, we can deliver what the customer expects, what the customer deserves, and what they should be getting. This is to the same standard as anywhere else in the world.</p><h4>What has been the key to your great success?</h4><p>Aston Martin now has 150 showrooms around the world. We were here about three years ago, but we closed for three years, and now we have reopened with a state-of-the-art, more boutique-type showroom in a strategic part of Dubai, next to Dubai Mall; it is really one of the top showrooms in the world. The key to success is a great brand. It is a fantastic car, and it has so much history. Last year was our 100th anniversary. We provide great products and it is a car that everybody desires; however, very few can afford it. Of course, we have our history with James Bond and every child's dream is to be James Bond and have his car. This is another reason why we are a well-known brand.</p><div class="quote">“We provide great products and it is a car that everybody desires."</div><h4>What is the strategy behind Aston Martin's decision to launch a limited edition of the Lagonda model?</h4><p>It is a limited edition of 200 cars that is exclusively for the Middle East, meaning nowhere else in the world can have this model. It came out of the success of the One77 Super Car that we did three years ago, which was a $2 million car. The value of this car will be in keeping with its exclusivity and final pricing will depend on the customers own unique bespoke configuration. We only made 77 One77s, and they sold out. We had substantial demand from the market for something that was more luxurious with more space, but still fast. This is going to be the finest of fast cars. It is quick and light because it is built from carbon fiber, meaning it is not like driving a tank. Plus, it comes with the luxury of size and you can put it in the class of a limousine. And the strategy is driven by local demand, which is why we are only going to sell it in the Middle East. It is a huge compliment to the region that Aston Martin, a global company, is able and willing to make something just for the Middle East. One of the reasons for this is that it is a small, dynamic company in the UK, and if the market base asks for something, as long as it is feasible, the company can turn it around quickly and deliver. On November 10, 2014, we are holding the global launch for Lagonda here in  in Dubai. How many other automotive companies would do a global launch in Dubai? This is the first of any that I can think of. This is strategically important for us, and we test the car in the Middle East to make sure it is suitable for the conditions. We expect this to be a reward for our loyal customer base at the end of the day. They are getting what they are asking for.</p><h4>What other products are you going to launch in 2014 and 2015?</h4><p>This is, of course, the major product for us. We have also released now, for 2015, a vastly improved eight-speed Vanquish and Rapide S, which is the next generation of these two products. Of course they exist today, but it will be the next stage. They are vastly different in terms of efficiency and in many other areas.</p><h4>What are the main features your clients look for when they come to your showroom?</h4><p>Ours is a niche and a luxury product; yet, more than anything, people are looking for a lifestyle. We already know that Aston Martin delivers a powerful and beautiful car. We have won many awards for having the most beautiful fast cars, but it also has soul. It is a lifestyle and it is a car you can drive every day. It is not something you just drive on the weekend because it is luxurious and comfortable to drive. At the same time, it is not something that everybody can have. That is important. It is part of the luxury lifestyle.</p><h4>Is there a difference between clients in the UAE and clients in the rest of the MENA region?</h4><p>I would say in the UAE there is a much larger expatriate population, and this can sometimes drive different expectations. We do see some differences within the region. Generally in the UAE, the customer base is willing to be more experimental with different colors and different Q designs, which means it is bespoke for the customer. They want the car to be one of a kind, with their signature on it. No other car is produced like this in terms of the selection of colors, and the accessories within the car, such as a gold or platinum finishing. They want to make the car more bespoke than perhaps customers in the rest of the region. Saying this, the whole region is different. In my view, they are an advanced customer. They all want something special and they are prepared to take the time to get the product that they really want. They may come to us with a color for example, from a material or any type of object, and ask for that to be used for their car. And we can deliver this.</p><h4>Are you planning to expand in the region in the medium term?</h4><p>As Aston Martin, we are expanding in the region. In 2015, we are looking to open four new showrooms regionally, as well as three new service centers. Planned investment across the region in terms of infrastructure is about $11 million.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main investments and development projects for Intelec in the field of telecommunications and energy?</h4><p>Intelec is a shareholder of Vodacom Moçambique, and I am chairman of the company. Intelec is the major component in our overall involvement in telecommunications. Yet we also invest in other telecommunications services companies, such as Questcom, which is the principle company for service solutions. In terms of energy, I launched Eletrosul, an engineering service for both public and private companies, back in 1990. Having identified key partners, we opened a cable manufacturing company in Mozambique. Eletrotec is now one of the main private companies providing major engineering services, such as the building of grids and power stations. We were the fastest growing company to have emerged from public tender in the 1998 to 1999 period through the World Bank and the government of Mozambique in the generation and management of natural gas. Our focus has always remained on being the key private sector company for power generation. We have contributed to the country; however, other players have also begun to establish their businesses here. The market is becoming competitive for us, which is essentially positive, and we are pleased with our contribution to national growth and employment.</p><h4>What would you say are the main agribusiness ventures of Intelec Holdings?</h4><p>Intelec Holding's focus is on creating and exploring local opportunities. Agriculture was not our main focus at the outset; however, we recognized that the country has high-quality land and a good water supply, as well as the required non-skilled manpower. We found excellent land and began growing soybeans and rice, which is now one of the most successful projects in the north, and moreover, a model for agriculture in the rest of the country. Together with our partners, we employ approximately 2,000 people. Our focus in the future will be on agricultural production and exports to Japan and wider Asia. There is currently considerable demand in the country, however, whereby all of our production goes to the local market.</p><div class="quote">“Intelec Holding's focus is on creating and exploring local opportunities."</div><h4>What is the status of your mining concession and how would you describe the industry in Mozambique?</h4><p>The mining sector increasingly revolves around multinationals. We won one of the five concessions that we had bid for, and then began looking for a strategic and technological partner in coal mining. We have already begun talks with a few agencies and potential partners about a joint effort to start exploring coal-mining prospects.</p><h4>What near-term priorities have you set for Intelec Holding?</h4><p>We will sell a number of firms, while we rebuild and amalgamate others to allow us to focus on areas such as energy and telecommunications and explore new business opportunities. We are looking at real estate, agriculture, and infrastructure, which is our main direction.</p><h4>How would you describe the role of the company in the socioeconomic development of the country?</h4><p>As a businessman my focus was always to leave a legacy and build the country. Intelec is important in Mozambique not only as one of the largest companies, but also because we have directly created over 2,500 jobs in Mozambique, while over the coming year several thousand new jobs will be created, thereby increasing our contribution to the broader economy and society. With three partners, we recently re-opened the largest textile manufacturer that had been closed for over 20 years. We have agreements to export to the US and are set to create over 750 direct jobs and indirectly support over 150 SMEs working with the factory. These will be anchored by our manufacturing operations and will create over 7,500 jobs with other small companies.</p><h4>Why should an investor select Mozambique as opposed to other countries in the region?</h4><p>Everything is available here for investors from infrastructure to fast-paced education and a good road system. We also have manpower; hence, if a company brings technology and training it can maximize its use of Mozambican workers. We also have fertile lands and water, as well as a strategic location on the western shore of the Indian Ocean. Mozambique has been growing for the past 15 years at a rate of 7% to 8% per annum, which clearly demonstrates a stable economy. Meanwhile, our strong democratic institutions are also an incentive to long-term investors.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of Intelec Holdings?</h4><p>As a major corporation, it is our duty to uphold the highest standards across all of our operations. Many companies are better capitalized than our own; however, they perhaps lack the same credibility and reputation that we enjoy. We want to be credible and to create a lasting connection and reputation with the business world and civil society. I hope that Mozambique can develop a more diversified economy. I do not believe in developing within an already established major industry, such as oil and gas, which is why we have focused on industry, agriculture, and value-added projects. We are also involved in water and waste treatment, working with smaller companies in this field. The oil and gas segment should add value to the processes of economic diversification, and will offer Intelec Holdings strong opportunities for sustained growth, in turn creating a sustainable corporation that will contribute to employment, while adding value to the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[time-to-branch-out]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the strategy behind acquiring Galas?</h4><p>We were already closely related. Convertidora Industrial and Galas conducted considerable business together, making for a natural fit for the group. We were one of the suppliers of Galas at that time; hence, with that purchase, we installed an integrated production line. We produce everything ourselves, and manage to serve Bimbo, as well as Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Grupo Modelo, and Heineken.</p><h4>Is Galas or Janel more important in terms of assets?</h4><p>They are about the same size, and are integrated. All of our production lines are integrated, from plastic pallets to finished products. We have adhesive tapes for industrial purposes, and also for commercial use. On this side of the business, our largest customers are retailers Wal-Mart, Chedraui, Soriana, and Office Max, in addition to various wholesalers and local distributors nationwide. We basically divide the business into two categories: industrial and commercial. They are both managed from my office. The industrial business generates a greater revenue.</p><div class="quote">“We are planning for growth in exports, and an expanded presence in other countries through acquisitions in the US and the EU."</div><h4>What trends have you recently observed in retailing in Mexico?</h4><p>The Mexican consumer has become more sophisticated over the past decade. We are a country traditionally motivated by price. Yet today, for Christmas products for example, the level of sophistication is striking, with demand for highly realistic trees, while the decorations consumed can readily be compared to those any market in Europe or the US. Customers are becoming more aware of quality and design.</p><h4>What impact will your new acquisition aimed at exporting plastic trees to the US have on your overall operations?</h4><p>We are currently working to consolidate the project, which involves the acquisition of a US company, and I hope to see this in place in 2015. Production in 2013 was at around 680,000 Christmas trees; however, I believe we have improved on this in 2014, at closer to 800,000 unit. Of our 20,000 SKUs, half are Christmas and decorative articles. As a group, 18% of our revenue derives from Christmas-themed products, which is substantial. Five customers account for 7% of those sales.</p><h4>What steps are you taking to make Galas-Janel a sustainable company?</h4><p>We have several products in the plastic and packaging side of the business that are biodegradable. All of our packaging for Bimbo degrades over time, and we have been doing this for two years now. We were the first company in Mexico to use such packaging, despite it being a global trend. Regulations are becoming tougher, and our major clients are focusing more on the sustainability of their products in order to develop alongside their customers who are demanding more sustainable practices. Around 99% of our production in Mexico is done at the eight production facilities we have in Mexico City, Toluca, and Monterrey.</p><h4>How important is innovation for your company?</h4><p>In 2014, we launched around 200 new products, while our 17 graphic designers constantly devise new ones, as we understand the need to innovate regularly.</p><h4>To which regions do you export your products?</h4><p>Our geographical position is an absolute privilege, with easy access to Central and South America from Mexico and the US. In addition, over the past couple of years, China has becoming less competitive, leading to greater interest from the US. I would say that Central and South America make up the bulk of our exports, followed Europe, the US, and Asia.</p><h4>What is the greatest challenge in selling into the US?</h4><p>Pricing remains the most significant challenge we face in doing this. In entering the US market, you are setting yourself up for direct competition with Chinese firms. In our segment, China is getting more competitive in terms of quality. However, our products have always been high quality, meaning this is not too much of an issue; the problem is related to rising expenses. Shipping our products from Asia is difficult, and it is also risky as you can only sell these products for two or three weeks of the year; therefore, if something goes wrong, the risk is relatively high.</p><h4>How much do you export?</h4><p>We export about 15% of the total, as a group, and our biggest exports are tapes and sticky notes. For now, therefore, most of our production is geared at the domestic market, although from now on, we will be focusing on exports as the Mexican is somewhat decelerated. Industry in general throughout the country is not growing as we would like it to; over the past couple of years, growth has been between 2% and 3%, which is inadequate, and it is natural for us to look to other markets.</p><h4>Where do you see the group in the next decade?</h4><p>We are planning for growth in exports, and an expanded presence in other countries through acquisitions in the US and the EU. Another aspect of our strategy involves the establishment of distribution centers in Europe. Our main goal is to promote external growth and our international presence.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the drivers behind your 400% growth of late?</h4><p>That growth has occurred over a period of about four years, and represents a marked increase in turnover. The company was a typical SME business, and a strategic decision was made to partner with Copperbelt Energy Cooperation (CEC), whereupon a joint venture was formed between the original owners of Realtime and Copperbelt Energy Cooperation. Immediately after the formation of the joint venture, in 2009, equity was pumped into the company by CEC to adopt fiber-optic technology for the provision of services. As a result, we pioneered the provision of fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) in this country. Until then, customer connections were made via wireless links. When we pioneered the provision of fiber cabling, it immediately gave us a competitive advantage over other service providers. As a result, we were able to attract high-end institutional customers, such as the mining houses, the banking sector, and large manufacturing companies. Having established the joint venture, it was necessary to restructure the company and hire new staff to ensure an adequate skills base. The other change came in light of the fact that prior to the joint venture, Realtime had mostly been providing services to the mass market; however, subsequently, our attention turned toward the niche market of large institutional customers.</p><h4>How would you assess the market demand for internet solutions?</h4><p>We have reasonable demand for our services, stemming from the fact that penetration levels remain low and also because Zambia's economy continues to grow at an average of 6%-7% per annum. Furthermore, the government has introduced incentives to grow the ICT sector, which is acknowledged as being a sector responsible for creating efficiencies for business and the economy in general.</p><div class="quote">“In terms of regulation, the government reviewed our license fees downward in order for the ICT sector to penetrate more markets."</div><h4>How would you rate the effectiveness of those incentives so far?</h4><p>It has been an ongoing process, and we continue to engage with government. Thus far, we have seen the government provide incentives through tax measures. For example, we enjoy concessional rates on the importation of ICT equipment into the country. Initially, the government was only allowing the importation of computers at a concession; however, over the years we have seen the government increase the range of ICT equipment entering the country at concessionary rates. Also, in terms of regulation, the government reviewed our license fees downward in order for the ICT sector to penetrate more markets. Of course, there is more we hope to see done, but over time we have enjoyed the tax incentives offered to the sector.</p><h4>What is your view on the regulatory framework and its development?</h4><p>Our regulator has tried as much as possible to ensure that regulations are provided in an environment conducive to the sector, whilst meeting the requirements of the international community. We have seen progressive changes in terms of regulation in the sector. So far, national regulation is in tandem with international practice. If there are going to be further changes, they will not be extensive. One area where we keep pushing for changes is the further reduction of license fees. In particular, our thinking has been that we are paying quite a bit more compared to others in the region in terms of operating fees, which currently stand at 3% for service providers such as ourselves. That amounts to 3% of our turnover. We trust that this could be reduced to as low as 1%, which is as low as other countries around the world.</p><h4>How would you assess the competitive landscape for ICT?</h4><p>In Zambia, we have about 22 registered internet service providing companies. However, of the 22 that are registered, maybe only about 10 are active. There is intense rivalry in the sector, and at the same time because of the intensity of the competition, it acts as a barrier to entry for new companies. Secondly, the sector requires an adequate capital because of the frequency of technological change. That, too, is a barrier to entry for new players and start-ups.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Bridgestone's key milestones over recent years?</h4><p>The key achievement was to understand consumer demand, then transmit this information to define each of the channels. Colombia is a country of consumer opportunities where people are not just looking for price, but also for a combination of the value that the product delivers. The other important focus is the business development of original equipment, that is, direct sales to vehicle assembly companies. Therefore, we started supplying tires to General Motors for the Cobalt passenger car. We also began selling tires with specific measurements for its NHR trucks. We are projecting strong growth for the end of 2014 and the coming year. On the list of the top thousand companies in Colombia, while we closed 2012 in 826th position, we were at 497th at the end of 2013. We had an important increase in turnover, and rose two percentage points in terms of market share, which for as competitive a market as Colombia, with more than 180 tire brands, it significant. The consolidation of the original equipment business in addition to the understanding of consumer need is giving us a perfect gold cycle, where people buy our tires for their cars, and return to us for replacements.</p><h4>Bridgestone was dependent on its Venezuelan subsidiary until 2010. What specific operations have improved since you achieved independence and took responsibility for the Ecuadorean market?</h4><p>When we separated from the Venezuelan market, we gained a degree of independence, but being a Colombian commercial operation meant that we needed to be supported by a mother plant, and to improve our supply logistics for our clients. To this end, in January 2013, we made the decision to join the Costa Rica operation. This means that we have a plant only five days away by ship that supplies us with products at a rapid pace, which was something we used to lack. We were bringing in products from Japan, the US, or Brazil, which took between two and six months to arrive. Now 60% of the products we sell come from Costa Rica. Ecuador was a complicated market for us in 2013 due to regulatory change at that time. We sought alternatives to complying with these regulations, and now we are growing by 37% more than in that year.</p><div class="quote">“Certification has become a way of life for us, as everything is strictly controlled."</div><h4>What innovative products are you using in your services, and what will these mean in terms of environmental impact?</h4><p>We just started a program called "Pilots of Life," which is aimed at children aged 9-15 years, in which we teach them how to be a better pedestrian, better passengers, and better drivers in the future. The idea is that we begin to educate citizens for the future. In terms of our products, we have many ranges that are closely aligned with the environment. The "Think before driving" program is about awareness, where people learn that they must check the air in their vehicles, which we do at all of our outlets. Just having a calibrated tire pressure leads to a significant reduction of up to 20% in fuel consumption, and obviously that means less pollution. We are now selling a product called “ECOPIA," which is a green product that gives less rolling resistance, saving fuel and reducing emissions. In the same way we are aligning our entire corporate strategy to introduce new products that are much more environmentally friendly and are adapted to the market conditions and consumers in Colombia.</p><h4>How important is BASC certification for Bridgestone, particularly in Colombia?</h4><p>Certification has become a way of life for us, as everything is strictly controlled, and all processes are monitored so that we can trust that there is no contamination of the cargo. We are the primary tire company in the world, and we want to change our image in Colombia and demonstrate in both markets, Colombia and Ecuador, that we are environmentally friendly.</p><h4>Which sectors do you distribute most products to, and which have growth potential?</h4><p>Our products are oriented to the transport sector, which plays an important role in the development of the economy of Colombia. This was even more so the case once we signed the free trade agreement (FTA) with the US, while three FTAs are about to be signed with Costa Rica, Japan, and South Korea, which are already being discussed in the chamber. We are highly involved in the oil and transport sectors at a national level, in projects such as the “Transmilenio," and with different transport companies in multiple cities. Beyond that, we are also aligning with these sectors and encouraging rethreading. We own our "Bandag" brand, which is a rethread trademark. We are heavily involved in national development, working closely with Andi on a post-consumer collection program for used tires and their disposal.</p><h4>To what extent are FTAs affecting your import ratio?</h4><p>We are directly focused on the FTA with Costa Rica, and are interested in signing it because it hosts our mother plant. Currently, we have a rather significant customs duty rate of 10% with Costa Rica and aim to make this FTA happen. We have welcomed the open approach that the government has toward FTAs worldwide.</p><h4>How has growth in infrastructure affected your operations here in Colombia?</h4><p>There has been so much development that we have even been obliged to order extra products to meet our source's needs. Currently, we are bringing in products from Thailand to supply a quality product and to ensure that work is not held up for a lack of tires. Our other internal focus is to have far tighter logistics management for effective product delivery. We are fully engaged in the infrastructural development of the country through our network of distributors.</p><h4>What is the strategic significance of Colombia for Bridgestone and how do your local operations differ from others in the region?</h4><p>Colombia is the third-largest economy in Latin America, while Ecuador is the eighth largest, and when combined they represent a formidable market of close to 9 million tires. Colombia, moreover, is a country with great coverage of other markets, given its access to the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific alliance is crucial for us because we have a solid relationship with Mexico. Colombia is set for significant further development, and is taking one step further in matters of the economy. Just the fact that Colombia's GDP may rise by 7% from 4.29% in 2013, and the signing of the peace treaty means that the eyes of the world are now focused on investment opportunities in Colombia. Bridgestone is watching too, and we are excited to see what progress results.</p><h4>How do you think the tire industry will evolve over the next few years and what role will Bridgestone play in this?</h4><p>The tire industry understands that it has to comply with certain international regulations. The problem of used tires is a complicated one to which we neglect to pay sufficient attention. We want consumers to buy our tires, but also to become aware of how to discard tires to better serve the environment. Our business development will continue rising because we are in countries experiencing strong growth, and are in a strategic region where the US is our main trading partner.</p><h4>What is the outlook for Bridgestone in 2015?</h4><p>In 2015 we will focus on doing business with original equipment with vehicle assemblers. There are some interesting projects that could be completed in the course of 2015. Fortunately the business is going well, having grown by 26% YoY in 2014. We have outperformed both the industry and GDP. In sales terms we are performing well, and have even had to expand our operations in Barranquilla. For me, the main focus in Colombian tire industry is logistics; it is all about who makes a product available the fastest, so we have operations in Barranquilla and Bogotá to reduce our delivery time. And over the coming years we aim at reducing delivery times even more, which is key to our business.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps is the Ministry of Energy and Mining taking to help the Dominican Republic take full advantage of its mineral potential?</h4><p>In many ways the Dominican Republic is a mini continent unto itself. It possesses an amazing diversity of renewable and nonrenewable resources, both metallic and non-metallic. We now have greater knowledge than before of our mineral potential, thanks to the System of Stabilization of Export Earnings from Mining Products (SYSMIN) Cooperation Programme of the EU, which provided us with multiple geological and resource-referenced maps, covering approximately 96% of the territory. It is a privilege for our geological service to hold so much information. As a newly-created ministry we are engaged in building our initial strength as defined by our strategic plan. As a key part of our agenda, we will seek to improve the overall management of the industry and the defense of public interests, raising the standards of regulation and control and increasing our arbitration capacity as a means of obtaining social licenses and attracting more qualified investments. We are integrating a highly qualified professional team and establishing partnerships with national and international institutions for the training of our human resources and establishing new standards for exceptional service for potential investors. In 2015, we hope to promote multi-sectorial consultation to improve the legitimacy of mining activities, and we hope to address important issues such as the definition of investment objectives, which must be financed with mining revenues. We must also finish the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and establish a “win-win-win" strategy whereby the state wins, enterprises win, and so, too, do the communities. We are also engaged in reviewing and updating aspects as important as establishing the cost of exploration patents, expediting and providing further reliability to the Mining Cadastre, formalizing and adding value to small-scale and community mining, and simplifying legal proceedings of concessions with mining companies.</p><h4>What initiatives is the Ministry undertaking to overcome expensive imported fossil fuels and an inability to purchase power from neighboring countries?</h4><p>The Ministry promotes an energy security agenda that has a strategic goal: to reduce the dependency on imported fossil fuels, should we not achieve self-sufficiency. We are focused on simultaneously boosting oil exploration on land and at sea, and also on the state's promotion of renewable energy. We are looking to promote partnerships with the business and industrial sectors, mainly as a tool for social inclusion in remote areas such as border and mountain communities. Hopefully by 2015, an effective energy efficiency policy will be put in place.</p><div class="quote">“The energy sector in the Dominican Republic must undergo major changes, especially in the electricity subsector."</div><h4>What is your view on the transformation of the energy sector in the Dominican Republic and what are your prospects for the future of clean technologies and renewable energy production in the drive for increased economic growth?</h4><p>The energy sector in the Dominican Republic must undergo major changes, especially in the electricity subsector. Already the government has arranged a great Electrical Pact, as required by the National Development Strategy. We hope that in this electrical pact, strategic agreements involving the public, private, and social sectors can be signed. In particular the Ministry of Energy and Mines understands the profound reform that the regaining of the vertical integration of the industry moving on from state enterprises to public companies of open market capitalization would imply. This would entail a change in the nature of Dominican capitalism, as well as the rules of governance of public companies. Our aim is for management to be transparent, efficient, results oriented, and de-politicized. We also deem it a high priority to ensure the conversion of the electric park to natural gas, although this cannot be done without new infrastructure development policies and regulation of international standards that ensures access to third parties, neutrality, efficiency, and security in the installation and operation of terminals and pipelines. We believe in developing a network of pipelines on the southern coast, and also in the creation of an energy hub that includes terminals in the Northern region, preferably in the area of Manzanillo, near the border with Haiti. This last point would be of strategic value for ourselves, for Haiti, and indeed, for the entire region. The border area also has optimal conditions to become a renewable energy generation address as it has the best solar radiation regime, great wind resources, and significant potential for marine energy. Marginal lands owned by the state will be used for the production of biofuels and biomass. With this approach we also intend to impact Haiti's energy consumption patterns, which essentially depend on firewood and charcoal, and therefore are unsustainable for both countries. With regard to the energy plan of the Dominican Republic we have certain precise goals. With the "Rooftops of Light" project, we aspire to have a good part of the public sector's building's rooftops generate electricity through the installation of photovoltaic panels. We have also advanced in the drafting of a regulation of co-processing and recovery of hydrocarbons that will essentially support the cement and electrical industries in the management of various wastes.</p><h4>Could you talk us through the main highlights of the Dominican Republic's National Energy Plan 2010-2025?</h4><p>The government's energy efficiency and savings plan is focused on achieving significant energy savings in the public sector with the use of various technologies, both in terms of fuel and electricity. In 2015, we will have an energy efficiency and government savings law that will provide access to this policy to the entire society. We aim to substantially increase the country's fuel storage capacity, which is crucial in some categories. With a consumption of 140,000 barrels a day, it makes sense to increase the country's refining capacity and take advantage of our geographical location and become a center of storage, processing, mixing, and regional and international distribution. We also aspire to advance with the Cultivando Agua Buena, or “Watershed Management" program developed in partnership with Itaipu and the Bi-National and the Brazilian authorities, and we have begun to implement this program in three river basins in the country. This program has a high component of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable and inclusive social development. We believe that much can be achieved with the modernization and resizing of the electricity distribution network. We support the Dominican Corporation of State Electrical Companies in implementing telemetry systems at industrial, commercial, and residential levels. I am particularly committed to this initiative because it was a proposed amendment, which I promoted as a legislator. With this initiative, the level of technical losses and fraud can be substantially reduced. However, we believe that we should do more with distributed generation, hence the importance we attach to the development of the northern energy hub and the implementation of special and differentiated energy policies for the border and mountain areas. The Ministry of Energy and Mining is well aware as to the importance of private, domestic, and foreign investment. We believe in progressively improving public sector institutions so that they can provide more legal security and attract more and better investment. That is why at the Ministry we have a specialized Investments Department to guide and accompany the processes necessary for the completion of the investment. We intend, alongside other institutions, to prepare relevant investment projects with international expert assistance to be tendered out for domestic and foreign investors, or even the materializing of public-private partnerships. What is decisive, however, is that with clear and transparent rules, all players agree to the "win-win-win" business model as the state, the communities, and the investors are strategic partners. The main objectives of the Ministry in 2015 are the further strengthening of our institutional capacities, integrating more trained personnel, and developing the necessary regulations in each of the areas under our jurisdiction. We also envisage the establishment of strategic alliances with reputable international institutions, especially in the field of science and technology. In addition, we aim to advance with the campaign of hydrocarbon exploration on land and at sea, and we expect to be able to request bids from exploration companies in late 2015, or early 2016, to establish the “Rooftops of Light" program in at least 30 public organizations, carry out the multi-sectoral consultation to consolidate the country's mining policy, extend the “Cultivando Agua Buena" program to at least five river basins in our country, improve the development proposal for the Northern Port of Manzanillo, as well as approve the regulations for third party access to energy infrastructure. We also hope to strengthen ties with our affiliated and supervised organizations such as the National Energy Commission, the National Direction of Mines, and the National Geological Survey.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ras Al Khaimah National Insurance Company (RAK Insurance) has been present in the UAE for almost 40 years. What are some of the recent milestones that the company has achieved this year?</h4><p>In terms of what we have achieved this year, there are clearly a couple of highlights; we were selected as one of the seven participating insurers for Dubai's mandatory health insurance scheme, which is a significant achievement for us as an organization. Another milestone going into 2015 was the planned majority share acquisition by National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah (RAK Bank). The UAE is a highly competitive market with over 60 insurers. Having a partner like RAK Bank will add value to RAK Insurance, increasing distribution capability and affording us the opportunity to move into new markets and offer new products. The third milestone this year has been to introduce a new online distribution channel; clients will be able to go online and buy a range of insurance products and obtain valuable service offerings. On top of that we have been going through a transitional period as an organization. We set a new strategy for the company in 2013, which runs through to 2017.</p><h4>What are the main focuses in terms of products?</h4><p>As a company, we are a composite insurer, which means that we sell both life/medical and general insurance products to both corporate and retail clients. Moving into 2015 and beyond, we will be looking to expand our footprint in the retail sector. In that respect, our product range will become more focused, specific to each and every need of the client, with an eye on simplifying the structure and pricing of the products. We are also making it easier for clients to shop for products.</p><h4>How would you describe the main pillars of your growth strategy, and how it will impact RAK Insurance?</h4><p>The initial focus has been on adopting a multi-channel approach to distribution. We are working closely with brokers, looking at bancassurance, corporate, retail, and e-commerce, as well as building for the first time, our own direct sales force. We are beginning a multi-channel approach to distribution, repackaging or restructuring our product offerings, and making it easier for a client not only to buy the product, but for them to understand what they are buying. We went through a complete transformation in terms of our brand in May 2013. Our brand was the starting point because we want to be seen as a different insurer, appealing to a more affluent sector of the market.</p><div class="quote">“I believe there is continuing opportunity and optimism in the foreseeable future."</div><h4>How would you describe RAK Insurance's strategy to compete with the large multi-nationals and other local players?</h4><p>I felt that there was a space in the market for a local company having a global perspective. We spent a lot of time, effort, resources, and money on areas like risk management, internal control, and governance. As a publicly listed company, I have obligations not only to the regulators, but to my shareholders as well. We take the best practices from the global market and embed them into a local company.</p><h4>Why would a company or private individual decide to use an insurance product from this company over a multinational?</h4><p>There are certainly some clients, either corporate or retail, that would find it more appealing to deal with a local company, simply because we have been here for 40 years and many of our global competitors here in the UAE have not been. We have a much better understanding of the local market, particularly when we are dealing with the local population.</p><h4>What impact do you believe mandatory health insurance will have on the health insurance industry as a whole?</h4><p>As the population in Dubai continually increases, especially within the expatriate population, the need for health insurance is becoming more and more a necessity, not only from an employee's perspective, but also from the employers' and government's perspective. I think the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) has done a good job in developing the initial structure and putting in place what will be a world-class healthcare offering. The DHA and the participating insurers will now learn and adjust accordingly.</p><h4>The UAE has just been labeled as the fastest-growing GCC insurance market with a 17% growth rate over the last six years. What factors do you think contribute to this?</h4><p>Dubai and Abu Dhabi are the two driving Emirates. Infrastructure projects, especially tourism projects and all the related services that have underpinned that, are driving the business. That said, there has been a downside to that; the pricing of insurance in the corporate sector is way below where it needs to be for long-term profitability and is not sustainable at current levels. Dubai won the right to host the World Expo 2020 and this is going to provide a fresh impetus for more business opportunities in Dubai.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the insurance industry going forward?</h4><p>I believe there is continuing opportunity and optimism in the foreseeable future, but again, as I mentioned, pricing is becoming a challenge, as well as profitability for some companies. I believe regulation has a big part to play as the insurance industry moves forward and becomes more mature. Unlike Saudi Arabia, which is well regulated by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, the regulator in UAE is working through a number of challenges that the sector faces. Although there is significant market opportunity, I believe the competition is very strong, while pricing is weak and there is over capacity in the market as well. Companies that want to succeed will have to deliver better quality products and better quality services, and they are going to have to become much more consumer focused than they have been in the past.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Driven by a growing middle class and by an increasingly sophisticated medical system, the Kazakhstani pharmaceutical market is steadily developing. What opportunities do you see for GSK? What key factors are contributing to cementing your presence in the Country?</h4><p>Kazakhstan has the most stable political and investment climate in the region. Around 4% of the country's GDP is spent on healthcare and there is a growing pace of state investment in the healthcare sector. The overall vision for the health system is reflected in the State Health Care Development Program for 2011—2015 and the Strategic development plan of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2020. One of the targets of the development program for 2020 is to raise life expectancy at birth from 62-63 to 73; this is a good target and could be achieved given certain special healthcare reforms, which should concentrate on the prophylaxis of disease, which includes immunization of the population. In that regard, we play a significant role: GSK's vaccines are represented in the Kazakhstani national reimbursement system and the national immunization calendar. This target can be achieved through medical education, one of the pillars of the healthcare system development. At GSK we are committed to investing in education. In 2012 we signed an MoU with the Ministry of Health in Kazakhstan. We are investing in two programs, namely oncology and immunization. This is where GSK has expertise and we can bring our expertise into this area. It is not just about pharmacy or profit for us; it is all about patients. We have introduced the patient-focused program, where we put patient's interests at the heart of decisions made. Kazakhstan is also a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, under which the regulations of three member countries aim to be harmonized. It is expected that marketing authorizations for medical products will be mutually recognized among member countries. This could speed up the process of registration of medical products and might influence the reduction of registration costs and timelines if implemented correctly. Kazakhstan is playing a major advisory role in implementing new regulations; the regulations are interactively discussed and we provide our feedback, which is considered and accepted. Of course the Belorussian and the Russian experts also play major role in harmonizing these regulations. Another factor that positively drives the healthcare system is Kazakhstan's importing of international experience.</p><h4>GSK's educational programs are used in the medical education of physicians in many countries worldwide. In this regard, can you elaborate on your partnership with Kazakhstani institutions to develop local healthcare systems?</h4><p>We are investing notably in oncology and in new diagnostic systems. Advanced diagnostics enable the patient to receive the right treatment, and we invest in education related to diagnostics; doctors are dealing with highly innovative medicines that require special skills. We are working with the European School of Oncology to bring knowledge and know-how to the country, giving more free time to doctors. While nurses are spending more time in technical procedures, the doctors can focus on formulating the right diagnostics, analysis, and treatment. Most of our products, like antiretrovirals, oncological products, and vaccines, are part of the reimbursement system in Kazakhstan. Our priority is to bring in more expertise in the area. Our partnership is more with the institutions and the Ministry of Health, which we are discussing on open platforms. One of those platforms is the annual Economic Forum in Astana.</p><div class="quote">“We are investing notably in oncology and in new diagnostic systems."</div><h4>As the Area General Manager for Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and Mongolia, can you share with us your strategy to expand and consolidate your presence in the region?</h4><p>We have numerous partners in this market, and are looking for programs where we propose that the government adopts competitive pricing. Our partners accept this as well because it will give greater options to patients, allowing hospitals to have access to well-priced products. The more patients have access to medicines, the more pricing flexibility the company can adopt. Increasing market penetration is a matter of the right interaction with healthcare professionals, something we focus on particularly intently. We do not speak about sales when dealing with healthcare professionals, and we expect a high level of knowledge and scientific engagement. For us it is more important to bring real expertise, knowledge, and a scientific approach. Our focus is the patient and the patient's interests. The important thing here is the health care professional's decision on how to provide the most beneficial service to the patient. This is why the medical component of our company is growing annually.</p><h4>What about the production of pharmaceutical products here in the country?</h4><p>That's a good question. In Kazakhstan there are some local manufacturing companies and I think they are very well established. I think rather than establishing lots of manufacturing sites in Kazakhstan, we should concentrate on the existing ones and improving the quality and GMP standards and so forth. Establishing manufacturing facilities here requires a huge investment; it takes 5-7 years until the final establishment of the manufacturing process. The quality of the product that is expected by the patient is also high. We have to balance local manufacturing with our desire to ensure that we price our products at a level that patients are able to afford, and adding complexity to the supply chain often doesn't make products more affordable. Licensing is a future collaboration of true potential between international companies operating here and existing manufacturers.</p><h4>Kazakhstan, Belorussia and Russia will have a common pharmaceutical market from 2016 within the Eurasian Economic Union. How are pharmaceutical market dynamics set to change once common market start functioning?</h4><p>I expect that the implementation of the new regulations in the pharmaceutical industry, if done correctly, which means understanding the business environment, including the local producers, and also the international companies who operate in those markets, will bring only benefits, like the mutual recognition of registration. We also see that, in terms of the production side, it will herald international standards, which will require higher-quality products; it can also bring in good clinical practice, effective distribution practice, and global manufacturing practice (GMP) standards.</p><h4>Do you have any specific goals for 2015?</h4><p>In terms of specific goals, it is mostly about the introduction of our patient-focused vision and our scientific engagement with healthcare professionals. When you are free of the pressure of targets you become more focused on knowledge levels, which we are delivering on, and expertise, which we are bringing. So it will require even more professional skills from our employees and I think of this as one of our ambitious targets; over the next year we want to be five steps ahead in order to make our employees more professional, more knowledgeable, and more partnership ready with healthcare professionals. In the pharmaceuticals industry, I expect the industry to change its vision of how business is conducted. Companies will, by and large, ultimately focus on quality.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the primary objective of the Regulation &amp; Supervision Bureau (RSB)?</h4><p>The regulatory body's primary purpose is to protect customers, and one of the ways it does that is through conservation. The less we need to produce, the cheaper electricity and water will become, which is particularly true during the peak season, so we see conservation as an over-arching goal. It comes from both our side and that of the consumer. We see it as a major way to drive down costs, but at the same time send the right pricing signals.</p><h4>What are some of the current shifts and trends occurring in Abu Dhabi's water, wastewater, and electricity sectors?</h4><p>A huge amount of diversity and change is taking place. With electricity, we are seeing more renewable energy, more panels on roofs, and more involvement with customers; with more focus being put on conservation. There are many developments in the use of recycled water, particularly in the wastewater sector, where we have introduced a three-taps approach, which seeks to direct large users to the best source of water for their needs. In this connection the three taps are; ground water, drinking water, and recycled water. The more recycled water we can use and the more efficiently we use it, the less drinking water we have to produce in the beginning. The key themes of diversity and sustainability run through everything we are doing.</p><div class="quote">“The smart grid group looks at many things to do with optimizing the distribution network grid."</div><h4>What are the goals behind the RSB's Business Continuity Management Regulations?</h4><p>This is part of a much wider process; the Abu Dhabi government has introduced planning requirements to ensure that, under any circumstances, business continues. For example, we have seven power plants in the Gulf waters producing drinking water using desalination technology. We have looked at the likelihood of incidents such as what would happen if these waters become heavily contaminated. In such a situation, we can supply all our drinking water needs from Fujairah into Abu Dhabi. We have done that and tested the system and it works perfectly. We have also looked at things such as IT systems and if they would be prone to cyber-attacks. In other words, we look at how to deal with worst-case scenarios for everything.</p><h4>What are some of the findings of your feasibility studies on waste-to-energy technology in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Overall we have a good understanding of waste to energy (WtE) projects and have been working with deferent stockholders in studying these technologies. Waste-to-energy incineration plants offer a reliable form of energy production and stops the release of dangerous gases such as methane into the atmosphere. It is known as a carbon-neutral technology. However, in line with our conservation philosophy there are certain rules that apply to everyone in connection with waste. The first thing is to try not to produce much of it. The second is when you do produce waste, recycle as much as you can before burning it. The third is how you deal with the residue. The things you can't recycle easily, such as rubber, plastic, and organic materials, are either burnt or are fed into anaerobic digestives for the organic materials. The average electricity unit costs are pretty competitive compared with other technologies.</p><h4>What are some key features of the new Al Mirfa power and water project plant, and how will it add value to the sector?</h4><p>The Al Mirfa plant is probably the most complex and unique one currently procured since the restructuring of the sector in 1999. Utilizing four unused plants from one of the northern Emirates with a total capacity of 400 MW generation and new gas and steam turbines, the station will have a combined output capacity 1,600 MW. In addition, some of the newer but existing thermal desalination equipment will be retained and new reverse osmoses (RO) plants will also be constructed, providing an installed water production capacity of 52.5 million gallons per day of high-quality drinking water. All this adds up to a complex project, being built on an existing site. However, the new and refurbished plant will replace old inefficient generators and old inefficient desalination plants, so this has a positive economic benefit. In addition, the old generators were unreliable and were often out of service so this new addition to the generation fleet has many benefits to the sector as a whole.</p><h4>What's the significance of the RO plant, as the first one ever installed in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>An RO plant can run independently of the need to generate electricity. At the moment, we have what is called a combined cycle and co-gen generation structure in the majority of power plants. This combined cycle operation provides waste heat for use in thermal desalination. There are problems, however, when water is needed but little electricity. Under these circumstances heat for thermal desalination must be produced by the additional firing of gas, which is possible but is less efficient than in a co-generation mode of generating electricity and producing water simultaneously. With RO, you can use electricity from anywhere in the sector as water is pushed through filters so with this technology the water sector can grow at a different rate to the electricity one. RO can also be used with nuclear power. It is part of where the future is likely to go—more RO.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the Shuweihat 3 (S3) power plant and its role?</h4><p>The S3 power plant will be operated by Shuweihat Asia Power Company (SAPCO) and is a joint venture with Korea Electric Power Corporation of Korea and Sumitomo Corporation of Japan. The plant has been commissioned and is fully operational. It is a 1,600 MW, gas-fired plant that only produces electricity with no water. The importance of that plant is that it is seen more as a peaking plant. If you look at our load profile over the whole year, the water drops off about 10% between summer and winter. However, on electricity, it drops off about 50%-60%. It doubles in the summer, nearly all driven by air conditioning. You need a peaking plant for the summer months, but not for the whole year. The structure of the contract for this plant is that it can be shut down for four months of the year and the S3 plant is specifically designed for that summer purpose.</p><h4>What are the objectives behind the smart grid development group you have recently established?</h4><p>The smart grid group looks at many things to do with optimizing the distribution network grid and in particular demand-side management. The Bureau (through our Powerwise office) is running some trials on five government buildings where we have gone in and disconnected the load during the peak on air conditioning units by about 20% for an hour. We measure humidity and temperature, and we found it hardly makes a difference internally. Eventually, we are looking at the ability of the transmission control center to send out a broadcast to disconnect parts of air conditioning load rather than keep building more gas-fired plants. This may mean that, for private customers, we will have to enter into certain commercial arrangements so as to allow such disconnections, but we are yet to establish any rules in this regard. However, there are many exciting opportunities in the sector to make a real difference using demand side management strategies, so there is much to do in this regard.</p><h4>With the focus on sustainability and addressing climate change, what ways do you expect industry regulations to change in the next decade or two?</h4><p>I think the key thing will be passing regulations for large users. For example, Malaysia requires all large users to identify a specific person in the company who is responsible for energy efficiency. We are looking at the possibility to issue similar regulations. We are trying to make the regulatory environment more prescriptive regarding the enforcement of conservation, rather than just people voluntarily conserving. Irrigation standards for water are also changing in this regard. We have regulations for the quality of the water that leaves the wastewater sector; however, not for how that wastewater is used. Our focus will be on the wise-use of irrigated water.</p><h4>How do you see the role of the RSB evolving as Abu Dhabi continues toward its goal of being 25% powered by nuclear energy and 7% renewable energy by 2020?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi has four new nuclear power plants being built, which equates to 5,600 MW. By 2020 we expect to have an installed capacity of about 20,000 MW, making nuclear slightly more than 25%. The key thing to note is that 25% is referring to the installed capacity, not the amount of energy produced from nuclear. The amount of energy produced in MW hours could well be 40% because nuclear plants are base-load plants, which means they run all the time with a lifespan of 60 years. They will become the backbone of the sector, and anything else we use will be used to support the variation of load. Because nuclear power is relatively more expensive, the only way to keep the cost controllable is to run that asset all the time. However, over time nuclear power will be seen as the cheaper option with very little volatility in the uranium primary fuel, which will not be the case for gas plants. With nuclear, fuel costs are only about 15% of total costs, whereas for gas plants it can be between 50% and 75%. Fast forward to 2020 and beyond, and nuclear in real terms will be cheaper. Admittedly, there is massive complexity and high capital costs up front, but over the long term you have a run of 60 years, at gradually diminishing costs.</p><h4>In terms of that 7% target for renewables, what sources will be leading the way in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Photovoltaics will be leading the way forward. Renewable energy plants are also must-run plants. One disadvantage of renewable energy is that you must run such plants whether you need the electricity or not, but you can't control when it is available. The key that will unlock all renewable energy generation is storage. We foresee many developments in storage because otherwise you are only able to use the energy when the wind blows or when the sun shines. The whole world is still waiting for that to happen, not just Abu Dhabi. Diversity is the important thing.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The tourism sector represented around 12% of national GDP in 2014. What actions drove that development, and which measures do you plan to implement to further boost its role in the economy?</h4><p>The tourism sector at an international level grows at an average of 4% annually, whereas in Colombia the figure has been touching 8%. At the same time we will close the year with a record 4 million visitors. I am not satisfied with this because, for example, the Dominican Republic receives 22 million annual visitors. We are a rich country in terms of biodiversity and have huge potential, and hence are currently trying to boost promotional actions with airlines and to implement the Productive Transformation plan. Colombians have to understand that this is an important industry for the country. We want to promote several destinations such as natural parks and ecotourism around these areas, such as the Sierra Nevada or the Ruta Cafetera. I want to make Colombians part of the development of this segment by, for example, sharing their knowledge with tourists. At the same time, we have to think that investment in the hospitality sector has increased significantly over the past few years as the country takes decisive steps toward increasing security levels, and we are now seeing the results of this in larger tourist arrivals.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the development of foreign trade in Colombia?</h4><p>Some 23 years ago our current president became the first Foreign Trade Minister in Colombia, and ever since, he has maintained the same message; openness to the world, the signing of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), and an export drive. We have a large market around the world and Colombia has to take advantage of this thanks to its qualitative production in many fields. We need to further open to the Pacific, particularly Korea and Japan. We have developed a regional plan to raise awareness among industrial businesses of their many opportunities. Colombian companies should also consider the Pacific Alliance partner countries as markets to explore further, in Chile, Peru, and Mexico. There are several programs in place to encourage our producers to export. We have to remember that Colombia has massive export potential far beyond hydrocarbons and manufacturing products; Colombia can export services and much more.</p><div class="quote">“We need to generate further added value for Colombian products and services."</div><h4>What is your strategy for improving national competitiveness?</h4><p>This is a matter of creating synergies between the public and private sectors; we have to dare to innovate. Colombia was lagging behind in terms of infrastructure around five years ago, so the president formed the National Agency for Infrastructure (ANI), an agency that was recently awarded best agency in the world. We have a total of 42 projects totaling $25 billion, which target energy costs, competitiveness, and innovation. We are also trying to focus our resources rather than spreading them around a number of different companies. It is also important not to forget imports; we have 47 million Colombian inhabitants that are becoming more demanding and smarter consumers. We also need to further increase the portfolio of our FTAs with regional and international players that can give Colombia added value as an economic unit. Asia accounts for 35% of GDP, and therefore we see it as one of the best regions to expand our FTAs to. However, one of the FTAs of the greatest short-term potential is the one we are poised to sign with Costa Rica, as we are the second largest investor in that country among all Latin American countries, despite customs tariffs. Costa Rica also voiced its keenness to be part of the Pacific Alliance, a market of over 215 million people. Colombia is the fifth largest growing economy in the world today, which is something we have to exploit as a country. Colombia also has great potential in two particular sectors, namely services and agribusiness. It has improved its business environment thanks to the availability of finance resources for SMEs, as these represent the future of our country. This is something foreign investors also appreciate; we closed 2013 with $16 billion in export revenues, but the figure has since reached $58 billion. Colombia has also done a great job of consolidating its development over the past few years, working to lift 3.5 million people out of poverty—2 million out of extreme poverty. Furthermore, the potential peace dividend for Colombia is, according to various reports, phenomenal; growth rates could be 2% above current trends, while infrastructure would grow at 1.5% above current rates.</p><h4>What role do you foresee for the Ministry over the coming years?</h4><p>I intend for it to be a key player in boosting innovation, competitiveness, and making sure we develop strong Free Trade Zones (FTZs) within specific clusters. We need to generate further added value for Colombian products and services. This is the best way to increase competitiveness. In this context we will implement several programs linked to the particular fields that I have just mentioned. The US represents a positive example for us, allowing us to boost exports thanks to FTZs, which can help us generate added value for our products and services.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Al Rabban Holding has grown from its pearl trading roots to become a strong and diverse family company. What do you take from those humble beginnings to strengthen this family business?</h4><p>Qatar didn't have a lot of choices in previous generations. There were few things to do then, and you didn't really have much of a choice outside of pearl trading. My late father's generation lived in a time that was difficult, but they also saw the way Qatar is today, so they had a perspective on the two different worlds. Unlike in other countries, development in Qatar jumped into a whole new world within one generation. This is what inspires me to carry forward our development, keeping in mind where we come from and not taking anything for granted.</p><h4>What is your core business and in what areas do you hope to grow in the future?</h4><p>We have three main activities, the first being FMCGs, which is Al Rayyan and its subsidiaries. The other parts are real estate and construction. We are already in the ready-mix concrete business in construction, and now the family wants to concentrate more on real estate, which is where we see the most opportunity. Real estate includes different segments, such as office space and residential. Even though construction is booming here, the local contractors are not getting much of that business. There are also a lot of companies in Qatar now, and I can't see Qatar being able to absorb this number of foreign companies. The market is quite saturated. Another exciting area is food and beverages. Al Rayyan's subsidiaries are investing in new products that have not been produced in Qatar before. The big news is that we want to take this company to IPO, to turn it from a family business into a public company. We have had excellent feedback on this plan, although it will take time. It will be an addition to the Qatar Exchange (QE), because the exchange is saturated with real estate companies, banks, and insurance companies. I think ours will be the first FMCG company to be listed, and that is exciting—it is a bit of a change. Perhaps we can be an example for others to go into the market.</p><h4>What do you want to achieve through the IPO?</h4><p>It is risky after a certain point for any business to be owned by a single person or family; it is important that there is a diversity of investors and shares. Furthermore, by being listed and going public, you have to make certain changes and reforms to your company structure in terms of corporate governance. This is important to keep the business moving forward. The IPO will change the way that Al Rayyan is run, from being a family business to being an institutional entity.</p><div class="quote">“We have three main activities, the first being FMCGs."</div><h4>What is the strategy behind your real estate division?</h4><p>Real estate is an extremely strong sector in Qatar, although prices are rising to the point where it is becoming difficult to invest. Nevertheless, we have always had our eye on this sector, and it is the backbone for many businesses. As we say in Arabic, real estate gets sick, but it never dies. So this sector is always valuable, and we want to make it our company's backbone as well. It also ties in with the new investments we have coming up in hospitality for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, as Qatar is trying to attract more tourists, especially from neighboring countries.</p><h4>Tell us about Al Rabban Services, a company that helps international companies come to Qatar.</h4><p>A lot of companies would like to relocate to Qatar. In conducting our business we have had a lot of inquiries and requests, so we decided to create a division to deal with that demand. It is important to know how to enter Qatar, how to set up here, and how to deal with the regulations. We want to share our expertise and resources. However, we are very picky; we receive many requests, but we sign very few deals.</p><h4>The country has been developing rapidly. What challenges do you see arising for Qatar as part of its National Vision 2030?</h4><p>I think infrastructure is a major challenge. Qatar has learned from its previous mistakes. Qatar has always hosted large, high-profile international events, so it has that experience, but the infrastructure is crucial. You need roads, airports, and other transport routes. The country has grown in a huge way and the number of companies here has grown spectacularly; however, the infrastructure has to keep up. Qatar needs to deliver at the same pace as the speed at which it is growing. The airport took a long time to be delivered, for example, and I hope the port won't take as long.</p><h4>What is your personal vision in terms of leading the company into the next generation?</h4><p>I am working on restructuring our company, in line with our IPO plans. I want to see this company live on for generations to come. So that is the aim, but I am taking my time, because it is a long-term vision. We are trying to implement the right systems, to create better corporate governance, and to create a board that can both take and reject decisions. All of this will be done with a family touch, which will remain.</p><h4>How is Qatar 2030 an inspiration for you in your own plans?</h4><p>I think what matters most in the end is human development, and that is what Qatar 2030 means to me first and foremost. There are examples of countries that have developed incredibly, simply based on human capital, countries with no natural resources. I hope Qatar can achieve that goal because our resources won't always be there. And so we have to invest in our people more than anything.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

In Mozambique we hold the franchise for the entire country. In terms of volume, it is on par with our business in Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda, and the returns enable us to invest in the market and develop infrastructure.</p><h4>How much room for growth is there for Coca-Cola in Mozambique?</h4><p>The room for growth is endless at the moment, and that is one of the reasons we are investing so heavily in capacity. By global standards, the per capita consumption rate here is low. As the country becomes richer, disposable incomes will increase, and people will consume more beverages. We are also bringing in a larger range of products. In 2014, we launched our water Bonaqua, and we have plans to launch into other beverage segments. We will continue to drive our sparkling range as well as continue to innovate in terms of flavors  and packs. There are a number of different offerings. Certainly, with the capacity that we are going to have in Maputo, the capacity that we introduced in 2013 in Chimoio, and the plans we have for Nampula, we are excited about the huge potential of this market.</p><div class="quote">“The room for growth is endless at the moment."</div><h4>What are your plans for the new Maputo factory?</h4><p>The Maputo plant will occupy a 21-hectare site. It is being developed and will ultimately have seven lines in place. We will initially run with three lines, which we believe will give us sufficient capacity until about 2022. Thereafter, we will need to put in additional lines. When it opens its doors, it will increase capacity four fold. The office and distribution center will relocate in May/June 2015, and the first line will enter production in 3Q2015, the second line by the end of 2015, and the third line will be commissioned in 1Q2016. The main challenge for this factory is getting the utilities connected. We have had to build a road, develop water pipelines from the reservoir, and now we need to get mains electricity connected to the plant. In all probability, though, we will commence operations with generators, rather than having a mains connection.</p><h4>Will your production here be for the local market or for exporting?</h4><p>Principally it is all for the local market, but I wouldn't discount any exports, and should a bottler in South Africa require additional product we could supply it. We have franchises all over; hence, there are intercompany transfers among us. One aspect of our business is that you need to have factories within a reasonable distance because transportation costs are prohibitively expensive in this part of the world. Right now, we can satisfy 100% of local demand from our factories in Mozambique, and we occasionally import cans, while juice drinks come in from South Africa.</p><h4>How has your portfolio of brands evolved in recent years, and what are your plans for the future?</h4><p>In 2010, we were pretty much a two-pack company. Today, we have Coke, Fanta, Sprite, and other brands, as well a range of plastic, glass bottles, and cans. You can now see that our stock-keeping unit (SKU) range has significantly increased. One of the major innovations is the introduction of PET bottles. We brought in our first line in 2010, and in 2013 we introduced a large line up in Chimoio. Nampula will be the last factory with a PET line, scheduled to be in place in 2016. We have invested $130 million in these lines. In 2013, we invested $20 million in Chimoio and in Nampula we will be investing $15-20 million.</p><h4>What are your strategies to sustain your leading position in sparking beverages?</h4><p>There are a few tiers to this, one being distribution. We make sure our distribution net is as wide as possible, and that our products are widely available. The second is effective marketing, which underpins all activities. This demands a committed, well trained sales team to execute on the ground effectively.</p><h4>How would you describe the business environment for new companies keen to enter the country?</h4><p>It is challenging, and not an easy market to enter. I would caution anyone coming in to definitely know the market. You can't enter in as a “greenhorn", comparing it to a market like the US. You have to understand; otherwise you will lose your shirt.</p><h4>What is your 10-year outlook?</h4><p>My mandate for this business is to see it through to the end of 2016. By the end of 2016, we will have all the capacity plans that I envisaged.  We will have also mothballed the old plant and sold off buildings that we no longer need. Then, it is all about “selling". The capacity will be there, the sales force will be trained, so it is just then a question of “pumping" out the volume, distributing it, and selling it. Our official vision for 2020 is that we will sell double volume, but my personal vision is significantly more. We are building a major, state-of-the-art plant, which will have modern, new lines. These lines need well educated and technically well trained personnel. Our old lines need 18 people per shift. Our new lines need fewer people per shift but produce four times the quantity. There is a small-qualified labor pool in this country, and there are too many companies that want to get them! People might come to me for 6 to 12 months, then they go on to whoever pays them the most. The labor market hasn't matured in this country, meaning people think it is okay to spend a year here and a year there. Our policy within the group is to localize as much as possible and buy from local suppliers, but my only criteria is that they have to be measurable by world class norms. When I came here, we had three expatriates, we are now up to 15, which is optimal. My people are here to train and develop the local staff and return home.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the historical background of the company and how did you launch operations in Nigeria?</h4><p>Ceezali has been in the construction industry for over two decades now as a civil engineering firm. We have participated in many projects nationwide, including the building of roads, stadiums, high-rise buildings, and many other civil engineering projects. Abinitio Ceezali has committed herself to operating within the best global practices with a strong inclination to quality and prudent financial management of her projects. We also give serious attention to the impact of our projects on the environment by keeping our operations environmentally friendly.</p><h4>What is the nature of your collaboration with the government?</h4><p>Ceezali is collaborating with government in various areas of infrastructure development. For instance, after three years of a highly competitive bidding process, our company was selected as the successful bidder for the provision of integrated engineering infrastructure to the Mabushi district in Abuja under a Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement. This scheme is one of the major infrastructure development projects that the federal government is embarking on and we are hopeful of its successful execution. We are delighted that the government has realized the efficacy of the PPP model as a veritable procurement alternative, much needed if we are to quickly narrow the gap in the national infrastructure deficit.</p><div class="quote">“Ceezali is collaborating with government in various areas of infrastructure development."</div><h4>What kind of support do you expect from the government, apart from PPPs?</h4><p>One of the major areas where the government can offer support to the industry, and especially to indigenous companies, is in facilitating and guaranteeing long-term funds to provide firms adequate access to the resources necessary to effective operation. In addition, tax waivers and import duties on capital assets will be employed in delivering vital infrastructure projects in Nigeria.</p><h4>How do you apply best practices in corporate governance, social responsibility, and security management?</h4><p>Ceezali is a corporate member of the British Safety Council in the UK and we are committed to keeping people safe and healthy at work. We also operate one of the best codes of practice by giving equal opportunity and fair treatment to our valued stakeholders. As a matter of fact, before embarking on projects, we hold a stakeholders' forum where interests are identified, discussed, documented, and executed. We also maintain a cordial relationship between employees as we consciously build in them an ownership mentality. Our company is socially responsible to the host community as we look to give back to the communities through values that will impact people's lives.</p><h4>You have recently taken on a new project, the building of a 16-kilometer dual carriageway in Kogi State, the Ganaja-Otokiti. Could you elaborate on it?</h4><p>This is one of several publicly significant projects we will be handling. As a public interest entity, Ceezali is strongly committed to making its contribution to the development of urban and local communities, which explains why we took up the project. Lokoja is a town of huge traffic challenges. The Ganaja-Otokiti narrow dual carriage ring road is an answer to the urgent need to decongest traffic in the capital. This effort requires a committed company to undertake such a project considering timely delivery and the cost implication. The building of this road will enhance the speedy development of residential and commercial space through the construction of real estate and public facilities, thus creating new jobs.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Drydocks World has just been presented with the Category 1—Best Oil &amp; Gas Project award for the construction of the world's deepest and largest subsea oil storage facility at the ADIPEC Awards, as well as the Shipyard Facility of the Year and The Innovation Award at the Maritime Standard Awards. Similarly, you have received the IMC Golden Helm award for your contributions to the sector. How would you describe the significance of these triumphs?</h4><p>Appreciation of our growth, innovation, excellence, and ability to deliver and prosper is always welcome. The Category 1—Best Oil &amp; Gas Project award was, without a doubt, an exceptional achievement for us that also reflects positively on our workforce because they have contributed to this success. Drydocks World is beginning to shift focus. To be a leader in the offshore industry you have to compete with places like Korea, Singapore, Japan, China, and certain European countries like Germany. For us to compete with them we have to reach certain standards and capabilities. What is important about the awards is that they are decided in a strictly managed and controlled environment. Certain awards are, of course, classified as global, and therefore they will always be at the forefront when it comes to helping our commercial and marketing teams to drive the business forward. That is important because clients want you to achieve the most you can. If you can get these kinds of awards then you are really proving your credentials.</p><h4>How would you describe the primary focus of Drydocks World going forward?</h4><p>Our strategy through 2035 is to focus on the offshore, deep water, and other services in the oil and gas sector. That is where the growth will come from. As a heavy industrial offshore company we have to target bigger and better jobs and also expand our capacity to achieve the most we can. We have become the major supplier for most, if not all, the innovative projects over the past three-four years; our brand focus is to be the only company that has such capabilities.</p><div class="quote">“Our strategy through 2035 is to focus on the offshore, deep water, and other services."</div><h4>What would you describe as the major growth opportunities for Drydocks World within the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>There are major opportunities in offshore production, service and accommodation, platforms, including new build and upgrades, refurbishments, equipment, and other marine solutions. Also, the very large and ultra large offshore structures including modules have real growth potential. Many people no longer think of oil as an isolated sector in itself; it encompasses a lot of other industries, in which it has grown very quickly. If you look at technology, the oil industry is still at the forefront of technology and will keep growing. In that respect, it is becoming very forward thinking and that is where we need to stay and focus ourselves on delivering megaprojects in the oil industry.</p><h4>What initiatives is Drydocks World undertaking to move the industry forward?</h4><p>Most of the projects we have undertaken so far have reshaped the oil and gas industry one way or another. The future is going to be in specialized structures and module-capture units. In order to capitalize on deep water deposits and reserves you have to build them; you have no choice. And so, the fact that we were the first to build and develop such systems with our partners is fantastic. Elsewhere, the oil industry is going to see more gas coming out of Australia because of our participation. Germany will also have more clean energy because of our participation, while Scotland will have the capability to store offshore. Thanks to such technology, the US also came back into offshore drilling. That is excellent.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the future, not only in regard to the maritime industry but also maritime trade in general?</h4><p>The global maritime trade will continue to suffer for the foreseeable future. Actually, I'm not sure how growth can be reestablished. However, I think what will grow is new innovation and technology offshore. Why? Because everyone is looking for efficiency, cost cutting on fuel and bunkering, and having less of an impact environmentally. This will happen because we are seeing more and more ships with different designs, the equipment for efficiency has changed, and there is more technology that has surpassed the old technology. The second aspect is the offshore industry itself; oil and gas, renewables, service, and transport, which all are innovating to a totally different level.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Maritima Dominica recently met with US Vice-President Joseph Biden to discuss the details of the initiative supporting the production of renewable energy. What is the importance of such support and what is your view on the transformation of the energy sector in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The shipping sector is looking at options to provide more environmentally acceptable vessel fuels. Maritima Dominicana, as a service provider to both the shipping industry and local industry, is also focused on more efficient energy production, and the ways in which we can provide our own services, for example warehousing, in a more environmentally acceptable manner. This is why, three years ago, we were the first company to install solar panels on the roof of our warehouse. The US Vice-President was keen to view them, as the message they give to the whole country is that everyone needs to focus on environmental initiatives. We are also ISO14001 certified as part of our efforts to protect the environment.</p><h4>In 2013 you mentioned that Maritima Dominicana planned to expand its business into supply chain management. How far has this initiative advanced, and to what extent do you want to expand your services?</h4><p>We have been working on that subject for the past 12 months. Caucedo Port, adjacent to the airport, is set to construct a Logistic Free Zone (LFZ) to facilitate supply chain management, and to help Caucedo become a hub for the supply of materials and merchandise to the eastern Caribbean for both ships and airplanes. It is similar to Dubai, which has become an important hub in the Middle East because you can send spare parts, materials, and merchandise, both by ship and plane. The inauguration of the new LFZ, scheduled for 2015, is eagerly awaited. Furthermore, the transformation of the customs legal structure that we have been discussing with the government intensely over the past year will also be realized.</p><div class="quote">“The shipping sector is looking at options to provide more environmentally acceptable vessel fuels."</div><h4>Maritima Dominicana has recently participated in the leading international maritime trade fair in Hamburg. What is the significance of these kinds of events for the development of the sector and for recognition of the Dominican Republic internationally?</h4><p>The Hamburg event held every two years is focused on shipbuilding, ship repairs, and the sale of spare parts to the shipping sector. In the case of the Dominican Republic, our ship repair yard, Ciramar Shipyards, has a stand at the Hamburg fair. We have quite a number of ships that are being repaired at Ciramar, and hence there is an important relationship between them, as the ship repair facility, and us as the ship agent. Facilitating this relationship is always an important aspect of our work and is what we focused on when while in Hamburg. In 2014, the event had the historically largest number of companies attending and the largest number of visitors. This was partly because the challenge of transforming the propulsion systems of ships from heavy fuel to other alternatives, involving complicated technology, was highly topical.</p><h4>Does that mean that you are seeing a regional and international willingness to address these new challenges?</h4><p>Absolutely, because of new laws ship owners and companies will have to comply with these requirements and, therefore, they will have to find solutions to be able to comply, which, again, involves complicated technology. Furthermore the US and Europe today have a limited number of LNG terminals providing the fuel, which curbs the fuelling ability of ships that call at the larger ports such as Bremen, Hamburg, and Rotterdam. The suppliers themselves are also facing a challenge. Hamburg Port in Germany is the first facility to purchase an LNG barge to fuel shipping lines.</p><h4>A challenge that many shipping companies have expressed concerns about is the negative balance of trade in the Dominican Republic. What is your view on this situation and how does it affect the industry?</h4><p>The shipping companies that have balanced trade obviously have the best opportunity to offer competitive rates because they can confirm freight coming in and going out. With balanced trade a country therefore has the most competitive freight rates in the market. For example, in the Dominican Republic for every three containers we import, we only export one in return, which means that two containers have to be shipped back out empty. In this scenario, income for shipping lines from these two empty containers is non-existent, with cost incurred Therefore, the struggle for each nation to balance its trade is an opportunity to be more competitive. This is something that we understand today, as does the government. ıt is looking into incentives, particularly in terms of the legal framework, whereby the Dominican Republic, its free zones, and its agricultural producers, could export in greater volume than in the past and reach a more balanced exchange of trade.</p><h4>Minister Montás has recently shared his strategic vision of the Dominican Republic becoming a regional hub in the Caribbean. In your opinion, what initiatives should be taken to achieve that goal?</h4><p>The only requirement really is an improved legal framework for customs handling. There are really no other obstacles. All other components are already in place, as the Port of Caucedo is conveniently located in the Caribbean in close proximity to the airport. As I said before we can ship parts by sea or air. And this is why Caucedo is building this new LFZ in anticipation of the necessary legal structure being put in place.</p><h4>What is Maritima Dominicana's development strategy?</h4><p>In 2014 the company has been implementing a global system, meaning that all our departments will be electronically connected through a uniform system for greater operational efficiency. The other initiative we have carried out in 2014 is an evaluation of the efficiency of all the companies that make up our group and their respective departments, to improve our service offering. We have also been authorized as an economic operator by OEA-RD, which further underlines our commitment to compliance with quality standards in terms of service provision. This neatly adds to the ISO certification that we have already had for many years.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you built on the success of past World Future Energy Summits (WFES) in preparation for the upcoming summit in 2015?</h4><p>Since its inception in 2008, the WFES—Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week's signature event—has grown into the region's largest and most important platform dedicated to advancing alternative energy, clean technology, and energy efficiency. Some 11,000 people and 300 companies participated in the first summit. Today, we are expecting CEOs, ministers, heads of state, academics, investors, and technical specialists from more than 150 countries to attend, along with close to 30,000 global industry professionals and 650 exhibiting companies. This growth in importance and scale correlates directly with the emergence of Abu Dhabi, and the UAE, as a key contributor to the global dialogue on sustainability and as an active investor in cleantech. WFES is an extention of Abu Dhabi's status, and over the years it has become known as a summit at which new partnerhsips are forged, technologies are showcased, and bottom-up, private-sector focused initiatives are accelerated.</p><h4>What will be the main themes and topics of discussion at WFES 2015?</h4><p>Unlocking renewable energy growth in the Middle East and across Africa will be a key focus of this year's event. As two quickly growing economic regions, both with huge potential to deploy renewable energy, the conference and exhibition at WFES will offer industry a gateway to these markets to accelerate and catalyse growth. A ministerial panel on African's energy opportunities and a panel discussion on Saudi Arabia's ambitious vision for renewable energy are just two of the features that support this focus. Other highlights of the Summit will include global policy makers debating the rise of shale gas, the role of cities in combating climate change, clean energy futures for the UAE, and the rise of South Africa as a sustainability leader through one of the fastest growing clean energy markets in the world. In addition, the team behind the winning bid for a pioneering carbon-neutral Dubai Expo 2020 will be on show, and the higher organization committee Managing Director Her Excellency Reem Al Hashimi, will lead a panel discussion on how her team manufactured a compelling sustainability narrative.</p><div class="quote">“Unlocking renewable energy growth in the Middle East and across Africa will be a key focus of this year's event."</div><h4>How is the summit set up to encourage networking, and how will companies and organizations in the energy industry benefit from participating in the Summit?</h4><p>WFES presents a uniquely accessible forum for energy sector stakeholders to network, exchange ideas, and explore business partnerships. The event provides an international business platform that links entrepreneurs and innovators to investors and clients from the public and private sectors. At our last summit, we had 650 exhibiting companies from 40 countries, and 91.5% of exhibitors agreed that WFES allowed them to generate contacts of higher quality than any other similar event in the MENA region. We are proud of that statistic, but continue to find ways to support action. For instance, the Sustainability Business Connect, a brand new networking program designed to maximize business opportunities by matching requirements with products and services, will be launched at WFES. It is complimented by an online booking tool that will make it easier than ever for participants and exhibitors to meet, connect, and do business.</p><h4>What are your expectations regarding numbers of attendees and countries represented at the Summit from both the public and private sectors?</h4><p>For the last edition of WFES, we welcomed over 28,000 attendees from 170 countries. We saw particularly strong representation from North America, Western Europe, East Asia, and the GCC. In terms of company profiles, the engineering, hydrocarbons, energy efficiency, and business sectors were well represented. We expect to see a similar range of attendees and delegates in January 2015.</p><h4>What key players and exhibitors from Abu Dhabi's energy industry can foreign attendees expect to see at the event?</h4><p>We are looking forward to welcoming participants from across the region, and the world. From the UAE and Saudi Arabia, to China and Japan, WFES will welcome the world's leading future energy players to the UAE capital. Participants at the summit will have the chance to interact with many of the leading players in the local energy industry, such as Masdar, the hosts of WFES, and ADNOC, which is the event's principle partner. As Abu Dhabi is also the home of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), there will also be a wealth of expertise from the leading intergovernmental organization on renewable energy. Last year, 140 official delegations attended, constituting an increase of more than 50% on the previous year. Such a level of official interest reflects the increasing importance of WFES as a global forum for governments, businesses, and experts.</p><h4>How would you describe Abu Dhabi's role in the development of renewable energies in the MENA region?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is a regional energy pioneer. With an economy based on hydrocarbon exports, the Emirate has embarked on a bold mission to diversify its economy to a knowledge based one, and balance its energy mix by investing and developing clean sources of energy. This makes it uniquely positioned to promote the expansion of clean energy in the MENA region, and I believe the region is following this lead. As regional economies grow and populations rise, the need for energy security and the need to liberate hydrocarbon resources for export becomes more important. WFES is a demonstration of Abu Dhabi's commitment to advancing the clean energy dialogue, and connecting global players to stimulate action and progress.</p><h4>How is WFES 2015 contributing to the realization of Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi plans to diversify its economy, away from a reliance on hydrocarbons to one underpinned by knowledge and innovation, and WFES is an economic vehicle driving that process. Now into its eighth year, it forms the centerpiece of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week and takes place alongside the International Water Summit (IWS) and EcoWASTE Exhibition, addressing the world's energy challenges from a nexus perspective. This unique multi-platform initiative allows the public sector, industry, and investors to harmonize effective strategies in support of sustainable growth, and contribute to the UAE's strategy to create an economy with knowledge and human capital at its core.</p><h4>What do you hope to have achieved once the event has come to an end?</h4><p>The GCC region is set to spend $100 billion on clean energy by 2020. This is a significant pledge and an attractive commercial opportunity for the sector. WFES plays an important role in catalyzing the development of renewable energy, clean technology, and energy efficiency solutions. And when the next summit is over, I believe it will have pushed the dial forward on regional sustainable development, and connecting technology and investment with billions of dollars worth of business.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Islamic banking is in its infancy in Kazakhstan; how is it shaping Kazakhstan's financial environment and what role do you think it will play in the country's development?</h4><p>Islamic banking is growing slowly, but it has certainly been picking up over the last two years. Kazakhstan is generally quite a regimented country. From a regulatory point of view there are a number of procedural requirements. People were not familiar with this new banking system. This meant that, in the early years, we had great difficultly penetrating different segments, especially the corporate segment. The legal departments of many customers refused to accept the transactions. Fortunately we built up a good legal team. In the first two years, our team spent more time in the client offices than in our office. We have been here four years now, and things have changed and improved; people accept the product now. There are also regulatory issues. In particular, because Kazakhstan is a new country, the Islamic banking law that was brought in was based purely on theory. This is one of the few countries where the law was made and then the industry started up. The regulators have been quite supportive, but the amendments have been waiting for parliamentary approval for almost 18 months.</p><h4>Is Islamic banking competing with the conventional banks here in Kazakhstan, or is it better to talk about integration?</h4><p>I would say integration. In Kazakhstan the top six banks account for about 75% of total assets, and there are a total of 38 banks. This means that 32 banks are then trying to share the remaining 25%. We are the most recent bank to enter the country and we have less than 1% of the market share. Although we are the last, we are not last in terms of asset size and capital. The economy is growing: that generates additional business. We have grown, but I would not say at the expense of stepping on the toes of any other players.</p><div class="quote">“Raising awareness for Islamic finance is really important."</div><h4>How would you rate your financial performance in 2014 compared with the results you published in 2013?</h4><p>In our first year we had maybe $40 million in assets. The next year that grew to $90 million, a 100% growth, but those percentages don't tell the whole story because you are starting from a very small base. Definitely in terms of assets and profit, we are exceeding our budget in both areas, and even for the next year we are planning a steady growth rate; hence that is well in line with our expectations.</p><h4>How are you working to increase the awareness of Islamic banking offers in the country?</h4><p>Raising awareness for Islamic finance is really important. Twice a year we have our sharia scholar visit Kazakhstan and we do a series of awareness lectures covering a broad spectrum of stakeholders and society. Our biggest focus is on university students. We go to a number of different universities because that is where you can find tomorrow's CFOs and CEOs. At the moment, when our relationship manager goes to see a client, the meeting has to begin with an explanation of what Islamic banking is, and how it works. Hopefully with the benefit of these training sessions, the CFOs of tomorrow will not need any explanation about Islamic finance. We also focus on professors and lecturers, so that they can educate the local community. We address the regulators and also CEOs and CFOs of existing companies, even those who are not clients of Al Hilal, as they need to have a better understanding of the alternate means of financing that are available. Plus, because we were not reaching out to the general consumer, we gathered together all the imams from the Almaty region to tell them about our approach to banking. Now during their Friday prayer sermons, they spread the word amongst their local communities; this gives us a greater reach.</p><h4>What specific sectors are you currently focusing on?</h4><p>Our focus is on the larger corporates and the government. Within that, we have a broad exposure to the various sectors: oil and gas, transportation, and agriculture. We are looking at the various business lines other banks are involved in that have possibilities and that an Islamic bank can enter based on existing regulations.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the future and what factors will lead to the consolidation of Al Hilal?</h4><p>Our medium-term goal is to test this model in Kazakhstan, and if it is successful, use it as a launch pad for other CIS countries. There have been a number of expressions of interest regarding the development of Islamic banking, particularly in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. Some countries are developing Islamic banking privately, but I am told that it is with the government's strong endorsement. Once they have a workable model they will just approve it. For Al Hilal to move out into other CIS countries there would be one main prerequisite, and one not so important secondary issue. The main prerequisite will be the existence of acceptable legislation. Islamic banking is an entirely new framework. Al Hilal is a bank that is owned by the government, and we cannot take too many risks at this time; reputational risk is very important to us, so legislation is necessary. Secondly, there needs to be a sufficiently justifiable economy for us to go in and start operating, otherwise the model would be different in the sense that maybe from a charitable point of view you would do it, but that is not the model that we do here. For us there needs to be a sufficiently vibrant economy to justify the expansion and that would be the characteristic that we look for. We believe that we are getting to our goal.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nutresa is the fourth largest food company in Latin America, with a total market capital of $6.7 billion. How is the group continuing to expand its portfolio today, both domestically and abroad?</h4><p>In 2013, international sales accounted for 39.5% of our sales, which in total amounted to around $3.4 billion with an EBITDA margin of 14% (proforma figures). This group arose out of the development of several companies, and it was founded almost 100 years ago in the 1920s. The National Chocolates Company was the result of a merger between nine or 10 small chocolate companies, recently branching out into other businesses as well. We have eight business units: cold cuts, biscuits, chocolate, coffee, ice cream, pasta, Tresmontes Lucchetti, and retail food. For the latter we have 500 ice cream stores across Central America and the Caribbean. In 2013 we formed a partnership with Alsea from Mexico in order to open Starbucks in Colombia. We have 41 manufacturing plants, and our products are sold in 72 countries on five continents. As a result of our portfolio, we do not depend on a single commodity, none of which represents more than 9% of the total cost. It allows us to maintain better management of commodity risk. The main commodity today is packaging material. The business model of the Nutresa Group is based on three pillars, the first and most important being people. We have more than 38,000 employees, 12,000 outside Colombia. These are crucial for us because our company has a robust innovation model based on committed and well-trained people. The second pillar is brands, and we have a strong portfolio that reflects the respect we have for local tastes and preferences. We have 16 brands that generate in excess of $50 million. We prefer to consolidate our brands to develop a stronger market status and pursue synergy in marketing our investments. In Colombia, the average market share is 60.5%. During the first nine months of 2014, we have grown 8.9% in Colombia, while the Finance Minister is forecasting GDP growth of close to 4.7%. Over the last eight years, we have grown by 10.6%, and by 7.8% over the last five years. Our strategic region covers those countries in which we operate, from the south of the US to Chile, including the Caribbean and South East Asia. We are also growing in the US. The third pillar is distribution, where we operate our own networks. We serve around 1 million clients with over 11,500 sellers.</p><h4>With regard to the various business units, are you concentrating on any one in particular?</h4><p>In Colombia, for instance, we are present in the cold cuts business, a particularly local segment, and we have a company in Panama and another in Venezuela. Operations in the latter are currently limited at 1.8% of our total sales and 0.5% of liabilities. In Colombia, we have a market share of 73% in cold cuts, and are growing. We are leveraging the currently positive dynamic of the Colombian economy for all of our businesses. Meanwhile, we are also focusing heavily on the biscuits industry in Colombia, the US, and Peru, and have a 53% local market share. It is the most aggressive and competitive environment in Colombia because all the global players are present. But we are growing based on solid innovation. We are building a new crackers factory in Texas to initially serve the US market and to export part of the production. In Colombia, there is always the worry of losing market share due to new competitors, although we have not lost market share in biscuits. In regards to the chocolate business, we have factories in Mexico, Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia, and a 69% share in the market of chocolate bars. In Colombia we also have drinking chocolate and instant chocolate powder. In the coffee business, we have factories in Colombia and one in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, in a joint venture with Mitsubishi, and Takasago International Corporation. There has been a lot of volatility in the commodity price for coffee this year, but we are still leaders in roasted and ground coffee and we are second in soluble coffee in the Colombian market. We have a very good opportunity in Colombia to increase consumption per capita. Even though Colombia is a very good producer of coffee beans, the consumption rate is low. We believe that players like Starbucks can promote new moments for consumption and new preparations, and it can attract young consumers. This can definitely increase rates of sale. We recently bought Tresmontes Lucchetti, the second largest food company in Chile. Through it we acquired instant cold beverages, pasta, coffee, and snacks brands. Chile is growing at a low speed this year but we are still growing more than the country. We are consolidating our synergies in distribution and manufacturing. We are very happy to be in Chile because we have opened the door to a very strong market.</p><div class="quote">“FTAs such as the Pacific Alliance are positive and bring new challenges."</div><h4>What are the most significant investments you've made over the past year to expand your export base in Latin America? How significant an effect on exports have the free trade agreements (FTAs) had?</h4><p>FTAs such as the Pacific Alliance are positive and bring new challenges. It all depends on how you prepare to take advantage of the possibilities that these agreements bring. Grupo Nutresa is present in Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Mexico, among others, and, at the same time, we are present in Malaysia. It is not just luck; it is related to our preparation to be in the right place and use the productive platforms available. We look at FTAs as a two-way relationship. We will not only have access to raw materials and technology but also to markets. Let's look at Mexico. It is a big country. We believe that with innovation and a strong value offering we can increase that market and be part of its growth, and our location in Mexico has easy access to the ports so we can export from there. We can sell there and send it to other countries in the region, including the US, which is a strong neighbor, so Mexico will improve its own capabilities and experience the direct impact of US growth. This will be promoted by our new plant in Guadalajara, for which we expect to have robust sales the first three months of next year, and which adds to our current facilities in Mexico.</p><h4>What was the strategic purpose of forming the Oriental Coffee Alliance with the Mitsubishi Corporation?</h4><p>Our first coffee export to Japan was made in 1961, and our relationship with Japan is long-term in nature. We decided on the joint venture Oriental Coffee Alliance in order to develop the coffee market in Asia, especially Southeast Asia. We have a coffee factory in Malaysia but the plan is to develop the market through commercial efforts. In addition, potential acquisition opportunities in the region will be considered. Looking toward the future, we hope to expand the alliance to other categories in the region, mainly in Southeast Asia. We perceive opportunities not only in coffee, but also in instant powdered drinks, chocolate, and others. The interesting thing about the joint venture with Mitsubishi is the combination of capabilities. We are a diversified consumer goods company, while it has the local knowledge; we are combining our strengths in a region full of opportunities.</p><h4>What are the key elements of Nutresa's 2020 strategic action plan?</h4><p>Our main goal is to double the size of Grupo Nutresa by 2020 and maintain our EBITDA margin at a rate of 12-14%, and that should be achievable through the combination of strategies we are currently pursuing. We believe that we will reach this goal of offering consumers our products and experiences with strong, beloved, and well-known brands with good distribution and affordability. To reach our goal we will work strongly on innovation, we will invest a lot of money in human resources, and diversity will become even more important.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Redco Construction—Almana distinguish itself from the other construction bureaus here in Qatar?</h4><p>Redco Construction—Almana is a local company and one of the key players in the construction market. We established Redco in 1998 from scratch and today it is one of the top five companies in the sector. What makes us different is our capabilities, our name, the types of jobs we have done, and what we are currently doing. There are a lot of clients who want to work with Redco because we deliver high-quality jobs on time; this is one of our policies. We have established sister companies to cover any gaps in the construction field, like ready-mix, aluminum, glass, electromechanical fit out, and facility management. We have made Redco successful and our vision for the future is to make sure it remains one of the top companies in the market. Our policy is to be a local contractor with international standards, and we are achieving this today by winning major projects solely as Redco. For example, we have just been awarded the Doha Oasis project, which is the biggest private sector project to be awarded this year. We have just completed the Handball Association Complex, which was recorded as the fastest sport facility project completed in Qatar. We designed and built the stadium in 14 months. Redco was also granted one of the most sophisticated projects in the market, the Qatar Foundation Research and Development Complex. This project was designed and built in around 14-16 months. On top of this, we have an ongoing project in The Pearl and two towers already under construction in Lusail. In 2012 we have completed prestigious hospitality projects, such as Intercontinental the City Doha, Crowne Plaza Doha, and Viva Bahriya 11 &amp; 17 at the Pearl-Qatar.</p><h4>What is currently your focus in further developing Redco Construction—Almana?</h4><p>We have obtained the prequalification for all the 2022 FIFA World Cup stadiums. For the last three to four years, we have been working to convince the market that local companies are capable of doing megaprojects. We were the local contractor for the mockup stadium, which was successfully handed over before the FIFA Committee's visit for the World Cup bid, and it was completed in five months. We are selective with the clients that we work with. We are not in every project in the market because we are making sure that we go with the right client and that we deliver the job on time at the highest quality. You have to be aware of requirements; this makes a big difference to the success of the project. Furthermore, it is important to make sure that you have the right people working for you.</p><div class="quote">“We have obtained the prequalification for all the 2022 FIFA World Cup stadiums."</div><h4>What would you identify as your main strengths?</h4><p>There are challenges when it comes to delivering a project on time, but we are well known for handling such challenges. We make sure that the job is delivered on time so that our clients are happy and so that we can establish a long-term relationship with them. We also do not compromise on quality and have a huge quality control team. Lastly, we have always been one step ahead when it comes to ensuring high welfare and safety standards for our laborers. We were one of the first local companies to comply with the requirements set out by the Labor Department, doing so before it became compulsory. We provide the highest standards for our workers in terms of healthcare and accommodation, and we make sure that any problems are investigated immediately. All of our projects are monitored by Qatar Foundation and by the Labor Department.</p><h4>What is your policy in order to minimize the impact on the environment during your projects?</h4><p>Construction jobs increasingly require a certain level of sustainability to be achieved. We have established a consultancy firm called BG2 for all sustainability and green requirements. They are also supervising our projects to make sure that we can add value. It is a new trend in Qatar, but it will be a requirement for most of our projects, like it was for the stadium we recently built. The desire to build a sustainable project should come from the client's side because it saves money for the client in the long term.</p><h4>How is Redco Construction—Almana preparing for the imminent boom in construction in the run up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and what challenges do you foresee?</h4><p>We are flexible in our ability to grow. Redco Construction—Almana has around 6,500 workers today and the possibility of bringing in another 2,500 depending on the requirements of the market. We are targeting megaprojects and moving away from small projects. I think we can handle any challenges we face because today we have reached the point where we wanted to be. The 2022 FIFA World Cup is one of the major targets for us because it will complete our vision of where we are going.</p><h4>How do you see Redco Construction—Almana developing in the next five years?</h4><p>I think the company will grow according to the market. We can expect to be very busy for the next four to five years. We are targeting prestigious jobs like stadiums, hotels, resorts, and so on. In the next five to six years there will be a lot of new resorts in Qatar and the country will be attracting many tourists. The country's infrastructure needs to be properly managed and, if that happens, Qatar will reach a different level.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Turkey for Abraaj's growth?</h4><p>We've been exploring Turkey since 2005. It was a very important market that we  believe has significant underlying growth factors in place. It has a very young population, with an average age of 29 years, which means that you can genuinely reap the dividends that come from this demographic profile. Coupled with high rates of urbanization (the country is as urbanized as Europe, with 85% of the population living in urban areas), you have a compelling growth story.  We're also intrigued by the growing middle class, and it's projected that another 7.5 million households will enter the middle class by 2020, and that fits with the trends that we look for globally at Abraaj. We did our first deal in Turkey in 2007, the Acıbadem Healthcare Group transaction. We exited that deal in 2012, and that has continued to build our confidence in the market. We continue to see long-term growth with strong underlying factors that underpin this growth for Turkey, and we've accordingly considered Turkey to be our regional hub, one of six Abraaj hubs in the world, from which we manage our investments in Turkey and Central Asia. We continue to plan to increase our investment activity in Turkey. To date we've invested close to $844 million, and we've returned in excess of $800 million back to our investors through five exits. We've exited all of our first cycle of investments back to the investors, so what we see now are our current investments, for example Yörsan, which is a leading dairy company in Turkey. The fact that we've returned all our investors' money is a very important statistic. We've returned more capital than all of the locally active private equity companies in Turkey combined, and so we're very proud of that statistic. We've proven not only that we could build a local entity on the ground, but that we've been highly successful with it. We started off small, whereas we now have seven investment specialists based in Istanbul, and we expect that number to increase further next year. We also have two investment specialists for Kazakhstan who manage our Central Asian activities based out of Almaty.</p><h4>What kinds of acquisitions is Abraaj looking for in the Turkish market?</h4><p>We're looking across all sectors. While we are essentially sector agnostic, there are defensive, high growth sectors we do like, such as healthcare, education, logistics and transport, retail, and the consumer services segment. Those are the sectors where we've seen particular potential and where we have a globally successful track record. Take the retail market for example: store-based retail is growing in the double digits, and we also see online retail as being a huge market, because it's growing seven times as quickly as store-based retail. So when we look at factors and trends, we're very focused on how we build our target portfolio. When we're building our target portfolio, we focus on key sectors where we see significant growth and then drill further down into those sectors to identify the strongest opportunities. In consumer services we find food and beverages to be an interesting growth area, especially considering the phenomena of the rising middle class, increasing urbanization, and dual-income families. Once again we like the midcap segment; an enterprise value of less than $500 million is what our focus will be, because we believe that's where the growth engine is for Turkey. That's where you have the largest number of companies, and it's also where you see a lot of high-growth businesses that require smart capital. Such businesses are also looking to bring on partners that can not only bring funding to the table but also help institutionalize a corporate framework and bring value-added knowledge to the table. When we look at partner companies, a key principle is alignment. We don't see this as a transaction, we see it clearly as a partnership, so we take our time up front understanding the partners that we're going to go into a long-term relationship with, and understand if we have the same alignment of vision, strategy, and shared approach toward long-term and sustainable growth. The second thing we look for is the underlying robustness and stability of that platform. For us it's very important that we're investing in defensive companies that have the ability to grow and expand. Thirdly, and probably the most important element for us, is the value that we bring to the table. When we look into a deal right up front as part of our due diligence process, the key aspect is to see the value that we're bringing together and how we can become a genuine contributor to the success of this business. This is manifested in various ways: it can be helping to grow and regionalize the business within Turkey or outside of Turkey leveraging our experience and our know-how. It's about bringing a corporate framework and institutionalization to help their business grow. If I were to give Yörsan, as an example, it is the leading dairy business in Turkey. It also happens to be a  family-run business and we were in contact with the family for 18 months, so that will give you an idea of the significant amount of effort, resources, and time that goes into building a genuine partnership. As a family-owned and run business it's very important for them to feel comfortable with us as a potential partner.</p><h4>What kinds of opportunities do you see in the real estate sector at the moment?</h4><p>We have one significant real estate investment in Turkey, which is Republika. We partnered with BGI, a real estate fund based in Turkey. We have a lot of respect for the organization and the team. We were exploring ways that we could work with them, and the most relevant transaction that came up was Republika. Republika is an interesting project that focuses on driving the student housing segment in Turkey. It's a massive opportunity; because when you spend time in the country you realize traffic and housing are significant issues. Even if you live in Istanbul you find parents prefer to place their kids in the Republika housing community so that they're closer to their university and don't have to spend so much time traveling in traffic. So that's our first real estate project in Turkey, and we think there's a lot of potential in student housing. We also think there are good opportunities in commercial real estate in Turkey. There's a shortage of good quality commercial real estate in Turkey. As the rate of urbanization increases and as Turkey continues to consolidate its position as a regional hub, we anticipate that the demand for commercial real estate will continue to grow.</p><div class="quote">“While we are essentially sector agnostic, there are defensive, high growth sectors we do like."</div><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of Odebrecht in the Magdalena River project, and how did it collaborate with Valorcon to bring about this project?</h4><p>We are a global company, so when entering new countries, we always find local partners. This enables us to better understand the communities in which our projects are based. For the Magdalena River project, we searched for a partner that had broad experience in the execution of infrastructure projects, as well as knowledge of the area in which we were going to operate. For example, we chose Valorcon, which is from Barranquilla, to develop projects such as the Cartagena-Barranquilla highway. It seemed appropriate to maintain such a strong association for the Magdalena River project. This is of great importance for us, as we always aim to transfer our know-how and technology to local companies.</p><h4>What are the synergies between your two main projects in Colombia, the Ruta del Sol and the Magdalena River?</h4><p>We have the synergy of the same structure we put in place for both projects; despite the fact that they are radically different. We could even have used the same office location in Barrancabermeja to reduce costs, but there are other elements such as the fact that we will be in charge of these two projects for some 13 years, and that both are infrastructure projects of importance in boosting Colombian GDP. This is a challenge and responsibility for us, and one that we are more than happy to take on.</p><div class="quote">“The assigning of risk in this project has been well defined."</div><h4>How will the Magdalena River project contribute to making Colombia a more competitive market?</h4><p>It will reduce transport costs significantly. Some studies show that the transport sector will save up to $200 million annually thanks to the Magdalena River project. It will also contribute to the reduction of carbon gas emissions, and many companies will opt to transport their goods on the Magdalena River. Additionally, many towns along the river will also benefit from such a major project. All in all, Colombia will improve its competitive edge as a result of the project. In fact, the impact of this project will not only be economic, but also social. It will generate job opportunities for local communities, and will contribute considerably to their development.</p><h4>What differentiates this project from other public-private partnerships (PPPs)?</h4><p>The assigning of risk in this project has been well defined and apportioned between the state and the private sector, which has encouraged more applications for the tender. We must comply with several requirements to win this project, but I think potential social and environmental risks have already been mitigated. The state will not be financially involved in the project until all completed functional units are delivered. It has done a great job and all the rules have been clearly set out. In this context, Odebrecht's technologies and capabilities give us confidence with regard to the fulfillment of our responsibilities in this historic venture.</p><h4>What have been the main challenges facing the projects Odebrecht has already completed in Colombia?</h4><p>We are about to start executing work on the Magdalena River project. One of the main advantages of this project is that all of the considerations related to environmental and social licenses have already been resolved, whereas in projects such as the 4G-highway between Cartagena and Barranquilla, we faced many problems due to these issues. The main challenges we faced in this country so far have had to do with licenses. Of course, every project has its own particularities and in each of them you get learn new lessons that help you to avoid problems in future projects.</p><h4>How are Colombia's PPPs affecting foreign investment?</h4><p>The country has a robust law for PPPs that encourages the private sector to push their projects. Odebrecht decided two decades ago to start investing in infrastructure, and the Magdalena River project is the best example of this. PPPs are a good way to develop key infrastructure projects, and I think that the private sector sometimes does not need to expect anything from its public counterpart, as such projects are not necessarily the responsibility of the public sector. Colombia has a unique opportunity with the PPP scheme, but the country has to make sure that the law is applied and respected, and that everybody knows their rights and responsibilities. The 4G road infrastructure project is one of the largest in the history of Colombia, and that in itself demonstrates the opportunities it offers to foreign investors.</p><h4>What are some of the projects Odebrecht has targeted for the near future in Colombia?</h4><p>We have analyzed certain private initiatives and targeted public sector projects in the water treatment sphere, and also regarding the Bogotá underground, a project that in my opinion requires private sector participation. We are also looking at certain urban highways in Bogotá and other cities. However, the Magdalena River is one of the largest projects for Colombia over the coming four years, and it is an honor for us to be part of a national project of such importance as we strive to complete our responsibilities as soon as possible and guarantee the unparalleled effect it will have on Colombia's economy.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What changes is the education sector in Oman seeing?</h4><p>The education sector has evolved quite significantly over the past 40 to 45 years. Though it has been a gradual lap toward success, the country has achieved its goal of creating a firm and secure educational background that cannot be impaired in any way due to the complex process in which it was developed. This is because our mission was to initiate a sound and effective education system through embedding activities with practical and innovative ideas along with supportive learning environment that define success for students and train them to think as individuals and to develop missionary goals, which will evolve into the creation of a more advanced ability of understanding the mindful creation of new ideas, which will no doubt raise the number of geniuses. They will definitely contribute successfully and enormously to the development of the education system in Oman, and predominantly SQU. In this sense, the university has thoroughly conducted many seminars and symposiums that aim at honing students' skills, particularly practical and educational ones, and is currently working to hold a symposium in October 2014 by the Secretariat General of the Education Council of Oman, where the Council will present the vision for the education sectors and bring about further developmental concepts for the future of our education.</p><h4>How would you characterize access to higher education in Oman?</h4><p>Private education relies comprehensively on the government. In effect, the Ministry of Higher Education distributes all the graduates after considering their degrees and grades within the colleges in the region. Accordingly, this in itself confirms a cooperative connection between the private and public sectors. To date, SQU has been ranked as one of the top priorities in the selection of places where high school graduates intend to enroll for their studies; more than 3,000 students annually are admitted at SQU. The Ministry of Higher Education sends about 1,000 students abroad for the same reason and SQU hosts 200-300 international students a year, all of who get to experience different cultures. And that, by itself, provides an opportunity to them to expand their fields of view, make them more open to new knowledge and expertise, as well as expose them to different languages.</p><div class="quote">“We have had over 40,000 graduates in different majors."</div><h4>What milestones has SQU achieved in recent years?</h4><p>We have had over 40,000 graduates in different majors, from the College of Engineering, Medicine and Health Science, Science, Education, Agriculture and Marine Sciences, Arts and Social Sciences, Nursing, Law and Economicsl and Political Science, since the inception of the university. The university has expanded significantly since it was established and today accommodates around 17,000 students.</p><h4>In which research areas is the university contributing to the advancement of science?</h4><p>SQU spares no effort to adopt measures to develop a strong research base that would effectively support the educational process, contribute to the Sultanate's social and economic growth, and add to global knowledge. SQU has witnessed a steady increase in the number of publications produced. For instance, the number of journal publications has dramatically increased to about 145% as it was 419 in 2000 and increased to 1,027 in 2011. In terms of conference publications, the number has risen by 136% from 253 to 598 over the same period. Additionally, in 2012 the number of papers published per faculty member per year was 1.1, which rises to 1.7 when considering conference publications. Furthermore, a total of 394 books were published by SQU faculty members between 2000 and 2012. The main areas of interest are Medicine followed by Science and Engineering and Agriculture and Marine Sciences. Besides that, we have some specific areas related to Remote Sensing, Geographic Information Systems, Omani Studies, Environmental Studies, Oil and Gas, Biotechnology, and Humanities, which have always been in our focus. The university also tries to address domestic issues, such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Other than that, we have also started focusing on autism, which has publicized the social impact and gained major interest and popularity in the community.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Prince Sultan Cultural Centre (PSCC) project evolved from an exhibition center into a massive multi-use real estate development?</h4><p>It was initiated by HRH Prince Khaled Al-Faisal in order to have a Jeddah exhibition and convention center. The idea started from this, but that was during the late Prince Sultan's life. We wanted to do something that carried on his name because he was well known for his charity and his support. Projects such as this are normally executed by a city's municipality, or by the Chamber of Commerce, because they don't usually make money as a development. Such projects only benefit the city once you have an exhibition; they become part of your tourism sector. At that time, we thought we had to have another business opportunity that could support this project and sustain itself. From that, we knew we had to create more business-oriented projects. We thought about what Jeddah needs and what it is known for. In the early days Jeddah was also known for its healthcare tourism. There were more private hospitals located there than in any other city in the region. We decided we should revive this business again, and hence we looked at establishing a medical park. Having the two anchors, namely conventions and exhibitions, and secondly the medical aspect, this megaproject was one of a kind. Our aim was to add value to both Jeddah and the country as a whole. Also, the different components needed to compliment each other. We worked to bring in top medical operators from the US, such as the Methodist Hospital from Texas. They are leaders in certain areas, such as cancer and heart disease. To achieve this high standard of healthcare, we also needed to bring in doctors. There are outstanding doctors here. Then, we needed to have proper housing and lifestyle options for them, and from that, proper schools for their children, and then universities, and then shopping centers. In this way, the project came together as a lifestyle and wellness concept. We have a large park as well, and we decided to use that. We wanted to introduce golf to Saudi Arabia; therefore, we established a golf academy where people could learn and play golf. Secondly, We wanted to make this city a benchmark for the future. We did a lot of work in terms of investment into how to make this city a smart, environmentally sound city. We are introducing new systems, such as district cooling, automated garbage collection, water and sewage, fiber optics, and telecommunications technology. It really is a unique city.</p><h4>What economic effects will the PSCC have on the city of Jeddah?</h4><p>Beyond having a social impact, it will also have an economic impact. We are not developing the whole project ourselves; we are developing the city, but we are also giving the opportunity to businesspeople to come and invest. They are the ones that are going to develop the hotels, schools, and sub-developments. In this way, we have created a chain of economic impact for the businesspeople of Jeddah. We have created the opportunities for companies and businesspeople to come and invest. This project will also have an impact on employment. With this and the medical park, we have created 5,000-6,000 jobs. We have created opportunities for people to work in the hotels, restaurants, medical facilities, exhibition spaces, and much more. Again, it is the aim not only to produce profit for the investors, but also for other reasons—we are creating jobs and a lifestyle for our children.</p><div class="quote">“Beyond having a social impact, it will also have an economic impact."</div><h4>How much interest is there from investors in the project?</h4><p>Around 70% of the project is already committed. This is from local and international investors. We aim to have international associations. For example, for the medical development, any party that wants to come in and invest in a hospital has to have an international partner. With this, we have attracted foreign investment from Europe—Austria, Germany, and France. Even the hotels, schools, and exhibition areas have international operators as our partners. They are bringing in their own equity. We have already started construction on some of the projects, including the mall. The mall is local, but it is a strong operator. We have started the infrastructure and cultural center development work. We have also started the design work for the project, including for the hospitals, schools, and universities. Hopefully by the beginning of 2015, we will start to see construction coming out.</p><h4>Where do you see the project by the end of 2015?</h4><p>We are hoping to have people living and going to school here by the summer of 2017. By the beginning of 2018 the hospital will be open to the public. We are hoping that it will be three to five years maximum for the project to open. The project is being developed on a lease basis; therefore, participants are now paying rent. The components depend on each other. For example, the school needs the housing, and the housing needs restaurants. They are all connected, and as such they have to finish at the same time.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Medical tourism is a highly profitable global phenomenon with tremendous potential for further growth. As an expert in the field, could you talk us through this new global trend?</h4><p>Medical tourism is the sector seeing the most growth within the health industry, by 25% a year. It represents at least 2.5% of travelers per plane, and the figures differ depending on the source. The Medical Tourism Association (MTA), which is based in the US, claims that about $60 billion is generated by medical tourism. That includes not only medical, per se, but also odontology and wellness in facilities such as spas. Medical tourism is growing rapidly because the world population is aging and becoming more affluent at rates that surpass the availability of quality health are resources, along with the long waiting lists in countries like the US and Canada, and the high cost of medical treatments; the first cause of bankruptcy for individuals in the US is health problems, making up 50% of cases. The US alone has 120 million people without dental insurance and 50 million people without health insurance, and sometimes even if you do have insurance there, the prices of treatments are still higher than if you come for the same treatment to countries like the Dominican Republic. People want cheaper and high quality treatments and travel for services like dental implants, cardiology, orthopedics procedures, oncology, checkups, weight-loss surgery, and plastic surgery. All of these represent the main areas of demand for our local clinics.</p><h4>The government of the Dominican Republic has been focused on developing the tourism industry, but will this make a difference in the medical tourism segment?</h4><p>Medical tourism is a segment that helps to grow and diversify what is on offer. The key factors are quality, safety, certifications, JCI and ISQUA accreditation, and health centers of excellence. Not everybody can be a candidate to offer medical tourism services, as international criteria must be met. First, you have to comply with local criteria, such that the center needs to be licensed by the Ministry of Public Health and the professionals should be part of the medical college and their medical specialty society. In addition, the hospital should be certified and have international departments that manage the entire patient experience, and optimally accredited by the joint commission international (JCI). In the Dominican Republic, there are three centers working toward the accreditation process (Hospital General de la Plaza de la Salud, HOMS, CEDIMAT). Medical tourism is not a simple task. The goal is not only to give medical treatment; you also have to provide logistics support and a concierge service. Similarly, you need a person that coordinates the conditions for the tourist, where they are going to stay, the agenda, language assistance, the consent, financial matters, the follow-up, second opinions, and numerous additional services. Medical tourism should never be about lower prices alone. The main focus should be the patient experience, quality, safety, and great results. I strongly believe that the nation should work more closely with Medical Tourism Association (MTA) certification programs, also with the branding, destination guide, strategic planning, legal, and quality support to meet our goals and become a world-class medical tourism destination. My experience being a Medical Tourism Specialist certified by MTA, attending its congress and continuing education programs, has been fantastic and was the inspiration to establish the Dominican Health Tourism Association. The actual implementation of a medical tourism strategy has been partially the responsibility of the private sector, but we are looking for international strategic partners, public and private alliances, and the formation of clusters to unify and become a solid player.</p><div class="quote">“We have a culture of hospitality."</div><h4>Medicine is a unique field of study requiring high levels of practical training and continuous learning and development. How would you assess the relationship between Dominican universities and clinics and the workforce in comparison to other countries in the region?</h4><p>Certified medical facilities in the Dominican Republic are modern and staffed with qualified doctors who speak English and are highly trained, receiving education on par with doctors in the US. The Universidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE) is the leading medical school in the region and has state-of-the-art facilities and an international training center. Many physicians have also studied abroad at world-renowned universities, so patients can make savings on medical treatments without compromising the quality and safety of the services. We are working diligently toward recertification, and looking forward to promoting a quality stamp to identify the hospitals that are up to standard in terms of human resources, and not just in terms of facilities or technology.</p><h4>According to an article published on your website, there is an opportunity for the development of health tourism through the creation of Medical Free Zones (MFZs). Could you talk us through this vision?</h4><p>There has been much discussion related to the possibility of establishing such zones. The MFZs in the Dominican Republic have many advantages in terms of tax exemptions and logistics support. The advantage of establishing an MFZ is that you could establish an already-certified hospital in the Dominican Republic and enjoy certain tax exemptions and freedoms. This would then allow the center to maintain special relationships with insurance companies in other countries and attend to patients on a larger scale. If it is a place that is going to be secure and will have the same doctors and technology that they have back home, they can save 30% to 40% on a procedure. This would actually encourage international patients to visit us, and not cause competition among local doctors. We need to raise the bar on quality and improve the safety of those international patients who visit the country. We need a differentiating factor, because if we are going to pursue medical tourism in the Dominican Republic on a large scale and want to compete, we are already 10 years behind countries like Mexico or Colombia. To be on the map, we already have a great strategic location. We enjoy social peace, and great capacity, and excellent hotels. We have a culture of hospitality, but we need differentiating factors to compete more effectively. MFZs have the potential to make a real contribution to the Dominican Republic. Besides, we already have over 200,000 patients with international insurance going abroad to seek care. This would be a great way to retain our own capital. Any model that we choose has to be in consensus with the authorities because we need to promote the destination.</p><h4>How extensive is the current traffic?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic receives more than 4.5 million visitors a year, some of whom inevitably have accidents or get ill, and subsequently seek treatment, a situation not be defined as medical tourism as it is reactive. The country's plastic surgeons saw over 1,000 patients in 2013 but, of those, many were absent Dominicans living abroad. Together last year, Grupo Rescue, HGPS International, CEDIMAT, and HOMS saw at least 20,000 international patients. Today, we are gathering information in cooperation with the authorities to obtain clearer statistics and work with more solid data.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[insuring-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most significant factors for the company over the last 15 years?</h4><p>The first company was launched in September 1998, meaning we have been in the reinsurance business as brokers for over 15 years. We had a defining moment when we relocated our head office from Cyprus to Beirut. By moving and setting up in Beirut, we have recruited highly qualified, experienced individuals with international exposure and know-how. Since 2004, we have also been recruiting fresh college graduates through an apprenticeship program so that they can gain experience and meet international standards. The team is our strength. In the financial services industry, we also need the vision and ambition to do something meaningful and make an impact. In 10 years, we became one of the major players in the region, and since 2008 we have been ranked among the top three and since 2012 the largest in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Is that thanks to the EuroMena Fund Investment?</h4><p>The investment from EuroMena has a different perspective. Since 2008 it has helped us institutionalize our shareholding structure, as well as help us with corporate governance and the expansion of the group in its relations with investors from outside Lebanon. Therefore, its support has helped us grow.</p><div class="quote">“We have been able to provide solutions to insurance companies through the structuring of innovative programs."</div><h4>What are the most significant ways in which Chedid Re's corporate governance has changed during this time?</h4><p>Year after year we have enhanced our structure, processes, planning, internal control and risk management all under the supervision of the board. The direction and strategy is set by the board. The ambition to expand is continuously monitored and challenged by very experienced directors. Every step is well studied and prepared in relation to value creation. We always look for sustainable growth with the long-term well-being of the group in mind. Our board comprises Charles El Hage as Vice-Chairman, Charles was the Managing Partner and Senior Vice-President of Booz Allen Hamilton in the Middle East, Romen Mathieu, who is the Managing Director of the Euromena Funds, and Sami Chedid, who has over 30 years of insurance experience. Our Advisors to the board are HE Ziyad Baroud, former minister and a very active lawyer, as well as Aldo Cardoso, the former President of Anderson France and Anderson worldwide, who is a current board member of a number of French-listed companies.</p><h4>What are the main trends in the Lebanese insurance sector at the moment that you are trying to accommodate?</h4><p>Lebanon is one of the most profitable markets in the region. The market is much smaller, but net profit in the insurance industry is doing well. The shareholding structure of the companies in Lebanon makes them different. The reinsurance market is attractive in Lebanon, whether it is treaty or facultative. The insurance industry in Lebanon needs government support, because the rules and regulations are outdated. We have an insurance commission trying to do the best it can to improve the industry, but it needs a new comprehensive law. The minimum capital requirement is $2 million, but if you compare that to other countries in the region, the minimum base capital is around $20 million in most countries. To be in line with the 21st century, there needs to be reform in the sector.</p><h4>You service over 270 companies in Lebanon and the region. How are you expanding your portfolio, and what is special about the services Chedid Re offers?</h4><p>Our offices in Beirut, Riyadh, Dubai, and Limassol service over 270 companies in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. Today, all insurance companies in the region know us and the solutions we provide. We have a specialized team that understands the requirements of the companies in the region. We have the trust and support of insurers and reinsurers throughout the world. We have been a Lloyd's cover-holder since April 1999, which means that we have underwriting authority on behalf of Syndicates there. We also underwrite on behalf of other global players, with Partner Re being the latest company that signed an agreement with us for financial lines. The range of support from European, US, Asian, and Middle Eastern reinsurers is impressive, and they are keen to support us because of our expertise, integrity, and ethics.</p><h4>You have a strong focus on product innovation and providing risk management solutions. In which areas have you innovated?</h4><p>We have been able to provide solutions to insurance companies through the structuring of innovative programs. If you provide a plain vanilla solution, anyone can do that; however, we have been different, which is why we have grown. In terms of risk management, if you look at the construction industry for example, we have a team of engineers that understand the risks involved with the construction industry, and have been involved in providing risk control solutions to our clients. We are one of the largest reinsurance brokers handling financial institutions. Our market share across the region is substantial. In Lebanon, if you take bankers blanket bond coverage for financial institutions, we have a 60% market share.</p><h4>How much value-added does Chedid Re's regional presence bring to your clients?</h4><p>It is all connected; you must have the people and the talent, and they must provide solutions that add value or you do not get the business. A few decades ago, business was about friendships and relationships, but now 90% of the business is done because you produce valuable solutions. Reinsurance is a business where you protect the balance sheet and reduce the volatility in the results. Reinsurance is also an alternative to capital by providing capacity through a combination of risk transfer mechanisms. This business is complex, and you need to understand the requirements to service your clients. We have engineers, lawyers, and actuaries involved in our team. I cannot think of any other broker in the region, even internationally, that has a team of 140 people between all our offices that can offer the same level of localized knowledge and expertise.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind the founding of SEIB Insurance company?</h4><p>That was an opportunity that came up due to the growth expectations we had in Qatar and the vision and ambition of our partners. We realized we can service and add value to Qatari companies and its economy. Qatar is a market for large and complex risks that require major support from the reinsurance market, which is our core strength.</p><h4>Do you plan to start any more companies under Chedid Capital Holding?</h4><p>As an insurance company, no; however, we do have plans to open new offices for Chedid &amp; Associates, which is our insurance broker brand name. Chedid &amp; Associates is an insurance broker located in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE and we are planning to expand. As for Chedid Re we have new offices coming up soon.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of Standard Bank's 120 years in Mozambique?</h4><p>The past 120 years is not just the history of the bank—it's the history of the country. It reflects everything that Mozambique has gone through. We have seen some substantial changes over this period. The world has seen changes, and we as a bank have. More and more companies and sectors are looking to Africa to invest in now. Africa is definitely starting to awaken, and if you are there first you have every opportunity to maximize your position and your returns before everyone else discovers the good thing we discovered 120 years ago. As a business, we have seen dramatic changes, in everything from technology to the economy. Today there are branches across the country where people bring in their money, and as technology changes and people change their behavior, you will see more use of electronic banking and not cash because people can use their cell phones. That's what we've learned over the last 120 years: the world keeps changing, Mozambique keeps changing, and we need to keep changing. Only the values you have as a business don't change; value, integrity, and customer service—those things don't go out of fashion.</p><h4>What are the strategies for Standard Bank in Mozambique for the next five years?</h4><p>The strategies revolve around what is happening in the resources sector in Mozambique because that's going to drive economic development here. As a bank, we have been very involved in the infrastructure sector. It's absolutely fundamental for the success of any operation in Mozambique that the infrastructure actually functions; proper infrastructure is required to meet the needs of the investments being made. For example, we have been involved in financing the railway line for coal, the ports, the Nacala Airport, and the road from Maputo and South Africa as well. Infrastructure, for us, is absolutely key. When you talk about resources, you are not just talking about assisting businesses in Mozambique, but you've also got to look at the stakeholders around them and ensure that the project goes ahead as smoothly as possible. As a bank, you have a great opportunity to see the whole picture around your customers, especially if you know them. You can understand what their needs are. At the end of the day, a lot of those stakeholders are your customers. As a universal bank we need to be at the cutting edge of technology developments and innovation to make services to our customers cheaper and more efficient. Thus, together with some growth in our branch network, we will incentivize our clients to use more electronic means of banking.</p><div class="quote">“The past 120 years is not just the history of the bank—it's the history of the country. "</div><h4>What is the type of client you are trying to focus on?</h4><p>I think the key is to try and target the real sectors and all the companies in those sectors. By that I mean that if you are going to focus on coal, you need to focus on the main players in coal, but not just the big corporate interests in the middle, because there are a lot of other stakeholders around them, such as SMEs, and a lot of people working for those corporates. As a bank, you want a value proposition that really takes all of the suppliers and workers for the corporate interests into account, and the government stakeholders as well.</p><h4>What are some of the future trends in the banking industry in Africa and Mozambique?</h4><p>The banking sector is pretty much going to follow the telecoms industry. Branch infrastructure is expensive, but the technology around cell phones makes it far easier to bank than ever before. In the next few years I see a greater and faster adoption of alternative banking channels, like cell phone banking, in comparison to normal branch development in different areas. Standard Bank is working on this trend. We had to make a decision to either keep rapidly rolling out new branches, or look at cheaper alternatives. The biggest obstacle at the end of the day for rolling out thousands of branches is cost. Branches are expensive. The more you move into rural areas, the higher the costs are for telecoms, roads, infrastructure, water, and electricity. Also, it's not as attractive for youngsters to work in a rural area as it is to work in Maputo. When you are trying to attract people into a banking organization, no one wants to work in a rural district. It's gaining the trust of the customer on the other end so that they can get used to seeing not cash, but money on a screen, and that is valuable. If a cell phone is stolen or stops working, they don't lose their money. There's a lot of work that needs to be done around cashing out, where if you need money, there are ATMs nearby. There will be strategies in the longer term around how to cash out. I don't think the branches will die, but there will be fewer over time. I absolutely see the future being cell phone banking, and what you can and can't do on a cell phone. POS is definitely going to accelerate, as is the card business in Mozambique.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Mozambican market for the overall turnover of Standard Bank in Africa?</h4><p>Standard Bank makes the second highest profits in the Mozambique banking system. As a business, we look at what we can contribute to this particular country. We want to be an African player. For us, the real value of this footprint is how we can link customers to other countries around this region. That is what Standard Bank is very good at: linking. As a business, we've grown dramatically over recent years, which is a mirror of what has happened in this economy. We are definitely a very important contributor to the Standard Bank group. There is no doubt that we are a good investment.</p><h4>What is your 10-year outlook for the future of Standard Bank?</h4><p>In the next 10 years, this is going to be a growing business. This is not a mature market, and therefore we are not yet a mature bank. I think we are going to have a fantastic 10 years of growth, especially when you start seeing the new mining operations come on stream and the new gas flows in Mozambique. It will bring a level of cash flow into Mozambique that we've never seen before. We are talking about government tax collections. If this economy keeps growing at the pace it is, you are going to see a very different bank in 10 years. You are going to see a bank that has more than doubled or tripled its size, and is substantially larger with far more complex products on offer as the market gets more sophisticated. We've managed to create more than 10 times the profit in 10 years. We bought the majority shareholding from Santander and, since then, we've pretty much multiplied our profit by 10 and it's been about 10 years. Assets went from $300 million to $1.5 billion in the last 10 years. If the economy presents itself as it does today and continues to get better, there is no reason why we couldn't more than double size of the bank. That's quite an achievement.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on the mandate of the Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON)?</h4><p>SON is a government agency that acts as a national standards group for Nigeria and is also involved in the quality assurance of all products. Our regulatory regime is limited to non-food and non-drug items. We do not handle food or drugs, except at the level of the elaboration of standards. All standards in Nigeria are elaborated in line with international practice. Our role has actually dovetailed into being part of a trade facilitation team. For example, if Nigeria wants to promote exports, the typical Nigerian exporter does not understand the standards in Europe. It is our responsibility to ensure there is enough testing so that when Nigerian products are exported, they are not rejected. All around the world standards are the LCM of business transactions, because standards define what people want. If, for example, there is a standard for cement in Europe, and we lack our own standard, we adopt the standard of the European market, making it easier for us to trade with those nations. We also create so-called Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) between countries allowing them to freely trade with one another. Our role is not limited to the original mandate of quality assurance. Any product entering Nigeria must be certified by us, especially those classified as life-endangering products such as tires, reinforcement bars, or toys. Therefore, standards must define the relevant health, safety, and environmental impacts. There is also a performance role. If a foreign manufacturer has been breaching standards, we have the responsibility to blacklist it from selling in Nigeria. We have not fine-tuned this, but we have created a better base today for ensuring that such manufacturers and their local counterparts are not allowed to deal in Nigeria, from whom we block access to foreign exchange in cooperation with the Central Bank. In 2011 there was a huge volume of substandard products in Nigeria, and we observed that the nation had effectively experienced deindustrialization. Local manufacturers found themselves competing with substandard products. Yet the fight is on, and we are taking it beyond Nigeria in order to set a pan-African standardization precedent.</p><h4>You recently outlined an agenda with multiple strategy points for SON. What can you tell us about this?</h4><p>Firstly, it is essential to improve the competitiveness of Nigerian-made products. Secondly, there is no quality control infrastructure, in other words, no accreditation body. And neither do we have a peer review mechanism with other accredited organizations in other parts of the world. Therefore, our test results are not yet applicable in Europe and America, as a result of which our exports lose substantial value. So we are currently working on establishing quality infrastructure and creating an accreditation body. In another example we have a metrology laboratory, but need to upgrade it to a metrological institute. We also need to harness the private sector through public-private partnerships (PPPs). Thirdly, our agenda is to create awareness by engaging the consumer in Nigeria. To achieve that, we also have media engagement and make certain the media is sufficiently trained and manage to disseminate information about what we are doing. Fourth, aggressive conformity assessment helps us to make sure that products imported from China are tested there by certified companies before being shipped. The system, while improved, is not yet 100% perfect. We are set to conduct a review at the end of the year because, looking ahead, we are keen to deepen our relationship with SMEs, which comprise the bulk of the economy, contributing the most to GDP and employing the most people. To maximize their efficiency we need to engage them in awareness of each other's particular offerings. For example, a community that assembles vehicles loses out to China if a client wants to purchase engine oil and lubricant, despite the fact that companies just two kilometers away are able to provide them, thus benefitting the local economy. Our responsibility is to create such linkages.</p><div class="quote">“Firstly, it is essential to improve the competitiveness of Nigerian-made products."</div><h4>You recently decried existing laws and regulations against fake and counterfeit products. What kind of regulation needs to be imposed to ameliorate this problem?</h4><p>What we are trying to do now is create new penalties, as the highest penalty in place today is a mere NGN50,000. If I were a dealer of substandard products, I would read the law and just pay NGN50,000 on those products. What we have tried to do is rewrite the mandate in the area of infringements and penalties to introduce a custodial penalty. Indeed, the law has gone through the lower house and is currently in the senate, and may be passed before the end of 2014. The SON should also have prosecutorial powers. Right now, only the police and the legal units in government can prosecute people.</p><h4>What would you offer to foreign firms keen to partner with the agency?</h4><p>We need partnerships in the area of standards elaboration. Some of the multinationals have certain experience in areas where we do not have the relevant experience. And so that is an area of collaboration; they teach us. Secondly, Nigeria has developed an auto policy, but we have not developed the capacity to certify vehicles. We need to be able to build that capacity, to have the knowledge base to be able to certify these vehicles, and to be able to check them against the established standards. Also, we need people to set up testing centers and set up standards development organizations.</p><h4>What are the goals you have set for the organization in the coming five years?</h4><p>In two years we will have an accreditation body and within the next four to five years we should have an efficient quality infrastructure in Nigeria in the areas of metrology, conformity assessment, and standards. Because we do not have this today, it creates challenges for everybody. Our exports do not attract enough international interest. We also have to create stronger collaboration with people within Nigeria—the government and NGOs—in such a way that when a product leaves Nigeria with a mark of quality, it actually can withstand the test anywhere. Also, we are working on products that have value added. For example, in the 21st Century Nigeria should not be exporting natural products in their crudest form. I believe that engaging the SMEs is key in this. I have just made a rule that every standard that is developed must have one SME as a member. We are also involved in certification, but we have decided as a pilot we want to take some SMEs and get them certificated within the next year free of charge. Then we will get them up to standard. Most of the SMEs in Nigeria are food sector-based, and we need to get people into other areas. With the SMEs, it is about quality, and if we can get them up in quality, they will find the markets. And so I will put a lot of energy into SME development.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about your company and your activities in Peru?</h4><p>We are present in 11 countries: Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, Panama, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Jamaica, and Israel. We are a power generation company headquartered in Peru, our main market of operation. In Peru, we have two power plants in operation, with an aggregate 1,060MW capacity. One is called Kallpa and the other is Las Flores, which we acquired from Duke in 2013. We have two projects under construction, one being Cerro del Aguila, which is a 510 MW hydro plant and an investment of almost $1 billion. The other is Puerto Bravo, which is a 720 MW plant, and a $400 million investment in southern Peru. It was bid on by the government to create demand for the future pipeline to the south, by promoting the construction of two power plants to assure that there is ultimately a market for the gas to be transported. We started operations in 2007 in Peru and have become one of the major players in the country. We are growing quite quickly, and we are developing additional projects to maintain this high level of growth.</p><h4>Historically there is little precedent for tendering power plants in Peru. What does this new strategy imply for you?</h4><p>The government decided to start tendering for different technologies, which is something we do not fully agree with. We argue that most decisions regarding new investments, locations, and technologies should be determined by the market. Meanwhile, we are concerned that the government's independent tenders for many new technologies could lead to an oversupply in the system. They are allocating all the energy growth, as well as some of the existing demand, for new projects to such a degree that there is no market for the existing players to compete for. In the particular case of the plant we were awarded in the south, the bidding is for a reserve plant with guaranteed revenues, which implies low returns. That is something on principle that we do not normally do, as we would rather compete in the market and commercialize energy with a potentially higher margin. However, today there is a scarcity of gas in Peru, although there are a lot of gas reserves to be released and used, particularly in the south. We felt that if we want to be an active player in the future in terms of growth, the best way to assure gas is to build one of these plants in the south. In the short term, we will build the plant and operate as a reserve. In the long term, when the pipeline is ready, which we expect to be complete before 2020, we will be allocated gas to convert these units, which will give us a new wave of growth. We will have four turbines with 720MW in aggregate, operating in open cycle, and will convert them to combined cycle for over 1,000 MW. It was a strategic move in order to be the first entity to receive gas in the long term. Sometimes the excess bidding by the government to promote new technologies is not completely aligned with the growth in demand, as their growth objective is often outdated. They are concerned about the lack of supply. We are concerned about oversupply as we are a poor country and run the risk of spending too much to build capacities that the system does not yet require. The government is so concerned about the lack of supply that it is pushing toward oversupply. We are in the opposite position and believe that there is too much capacity to be paid without enough market demand. We think that the market should determine new plants based on price signals, contrary to politically determined projects.</p><div class="quote">“Hydro is a manageable energy source as well, while solar and wind are not."</div><h4>Recently, renewables have become competitive with even the cheapest conventional energy sources. Are you planning any renewable projects in Peru?</h4><p>We are not considering any solar or wind projects in Peru. Although Peru has relatively good conditions for these two energy models, they remain more expensive than conventional energy sources. Conventional sources include hydro, which is also renewable. Hydro is a manageable energy source as well, while solar and wind are not. They imply more indirect costs to the system because you need other plants to act as backup to mitigate volatility in wind and solar generation. Even though the government has implemented some processes, we do not want to invest in technologies that we see as overly subsidized. Subsidies can change over time due to political reasons. What's more, we believe that Peru should not rely excessively on non-conventional renewables because hydro is a better and cheaper renewable energy. While hydro can be sold at $70 PER WHAT?, solar would be sold at $120. The first tenders were for $220. As a country, we should not pay for such technology while there is a better and cheaper alternative widely available. These bids have taken place mostly due to foreign construction companies and equipment manufacturers that have lobbied quite a bit to push to install their technologies in Peru, due to the downturn in Europe.</p><h4>Could you tell us about your hydro plant?</h4><p>Peru's energy mix is a 50-50 split between natural gas and hydropower, with 2% to 3% derived from other sources. This makes for a combination of two manageable, cheap, and clean energy sources. The project we are building is one of the last cheaper of hydro plants that are less than $2,000 per kW. It is a 510 MW project costing $910 million and İS scheduled for completion by 1H2016. We sold a part of its energy under government promoted bid. We are still looking for new hydro plants, and have found that the construction costs of hydro plants are becoming more expensive, not only because the best locations are already taken, but also because of recent negative experiences in the construction of other projects in the country. All things considered, prices for new hydro plants are between $2,500 and $3,500 per KW, with capacity factors around 70%. It is still lower than other renewables, but not as cheap as it used to be.</p><h4>What about future projects?</h4><p>Our intention is to actively pursue growth throughout Latin America. The hydro project was a learning process, trying to finance a billion-dollar project in Peru during a crisis. We achieved it through a loan from 12 banks from nine countries, which was not easy to deal with. We discovered the merit of reducing the size of our project, and are now looking for projects in the $500 million ballpark.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the Mozambican market for Vodacom's African operations?</h4><p>Vodacom Moçambique is an integral part of Vodacom Group in southern Africa. Obviously, we are neighbors of South Africa, sharing a land border with it, and are close to Vodacom South Africa, as well as important for the Vodacom group. We are also connected to Tanzania, which is connected to the Congo; therefore, we are a link between the entire international group in southern Africa in physical terms. That footprint is continuous and something that, as a group, we will be looking to leverage moving forward. More and more large companies are entering Africa, and frequently have investments in multiple countries. They seek one multinational company that has operations in multiple geographies to be a one-stop shop providing all their services. On that level, Vodacom Moçambique is an important part of the group.</p><h4>How has your market share evolved over the past year?</h4><p>We have been gaining market share over the past year, primarily driven on the back of significant network growth. In 2013, we expanded our network by 70% with our largest-ever investment. In 2014, we have so far increased our network by 50%, which I think will give us the second-largest network in the country, and we certainly cover all the main population areas and are merging into the rural areas. We have also invested heavily in 3G coverage because as data is the future. Every young Mozambican is on Facebook now, so we are going to be part of that trend.</p><div class="quote">“We have been gaining market share over the past year."</div><h4>What are your key priorities for the coming five years?</h4><p>First, we want to continue expanding our coverage of rural areas, and then we will continue to add 3G coverage to increase access to the internet. After this, we hope to continue growing our M-Pesa offering, as financial services are moving increasingly toward mobile-based solutions due to its convenience and the many unbanked Mozambicans. It is difficult for the conventional banking sector to roll out branches all over the country to reach everyone in Mozambique. We, therefore, complement the banking sector with our coverage in voice, data, and M-Pesa.</p><h4>How does mobile banking in Mozambique compare to other countries in Africa?</h4><p>It still has some way to go, and our goal is to catch up with Kenya, which everyone is currently lagging behind. Kenya started three or four years before us, and in two or three years' time we want to be where it is today. M-Pesa is present, and many use it, as they no longer need to carry cash. Without the need to visit a bricks and mortar branch or cash point, you simply take care of all transactions by phone.</p><h4>How do you tailor services to your corporate clients?</h4><p>That largely depends. There are corporate clients that come in at an Africa-level, meaning that they already have contact with Vodacom or Vodafone. We service them as part of that contract. Then, there are companies that enter the country and set up locally to grow their own businesses. Many subcontractors come here, and we do our best to target those customers, too. In terms of corporate customers, we hold around a 50% market share.</p><h4>What are the business opportunities for Vodacom derived from all the activity in the north?</h4><p>They are quite simply huge, and much of the network has indeed gone north. We cover all new roads being built, as well as the new cities, towns, and infrastructure being built. It is easier to provide internet and voice coverage using our technology.</p><h4>How would you describe the existing telecommunications infrastructure?</h4><p>It is rather good, and once you buy a SIM card here and another in South Africa, you can make your own call using the one offering the better network. When you compare the networks in Mozambique against those in Europe, you find that they are actually quite good. The former gap between the developed and emerging markets is no longer the case. People here want the same quality of service and internet speeds available in Europe, and we have to provide that. Consumers nowadays are tremendously well educated; and if they find the local network poor or slow, they complain. The good thing is that we benchmark ourselves here in Mozambique and also in developed markets, and I think we compare well.</p><h4>How would you characterize Mozambique's rate of technology adoption?</h4><p>A large portion of the population in Mozambique is young. The youth adopt technology much faster than older people. Indeed, the adoption of technology here will continue to be driven by the tremendous number of young people in Mozambique, because they pick it up faster. The potential is massive as about 60% of the population is under the age of 24.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the core focus of Credicorp Capital?</h4><p>Peru has been growing significantly over the past decade. Most of our Peruvian clients were well served within Peru, registering domestic market growth followed gradually by a regional presence in such markets as Chile or Colombia. While we could serve them well in Peru, we lacked the necessary resources to help them enter regional markets. That's when we thought there would be a space for what's going on in the Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano (MILA), or this part of the Pacific Alliance. Every day numerous Colombian, Chilean, and Peruvian companies invest in other markets. What's happening in the real sector in terms of investment is that we've built this investment banking platform to support not only companies, but also individuals and institutional investors that are starting to invest all over our region. That's why we first created BCP Capital, an investment banking group, in Peru, as a spin-off of assets out of BCP. Later, we acquired a majority stake in Correval in Colombia and IM Trust in Chile. These acquisitions plus BCP Capital became Credicorp Capital. If you look at South America, you have Brazil on one side, which is huge but has its own dynamics, and then Colombia, Peru, and Chile, all having similar economic and political models. Individually, we are quite small, but if you add up the three of us, it amounts to 90 million inhabitants with a GDP of $800 billion. More companies and people will start investing in a regionally connected economy, and we realized that such a platform would better serve them in investment banking, asset management, and sales and trading. Those are the three main businesses on which we focus on this platform.</p><h4>How will you react to falling commodity prices and how will that affect debt issuance and Credicorp's activities?</h4><p>We all feel that we are not going to see the same commodity prices in the near future. However, the Peruvian mining sector is highly competitive on a cost basis, even amid prevailing prices. That will not affect the actual debt issuance that this country needs, because the infrastructure deficit is said to be $90 billion and growing. If we are going to finance many such programs, we can expect local and international financing participation, depending on scale. That is something that we are going to be greatly active in. Ultimately, even though Peru has done well over the past decade, it remains a poor country that will need to grow by between 6% to 7% per year for the next 10 years to reduce poverty and become a developed nation.</p><div class="quote">“We all feel that we are not going to see the same commodity prices in the near future."</div><h4>Do you think there has been overinvestment in Peru's mining sector?</h4><p>Here, no. I think that you will see many new projects arising in Peru. The good thing is that the debt levels in the mining sector are very low. Many of these projects have already issued new debt, such as Freeport-McMoRan for the Cerro Verde expansion. Grupo Mexico will probably issue some bonds in the international markets, but I don't think there are any restrictions on money being available to finance them. Only between institutional investors in Colombia, Peru, and Chile you have more than $500 billion in resources. Money is not a restriction, and good viable projects will be developed and should not have problems with the needed financing.</p><h4>You just launched two new funds, as has Mexico, which plans to enter MILA. What is the future of those funds?</h4><p>We built a Luxembourg-based platform that covers Colombia, Peru, and Chile. I think that we are strong in each of these countries, but what we wanted to achieve with these funds was the cumulative effect of investors approaching the three countries as an investable proposition. Many investors don't have the necessary capabilities and knowledge to invest in the region. We live here and should therefore know the region better, but, if you want to attract investment from the Middle East or elsewhere, without having in place a platform that complies with all regulations, you won't be able to do so. We need to play the game on a global, rather than a local basis. And this is precisely what the new platform allows.</p><h4>The Bolsa de Valores (Lima Stock Exchange) is heavy on mining currently and some predict negative effects from the recent drop in commodity prices. What is your view?</h4><p>The Lima Stock Exchange (LSE) has always been a mining exchange. About 50% of the market capitalization or more has been weighted on mining companies. I'd like to see other sectors active on it, but the situation is such that we have traditionally been a mining country and will continue to be one. Therefore, much of what happens at the LSE will depend heavily on the fate of the mining companies. The year of 2013 was a particularly hard one amid declining commodity prices, which reflected in the price of equities traded on the LSE. The mining companies' prices lost around 40% of their value, which given their overall weight, negatively impacted the index overall. There has been a slender rebound this year as prices have stabilized and some have even risen. Nonetheless, the performance of those companies often depends more on external factors than on the plight of Peru.</p><h4>You recently signed a deal with S&amp;P Indices to promote your index. Where does this fit in with your growth strategy?</h4><p>The LSE has had a number of indices in the past, but the problem with each was that none of them were investable due to poor liquidity, the chief concern at the bourse that curbs trading volume. We need to work on how to boost liquidity and  the market and have indices reflect that liquidity. We need to find a way to make it. This is why we joined up with Standard &amp; Poor's. They are specialists in selling the indexes to the international markets and they will help us promote the market and increase liquidity.</p><h4>What is the climate in Peru for international investors?</h4><p>The LSE recently reduced trading costs by 70%, which is significant. But, with this 70% we are not as competitive as we should be. Actual volumes haven't increased substantially as a result of this price reduction, as on top of these costs, brokerage costs are also incurred. In the past, infrastructure cost was 20 basis points (including SMV and Cavali). That declined to 10 basis points, but if you add 50 basis points on top of that from brokers, the reduction is much smaller. A second consideration is that Peru is alone among the Pacific Alliance to levy a 5% capital gains tax, which renders us less competitive than the other two members. Liquidity simply moves to a more efficient market. On a typical day at the LSE, the average traded volume will be around $15 million. But for Peruvian companies trading in New York, it's going to probably be $150 million to $200 million. This poses the question of whether there is liquidity in Peruvian companies. And while the answer is yes, that is not the case on the LSE. It will take a lot to bring that liquidity back home. Simply removing taxation would make it much better and we could do a lot of things to increase liquidity, the fundamental limitation curbing LSE performance.</p><h4>What role do you expect the LSE to play in broader national development in the coming years?</h4><p>The main advantages that the stock exchange brings are transparency, liquidity, and good pricing. This said, transparency in particular is key. If we are going to attract investors, both internal and from abroad, we need to make sure that companies, be they listed on the LSE, or not, are complying with the highest standards of governance. Something we should be focusing on, and indeed, something we are still working on as a market and as a nation is corporate governance and transparency. As long as we are seen as a highly competitive, transparent, and well-governed exchange, more companies will be keen to come and list on it, and that culture will permeate throughout the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Haji Husein Alireza &amp; Co. Ltd. developed its business, and what lies ahead?<br></h4><p>We were established in 1906 as a family company, which we remain to this day. We have also been engaged in a diverse range of businesses. In 1926, we entered the automotive sector, becoming one of the first automotive importers on the Arabian Peninsula. The first car we imported was a Fiat, but shortly thereafter we entered into an agreement with Ford to launch its models locally, too. Over the years, we have come to represent numerous brands, such as Nash and Hupmobile. Until the 1970s, we were also present in sectors such as food and building materials; yet, we decided to specialize in the automotive sector. Today, we prefer to offer a variety of brands that address a diversity of needs. We sell German truck-maker MAN, as well as Peugeot, and we have represented Mazda in Saudi Arabia since 1968. In 2012, we signed a partnership with Geely, China's largest independent auto manufacturer. We represent Aston Martin, which should give you a fuller idea of the scope of our automotive offering. Nonetheless, we shun competing products, so as not to cannibalize our brands. We also purchased an IT company called NATCOM, which is a hardware and solutions provider, 15 years ago. It was established in 1978, and is one of the oldest and most experienced IT companies in Saudi Arabia. We provide IT technology and services for both the public and private sectors. We have other businesses that are related, for example, by offering financing to our customers, which has also given us a foothold in the finance market. The nature of our company means that we have a solid presence in every corner of Saudi Arabia, also owning substantial real estate to support our businesses. Thus, by default, we have also become a real estate developer. In fact, one notices that most family companies in Saudi Arabia tend to be diversified into many different businesses.</p><h4>In the automobile market, Geely is relatively new. How does the market perceive that brand relative to a more traditional one like Mazda?</h4><p>The good thing about the Saudi market is that it is open to all the players, as long as they comply with Saudi regulations. This means that a wide variety of car manufacturers are represented here, competing on a level playing field. The good thing about Chinese brands in general is that they are cost effective, and provide the same features as their competition from the US, Japan, and Europe. Local people are becoming attracted to them as they are very well priced. Now, it is up to the vehicles to stand the test of durability and longevity to establish a loyal customer base. We were actually surprised by how quickly the Chinese established a foothold in our market, and I foresee an interesting future for them.</p><h4>Where do you envisage large family groups in the future once regulatory changes take place to open up the market?</h4><p>Some of the companies listed on the stock exchange started life as family businesses and have evolved that way. I think that the important point here when talking about regulations is that they have to help companies with modest family beginnings to become contributors to the economy. Regulations should help them take the next step to becoming publicly traded companies because such entities contribute to the economy, not just in terms of GDP, but also employment. In order to secure the future and continuity of these organizations, you need to take them away from the non-business pitfalls of being a family company that have the potential to hinder their progress. We need regulations that encourage and reward these family organizations that are important to the economy to help them transform, firstly to ensure their continuity, and secondly to give opportunities to other investors to contribute to their growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Growth & Diversification]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[growth-diversification]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Abdulaziz Alsaghyir Holding come about?<br></h4><p>Our company actually started over 30 years ago, and the business was largely built around contracting and trading. My brothers and I subsequently decided that the best course of action was to head our own companies, with separate operations, management, and profiles. That was more than 15 years ago. At that time, there was a national boom in contracting and trading, and, being a civil engineer by profession, I decided that this was the right field to be in. Then, on a continued growth path, we diversified into investment, both local and international. Perhaps one of the major investments we made was when the government decided to liberalize the telecoms sector. It was the second license in Saudi Arabia. I was one of six business people bidding for it and fortunately proved to be successful, paying around SAR12.5 billion for the license. Since the inception of that company, known as Mobily, I have been the Chairman. Luckily, its performance has been fantastic and we see it sustaining the same trend of excellent growth in the future. We have also been dealing with other investments, in the banking, equity, and real estate markets, both locally and internationally. When our company started to grow, we established a vision for bigger projects, such as airports and infrastructure in association with well-known companies. Today, we are bidding for airports and several other projects. In addition, we have also, in collaboration with other businesspeople, established a type of corporation for international investment.</p><h4>Where do you see the most potential for growth and investment in the Saudi economy today?</h4><p>Growth has mainly been in the infrastructure sector. There are many airports and railroads being built, be it the expansion of existing infrastructure or new projects. The last two years have seen many new projects take shape, and I think this is where the growth will be for the next few years. In addition, I have observed a rise in the services and petrochemicals sectors. Meanwhile, the huge investment in petrochemicals will spell potential for the downstream industry.</p><h4>Are there any plans for regional or international expansion?</h4><p>Yes, we have established a new division at our firm called the Alsaghyir Food Company. We plan it to be a flagship operation, and have already commissioned the consulting firm and started acquiring companies, both locally and internationally. We are talking about the takeover of several companies in the UK, Turkey, and the UAE. Rather than opting for the greenfield approach, we thought it best to take over existing companies with growth potential, and this is what we are doing today. The business scope will encompass the processing or importing of food, and expand vertically or horizontally.</p><h4>How do your operations move the country toward a more diversified economy?</h4><p>We have no businesses in oil and gas. Unfortunately, our economy is, to a large degree, dependent on oil. There are several things we cannot do, such as agriculture. In that respect, one of the only paths involves petrochemicals and related businesses. There are also opportunities in mining, but we really need to utilize the downstream sector. Services could also be improved and better utilized.</p><h4>What are your feelings on renewable energy in the Kingdom?</h4><p>The government is keen on renewable energy, although it has been expensive. Yet with new technology, it is starting to become affordable. Even though we have a steady supply of crude, the government is starting to notice an increase in the local consumption of oil. Officials are considering solar options, in addition to perhaps establishing a department for nuclear energy. This is all because of increased local demand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What services do you provide to the Saudi Arabian people and where is the council positioned in the network of national healthcare and private providers?<br></h4><p>The health insurance law was announced by the Saudi Arabian Royal Cabinet in August 1999, and the law aims to cover everyone working in the private sector, be they Saudi or non-Saudi nationals—around 12 million people are targeted by this law. It does not cover public-sector workers. The health insurance system constitutes around one-third of the Saudi health system. The Council of Cooperative Health Insurance (CCHI) is an independent governmental agency that seeks to govern the lawful rights of the insured. The main stakeholders are health insurance companies, employers who pay the health insurance premiums, and the healthcare providers. The CCHI's task is to ensure that the law is carried out to the satisfaction of those covered. Healthcare service providers, including public and private healthcare facilities such as Ministry of Health hospitals, have to register with the CCHI to be eligible to treat insured patients. The Minister of Health chairs the CCHI board, which consists of 10 council members. The CCHI shares responsibility with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA). SAMA regulates the insurance companies as a financial entity; they regulate and control the financial aspect of the health insurance sector, including the solvency issue. SAMA applies the insurance companies' law. The employers are fundamental stakeholders. The CCHI deals with other stakeholders, too, and they're represented on the board. They are the Ministers of the Interior, Health, Finance, Labor, and Trade, and the Chamber of Commerce, as well as government healthcare providers and the insurance sector. The CCHI expects groups to be targeted for health insurance, such as visitors to Saudi Arabia, whether for business, leisure, or educational purposes. Another issue is universal health insurance, which is awaiting a government decision. There will be health insurance for the remaining two-thirds of the population. It would be a social health insurance system, like those we see in Europe.</p><h4>In 1999, the act that formed the CCHI was amended to require those Saudis working in the private sector to have private health insurance. How did the CCHI respond to that change?</h4><p>When the law was created in 1999, it was applied to non-Saudis working in the private sector, stipulating that it might later include Saudis working in the private sector as well. That amendment came through in 2003 or 2004, and it was up to the CCHI to implement it. We started with the big companies, working our way down through medium to small companies, because we didn't want a bottleneck and we wanted our tools to be ready for everyone. We started with non-Saudis and their families, then Saudis and their families. The SAMA report can also give you a good idea of how the sector has grown and developed since implementation.</p><h4>What are the opportunities for foreign private health insurance providers in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>There cannot be any non-Saudi private healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia. The insurance companies must be Saudi by law and must have a minimum capital requirement of SAR100 million within the country. The company has to be at least 51% Saudi owned, meaning a maximum 49% foreign owned. However, we still see strong potential for major multinationals in Saudi Arabia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where is Sahara positioned in the petrochemicals sector?<br></h4><p>Sahara Petrochemicals was founded in June 2004 and is considered an important player in the Saudi Arabian petrochemicals industry. In terms of rankings, SABIC is the largest player in the petrochemicals sector in the Middle East. Sahara and others are considered good-sized companies in the region in the petrochemical industry. During 3Q2015, Sahara will introduce a new product to the market called Butanol, and this is considered the 10th product to be produced in a little over 11 years since Sahara's establishment, which is like building a new plant every year, and this is considered to be a significant achievement. Sahara's first partnership was with the international company LyondellBasell, and we built our polypropylene plant (Al-Waha) using its Spherizone technology. We were the second company in the world to have this license from LyondellBasell and our plant produces 460,000 tons of polypropylene per year. About 30% of this polypropylene product is different from the normal polypropylene and provides value-added to our product. Sahara's second partnership was with Tasnee, with whom we have built jointly, at Tasnee's site, a polyethylene plant where we produce ethylene and high- and low-density polyethylene. We also produce other products with Tasnee, such as acrylic acid, and this is the first plant of its kind in the Middle East. We have worked very hard with Tasnee in convincing Dow Chemical Company to bring this technology to Saudi Arabia. Acrylic acid is the main product and it is the feedstock to manufacture super absorbent polymers (SAPs). We also managed to convince Evonik Industries, the technology owner for SAPs, to come and build this plant at Tasnee's site. SAPs are the main material used in diaper manufacturing. Thirdly, Sahara also has a partnership with the Saudi Arabia Mining Company (Ma'aden), and we jointly built a plant at our site called SAMAPCO, producing ethylene dichloride and caustic soda.</p><h4>How do you see Saudi Arabia in global petrochemicals?</h4><p>Today, Saudi Arabia is one of the largest petrochemical producers in the world with 70%-80% of the people operating the plants being Saudis. I am very proud of that, especially being a Saudi and being one of the very first people who participated in developing Saudi nationals to do this petrochemical work when I joined SABIC in 1978. I am confident that our Saudi engineers and technicians can work successfully in any petrochemical plant in the world. When Saudi Arabia started in the petrochemicals business in the early 1980s, it was new to us, and very hard to operate and learn, but with the insistence and strong desires for Saudi nationals to learn, nothing is difficult.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the milestones of your M&amp;A division and your key strengths?<br></h4><p>First of all, we have a team of formidable experience in all sectors of Colombia. Our people have worked in the banking, finance, and services sectors for at least 15 years. The individuals on our directive team have to meet three of the four following conditions: they must have at least 15 years of experience; have been a president or vice-president of a large company; boast a great national and international network; and have been working internationally for the past 10 years. Our current group has access to local and international companies. We are identifying Colombian companies that want to grow in their local and regional markets. We look to international investors to invest in these companies. In the past three years, we have closed negotiations valued at over $700 million. We are also involved in the first private-public partnership (PPP) in Bogotá and the Metropolitan Region, a transportation infrastructure scheme, which will be wrapped up in the second half of 2014. I forecast success because the group we are advising has identified Bogotá as representing an opportunity to develop an integrated transportation system in the region. Our team advised specialists from Germany and Spain to participate in the project, which could have a total cost of $1.2 billion. We have a lead time of 18 months for the first line to enter operation.</p><h4>What aspects of the economy do you consider particularly attractive to foreign investors?</h4><p>International investors considering Colombia as an address consider the following points. Colombia has a population of 47 million, of which 50% is aged below 50. There are more than five  cities with a population of over one  million, and the quality of human capital is increasing. Generally, Colombia is more of a proposition than other countries in the region because it is a country of medium-sized cities, including Bogotá, Medellí­n, Barranquilla, Cali, and Bucaramanga. People who invest in this country see that their activity here will be long term because of the age demographics. For example, I work with a Polish company that is one of the largest in Eastern Europe's food industry. It decided to come to Colombia perceiving a difference from other countries in the region. We were in the best position, geographically and otherwise, to provide a base for future growth in the region.</p><h4>Latin America led the M&amp;A revival in 2012. Colombia was third overall with $8 billion in transactions in six deals. Could you evaluate Colombia's M&amp;A activity in 2014 and share your views on the trends you have identified?</h4><p>The M&amp;A trend will remain stable because many companies remain unlisted on the markets, despite being valued at between $30 million to $300 million. When I add up these transactions, I envisage a stable M&amp;A sector for the next five years. There are 30 companies in our pipeline that are keen to be sold. Together, their issuance value stands at around $1 billion. And while not all of these deals will be closed in 2013, they will be within the next three years. I expect companies in the oil and gas services, transportation, and infrastructure sectors to experience the greatest M&amp;A activity in 2014. I also believe the bulk of capital flowing into Colombia will be coming from the US, Spain, Germany, UK, Venezuela, and some from Poland.</p><h4>A number of private equity firms in Colombia are scheduled to exit the country in 2014 and 2015. Could you share your views on the private equity industry and its potential for substantial growth?</h4><p>Five years ago, few private equity firms were coming to Colombia, but now the country's private equity landscape is set to change drastically over the next few years given the potential for sustainable growth. There are many unlisted companies in the market that are growing. Certain companies, like the Rohatyn Group, do not have offices in Colombia, but rather have established alliances with people like me who know the market and the important players in the local market. Right now, I have relationships with 76 private equity firms in the US, Dubai, Canada, and other places around the world. Most of these companies would favor having a partner with which to penetrate Colombia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Colombia's potential to become a global educational powerhouse?<br></h4><p>Over the past two decades, higher education has received an important boost from the Colombian government in terms of improving program quality. As a consequence of this policy, Colombian universities have a solid reputation at the national and international level. Secondly, the student population has increased significantly in the same period and, thirdly, research activities have been consolidated at the most advanced universities. However, work needs to be done in order to improve the quality of regional and local universities not yet benefiting from the national policies. The fact is that only 28 higher education institutions in Colombia out of 286, including Universidad Autónoma de Occidente, have been accredited for high quality standards by the National Ministry of Education.</p><h4>In which fields does Colombia excel in higher education?</h4><p>Since Colombia is a country rich in biodiversity, there has been an urgent need for environmental programs at many universities. Our university, for example, has an undergraduate program and a Master's degree program in Environmental Management. We also offer a course on culture and biology of environmental diversity, jointly with an American university, which is popular with many American students. At the same time, the University is doing significant work on renewable energy in association with national energy providers. This is only an example of the many projects that are now in progress at our university and at certain others in Colombia, in the promising field of environment and sustainable development.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the measures implemented by the government to broaden access to higher education for students of limited economic means?</h4><p>Colombia has taken crucial decisions toward the democratization of higher education over the past decade. As a result, 13% of students at the Universidad Autónoma de Occidente have benefited every semester from the so-called budget quotas, reflected in subsidies and credit lines for students of low-income families, belonging to levels one and two of the Colombian socio-economic scale. In this way, many academically able students from poor families have the chance to study at high quality universities. In this setup, universities assume up to 25%, while the government provides 75% of the total value of these credits.</p><h4>What are the goals of universities belonging to the Mutis network?</h4><p>We are convinced that integration with other universities to combine strengths fosters the development of projects of high social impact. Given that we live in a globalized world, it is necessary to adopt identical operating standards and parameters and pursue strategic alliances with other universities around the world that will contribute to the achievement of our own goals and those of the entire educational system in Colombia. A clear example of the value of the network is design and development of a doctoral program in engineering by the Red Universitaria Mutis, a goal that has been difficult to achieve by each of the universities that are members of this network.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of your Campus for students?</h4><p>Our campus represents the essence of a high quality educational institution in Colombia. We try to provide the best quality of life for our students, since we know that the better the student feels, the better they perform in their studies. Our campus offers a wide spectrum of activities related to welfare such as a leadership school, a social facilitators' school, sports, and cultural facilities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your milestones in the past year?</h4><p>We are continuing to grow very quickly. There has been double-digit, record growth in the region, and subsequently we are investing more here. Today, in Dubai we have more than 1,500 employees, mainly engineers, to cover the Gulf region. We are present in all the GCC countries. It is a continuous investment in local resources to support our growth. More precisely, we have taken two new initiatives in 2014. Firstly, we created a stronger services department with about 450 people dedicated to maintaining our equipment that is installed in various infrastructure in the region. Good maintenance of the equipment allows for more energy savings for the organizations. It is a big focus at the moment for us to invest and to support our customers with this services business model. The other important thing that happened was Schneider Electric's acquisition of a large worldwide corporation, Invensys, at the beginning of 2014. Locally, we are also merging our team with this company. This means about 450 additional engineers are joining Schneider Electric in the Gulf. Invensys specializes in process automation, and is very active in the oil, gas, and water sectors, where there is a strong need for the control and monitoring of processes. It is therefore an interesting element  to add to Schneider's capabilities in the energy segment.</p><h4>Which of Schneider Electric's business segments has the most importance in Dubai and the UAE?</h4><p>We have seven targeted segments that bring us the strongest growth and where there is a strong differentiation in our offer to our customers. The first one is oil and gas, where we have a dedicated team to follow the sector from the beginning of pre-fitting to the installation of our equipment in the field. The second one is water infrastructure, which is very important in this region. We provide not only the electricity needed to treat the water and run the desalination and wastewater plants, but also all the software needed to monitor these plants, with a clear focus on making them save energy. Water is a significant consumer of energy at a country level, so saving electricity in the water segment represents a big saving in global energy spending. The third segment is energy, especially oil and gas. Energy is part of the utility sector in our world. Here what we focus on is delivering electrical solutions equipment and also the smart grid software that allows the utility providers to manage their energy supplies in the most efficient way possible. The fourth segment is more in the real estate segment, especially hotels. There are many hotels in Dubai and across the UAE. The authorities plan to grow the tourism industry, and we are partnering with hotel chains to provide facilities with fully integrated automation for air conditioning, video surveillance, and everything else that is smart. The fifth segment is healthcare. There are a lot of healthcare investments in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the GCC, where we have very specific solutions to provide secured energy in an operation theater, for example. Another segment is data centers. More and more data is needed all the time, and this is where we can provide a full turnkey data center for storing and securing data. The last segment is the smart city concept itself. The point at the country level is to make all the component parts communicate together to have a layer of data control that manages the data, the water, and the grid as one.</p><div class="quote">“We have seven targeted segments that bring us the strongest growth."</div><h4>What is the potential for Dubai to become a smart city and how can Schneider Electric contribute to this goal?</h4><p>I think Dubai is already a smart city to some extent, and there is a big focus on bringing it to the next level. For example, there are a number of data and operational services you can do with public services through your smartphone. Now they want to go to the next level, and in every public entity we do business with currently, there is an extremely strong focus on transforming themselves into a smart entity. We provide a lot of training for these entities. Schneider Electric is well recognized in this field globally. We are one of the top three companies worldwide in terms of creating smart cities, along with Cisco and IBM. And we are already recognized as a strong player in the region because we have been present for 30 years and are heavily involved in regional development. The Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) is just one example, monitoring the energy grid and also monitoring the controls in buildings, such as hotels.</p><h4>How important are public-private partnerships (PPPs) in developing the energy sector in Dubai?</h4><p>I think they are critical. The public sector will operate the energy sector. It can be the utilities or the oil and gas sector. However, private companies would provide the people who can design this sector, as per public entity wishes. There is a way to find the right expert private companies to deliver and build these infrastructures. It is obviously essential and important to have these types of arrangements and understandings between the public and private sectors, and I think it is already happening.</p><h4>Dubai is developing an integrated energy strategy to improve its energy matrix by 2030. What are the main challenges that Dubai has to face in this sector?</h4><p>The smart grid is really something that Dubai should embrace, and we have high-level workshops with DEWA and other authorities in this area. Demand is clearly rising in the Dubai energy sector, and there are several initiatives by the Dubai government to try to control this. One is being carried out by DEWA. It has a department called Etihad Energy Services (Etihad ESCO), which specializes in doing energy saving work on existing buildings. They encourage the private sector to save energy by retro-fitting their buildings with better technology that will allow their buildings to consume less. This is the demand side of the issue, where we can decrease the consumption of energy through existing infrastructure. Schneider Electric is the main provider of this type of technology for these buildings. Then there is the production side. In every country and city, there are certain seasons where you consume more than in other seasons. All of this should be managed to properly dimension new investments into producing new plants. This is about demand response technology managed by a smart grid. It's about supply. It's important to monitor this consumption based on data so that we can adapt production in real time. In the UAE there is certainly some progress needed on smart grid implementation. It's also one of DEWA's main priorities at the moment to be able to produce just enough energy in accordance with what customers need in real time, while not overproducing and creating more of a carbon footprint.</p><h4>What are your main plans for investment in the region in 2015?</h4><p>We will continue to invest heavily to accompany our growth and support our customers. The services area is something that will continue to grow. In these emerging countries, companies are usually focused on building, and then they forget to maintain what they have built. There is a real demand for that and on energy efficiency because when it's not maintained, it's not energy efficient. Utilities in the Gulf are also something that we are putting a bigger focus on at the moment because there is an understanding that today doing utilities is inefficient. There is a need to develop this smart grid and smart utility approach. That is another area we will focus on specifically in 2015. We will keep the rest of our activities as they are today: oil and gas, data centers, and industrial applications.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors helped Codelpa establish a leading position in the Dominican Republic's construction sector in just two decades?</h4><p>After the expansion of the tourism sector, we decided to focus on construction and today we are the foremost builder of hotel facilities. Codelpa currently has over 10,000 beds in its portfolio of built and renovated hotels. We have also benefited from the favorable conditions foreign investors enjoy here, which has brought many foreign companies to the Dominican Republic to build their hotels. As business expanded, we expanded our operations to other countries; for example, in 2005 we moved into Jamaica, a country where we plan to open a couple of new hotels this year. We believe that Jamaica has great potential within the tourism industry. Codelpa has also developed industrial projects in Haiti, and will explore new markets in the near future.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your current projects, such as Terminal A at Punta Cana Airport?</h4><p>We have two projects in Punta Cana, which we have built in six months. They are breathtaking projects that are in line with the style we have encouraged over the years. Our projects are always completed on time and one of our greatest advantages is the team of young and talented professionals we have. We have invested a lot of time and resources in our people and processes; we are fully certified with ISO 9001 and we have played a very active role in industrializing the construction sector in this country. Codelpa has also invested in many facilities and processes related to the construction sector. For example, we are self-sufficient in cement blocks and concrete.</p><div class="quote">“Barcelo Hotels is one of our major clients right now."</div><h4>What are Codelpa's competitive advantages over other companies in the sector?</h4><p>Our people are our main assets; we have people from the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Germany, Spain, and Haiti who keep us at the forefront of our industry.</p><h4>Who are Codelpa's main clients?</h4><p>Barcelo Hotels is one of our major clients right now. We also built for Grupo Martinón, Royalton, NH Hotels, Bahia Principe, and many more. This shows our flexibility and ability to produce at international standards. Regarding our business activity, this year we focused on strengthening our HR department in order to improve the training of our professionals. We have also built bridges with the higher education sector to provide our staff with other development opportunities. In addition, closer ties with universities will allow us to spot new professional talent.</p><h4>In October 2013, Codelpa was recognized as the best construction company in the tourism sector for 2005-2012. What is the importance of such an award in terms of building customer confidence and attracting new clients?</h4><p>These are two very important elements in our business. This award was bestowed by the Chamber of Construction, based on our impact in the tourism industry, making us the most important local company in this regard. The Association of Hotels also reinforced this prestige by highlighting how we conduct our operations from a business point of view. This substantiates the way in which we have managed to become a reliable company in a very competitive market. Over the years, we have partnered with European, Canadian, and US firms, meaning that we know how to adapt our work to their expectations. We are a very flexible company.</p><h4>How would you assess the Dominican Republic's overall investment environment?</h4><p>The current environment is ideal for investment. The Dominican Republic has better incentives than the entire Caribbean put together, with which we actively compete. We have become a very attractive investment destination thanks to political stability, favorable conditions, the affable character of our society, and over 10% growth this year in the tourism industry has been the main economic engine for the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>Since 1980, revenues generated by the tourism sector have increased, from barely $172 million to $5 billion in 2013. How does Codelpa plan to respond to that upward trend and what industry segments do you see the most opportunities in?</h4><p>The economy must be prepped for the growth of tourism. However, we also need to further diversify our business activity. There is also great potential in some segments of the tourism industry as this has evolved over the last few years. We now target a more high-end audience, rather than only the all-inclusive market. For example, there is great potential in the luxury and ecotourism segments. Health tourism could also bring some interesting developments and in my opinion, this may take place sooner than people expect. Finally, we still need to explore the second residence segment within the tourism sector, and take full advantage of our proximity to the US and Canada. We have taken some steps in this regard, but we have yet to fully exploit it.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the Dominican Republic's economy in the medium term and what sectors of the economy (besides tourism) possess the most potential for further development?</h4><p>I think the country will continue to emulate the positive growth trends of the last decade. Apart from the tourism industry, the agriculture and agribusiness sectors have great potential, as currently the Caribbean region sources these products from the US. We have a lot to contribute to these markets. Organic agriculture is another segment with interesting prospects. The country has yet to fully explore economic cooperation with the US in terms of exports. Also, the increasing investment in education—right now there are 15,000 Dominican students around the world enjoying a scholarship—will boost the service- and IT-related business areas in the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When and how was the GZA Group established?</h4><p>We have a history of over 35 years, and have now consolidated all operations into the GZA Group, which was originally called Zardman and Renaissance Holding. Renaissance deals with the BeitMisk Project, which concerns Misk Town—a 70,000 sqm residential village with retail services. Zardman, on the other hand, has 104 buildings ongoing, and is managed by my children.</p><h4>What was the total investment in the BeitMisk project?</h4><p>The original investment was around $200 million, and the project will take 10 years. In the beginning, we did not need that much equity. I believe that over the coming one or two years, another wave of consolidation will take place. We have some business today in Erbil, in a significant project with an area of 200,000 sqm. We are also in the process of establishing some work in Africa, which will also be a megaproject.</p><div class="quote">“Emaar, the company that built the highest tower in the world, the Burj Khalifa, is assisting us in almost every aspect."</div><h4>How has the business portfolio developed over the past decade?</h4><p>It was in around 2008 that I fully committed to working in real estate. The first major real estate project we did was the retail center at the entrance to the Presidential Palace of Saint Jean. We also worked on two large telecommunications center buildings. There are many buildings like those that we have worked on, but BeitMisk is on a different scale, and occupies well over 50% of my time.</p><h4>What is the range of properties on offer at BeitMisk, and why do you feel it is such a unique project in Lebanon?</h4><p>The properties go from one bedroom to huge villas. There are 2,000 units altogether, and it can accommodate up to 12,000 people. There are currently 400 families living in the project, and we are starting the downtown for BeitMisk in the latter half of 2014. We have an occupancy rate of 100% for the units already built. Many of the apartments that we are still building have also already been sold. We have connected the infrastructure, such as water, telecommunications, internet, and electricity, and the scheme even uses wastewater to irrigate the green areas. This is giving us an edge over the competition, because we have our own security. We have truly mastered all of the energy-related ins and outs. We have achieved zero pollution, as we use both solar and gas energy. Meanwhile, in our scheme you will never see the wiring, and with the lighting, we use a new advanced system that is energy efficient. It is a masterpiece and unique to the region.</p><h4>How much of the entire project is constructed?</h4><p>Almost one-fifth of the town has been constructed so far, and around 400 of the 2,000 units. The rest of the construction will be determined by market demand. The project land is large enough, meaning that we are not obliged to build all the units simultaneously. We are using less than 20% of the total area, meaning that 80% of the land is given over to gardens and green space. Naturally, the downtown area is pedestrianized, and we have a large club with its facilities spread over a 15,000-sqm area. Still, costs have risen slightly since we began construction, which affects the final selling price. We are now selling at 1.5 to 1.8 times the original price, and it is still rising.</p><h4>How would you assess GZA Group's performance over the last year?</h4><p>We are doing well, but we could be doing better.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Overall, 2015 is expected to be a big year for Saudi initial public offerings (IPOs). What pending IPOs is Saudi Fransi Capital handling?</h4><p>Saudi Fransi Capital currently has a good number of IPOs in the pipeline. We have a significant number of companies shaping our IPO plan. Most of the IPOs we are offering are of medium to large size, as we think that investor appetite is healthy and that companies will continue tapping the Saudi stock market. After all, this market is valued now at a much higher rate than it was back in 2007 and 2008, and even in previous years. Saudi Fransi Capital will continue to be a major player in the equity capital markets, the fields of IPOs, rights issues, and other related transactions. We attribute our current status to the strong relationships we hold with our parent company Banque Saudi Fransi. In retrospect, 2014 was much better than 2013, and we should use 2014 as our benchmark. Therefore, we think that 2015 will be a very successful year.</p><h4>The Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) is set to open up to foreign institutional investors in 2015. How do you see this affecting Saudi Fransi Capital and the sector?</h4><p>This development will definitely have a positive impact on our sector at large. Coincidently, we have established an office in Dubai. Through this office, we are targeting international investors wishing to invest in the Saudi market. Initially, this office was established for our asset management projects and the discretionary portfolios for mutual or real estate funds. We anticipated that the market would open up, but we were not able to predict when at first. Today, we believe that trading volumes will see an increase within this open market environment. I believe there are going to be large amounts of funds coming into the country. Reuter's quoted that $30 billion to $60 billion would be coming in, depending on our admission to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Those numbers, if admitted, will be really small. They will have an impact, as they will encourage more rational trading. I think that the Saudi market is one of the least volatile markets in the world; it is less volatile than the US market, and most other emerging markets. The standard deviation in the Saudi market is very low. For us, the opening up of the market will facilitate matters and bring more business for our company.</p><h4>It is unusual for a Saudi bank to have overseas branches. Do you think this could be a new trend as the market continues to open up?</h4><p>Currently, the subsidiaries of Saudi banks do not have much of a presence abroad, especially for investment activities. The biggest winners with the opening up of the market will be the large international banks, because they already have their clients and they will channel their clients' business to their offices here. We do not have a lot of international clients at present. However, we can increase this client base through our major shareholder, Crédit Agricole, yet we know that this base will not be as large as the client bases of our peers Merrill Lynch or JP Morgan. We have limited access to customers. So for us, opening up a subsidiary in Dubai would serve as our starting point, and we would begin to get more foreign institutional investors into the country.</p><div class="quote">“We are continuously working on strengthening our infrastructure, our systems, and our processes."</div><h4>What opportunity does the Kingdom offer for equity investors in 2015 and what products does Saudi Fransi Capital offer potential investors?</h4><p>In July this year, the Saudi Arabian authorities announced that they will open the $550 billion Saudi equity market to direct foreign participation from 2015. This is the first time in history that this development has been seen in the Saudi market. This is a landmark development, especially in light of the fact that Saudi Arabia is one of the world's 10-largest emerging markets and will constitute approximately 4% of the MSCI emerging markets index if included today, or 60% of the MSCI Frontier Markets index. By market capitalization, the Saudi equity market will be larger than the markets of Russia, Mexico, Malaysia, and South Africa. The average daily traded value in the first 10 months of 2014 was $2.3bn and the market has 167 listed companies across 15 sectors. These companies provide investors with broad access to various investment themes within the economy. The market currently trades at an estimated forward FY15 P/E of 14x with a projected earnings growth of 13% for 2015. Saudi Fransi Capital is part of the Credit Agricole S.A. Group. We provide Saudi equity brokerage access through an online platform and a team of 30 brokers. This team is supported by an equity research and advisory team providing market-leading coverage of listed companies. Additionally, our asset management division has an enviable track record of outperforming its Saudi equity benchmarks in 11 of the past 12 years and we provide investors access to managed portfolios and funds within Saudi equities and physical Saudi real estate.</p><h4>What effect, if any, do you see falling oil prices having on the Saudi stock market or on the Saudi financial sector in general?</h4><p>If this becomes a continuous trend, it will be a cause for concern in the future. The question is whether or not there will be a continuous decline in oil prices. However, in the short to medium term this trend is going to be a cause for concern, because the government is the main player in the Saudi economy. It is seen as the main driver or engine. We have backlogs of three to five years on most governmental projects, which means that we should be okay in the coming three to five years, even if oil prices plunge further. Of course, some sectors, particularly the petrochemicals industry, will suffer if oil prices continue to decline. I think that the sectors that we recommend to our clients, such as retail and consumer products, will not be impacted in any way. Oil prices will also have little impact on healthcare and construction materials sectors.</p><h4>Beyond your IPOs for 2015, what are your other short-term priorities?</h4><p>We are continuously working on strengthening our infrastructure, our systems, and our processes, and that is something that we never slow down on. We have not been active in the field private equity, and this is an area that we are moving into. Our board of directors has given capital for this activity, and we are now in discussions with some companies to become involved in physical equity-related activities. We are active in the debt capital markets and sukuk, but not as active as we are with the equity capital markets and IPOs, and we want to strengthen the team there and be more competitive in that market. We are continuously enhancing our website and trading platforms for our clients, and we are now providing more services. We currently have six different models to offer our clients, and we also want to improve our institutional sales team's capabilities as the market opens further—and we need more talent to join that team. Our focus for 2015 is to increase our sales team and management through positive performance in the current funds and the introduction of new funds.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tanzania is ahead of the curve compared with most African countries in terms of the liberalization of the ICT market. How has this liberalization translated into greater economic efficiency in the overall economy of Tanzania?</h4><p>There has been considerable growth in the communications sector, which can be attributed to the attractive legal and regulatory environment, which enables businesses to run and operate far more efficiently overall.</p><h4>What kind of regulatory reform do you think is needed to increase the level of innovation in the country?</h4><p>The strength of our framework is that it is long term and designed to absorb future developments and trends in the ICT sector. We introduced this framework in 2005, but at that time when we were talking about infrastructure people were thinking mainly about the wireless infrastructure. Our infrastructure was technology-neutral, whereby it did not matter whether it was wireless, fiber, submarine, or digital in nature. This is why the same framework serves numerous uses. The Application Services License is open ended, and has proven useful in both financial services and mobile banking applications.</p><div class="quote">“There has been considerable growth in the communications sector."</div><h4>Have other countries approached you regarding this model?</h4><p>We receive many visitors, and also participate in a number of regional and international bodies. We are members of the East African Communications Organization (EACO) along with Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, and Rwanda. In the EACO, there is a firm tradition of countries sharing knowledge with each other. Southern African countries have the Communication Regulators Association of Southern Africa (CRASA), in which there is a similar exchange of ideas and experiences. The ICT sector features global, continental, and regional organizations. We have held meetings with global companies too, such as ITU Telecoms, based in Switzerland, and also with XO Communications, a satellite communications company based in the US. There is always much to learn from such meetings and conferences, which helps a company figure out how to adapt to fit the local environment. You have to do so in order to expand your horizons, while remaining on top of global developments and developing your own capabilities.</p><h4>What factors would you say are unique to Tanzania's ICT sector?</h4><p>In terms of financial and mobile services, people in the West with credit and debit cards, for example, have no real need for such services. Here, credit card penetration is low, and so is the number of people holding debit cards. Meanwhile, in terms of mobile communications, we have 28 million SIM card subscribers. By leveraging communications and banking you better serve these people.</p><h4>What challenges remain for the sector?</h4><p>Cyber security is a challenge, whether for mobile networks or the internet. Another challenge is the misuse of ICT, be it for negative publicity, pornography, or abusive or derogatory material. One way we are planning to counter this is through the establishment of the Computer Emergency Response Team Regulations (TZ-CERT), which will specifically deal with the issue of cyber security. The TCRA would be the focal point through which we connect all the key structures, such as e-government offices, mobile companies, and banks to mitigate cyber threats. TZ-CERT has been established to deal specifically with such threats. It connects us with the global community, and we will receive warning of suspicious activity or possible threats from foreign agencies, which will then alert TZ-CERT.</p><h4>What efforts are you undertaking for greater nationwide access to ICT, including rural areas?</h4><p>This is another challenge. We have to ensure our communications services cover rural areas as well. We do this in two ways: first, we monitor our license rollout plans, and secondly, our government has established a special institution for this, known as the Universal Communications Services Access Fund. Its main role is to ensure that communications services reach rural areas. The program is still slow, but we will see in the coming years how this goes.</p><h4>There is increasing competition in Tanzania with five main telecom companies operating in the country. Do you think there is room for more competition?</h4><p>The lack of room for other competitors is mainly due to the lack of necessary resources to enter this sector; however, it is a dynamic sector. Most countries have three or four competitors, but we have five, which I consider healthy.</p><h4>What objectives do you hope to achieve in the short term?</h4><p>We need stronger enforcement of regulations to ensure that a high quality of service in the communications matrix, for consumer rights, and to reduce tariffs. Broadcasting has become digitized, which is a significant development for Tanzania. We have already licensed three digital signal disputers, which are already in place. Dar es Salaam switched off in December 31, 2012, followed by Dodoma and Tanga, and then Mosherusha and Mwaza. That was Phase I. In Phase II, we switched off Dobora, Singida, Bukoba, and Musoma. By the end of the 2014, we hope Tanzania will be completely digitized. It has taken two years because we wanted to make sure our legal and regulatory framework was correct, and we also wanted to consult the stakeholders, the business community, the public, and politicians. We had to convince everyone that digitization was about socio-economic development.</p><h4>Where do you think the ICT sector is headed in Tanzania?</h4><p>The future is still bright, and Tanzania has only a 60% penetration rate for telecommunications. There is a lot of potential for growth. In terms of infrastructure, we are laying submarine cables for Dar es Salaam, and then we have the national ICT infrastructure project. Our regional headquarters is connected, so our focus is now on connecting the more rural parts of the country. In digital broadcasting, the major channel will be local content. In terms of internet growth, we need to bring many government services to the web and to mobile devices as well, so we are going to expand our e-government services. In the postal segment, we are changing all the post office boxes into physical addresses.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[heres-the-place]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Zambian International Trade &amp; Investment Centre (ZITIC) is unique, in that it sees the private sector taking on the responsibility of investment promotion. Could you tell us how you came up with this concept?</h4><p>Between 1972 and 1991 the country had a socialist government, and by 1991 80% of the economy was state controlled. At that time, 80% to 85% of foreign earnings came from one industry—copper mining. Therefore, ours was a state-controlled mono-economy. In 1990, we started lobbying for a change in the constitution that would allow for a liberal economy, and the party that was advocating change won the election in 1991. One of the things that needed to happen at the time was the reengineering of the economy. After the elections in 1991, I was asked to become an advisor to the Vice-President and I left my private business, a manufacturing company, to join the government and become an advisor particularly focused on economic management. In 1993 they sent me to Georgetown University to specialize in Transitional Economics.  As soon as I came back I was transferred to the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, &amp; Industry as Director of Industry. They gave me the responsibility of developing policies that would liberalize the economy. We had to come up with new investment codes, new trade policies, new standardization policies, new small enterprise development policies and all the other policies that go into ensuring such a change. This is how we embarked on the privatization program through the Zambia Privatization Agency. In 1996 I moved to work as Permanent Secretary in the Office of the Minister Without Portfolio who is the current President. Later in 1997, I was moved to the President's Office as Permanent Secretary/Comptroller under President Chiluba. Later when late President Levy Mwanawasa took office, I was called to serve as Special Assistant to the President (Special Duties). Over the years, what I have realized is that the government, by its nature, is structured in such a way that it is not exactly private sector friendly. It is a bureaucracy. They take their time, even if an investor is waiting or in a hurry; they will say, “come tomorrow." An investor does not have all the time in the world, as he may have multiple business interests and commitments; he/she may be catching the next flight to the next destination, hence may not “come tomorrow." I noticed that we had lost numerous investment opportunities because of this. When I left government in 2006, I decided that I had to do something that would help investment. Two years after I left I came up with the idea of setting up a private trade and investment center. This is where we are today with ZITIC. We are here to be a friend to investors. We help them with all the legal requirements, necessary registrations to set up their companies, and also any licensing they might need. They do not even need to be here; as long as we have their mandate we can do everything they want us to do for them.</p><h4>What sectors or types of company do you see the greatest demand from?</h4><p>I think that demand is coming from all sectors, especially from the foreign investors' side. We are also providing another service, which is raising financing for local companies. There is demand on that side as well. In addition to this, we get companies that are trying to enter public sector tenders. We get companies that need representation. There is significant demand from manufacturing companies trying to offer their products in the Zambian market. They come to us to connect with local buyers. It really covers all sectors: agriculture, mining, and health. Recently, we have been contacted by UK interests who want to set up private schools here, people from China that were looking for mining opportunities, and someone who wanted a contract for optic fiber installations. So it is a broad range of demand.</p><div class="quote">“I think that demand is coming from all sectors, especially from the foreign investors' side."</div><h4>What do you feel should be the policy priorities in terms of creating a more conducive investment environment?</h4><p>I would like to see the growth of manufacturing in this country. Before this can happen, we have to see public investments in infrastructure and then attract investment into value-adding industries. The biggest export commodity we produce outside the mining sector is corn. However, the current policy mix is not consistent. For example, we are exporting groundnuts instead of exporting peanut butter, and are happy to export sunflower seeds instead of cooking oil. I do not believe there has been a strong enough policy drive to reengineer the economy in the right direction as regards value-addition. Up to now, 50 years after independence, even our main product, copper, is exported in its raw form without processing. It is incredible that such a sizeable country in terms of landmass, natural resources, and population has such huge unemployment rates. We have sufficient capacity, if we would employ the right technologies, to have a job for every single Zambian. In fact, we should be net importers of labor. At a private level, I do what I believe I should do as a Zambian to expose the country to the importance of value-adding. That is my passion. But I cannot do this on my own. I have to get the rest of the Zambian private sector on board. I have to convince them to invest in knowledge.</p><h4>What domestic economic activities do you feel have the greatest export potential?</h4><p>Number one is value-added agro produce. We have the environment, the land, and the climate. We have everything. All that we need is technology. In my opinion, it is the lowest hanging fruit, and this is why I want to focus on the sector. I do not think that we have to look too far. Secondly, I think that we have excellent tourism potential as long as we can maintain our reputation as a peaceful country, and as long as we can develop the infrastructure to support that sector. The latter is an area that still needs considerable investment. Once again, we have the natural resources. We have the initial force to start with. We have the wildlife. And we have to build on that. All we have to do is to sufficiently invest in order to be able to take advantage of these resources. Thirdly, we have the necessary bodies of water for us to produce enough hydropower to supply the whole region. The entire East African region is suffering serious energy shortages. That is another line of business that we can take advantage of. We also have strong winds and sufficient sunlight. I think that we just need to do a little more, get out there as much as we can and attract investment that would help us take advantage of what we have. I am not disregarding the mining sector. There is potential there, too. This country has not yet been fully explored. I think that we need to streamline our approach to the issue of mining rights and licenses so that we can ensure that serious investors come into the sector. We also have to use these sectors to empower local people. I think that these are some of the sectors that can really help to drive this economy forward—manufacturing, mining, tourism, agriculture, and agro processing.</p><h4>In terms of tourism, what specific investments do you think are needed from both the public and private sector to realize this potential?</h4><p>I think that the first thing that we have to sort out is essentials. Tourism means people going somewhere to see something that you have. We need a system that would bring them here. We have to make an investment in an airline. It is a critical component to the success of our tourism sector. A national airline's impact on an economy is very multifaceted. It is not only on tourism. People do not invest in a country that they do not know. When somebody comes to Zambia as a tourist and they see the business potential in the country, they come back as an investor. However, you have to get them here efficiently and at a competitive price. Secondly, I believe that we have to invest in actual tourism infrastructure—roads, as well as hotels and lodges. We have to understand the terrain and explore what is available. For example, the Samfya area is exceptional, yet it is currently unknown in tourism terms. We have the Victoria Falls, but it only takes an afternoon to see the waterfalls and that's it. A tourist wants to go on a holiday for one or two weeks. So we need to take them to Samfya's beaches, which have the whitest sand in the country and on the continent. However, we do not have the facilities or infrastructure to introduce tourists to this area.</p><h4>Do you think that Samfya is currently an investable destination?</h4><p>Yes it is, and I am passionate about it. I have met with the local authorities, and they have given ZITIC a mandate, in writing, to promote it. I think that there is considerable excitement being built around it. At the moment, I am trying to build interest from within the country so that people can see its potential. Moreover, it is the right time for the outside world to know about it and to invest in it. I think it should be the Sharm Al Sheikh of Zambia.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Two years are left until the Winter Universiade will take place. How is the work progressing?</h4><p>We are now in an active phase of preparation because we have already finished all of our operational plans. One of the main problems for Kazakhstan is the lack of specialists. We do not have enough professional staff, especially at a multifunctional level when huge sporting events take place. It is a huge task for Kazakhstan to work on acquiring this technical staff and resolving these sports management issues. Our organization focuses on educational programs as well. One of the things that I mention all the time is the importance of the legacy. We have to think about the overall future of our country and what kind of legacy we will leave after our project. This includes what kind of sports infrastructure and staff we will be left with. If we do this work the right way, Almaty will get a professional team to organize events such as the Universiade and even bigger events. Today, we have a team of 54 people. By January or February 2015, we expect to have around 85 people, including technical staff, competition managers, public relations and marketing departments, as well as medical services. We will have 28 departments and, by the end of 2016, and there will be a team of 1,500 people.</p><h4>From a technical and infrastructural point of view, you have to meet the high standards expected for any Universiade. What kinds of venues and infrastructure will be built, renovated, or developed for the event?</h4><p>For this Universiade, we have three new venues—two sports venues and one non-sports venue. There is an athletes' village for 5,000 people and two ice arenas—required by International University Sports Federation (FISU) standards. One ice arena will be used for hockey—it will have 3,000 seats, and the other one is for figure skating, and the opening and closing ceremonies; it will be a huge arena with 12,000 seats. Each of these arenas has additional ice rinks and one of them has a swimming pool. For training and preparation, as well as relaxation, these are the International Olympic Committee (IOC) standards we must comply with. Other work includes some changes and technical updates to our existing sports venues as well. The Universiade is quite important for bidding for the Olympic Games. After our preparation for the Universiade, a maximum of 10%-15% of these assets will be used to update resources for the Olympic Games. Everybody already knows the level the Universiade will be at. All the standards are set by the International Sports Federations, including the International Ski Federation, Speed-Skating Federation, Hockey, and Curling Federation. We have a special department in our organization that oversees compliance with all the federations' standards.</p><div class="quote">“I think that the promotional activities should start the day after winning a bid."</div><h4>How do you plan to increase awareness about this event, not only among the local community but also internationally?</h4><p>I think that the promotional activities should start the day after winning a bid. We must understand that promotion is one of the most important steps for a project. Even if we host the games at the highest level, without spectators it's not a complete success. Things have not been done properly in the past. That is why it is crucial to do things differently, in the right way, and to involve the spectators and tourists. Currently, our plan is to invite between 90,000 and 110,000 tourists to Almaty for these games. I think we have to pay attention to the local tourists from Kazakhstan as well, rather than just to the international tourists. I am not speaking just about the competition now. It is one of our tasks to not only organize sports competitions, but also to create sporting occasions—sporting holidays with concerts, festivals, and exhibitions. We are preparing a tourist package. The first task is to create the conditions to attract potential tourists. The second step is the promotion of festivals and other events to bring them to people's attention. We used the 2014 budget quite productively for this aim. A recent report from the Minister of Culture and Sport mentioned that, in 2014 alone, we had 264 appearances in the mass media. This year, we organized more than 50 different events. These events covered a lot of Almaty and Kazakhstan, as well as cities such as Moscow, Sochi, Barcelona, Belek in Turkey, and Manila in the Philippines; there were about eight or nine countries involved. In 2015 we are aiming to have a test event, and we have made commercials and done various video spots for our event. According to the FISU standards and our contribution contract, we have to arrange about seven international championships before 2017. Test events are quite important. First of all, we have to demonstrate all the spheres of our organization and FISU, as our coordinator, has to see our abilities in action and identify any mistakes that need to be corrected. Out of these test events, a minimum of five will be hosted here and broadcast by the Eurosport television channel.</p><h4>Do you have any specific goals for 2015?</h4><p>On July 31, 2015, the host city will be named for the Winter Olympics in 2022. Kazakhstan is quite an ambitious, young country. And I think that the main cities are full of well-educated people; they have an important role to play and they are changing the country. Kazakhstan is a country with a very bright and interesting future, and other regions know this as well. It is a new region, a new market, and a huge territory, rich in natural resources. Our President's vision is reflected in our program's ambitions; to be among the 30 most developed countries by 2050. Our previous program was targeted for 2020 and we accomplished that by 2013, so I think that if we keep this dynamic, we can manage to have another victory. Projects such as the Universiade are a great chance to use international experience for the development of various spheres here. If my colleagues from other sectors want the same results, they can use these opportunities, and we will build a really stable and strong country as a result.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Quesada celebrates its 40th anniversary in 2014. Could you tell us about the development of the company over the years?</h4><p>In 1972 the free zones (FZs) were launched in the Dominican Republic, the first being located in La Romana. And the first cigar factory to be established there was the Aldatis of today. In 1974 we were approached by US investors regarding the establishment of a cigar factory. We were not cigar makers in Cuba, but leaf brokers, with my great-grandfather and his brother having set out in business in 1876. They were buying tobacco from the farms, processing, packing, and then selling it to factories around the world. When we “donated" everything to the new Cuban government in 1960, we relocated to the Dominican Republic as we had been going there since 1939 as the Germans had taken over the Dominican market and were selling tobacco in Spain, in competition with Cuba. That was hurting our margins, which is why in 1939 we started to buy tobacco from the Dominican Republic. We were in the leaf business until 2002. Since 1974 we have been involved in the manufacturing of premium cigars as a company that started as MATASA and now operates as Quesada Cigars. My daughters, niece, and nephews are the fifth generation working for the company.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the composition of Quesada Cigar portfolio and the brands that enjoy the most popularity?</h4><p>We own three major brands. The first is Fonseca, a Cuban brand, the rights to which we hold in the US. This particular brand cannot be sold in any market besides the US market due to a brand registration conflict with Cuba. Secondly there is Casa Magna, our own private cigar brand made in Nicaragua, and finally Quesada Cigars, which is also our private brand made in the Dominican Republic. Both of these brands are sold in the US and European markets as well.</p><div class="quote">“The demand for premium cigars in the world is slowly increasing every year."</div><h4>What are Quesada's competitive advantages over other cigar producers in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>In the premium cigar world, we talk about three main characteristics; taste, construction, and consistency of manufacture, which is how the product is perceived. A good draw, excellent construction, and an even burn are key elements besides flavor and strength when smoking a cigar. Therefore, the continuity of construction and continuity of blend are the main essences. In addition, having our historical legacy affords us an enviable reputation, and we have extensive experience of both manufacturing and maintaining the blends that we make and have made throughout the years. That may not give us an advantage, but it does afford us a strong presence in the market. When the first Quesada came out in 2009, which was on our 35th anniversary, it was bought unseen. We had not even made the cigar yet and we were already selling them, as people trusted our knowledge and the passion we put into every cigar we make.</p><h4>What is the origin of the tobacco that you use in the production process?</h4><p>There are two ways to make a premium cigar. The first involves a “puro," which means that a cigar has to have all fillers, binders, and wrapper from one country only. The countries that we use the most are the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Honduras, but we also use tobacco from Mexico, Ecuador, the US, Indonesia, Brazil, Peru, Costa Rica, Cameroon, and Colombia. The second approach is to make a blend; this means that you have materials from different countries put together as one. A good example of a blend is to take Dominican and Nicaraguan fillers, a Honduran binder, and US wrapper. In the blends that we make, the tobacco we use the most is from the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Honduras, Mexico, Ecuador, and the US. When making a blend you have the option to combine different tobaccos to create a unique cigar that using tobacco from just one country cannot accomplish.</p><h4>What percentage of your cigars is destined for export?</h4><p>Almost one 100% of our cigars are exported. Recently, my daughters Patricia and Raquel and my niece Esther opened a premium cigar shop in Santiago, our hometown, that sells our cigars in the Dominican Market. This launch means a greater opportunity to sell more cigars in our home country.</p><h4>What is the importance of being a member of the Pro-Cigar Association?</h4><p>Pro-Cigar is a unified voice with considerable power behind it. While it may be easier for a minister to challenge an individual, it is difficult to do so to an entire sector. Pro-Cigar represents about 85% of all cigars being exported from the Dominican Republic. It's a wonderful organization to work with; we all have a shared passion, which is our love for cigars.</p><h4>How would you assess the overall performance of the tobacco industry in 2014?</h4><p>The demand for premium cigars in the world is slowly increasing every year. Percentages are in the single digits. This may vary  by two to three percentage points, but that gives us a boost because, rather than being in decline, we are slightly increasing and maintaining our presence in the market.</p><h4>What is your growth strategy?</h4><p>Let's go back to talking about the palate; the palate is sensitive to sweet, salty, acid, and bitter tastes. Another important element has been added, the umami, which the Japanese have come up with, and is located in the center of the tongue. We also have salivary glands and the nose that also come into play when perceiving smoke on your palate. When reading reviews in Cigar Aficionado, you come across references to chocolate, cinnamon, coffee, leather, fruits, herbs, and so on. When you have a bittersweet reaction on your palate, that message is transmitted to your  brain, where upon from your personal map of associated objects, you say, for example, chocolate. There is no actual chocolate content at all, but you are immediately reminded of it. Everything is unique and the combinations are so huge that we allow the smoke to produce different effects. That is why we are so different even though we use the same tobaccos. We blend differently and in so doing create all kinds of variations that play upon the smoker's palate. In our world, there is no best. Is Gauguin better than Picasso? Is Grappa better than Mendoza?</p><h4>What is your view on the current regulatory and fiscal environment in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We face a number of challenges among which I can mention taxation and prohibition. But, smokers somehow find that extra 25 or 35 cents to buy a Dominican cigar, even if they cut their consumption down from five a month to four. The greatest concern is prohibition, because if a smoker buys a cigar but cannot smoke it anywhere, he will stop buying. Tobacco prohibition in our major market, the US, runs from city to county, and from state to federal level, making it a four-tiered affair. These do not have a uniform strictness, and so must be challenged individually.</p><h4>Despite all the challenges, the industry is still steadily growing. What would you say explains this trend?</h4><p>Many smokers are moving away from cigarettes; some to e-cigarettes, and others to cigars. So there is an upward movement from product categories. Young people, from 30 years and up, are finding that cigars are a social product that relaxes when shared with family and friends. Two people having a drink in a bar may not talk to each other, but when a cigar is introduced it immediately stimulates impassioned conversation of the “where did you get it, and how do you like it?" variety. That's why cigars are routinely a staple part of  baseball games, barbecues, hunting, golfing, or fishing, to name a few occasions that merit a smoke. Therefore, many younger people are entering the cigar smoker's world, which also accounts for the gradual annual uptake every year. I staged some events in Tennessee and Alabama recently and was surprised to see the number of young people attending and smoking cigars. So that bodes well for the next 30 years. Once you have enjoyed a cigar you usually continue to do so. We have a cigar called the Heisenberg. Curiosity and a thirst for knowledge is part of life, and although many wanted to know more about the cigar, we decided that the Heisenberg cigar would remain an enigmatic celebration of uncertainty. No one knows what the blend is, and that's exactly how things will remain. At an event in California, I met a physicist who was fanatical about the Heisenberg, and he told me how he gets together with top physicists at his home to discuss their work and smoke his beloved cigars. This has got to be the greatest feeling in the world.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Statoil has been in Abu Dhabi since 2010. How would you describe your presence in the UAE to date?</h4><p>Achieving things in the energy business requires a long-term focus, and our presence in Abu Dhabi is linked to what we are trying to achieve. We are a small office here and are still in the business development stage. Most of our technical work is done outside of the country. We are pursuing our goals and looking for a long-term partnership with ADNOC in Abu Dhabi. With our regional office in Abu Dhabi, our main goal is to establish a substantial and sustainable presence here. We are focusing on business opportunities where we believe we can add value to the Emirate. The areas we are looking for are, of course, upstream oil and gas opportunities, both onshore and offshore, as that is where we add value, and where we have to position ourselves. So far, we strongly believe we are achieving our objectives.</p><h4>Statoil is well known for investing in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. What is your strategy in terms of transferring that technology to Abu Dhabi and marketing your position in this segment of the energy industry?</h4><p>We have four areas in our Statoil toolbox where we believe we have a strong base, technology-wise, that is needed in Abu Dhabi. One is developing strong gas value chains. Statoil is the second largest supplier of gas to Europe. We supply gas from Norway, the Caspian Sea, and North Africa. Statoil has a long history of developing robust, gas value chains. Since Abu Dhabi is short of gas, developing a local gas value chain is an area where we can add value. The other area where we believe we can add value is by managing oil and gas in bio-sensitive areas. There are areas here where oil and gas are situated in bio-sensitive areas, which means you have to operate in a responsible manner by applying practices and technology to carefully extract the resources without interfering with the bio-systems, which is something we have a lot of experience doing. This goes back to our heritage in Norway, where a lot of the resources are situated in extreme habitats with several types of species at risk. We are essentially fishing for oil where fishermen are fishing for fish, which is why we have practices and technology to extract the resources in a systematic, responsible manner. Ultimately, it is about achieving increased oil recovery. It is our eternal fight to ensure that we really get the most out of the resources from the reservoir, and we have developed practices and technology to maximize the recovery of our fields. Today, we have some of the highest recovery rates in the world. Additionally, we have had a favorable tax regime in Norway in support of R&amp;D in the field of enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The last of our four key areas is CCS. The tax system in Norway taxes our CO2 emissions offshore, and, therefore, it is in our financial interest to find solutions to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. We now have a research center in Norway outside of Bergen focused on removing CO2 from exhausts gases looking at how we can take out that CO2 economically. Currently, there are no international framework conditions in place, as the world cannot agree on a common system for how to manage CO2. However, in Abu Dhabi, there is a situation where it is short of gas, and, thus, the gas that it has, it also needs for the recovery of the oil. Abu Dhabi is still experimenting and has research projects looking into replacing natural gas with CO2, using CO2 as a drive mechanism, which is also a gas. As we have a long background in managing in CO2, both in storage and capture, this is where we believe we can add value.</p><div class="quote">“For an oil company, it is important that you have some technology in house."</div><h4>In addition to your oil recovery systems, what other technologies are you bringing to the Abu Dhabi energy market?</h4><p>For an oil company, it is important that you have some technology in house; yet, the most important thing is that you are architectural, which means you know when you need to develop a technology and you know when you need to bring in a technology—either something you have developed yourself or from a service provider. The role of an oil company is to have the ability to be the one that pulls those things together. It is not to come in with a big bag of technology, although sometimes it is portrayed that way. We have a good understanding of which technology to apply to certain situations because each reservoir has its own characteristics and needs to be developed in a different manner. Using technology is one thing, but it is also about the methods and how you responsibly develop the technology over time to take out the resources in the most economical manner and operate in the most environmentally friendly way. Doing so safely goes without saying. Another area that we have been part of developing and supporting is seismic studies. Seismic technology is like goggles that allow us to see what is happening 3,000 meters under the ground. We spend 50% of our money on R&amp;D, together with industry, contractors, and suppliers to develop the technology that we need.</p><h4>How do you see supply and demand evolving in the oil industry in the near future?</h4><p>In the short term, oil prices are probably on the border of the breakeven price when it comes to breaking out to new fields. Fields in especially more demanding settings require a high oil price in order to develop. This is why some areas have a lower cost of development—because of the conditions in place. Here in the UAE, it is more cost efficient to develop capacity and produce than it is in the North Sea or all the way up north in the Arctic. Sooner or later, oil prices will pick up again as the world's population continues to increase. The real uncertainty going forward is the price of gas. It is really about how gas prices will impact the oil price. The US is now producing the same amount that it was producing 27 years ago and its internal production will impact the flow of oil and gas. The question is how will the US use its shale gas? Will consumers and producers in the US be able to convert their gas into the transport sector? If so, then they are hitting oil market territory, where it used to be oil that was meeting the demand and now it is suddenly gas. The more transport gets gasified, the greater the impact we will see in the economy and in the prices of products. For this region, the fastest growing market is in the East. Sooner or later the price for oil will go up, but I think it will stay where it is for a while.</p><h4>What is your perspective on the importance of education to innovation in the oil and gas industry?</h4><p>The oil and gas industry has a high demand for scientists and engineers, and it is important for us to focus on making sure students in school choose science and technology subjects, meaning we are able to get the best heads as future employees. We have programs where we work with kids very early on. One program we have is called, “Heroes of Tomorrow," which has been successful in Norway. They are also doing a lot here in Abu Dhabi. The economy in Abu Dhabi is similar to Norway, as it is a resource-based economy with a small population that has developed into a knowledge-based economy. If you are going to develop advances in CCS technology, you are going to need good, smart people to find new solutions that can bring the cost down. Abu Dhabi is trying to focus more on using its knowledge-based economy as a funnel for innovation. Education is extremely important for the industry.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the work that BP has conducted in the Sultanate after winning the exploration contract for Block 61?</h4><p>BP signed an agreement in January 2007 for the appraisal and development of Block 61. We then carried out one of BP's largest ever 3D-seismic shoots. It was conducted safely without any safety incidents at all. Then, we did an extensive appraisal program, drilling 11 wells. As part of that appraisal program, we actually developed an extended well test (EWT). We built a facility in the desert that was commissioned in March 2001 and it processes the gas. We produced a small amount of gas that was given to Oman through the grid, but the main purpose of that facility was to get data on the wells and on the flow rates. It also gave us a great understanding of operating in a desert environment in Oman. On December 16, 2013 we signed the $16 billion Khazzan development project for Block 61.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Sultanate within BP's operations in the GCC region?</h4><p>Within BP's portfolio, the Khazzan gas project is one of the biggest unconventional projects. The operations here are a major part of the BP Middle East portfolio. In fact, the Khazzan gas development is one of the biggest portfolios in BP after Shah Deniz in Azerbaijan, and it is the biggest onshore gas project. It is important to BP, and also to Oman, because once we are successful we will produce, on a gas basis, only one-third for domestic consumption.</p><div class="quote">“ICV is something that we take seriously. It is not a fad; it is here to stay."</div><h4>What sort of investment will be required and will it be fully operational in 2017?</h4><p>To date, we have awarded $4 billion worth of contracts. We have already drilled our first development well. That started in January 2014, and we are on to our second development well now. We are building roads, well pads, and other infrastructure. The central processing facility (CPF) has been awarded to Petrofac. BP has one rig drilling at the moment. We are also mobilizing two rigs in Nizwa, and they have come from Central Asia, through the Suez Canal, and then into Oman. They are being assembled now. Both rigs are mobilizing to the field as we speak; moreover, we have got three new rigs on the way. By the end of 2014, we could have six rigs operational. I think the main message is that we are in action.</p><h4>What are the main technical challenges that you are facing?</h4><p>We are going to mobilize between 7,000 and 10,000 people into the field to work on this development. In that respect, safety is probably the biggest technical challenge. Then, it is the very hard rock, meaning that drilling and hard rock stimulation are challenges as well. But basically, we have so much technology and expertise from lots of other parts of the world at BP, especially from North America. We have people from that business here now assisting and helping with that technology and know-how. With our partners, Schlumberger contractors will use their technology as well as our technology as an advantage. The sheer scale of the project is also a challenge, as we are going to drill 300 wells over the next 15 years.</p><h4>How is BP supporting and promoting in-country value (ICV) in the Sultanate?</h4><p>ICV is something that we take seriously. It is not a fad; it is here to stay. I sit on the ICV committee with HE Undersecretary Salim Al Aufi, as do the other oil operators. We are doing many things within our contracts. We have elements of ICV, and we are working on some projects to develop some businesses here in Oman around proper manufacturing, rig construction, and we are also looking at the broader picture of ICV around graduates, which include the colleges and schools delivering across the board from an individual point of view.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the investment environment in Peru?</h4><p>Peru is one of South America's top economic performers. Private investment, foreign as well as domestic, has been one of the main factors behind growth from the early 1990s. The Peruvian economy has been improving since the early 1990s, when economic reforms began to take effect. At that time we embarked on a process to attract foreign investment. The main rules regarding the treatment of foreign investments, coming from those days, are based on the principle of national treatment. This means foreign investors have the same rights and obligations as Peruvian investors. The attraction of foreign investment began with the privatization process in Peru, when we opened several sectors such as mining, financing, power generation and distribution, and many other sectors that were previously only in the hands of nationals, or even in the hands of the state. This process was improved during the 2000s, when Peru decided to promote the participation of private investment in infrastructure and public services through PPP. The Peruvian Investment Policy was consolidated by the negotiation of free trade agreements (FTAs). The first FTA that Peru concluded was with the US, and with this agreement we just consolidated the open policy for foreign investment and we turned toward to a very stable and predictable policy for foreign investors. The investment chapter of the US-Peru FTA formed the basis of the subsequent 16  additional FTAs that we have negotiated and which are already being enforced. The main reason behind the expansion of foreign investment in Peru is the stability of economic policy and the stability of our investment laws.</p><h4>Over the past two years alone, both Moody's and Dow Jones have upgraded Peru's credit rating. What investments are on the horizon?</h4><p>In recent months we have experienced a slowdown in the economy. Over the coming year there will be several important mining projects and some significant infrastructure projects that will also begin the construction phase. Regarding infrastructure, there is an irrigation project being undertaken in the North, a second line of the Lima Metro, and a gas pipeline in the southern part of Peru. Regional airports around the country will also be renovated and expanded, probably in the third quarter of the coming year. Two thermal power plants in the south of the country will really expand the dynamics of the economy. We expect a GDP growth rate of about 5.5% to 6.3% over the coming years, partly due to these projects.</p><h4>Do you think that in the long-term prices need to return to their former levels in order for Peru to continue growing as before? Can infrastructure fill that gap?</h4><p>Infrastructure is the foundation of the nation's productive potential. In the future, Peru will not depend as much on the price levels of minerals. A major goal is to diversify the export base and one of the most important areas is agribusiness. The irrigation project of Chavimochic in the northern coastal region of the country will incorporate around 60,000 hectares of new land for agribusiness. Together with that, in the southern part of the country, there will be a further 35,000 hectares of land also incorporated through another irrigation project. The gas pipeline being constructed to the southern part of the country will bring gas to two power plant projects that have already been awarded and will provide energy for the development of important mining projects in that zone. In addition, natural gas may also allow the development of  petrochemicals.</p><div class="quote">“Infrastructure is the foundation of the nation's productive potential."</div><h4>Over the coming years Peru is expect to regain its growth rate, at least to some degree; how will Pro Inversión continue to encourage investors to come to Peru and stay here for the long term?</h4><p>We have a particularly stable economic policy that we will continue pursuing. Clear rules allow for the planning of your business. Something that has helped us hugely is our FTAs and wide range of investment opportunities, not only in mining, but in food production, tourism, and now petrochemicals. We will probably also talk about forestry in the coming years to promote Peru an export platform; the country is working to become a regional hub to connect the South American region with the Asia Pacific economy.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have just launched ETB mobile and have the ambitious target of gaining 10% market share in 2015. How will your existing infrastructure help you to do so?</h4><p>This is a crucial period for ETB, a year after formation, and a year in which we celebrate our 130th anniversary. We have launched a fiber optic service into homes, namely FTTH, and our own IPTV service, and are now even launching our own mobile service; ETB Mobile. We bought a 4G spectrum in June 2013, and since then have created our own mobile company from scratch to provide nationwide coverage. We will be the fourth operator to join the competition in the local market after Claro, which has a 60% market share. Colombia is the second most concentrated mobile market in the world, after Mexico, where Claro—the Telmex group—is the leading player. Telefonica holds 25% of the market, and Tigo, owned by Milicom, has roughly a 15% market share. We will offer rates per second mobile plans, and at the best rate on the market of Ps3 per second. We expect to offer simple plans without the small print so that there are no surprises with regard to monthly usage costs for mobile account customers, for example. Meanwhile, we will focus on data. We want people to be connected at all times, which is part of our data strategy, and to establish more fiber optics to the home, which is the first stage; we have the fastest internet speed in the country and want people to be connected beyond their homes, especially with 4G, and with non-interrupted connectivity for mobile data. Therefore, all of our plans will have free access to WhatsApp and Facebook. In late 2014, fixed-line customers from ETB will receive a discount on their mobile plans and in 1Q2015 we will be completely convergent, meaning that customers will be able to see all our products and services on one invoice. They will have a quadruple play plan that provides special rates for having all ETB products, or else a diverse mix of products, which no other mobile service provider in the country offers.</p><h4>How significant are the logistics and infrastructure investments that have been made in order to launch ETB Mobile?</h4><p>It has been a long process to transform a fixed company to a mobile company; everything is new, IT and networks are different, logistically it is a different proposition, and even the commercial component of the business has changed. We are investing around $200 million to complete the investment, which may not sound like much for such a large project, but it results from a strategic alliance with TIGO to share infrastructure and spectrum, which helps us reduce costs significantly and rapidly access a nation-wide plan. This marks a new ETB investment across the spectrum, within the network.</p><div class="quote">“It has been a long process to transform a fixed company to a mobile company."</div><h4>The price of the company's stocks has risen by 45% over the past 12 months; what are the conditions needed to allow for a continued rise?</h4><p>Two years ago it was the strategic plan that investors were interested in, although obviously they wanted to see its execution, and for us to start posting healthy results to cement the ETB name. There is also considerable political uncertainty surrounding the company, as an 88% stake is owned by the City of Bogotá. It follows then, that certain investors prefer to see whether the mayor stays in office. The mayor's term expires in 2015. So all of these factors may create some uncertainty and prevent the stock from rising at the rate it should. Additionally, while the stock is not particularly liquid, that is actually rather indicative of the national market in in general.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the next few years in terms of potentially releasing more bonds or shares through private investors?</h4><p>We have completely funded the strategic plan, which is worth about $1 billion over four or five years, and have already invested half of it, amounting to about $500 million. We have around $500 million in cash today, and are completely funded. We also have low debt of about $270 million, which comprises bonds issued in January 2013, from what was probably the best bond issuance that any Colombian company has made in international markets. We obtained a rate of 7% in Colombian pesos for 10 years, which is the historic best rate for any Colombian company. We have low debt, and a good EBITDA margin of 40%, as well as liquidity and the plans and execution needed for solid performance. We are delivering, which makes stockholders and investors faith in ETB—they take interest and continue to invest in the company.</p><h4>In February 2014, ETB acquired 75% of Skynet; can you tell us what synergies this represents?</h4><p>Skynet is basically a small company that offers satellite internet connections. This could be interpreted in different ways. For example, we are going nationwide with the DTH television product, though not just yet. We basically made the purchase to create synergies with our corporate enterprise and government business. There are many areas in Colombia lacking a ground connection, be it fiber or any other type, and, therefore, we have to offer satellite-based alternatives. We used to hire Skynet among other companies to provide services, but considered it a good opportunity to become more efficient and competitive in the enterprise and government business, which is crucial for ETB, accounting for about 45% of total revenue.</p><h4>Regarding the investment in LT technologies, can you speak more on the technical synergies you have been promoting as part of the re-structuring?</h4><p>I think this is a mixture of many factors. With fiber-to-home we have started reducing the cost of copper. We have about 40 facilities operating the copper network in the city of Bogotá, and when we complete our fiber project, that number will be reduced to 13. We will have significant copper volume to sell to the international markets worth an estimated $80 million, as well as substantial real estate, worth at least another $80 million to $100 million. The synergies are numerous given the technology in place that will boost out efficiency. Obviously with fiber there is a major synergy with the mobile business, using the fiber to offload data from the mobile networks, which will be more efficient and increase quality, while related cost declines because the fiber network is our own.</p><h4>How many households have you currently reached with fiber optics and what are the projections?</h4><p>We started deploying fiber less than a year ago, and at this point have more than 600,000 home passes and about 10,000 connections, while we expect to close 2014 with about 800,000 home passes and 20,000 to 25,000 home connections, which represents successful deployment for the first year of fiber. If you compare us to Telefonica in Brazil and Spain and several parts of Europe, and Verizon in the US, none of these companies reached 10,000 connections in their first year, and we will probably have doubled that number by the end of 2014. The idea is to end next year with about 80% of homes in Bogotá passed with fiber optics and to create our rate of connections significantly in 2015, and we hope to reach 130,000 to 140,000 connections, which is a major jump from the 20,000 we expect to close 2014 with.</p><h4>What does this mean in terms of expanding your operations?</h4><p>I believe that we have to continue sharing the network with TIGO, and in order to expand our network nationwide we must also continue investing in networks, which is the core of the business, and what we have done to date can help us obtain our targeted market share. That will have a positive impact on revenues in the mid-term, and if we reach five million customers within five years that will probably at least double the value of the company and underpin sustainable growth.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the evolution of Kazakhstan Kagazy from its inception in 2001? What are the main highlights and milestones that the company has achieved over a decade of activity?</h4><p>Our company has been a leader and the most innovative company in its sector. Kazakhstan Kagazy was established in 2001 following an import substitution program and was financed by the Kazakhstani government. It was the first paper factory to be installed in Kazakhstan. Our factory was also the first to move to paper production from waste paper. Kazakhstan Kagazy takes waste paper, regenerates it, and then we make boxes; we were the first to establish a modern corrugated factory, and we are the leading factory in terms of size and the quality of the technology we are using. We were the top company in our sector, and the only one to be listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Kazakhstan Kagazy was the first company to produce mottled bleached cardboard out of waste paper in the country, and we are the first company that produces “green" boxes, which are made from 100% recycled paper.</p><h4>What is your market share within Kazakhstan?</h4><p>In terms of paper production, we have a 90% market share in Kazakhstan. In corrugated paper products we have a 50% share of the Kazakhstan market. In waste paper it is hard to say, because there are no solid statistics; it is still a market that is under development. A lot of waste paper in Kazakhstan is used for heating in the winter. I estimate that out of the entire collectable market, we have around a 70% market share.</p><div class="quote">“Kazakhstan has all of the prerequisites for a successful transition to a green economy."</div><h4>What is the potential for the green economy and specifically for recycling businesses here in the region and in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>There are several positive developments, with even more room for progress. What is critical is that we are operating in a relatively rich economy that has money to reinvest; Kazakhstan is a wealthy country. And the country is doing well compared to its neighbors. The government, and specifically the President, has made it an objective that by 2050 Kazakhstan will no longer rely on oil and gas as the mainstay of its economy. What is still missing is public consciousness about recycling and the treatment of waste. The development of a green economy has to be a partnership between the government, the general public, and the private sector. One does not simply impose a green economy without public awareness. And currently, this awareness is still insufficient. This is critical for our company, as we are pioneers in certain areas of recycling. In addition, there is complex legislation that is not always properly executed at the municipal level. Through international conferences, we try to educate the industry about different ways of packaging, and we show how green packaging actually can provide long-term savings.</p><h4>What has to be done to increase the attractiveness of this sector to international investors?</h4><p>Right now, Kazakhstan is a small market. However, Russia is investing more into this area. Normally, international companies make an entry when the market has already evolved to a certain point. They stay away for the early stages, and thus our role is to move toward this point. Kazakhstan Kagazy must bring these recycling opportunities to the national stage and then partner with the international community and large international investors.</p><h4>How is the group promoting the social development of the country?</h4><p>Kazakhstan Kagazy pays close attention to the issues of ecology, education, and charity. We have several long-term corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects underway, and we also support a number of social initiatives. Among our long-term social initiatives are the recently opened Kazakhstan Center for Peace and Accord, the educational Young Leaders Program, and the eco-social projects “From Recycling to Donation" and “Going Green." The Kazakhstan Center for Peace and Accord (KCPA) was opened in August 2014 in London through cooperation with the People's Assembly of Kazakhstan. The center will focus on several important projects grouped around language, security, and education as a way to foster peace and stability in the region. The center has close partnerships with leading British universities and prominent academics, so education will be a central focus of the KCPA. For instance, we plan to establish a scholarship program that will sponsor non-Kazakhstani students who are interested in researching Kazakhstan-focused topics that will further promote peace and international accord. Through its Young Leaders program, the UK-based charitable organization Foundation K provides opportunities to gifted children of Kazakhstan Kagazy employees, and their relatives and friends, to receive a high-quality education in Almaty and, eventually, to study abroad. Six children have already received this scholarship. By partnering with large companies through an initiative called From Recycling to Donation we achieve two goals: promoting the idea of recycling, and supporting children with disabilities. And through the Going Green initiative, we educate people on environmental issues and encourage them to sort and recycle waste.</p><h4>What are your priorities and goals for 2015?</h4><p>We have an ambitious development plan for the years 2014—2017. Now that we have finished our financial restructuring with Alliance Bank, we can direct our full attention to growing and expanding our business. Through this strategy, we are going to expand recycling to other types of recyclable materials, including plastic. This niche has not yet been filled in Kazakhstan, so we see growth potential here. We will also expand geographically to the north, both by opening new waste paper collection points and by entering the Russian market. This entails building a recycling plant and diversifying our product range. To support these plans financially we will reinvest our profits into the future business.</p><h4>What is your long-term outlook for Kazakhstan's transition to a green economy, and what amendments should be introduced into the national legislation related to the waste management sphere?</h4><p>Kazakhstan has all of the prerequisites for a successful transition to a green economy. The government of Kazakhstan has given its full support to the plan and has made it a top priority for the coming decades. The economy is growing and is in constant need of new technologies and more efficient practices. One major amendment that should be introduced to the existing legislation concerns waste management. We suggest that there should be and obligation of all companies and the general population to sort and recycle all types of waste. Every city dweller generates 330 kilograms of household waste per year. This statistic is frightening if you multiply it by the population of Kazakhstan, of more than 17 million people. While in developed countries there is an integrated waste management system that helps to cope with growing amounts of waste, much still has to be done in Kazakhstan in this regard, from the development of infrastructure to the education of the country's population.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Limak Energy's current position in the Turkish energy sector?</h4><p>Turkey is experiencing a rapid increase in general energy consumption and it is hard to find a benchmark country to gauge this change. So we are keeping the track of everything in the energy business. We are evaluating all of our options, from green field projects to privatization, and looking to acquire more licenses. We have 870 MW of hydropower capacity and our aim is to exceed 1,000 MW in the next four years. If we can acquire the licenses, we will continue to build more capacity.</p><h4>You recently acquired the BEDAÅž grid. Where does infrastructure expansion on the distribution-side fit into your overall plans?</h4><p>Limak and its partners (CLK Group) is the biggest distribution group in Turkey with four distribution areas and a nearly 30% market share. This amount will correspond to nearly 15,000 MW of consumption in a five-year period. As a part of a three-party consortium, our goal is to cover one-third of this capacity, which is nearly 5,000 MW. Thus, we believe that our distribution areas will provide advantage to us. Additionally, as Limak Energy, we are a well-known retailer and have our own retail customer portfolio. We are closely watching privatization of lignite-fired power plants, and are expecting to acquire at least one in Turkey. Moreover, we are planning to construct our own coal-fired power plants. All of the decisions made by Limak Energy are derived from the market's needs. Based on what we learned from other countries, we are diversifying our investments in electricity generation. We have started to import power from the Bulgarian transmission network, and we are working with almost every electricity trading company in Southeast Europe. Additionally, we sell all the electricity generated in Kosovo. Due to the nature of the electricity market, we often experience excesses and deficits, so we are constantly buying and selling electricity in Southeast Europe.</p><div class="quote">“Developing renewable energy is an important part of our corporate strategy."</div><h4>Do you see an expansion of the electricity trading business, not only in Turkey, but also in Southeast Europe, and, as that process continues, do you plan to take on new opportunities?</h4><p>We will invest more in Southeast Europe, where we expect further growth in electricity trading and consumption. Our careful expansion into the Bulgarian market has helped us to understand the regional market, and Bulgaria is now a critical part of our strategy. We plan to expand into Romania based on our success in Bulgaria, and we will register our company there in the near future. That will be followed by Hungary. We have also established a company in Serbia, and we plan to start energy trading there soon. Looking further ahead, we are investigating electricity generation opportunities in Kosovo. The current electrical infrastructure there is old and unreliable, and will require significant upgrading. Our plans involve lignite-fired generation plants, with which we hope to turn Kosovo into a net exporter of electricity. We also plan to use transmission lines in Southeast Europe in order to bring more reliable distribution to the region.</p><h4>Are transmission lines an area that you are interested in investing in?</h4><p>Because of strict regulations, transmission lines are not something that we can invest in, but we can do the rest. By the end of 2014, Turkey's transmission lines system will be linked to Europe at full capacity. Currently cross border capacity is 950 MW between Turkey and ENTSO-E, which is less than the planned capacity of 2,000 MW. When all the capacity becomes available, this will really make a significant difference. The European side of Turkey is poorly connected to the Anatolian side. The electrical connection with Europe is actually stronger than the connection between the two sides of Turkey. In 2015, there will be additional transmission capacity between the Asian and European sides of Turkey; however, these developments will not keep up with projected demand. To the east, more transmission lines between Turkey and Georgia are being built due to significant investment in the region. This development will link the grids of Georgia, Turkey, and Europe. The region around Turkey will soon be integrated into one of the largest electricity sales, generation, and trading markets. We expect that Limak Energy Group will be at the center of this new market.</p><h4>Do you see evidence of regulatory progress inside Turkey? Do you expect that further liberalization will help your business, especially in terms of electricity trading across the region?</h4><p>Liberalization in the energy market has been an important part of Turkey's progress. The current government has been bold and decisive in promoting market reform. Privatization has been a cornerstone of market liberalization in Turkey. The privatization of electricity distribution is going very well and is an important part of our success. However, certain steps are still necessary in order to reach a fully liberalized power market and it's a given that some steps will take time. Turkey needs to integrate into the region in order to reach its full potential. Given its location and makeup, Turkey is positioned to become an important energy hub, but in order to achieve that aim we still need a fully liberalized market. This will require that the state further decrease its share of electricity generation. The Turkish Electrical Distribution Company (TEDAÅž) is set to cease electrical generation, which will open the market to more private companies. State-owned thermal power plants are also undergoing privatization. The hydropower plants and other critical infrastructure, however, will likely remain with the state, but their privatization is not crucial.</p><h4>What are some of your main investments in terms of renewables?</h4><p>Renewable energy is a large part of our portfolio, and developing renewable energy is an important part of our corporate strategy. While competition over transmission line capacity concerns us, we are also involved in different renewable energy projects, such as hydro, wind, and solar power. We have developed 400 MW in wind farm capacity, and while it is not yet licensed we are working hard to obtain the necessary licenses to begin generation. Currently, we have license applications for 70 MW solar capacity and the total capacity allowed in Turkey is now 600 MW, which leaves significant room for growth. We are also undertaking feasibility studies for unlicensed solar projects. Within a year, we will be able to establish unlicensed solar projects in Turkey.</p><h4>Are you interested in expanding into Africa as well?</h4><p>In Nigeria we recently became the technical partner of a distribution company. We see Nigeria as a market with growth potential. Within two years we will be visiting the area in search of more investment opportunities in both generation and distribution.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[cash-back]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Banco de Crédito del Perú (BCP) is one of the largest and oldest banks in the country. This year it purchased MiBanco, a microfinance firm. Could you tell us about BCP's retail business?</h4><p>Historically, BCP has been the largest bank with the largest share of the customer base among those customers who are already part of the banking system. We decided that rather than capturing a greater market share of the existing customer base, or taking customers from a competitor, we would focus on bringing more people into the banking system and enlarge the pie itself, as penetration levels were relatively low. This was a strategic decision we took about seven or eight years ago, and we have been working hard on it with great success. The penetration level in the banking sector has increased, and now we are at a level slightly higher than Mexico and comparable to Colombia. Growth has been substantial over the past couple of years because of the combination of two factors. We started at a low level of penetration, and the country has grown considerably. Thus, the banking system grew by multiples of GDP growth. GDP was growing at 7%, and the banking system grew at three and a half times that rate. It has been a period of furious growth and we have been a driver of that growth by bringing more people into the system. The problem was that our branch network was not located where people wanted it because we did not have the right distribution channels, prices, or products, prompting us to address these issues. During that process, one of the lessons learnt was that a segment of the customers is better served by specific business models, rather than by a universal, large bank, such as BCP. We bought a microfinance company called Edificar and subsequently expanded into buying MiBanco. Today, we have BCP as well as microfinance companies with different business models that are more appealing to certain groups of customers. We have been successful in bringing a substantial number of customers into the banking sector. We are in the process of understanding their needs better and being able to serve them better. That is the challenge we have been working on for the past seven or eight years.</p><h4>How would you characterize the frontier market in Peru, compared to other parts of the world such as East Africa?</h4><p>There is no universal set of best practices for doing this. The solution has to be tailor made to specific markets and local conditions. We did look at best practices in Africa and Asia, and tried to bring what we thought was relevant to our market. For example, one element that was tremendously successful was what we call the BCP agent. This model was invented in South Africa, but we localized it to our own market. It is a machine at any corner store where you can use your credit card to obtain cash. The money goes from the holder's account to the storeowner's account, and the storeowner hands over the cash. It is similar to an ATM, but without a cash component. That cuts costs dramatically. An ATM costs $30,000 and you need 200 transactions a day to break even, while this machine costs $500 dollars and only takes 20 transactions to break even. This enables you to have transactions at points where an ATM would not be profitable. We have about 6,000 of them installed across the country. In microfinance, there are two basic models: collective lending and individual lending. The market is more developed in individual lending. What you need at the end of the day is a practice called lend to learn. You have to learn by making mistakes, but you have to be careful that those mistakes are not large enough to jeopardize financial institutions.</p><div class="quote">“We have always been proud of our ratings and of the fact that BCP has survived for over 145 years."</div><h4>Earlier in 2014 Moody's and Fitch upgraded BCP's rating. What do those ratings represent in terms of your business in Peru?</h4><p>We have always been proud of our ratings and of the fact that BCP has survived for over 145 years, despite the volatilities the country has undergone. This only reaffirms the importance of the bank in the broader economy. We are extremely conservative, not only in terms of the amount and quality of credit risks, but also in the level of capital decisions that we would like to work with, the level of liquidity we would like to handle, and the risks we take in general. The continuous upgrade is a recognition of the way we manage the bank.</p><h4>Mexico has just joined the Integrated Latin American Market (MILA). What do you think the greatest obstacles for further integration are?</h4><p>The obstacles there are related to security regulations. Conceivably they should be easy to solve, but regulators have a complex process, leaving some problems unresolved. For example, if you really want to push integration, the regulators of the three countries should agree that if a security is approved by one of the countries, then it is approved by all. Instead, in reality the regulators take the approach that they will only approve it if it is done their way. The other issue is taxes. There is unequal tax treatment for capital gains, interest, and the like. This is a tough issue to solve that usually requires changes in the laws. I do not have a big expectation that the actual integration of the capital market system is going to happen fast. I do believe, however, that if you talk to any large institutional investor in Peru, Chile, or Colombia, they already operate in either of the other two countries. They do not need a common operating process or one platform to invest in each other's countries.</p><h4>Where do you see the bank in three to five years time? Do you have any specific goals in terms of growth, revenue, or corporate and retail banking?</h4><p>Following this period of very strong growth where we have almost tripled the size of the bank, we will see more subdued growth over the period you mention, making for growth of 12% to 15%. We want to use this window of opportunity to make sure that we operate efficiently, that our portfolio is of the desired quality, and that we have the right risk management practices. It is an opportunity to step back and make sure that all of our basic structures and procedures are right, and that we are ready for the next step. We have been doubling the size of the bank every three years, which puts strain on processes, systems, and human resources. I would add a note of optimism here, in that the way in which the government manages its public finances, the way the banking system operates, and in the fact that there is no leverage in the private sector. We would like to continue growing at 8%, but 5% is still a solid number and the country presents a tremendous opportunity going forward.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your overall strategy to strengthen your services and increase the number of trade offices abroad?</h4><p>The strategy we follow at ProMéxico aligns with the goals set by the National Development Plan and the Innovative Development Program 2013-2018, and responds to the cross-cutting themes of the current government: democratization of productivity, gender equality, and the government's closeness to the people. Hence, ProMéxico contributes to the creation of an inclusive, prosperous, and globally responsible Mexico. Our role is to drive Mexico into the business arena as a leading global player. One of ProMéxico's key tasks is to capture productive projects from abroad; projects that create jobs and encourage national development. In addition, we have designed and implemented different business models and services aimed at attracting investment both from foreign companies looking to venture into the country and from companies already established here seeking to invest in new projects. ProMéxico is recognized worldwide as a government entity dedicated to the promotion of international business, the Mexican agency that supports the effective realization of global economic projects. Through 45 overseas offices we have been able to position Mexico as an attractive investment destination. We have a portfolio of support programs and services that enable national and foreign investors to participate in business summits to promote Mexico or realize commercial delegations to countries with whom there is interest and opportunities, through travel grants, receive specialized information about Mexico or specific sectors, and connect with companies and government entities abroad. ProMéxico is an agency that generates meetings and encourages successful business between Mexican business owners and entrepreneurs from any country in the world.</p><h4>How would you assess the current level of FDI in Mexico? What countries are showing an increasing interest in Mexico?</h4><p>In 2013, FDI rose to $38.2857 billion—according to figures from the Ministry of Economy and the UNCTAD—which was a historic record that placed us among the major recipients of FDI. Furthermore, between January and March 2014, we have received around  $5.821 billion in FDI. This figure is 17% higher than the preliminary amount reported for the same period in the previous year of $4.988 billion. In these two years, investment from Germany, Japan and Netherlands has remained steady; last year, investment from Belgium was higher than from the United States, while this year investment from Spain has grown significantly. Some countries are strengthening their presence in the country, such as Luxembourg, have now begun to appear with representative percentages. In recent months we have received interest from China, India, Italy, Korea, Norway, Portugal Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, and United Kingdom, among others.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico is on an excellent path."</div><h4>What are the main investment incentives to attract capital flows to the country?</h4><p>Some of the main competitive advantages that Mexico presents to foreign investors are: a young talented and skilled workforce, favorable business environment, competitive costs in North America, and modern, world-class infrastructure. We are a leading exporter of high technology and advanced manufacturing; thus, industries that require greater capacity and precision are beginning to locate in Mexico. Mexico is one of the most competitive countries for productive investment in the world due to its macroeconomic and political stability, low inflation, size and strength of the domestic market, and economic growth rate.</p><h4>How would you describe the importance of the energy and telecommunication reforms as a tool to promote Mexico as an investment destination?</h4><p>It is important to highlight that the recent structural reforms implemented by President Enrique Peña Nieto's government, among which are the two you mention, respond primarily to an urgent need to modernize the legislation relative to a number of national sectors, so that they become more competitive, and as a result, more productive. This, in turn, will translate into greater prosperity for the Mexican society. The reforms were designed and will be implemented, beyond promoting Mexico as an investment destination, to modernize certain sectors in order to continue to respond to the country's growing needs.</p><h4>What are the main sectors of the economy that hold particular potential and opportunities for international investments?</h4><p>Although the first transformative reforms concern certain production sectors, all sectors are a priority for our current government. Some have a prominent history, as is the case with manufacturing in general, and others are just coming into their stride, such as the aerospace sector and the creative industries. The sectors that have recently drawn the greatest attention from foreign investors are agriculture, energy and environmental technologies, health, creative information and communication technologies, knowledge technologies, transport and heavy manufacturing, and infrastructure.</p><h4>What are the advantages of Mexico as a manufacturing country, but also as a center of innovation and creativity?</h4><p>Mexico is the foremost Latin American destination for establishing information technologies (IT) service companies. It excels in areas that include government support, costs, cultural affinity, and human resources. Furthermore, Mexico has firmly established its global position in this sector and currently occupies fourth place as a global IT provider. Over the past decade, the average annual growth rate of engineering graduates in Mexico was 7%. According to National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) estimates, 111 thousand engineering and technology students graduated in 2012. In addition, Mexican creativity is renowned the world over. Aware of its potential and the strategic role of the creative industries, Mexico is determined to position itself as one of the world's major players and become Latin America's hub of excellence for the production of audiovisual and interactive content. Mexico has world-class audiovisual production facilities, such as Baja Film Studios, which has the biggest water set in the world, and Estudios Churubusco, whose trajectory is renowned throughout the national and international film world. Audiovisual production and development costs are very competitive; according to KPMG, Mexico is 37.7% and 38.9% more cost-competitive compared to the US for software development and digital entertainment, respectively.</p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of Mexico as a logistics hub?</h4><p>Mexico is a major, global, high value-added logistics center due to its network of free trade agreements; our country has a strategic geographic location, close to the world's major ports. We have the lowest average of port-to-port days and are connected to Asia, Europe, and South America thanks to our Atlantic and Pacific coastal ports. Our infrastructure and strategic location translate into better overall costs and greater competitiveness for companies. We have 117 sea ports, 64 international airports, more than 26,000 kilometers of railroad, and around 372,000 kilometers of road. Mexico is a business partner for those companies whose aim is to serve the North American market. We are part of the biggest economic bloc in the world (NAFTA), which represents $18 trillion dollars. We have more than 50 overland border crossings with the United States and logistics corridors that allow us to connect rapidly with the western and eastern parts of the United States and Canada. Mexico is a great option for those companies planning to establish production centers beyond their own territory: in addition to its logistics infrastructure, Mexico has a highly trained workforce with advanced manufacturing expertise and one of the most competitive cost structures in the world. Our country's platform of international treaties enables not only the attraction of investment for production, but makes it possible to export from Mexico to anywhere in the world.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2014?</h4><p>Mexico is on an excellent path. During the first half of the year, it received FDI inflows of $5.8 billion, a figure 17% higher than the preliminary amount reported for the same period in 2013. This is evidence of the growing confidence of investors in the economic future of our country. The most important factor of the investments is not only their amount, but their impact on job creation and their repercussions on national economic development. In this context, it should be emphasized that the country receives investment mainly in advanced manufacturing sectors, which creates better-paid jobs and generates a greater capacity for knowledge transfer. ProMéxico undoubtedly encourages foreign direct investment with a high-technology and innovation content. We know that Mexico has many strengths. We want to further promote them in the world's business community. An example of this is Mexico's leadership in medium- and high-technology production, as well as in the agrifood industry. There is no doubt we are experiencing Mexico's moment. The country has seized a key historic opportunity based on the recently adopted structural reforms. These changes and political agreements will trigger unprecedented progress to boost the integrated development of the country in the short and medium term. These structural reforms will allow a more promising future in terms of attracting FDI. ProMéxico will continue to promote the export of products and services to contribute to the country's economic and social development and the strengthening of Mexico's image, and to push Mexico's recognition as one of the best business destinations in the world.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of Petroecuador in Ecuador's efforts to transform the energy and production matrices?</h4><p>We play a key role within the energy sector, as part of the decision-making process, and  we provide advice on the business to the public authorities. Ecuador currently imports large volumes of diesel for power generation. Once projects like the Pacific Refinery, in which we also play a substantial role, are on course, Ecuador will become self-sufficient in diesel for its industrial needs. We are also involved in efforts to change consumption patterns in terms of electricity and gas, areas in which Petroecuador also has several projects. We also have close ties with other economic sectors to better assess their fuel needs. Petroecuador not only produces fuels, but also many other products such as asphalt, an essential element in the large infrastructure projects the country is set to implement. Again, we have close ties with public authorities and the relevant ministries in order to better orientate our projects and business activity toward the main objectives of the government.</p><h4>What analysis has the company made in terms of producing and marketing alternative fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel?</h4><p>We have conducted technical analyses and studies in order to start biodiesel production. Technically speaking, we are ready to produce biodiesel, but this is not a decision we can take unilaterally, as it also requires infrastructure such as service stations, and the vehicles need to be prepared for this type of fuel. Currently, Ecuador produces palm oil, which is transformed into biodiesel, and so far there is just one biodiesel producer in the country. However, a tariff scheme has to be set up. In the meantime, we already produce several types of fuel such as fuel with ethanol. Over the final months of 2014, we will be providing this type of fuel to all of the Guayaquil city area and we plan to expand nationwide. I should also note that for us to fully cover the Ecuadorean territory with such fuels, we require substantial sugar cane production.</p><div class="quote">“Ecuador produces 550,000 bbl/d of crude oil and the national refining capacity only reaches 175,000 bbl/d."</div><h4>How has the restructuring of Petroecuador made the company more efficient?</h4><p>This restructuring, which also involved Petroamazonas, took place a year and a half ago. It has been a positive decision for both companies. Before, there were two companies engaging in duplicate activities: production and exploration. The restructuring implied greater efficiency and more synergies. Petroamazonas has increased production and we have a stronger focus on the activities we do, namely, refining, logistics, distribution, and supply of hydrocarbons.</p><h4>How important is the Pacific Refinery project for the national economy?</h4><p>Ecuador produces 550,000 bbl/d of crude oil and the national refining capacity only reaches 175,000 bbl/d. The remaining production is exported, and we import industrialized products such as diesel, gasoline, and LPG. One should bear in mind that the gap between exported oil and imported products is significant. We have a strong dependence on fuel imports. The Pacific Refinery will redress this situation, augmenting the economy and boosting development of the whole country. This refinery will also help us to improve the quality of our fuels. It should become fully operative within five years, as key steps have been taken over the past few months. Our company and the country itself are making large investments in infrastructure and other projects such as the storage and transporting of LPG. We also have ambitious projects regarding the storage and handling of diesel and gasoline, as well as petrochemicals, including several key pipelines and oil distribution centers. We have invested in the latter areas over the past few years to make our infrastructure more efficient. We are also modernizing and making much more efficient use of infrastructure at the Esmeraldas Refinery. At this facility investment is exceeding $1 billion.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways has the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in November 2012 by Panama and UK boosted the commercial relations between both countries?</h4><p>I was delighted to sign the MoU during my visit to Panama in November 2012. It sets out a shared commitment to strengthening our relationship. But it is not an end in itself; we need to continue to work hard to turn that commitment into results. I visited again in mid-2014 to follow up Panama's new government following the May elections. I was reminded of the country's great potential, and of the reasons why so many British companies are already doing business there. The World Economic Forum ranks Panama's economy as the second most competitive in Latin America, boasting the top-10 global rankings in its airport and port networks, the soundness of its banks, and its access to financial services. That is why the stock of UK FDI in Panama now stands at £1.95 billion, second only to the US. In 2012, for example, we saw the Travelex Group win a concession to operate a foreign exchange bureau at Panama City's international airport, which was a great boost to trade. This airport is now also being further developed with the help of British firm Foster and Partners. Elsewhere, London &amp; Regional continues to lead Panama's urban regeneration through its impressive Panama Pacifico project, while Cable &amp; Wireless has launched transformative new products, such as a mobile banking application. Panama is also increasingly positioning itself as a regional logistics and connectivity hub, which is why companies like Diageo use it to get their products closer to the final market. The Scotch Whisky Association reported £58 million of whiskey sales to Panama in 2013, the third largest market in the region and a 15% YoY increase. These examples demonstrate Panama's growing importance as a commercial partner for the UK in Latin America, and show how the UK has consolidated its position as one of the leading foreign investors in Panama. However, I am convinced that we can do more. The new government has set out its commitment to tackling corruption, and I welcome this. We have found in the UK that foreign investors tend to respond well to certainty and transparency. We are already doing work with Panama to promote a rules-based economic system, and I hope we can cooperate ever more closely in this area.</p><h4>Following the Double Taxation Agreement signed by Panama and UK in July 2013, you expressed your enthusiasm for the strengthening of the bilateral relations. Which are the economic sectors with a bigger potential for development between Panama and UK?</h4><p>The Double Taxation Convention was a really important step. It established a new channel of information sharing between the UK and Panama, which we believe could lead to the recovery of up to £1 billion in tax revenues in the UK alone. And as well as improving transparency, it also has the potential to encourage more UK investment in Panama by reducing the tax barriers to cross-border investment and putting UK business on an equal footing with competitors from those countries that already have a similar agreement in place, such as France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain. It is a business-friendly treaty that safeguards against tax avoidance and against other issues that can damage trade. This is one example of the work we are doing to boost UK commerce the world over. I think there is particular potential in our partnership with Panama, not least because of the similarities between us. Just as the UK is the gateway to Europe, Panama is the gateway to Latin America. We are both trading nations at heart, with a strong maritime history. I saw for myself the construction of the astonishing new lock at the Panama Canal, which I am sure will cement its position as the world's busiest trade route. I was able to recall Britain's own connection to the canal, by unveiling a plaque to commemorate the Herculean efforts of the British West Indian community in its construction 100 years ago.</p><div class="quote">“The Double Taxation Convention was a really important step."</div><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What actions have been implemented to spread the culture of research and innovation among society?</h4><p>The current government has put a special emphasis on the promotion of science, technology, and innovation (STI), not only by increasing existing funds, but also through the implementation of new funds for R&amp;D, STI, and innovation and innovative entrepreneurship. In all, the resources allocated to these funds add up to over $360 million, and several public entities are involved in their implementation and execution. Also, in a complementary effort, this government has focused on strengthening human capital through important scholarship programs for higher education and technical training.</p><h4>What role does innovation and science play in the country'sgrowth strategy?</h4><p>In July 2014, the National Plan for Productive Diversification was approved. The Plan aims to create new engines for sustainable economic growth, leading to productive diversification and sophistication and the increase of productivity. Innovation is a key element of the Plan, which recognizes that without innovation it is not possible to diversify and grow. This is a lesson learned from the experience of more developed countries, where innovation explains much of their medium-term sustainable growth. The Plan proposes activities and actions that aim at improving and strengthening the innovation and entrepreneurial eco-system. In line with the Plan, our country's innovation strategy has two main objectives; to incorporate innovation in firms' business and competitive strategies, and to increase the number of firms with the capacity to innovate in the future. The first objective is addressed through innovation funds, and the second through technological innovation centers, which will contribute to reducing the productivity gaps of SMEs through technology diffusion, which involves the dissemination of technical information and know-how and providing technical assistance for the subsequent adoption of new technologies and techniques.</p><div class="quote">“In July 2014, the National Plan for Productive Diversification was approved."</div><h4>How have research and innovation funds evolved over time?</h4><p>The Innovation for Competitiveness Project (FINCyT) was established in 2007 through a loan agreement between the Government of Peru (GOP) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). The fund received an allocation of $36 million, with $25 million from IADB and $11 million from the GOP. That was the first step we took in Peru to finance STI activities. In 2009, the government established the Fund of Research and Development for Competitiveness (FIDECOM) with almost $70 million to finance innovation projects in SMEs. In 2012, FINCyT was increased from $36 million to $100 million ($35 million from IADB and $65 million from the GOP), including funding lines for innovation and innovative entrepreneurship. In this manner, the Peruvian government confirmed its solid commitment to promoting innovation, including technological innovation. With the new funding, in 2013 several funding lines were implemented: start-ups, incubators, disruptive innovation, technology transfer for SMEs, and sectoral agendas, among others. In all, today there is funding from the Peruvian government of up to $360 million for science, technology, and innovation funding lines, of which $151 million are assigned to innovation funds, which are brought together under the Innovation for Competitiveness and Productivity Program, established by the Ministry of Production in 2014, in line with the objectives of the National Plan for Productive Development.</p><h4>How does this innovation program contribute to the objective of improving and strengthening the innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem?</h4><p>The program has allowed us to focus on the national strategy set by the Plan, where all funds are aligned and complementary with each other. The instruments address different stages of innovation, such as the identification of gaps and of existing solutions, project development, prototyping, and validation and packaging. There are also funding lines for developing the quality system. In 2014, over $1.6 million has been assigned to 23 startups and four incubators; $0.4 million for the development of two sectoral agendas; and $0.7 million for the accreditation of 11 laboratories. There are also resources available for enterprises to develop and adopt technology that will allow them to increase productivity and, thus, competitiveness. Since the creation of FINCyT, 640 enterprises have benefitted from funding for over $45 million. This funding line provides incentives for enterprises to work jointly with universities or research institutes, by financing up to 70% of the cost of the project, while if the enterprise implements the project on its own, it receives financing for up to 50%.</p><h4>Could you talk us through some of the successful projects supported by the innovation program in recent years?</h4><p>In terms of commercial success, an outstanding case is that of an agro industrial company in Piura, which adapted several technologies from abroad and made its grape production much more efficient and able to yield at seasons in which the product is not available from regular providers worldwide. This project has attained a high commercial impact for the company, and returned to the government up to 12 times in taxes the amount invested by the public fund. It was estimated that in the 2013 to 2017 period, this project will have contributed almost $50 million to Peruvian GDP. In terms of entrepreneurship funding, there are several interesting startups being funded. For example, one is developing an electronic system with RFID technology to facilitate shopping and item detection in the retail industry. Another startup is implementing a web-based platform to design and execute learning programs from semantic searching; this startup has been recognized by MIT and Stanford universities in startup competitions. Other interesting cases include a startup working with modular computer numerical control (CNC) machines for the textile industry, and another working with health food vending machines. In terms of innovative merit, there is a successful project related to seaweed in Arequipa; a new farming area has been developed, where the company extracts certain properties of the algae for commercial purposes. The product obtained is high in proteins and is exported to Chile, where it is widely consumed. There is also a joint poultry project between the company San Fernando and Cayetano Heredia University, in which waste from poultry is utilized to produce fertilizer and organic antibiotics.</p><h4>What are your main goals for the future?</h4><p>We are working toward identifying which sectors of the Peruvian economy have the greatest potential for growth, or could be considered potential economic drivers, and which could lead our country to sustainable economic growth. This will allow the government to focus and align innovative efforts from diverse actors, both private and public. In this way, these sectors should become the engines that lead the Peruvian economy to growth in the medium term. The results of our current innovation funds show that for every $1 invested in an innovative project, there is a return of $7, through the generation of employment or taxes. Our main task will be to consolidate and strengthen the innovation program, making sure the necessary resources are available, and designing and adjusting instruments to provide reimbursable and non-reimbursable funding that will allow innovations to reach the market. Also, special attention will be given to strengthening the innovation eco-system, to raising awareness, and to building the capacity of all actors involved in the innovation system so that they may use the tools that are made available through the innovation program, thus increasing public and private investment in innovation.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a global construction firm with Turkish roots, what does Baytur bring to the Saudi market?<br></h4><p>Baytur is an international contractor and has experience in more than 11 countries. It has vast experience working in different environments, lines, conditions, and legal and cultural standards. Our senior management team understands how to adapt to different requirements. Baytur, as a parent company, has worked in the GCC area since 2004. In addition, it had worked in Saudi Arabia before in the 1980s; therefore, it has adapted to the different requirements of the area, which is not so popular among the Turkish contractors that do not work here. Most of them have broad experiences in Russia and the CIS region, but the conditions in those areas are quite different to this part of the world. Hence, as an active contractor in the Gulf area for 10 years, I think that Baytur has a better understanding. And the high-quality health and safety culture that we have is making a difference in the Saudi market and for the other contractors in our line of business. Mostly, we are concentrating on complex construction works, especially complex building construction work, which requires a high degree of specialization in order to meet the many demands from investors for quality and management style. Our main difference from the average company in the market is this mentality. The focus is mostly on our segment, on the contracting and construction industry, complex buildings, or large complexes, such as medical cities or large hotels. We do not see ourselves participating in the ordinary housing segment, but in high-end complexes.</p><h4>Could you talk in detail about your activities in Jabal Omar and the Mecca Metro?</h4><p>The Mecca Metro is still at the tender stage. Our Jabal Omar project includes the Sheraton Hotel and Westin Hotel, just across from the Kaaba. It will have 1,142 five-star rooms with a large commercial area and a parking area. It is one of the closest places in front of the Kaaba and is a high-end project. Right now, the job is in its structural phase, but is slated for completion by the end of 2015. We are targeting Mecca for other similar projects as well, because in the next 15 years the amount of investment, especially in the specialty sector, will be greater than all of the investments in the rest of the Gulf area. Mecca is a critically important market for us. We are trying to set ourselves up not only for this project, but also for more long-term involvement. We have set up our manufacturing and accommodation facilities there for the long term. Another project that we have underway is the King Khalid University, which is in the southwest part of the country in a city called Abha. This is an ambitious project with a campus for 65,000 students on a site that was empty four years ago when the project started. We are constructing phases II and III. Phase II is the male medical campus, a teaching hospital with 800 beds and several medical colleges covering pharmacy, dentistry, and medical sciences, among others, as well as the dormitory rooms for the medical colleges. At the same time, we are building the administrative buildings, such as the chancellery, museum, main conference center, and the main mosque. The project is scheduled to be finished in June of 2015 and is running on schedule. The third main contract we are executing is for Aramco. Aramco and Sumitomo are constructing the second phase of the Petro Rabigh petrochemical plant. The first package was contracted to us to build the non-process buildings and the site facilities for the project management team that will construct and run the second phase of the petrochemical plant. These are our three main contracts, but under each we have different contracts. We have six different contracts, but there are three main sites.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In terms of the larger development of tourism as a sector of the Saudi Arabian economy, where do you feel that it fits in the trajectory of economic and cultural development?<br></h4><p>The Ministry of Labor says that tourism is the single most important opportunity to create jobs, and our initiatives have already created employment for thousands of people in a sector of the economy without any loans, cheap gas, or any other incentives. That is a very big statement.   We believe that job creation in Saudi Arabia will come from the people and SMEs that provide services rather than large-scale enterprises.</p><p>In addition, we believe that tourism and cultural development are critical to a country's well being. For people to connect to their country, they need tourism services, such as transport, hotels, apartments, and events, as well as places to go and things to do. Tourism development is critical, because it enables people to make their country the first choice for where citizens choose to spend quality time with their families. It is about job creation and energizing the service industry, the construction industry, and the other sectors that benefit from tourism.</p><h4>How do you plan to structure future regulatory changes?</h4><p>This year, I completed a marathon session with the Council Of Ministers to get a new antiquities heritage law approved. That law has been through many cycles of revision, but will soon be implemented. In the past, we restructured the whole tourism industry from the bottom up, beginning with the master plan that was approved in 2005. The antiquities law has taken us seven and a half years and incorporates the lessons from that progress. One of the major wins we have achieved, which also shows the government's confidence in this organization, is that we obtained an exception from the law to create the first public—private business association in the Saudi economy. That was approved in June 2014, and we are now forming the first three associations in the fields of accommodation, tourism and travel, and tour guides. Tour guides, as an industry, were practically non-existent in Saudi Arabia. Now, we have more than 250 fully trained tour guides. We want people to represent this country and where it comes from. It is an important country to us, to all Muslims, and to the rest of the world in terms of its position, place, and economy. We are rediscovering our history and the history of Islam with these new initiatives. We are exploring the country. Never before in the history of Saudi Arabia have we had so much work happening at the same time. There are more than 30 archaeological teams from all over the world excavating in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Is there or a timeframe or the possibility of allowing tourist visas again?</h4><p>We have only temporarily halted attracting tourists from outside the country. The US has about 300 million people, and maybe 40 or 50 million tourists visit every year—that is about one-quarter of the population. In Saudi Arabia, we issued 10.7 million visas in 2013 with a much smaller population. We are not a closed country, and we are not against people coming. We just want to wait until the sites are ready. Therefore, we will open up Saudi Arabia again eventually. It may be site-specific, such as Mada'in Saleh; however, we have opened it before and had no problems whatsoever. We loved the experience. Now, we are targeting markets that are already beginning to open. For example, in 2014 we are opening it to Umrah visitors. People from 65 countries, including Muslims from the US and the UK, will come to perform Umrah and be able to convert to a tourism visa.</p><p>However, the most important tourist we are going to target is the Saudi tourist. Saudi families are, I think, one of the top-five spenders in the world today.   I would be ashamed if I were sitting here pursuing tourists from all over the world and my own people were traveling abroad because they cannot find the services they want or spend the leisure time they want on a one- or two-week vacation in their own country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are the first Saudia affiliate to launch an IPO. Could you talk about the results of this process and the strategy that has produced it?<br></h4><p>We had a fantastic IPO and have experienced significant development in our share price over the past two years. A share price always represents a market assumption of the future development of the company. We believe that we have a solid strategy that has convinced our investors of Saudi Airlines Catering's value. Today, we are an in-flight catering company. We generate about 80% of our total revenues from the airline business. When I joined the company in 2012, we produced a top-level strategic review and worked out a five-year growth plan. The main components of the growth plan are all factors of the KSA airline market, including Saudia Airlines' aggressive fleet and passenger development plans, the investments of the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) in airport facilities, and our diversification strategy. We were proud to announce in early 2014 that we renewed our exclusive contract with Saudia Airlines to the end of 2019. Besides the airline business, we want to expand our activities in our Support Services Division, which includes business and industry catering, remote site and camp management, the industrial laundry business, and our catering activities for Hajj and Umrah pilgrims. Our strategic partnership with Newrest offers Saudi Airlines Catering both the expertise and corporate reach to back and support our diversification, ensuring such an activity is supported by a leading global service organization.</p><h4>How do you plan to maintain your market share as the country liberalizes?</h4><p>Today, we have an estimated inflight catering market share of 98%; however, we know that this kind of monopoly position will not last forever. Our 2017 growth plan includes the assumption that an international in-flight caterer will enter the Saudi market. We simply have to continue to provide high-quality services in competitive conditions—then we don't have to be afraid of any competition. Currently, we do not do much business with other Middle Eastern airlines, because when they fly from their hubs into Saudi Arabia, they practice back-catering, meaning they bring the meals for their back flights with them. This is the industry standard for flights up to about three hours and also Saudia's common practice; however, as soon as foreign airlines start domestic operations, their aircraft will stay overnight in the Kingdom, and consequently will need a local catering service provider. Being the number one in-flight catering service provider in Saudi Arabia, I am confident to be able to establish a fruitful cooperation with any airline that enters the domestic market.</p><h4>How do you expect the government's infrastructure investment to impact the long-term aspects of your business?</h4><p>One major growth factor for our in-flight division is the huge airport infrastructure investments of the GACA. It plans to more than double the capacity of Riyadh's airport, increasing passenger numbers from 15.3 million in 2012 to 35.5 million in 2017. Another project is the new airport in Medina, increasing passenger numbers from 3.6 million in 2012 to 8 million in 2015. And, of course, the new airport in Jeddah is also significant, increasing passenger numbers from 23.6 million in 2012 to 30 million in 2015 (Stage I) and up to 80 million in Stage III by 2035. In addition, there are plenty of expansion projects ongoing for smaller airports, such as Jizan, Abha, and Qassim, to name a few. All these expansion projects will massively drive the growth of our company.</p><h4>How will you meet the growing demand?</h4><p>We are in a constant process of adapting our resources to future market demands. We are constructing a kitchen facility at the new airport in Medina; two years ago, we opened a state-of-the-art central production unit in Riyadh with a capacity of 18 million meals. This production facility will double its capacity by just adding two production tunnels. We are convinced we are ready to cope with the huge growth rates the Kingdom provides us in our business activities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Saudia Aerospace Engineering Industries (SAEI) positioned in the Gulf aviation maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) market?<br></h4><p>We have over 5,300 people working with us, and we are the largest maintenance organization in the Middle East. Approximately 92% of our employees are Saudis, from technicians all the way up to managing directors. During our time in this industry, we have gained a significant amount of experience. As an example of this, the average experience of a Saudi technician at SAEI is 18 years. We maintain the aircraft, and we also maintain the components. As well as an aircraft maintenance and a components maintenance division, we also have an engine division that conducts overhaul programs. We have been overhauling aircraft since 1982, while we started overhauling engines in 1984, which is much longer than any other MRO provider in the region. Since the early 1980s, the most significant organizational change has been privatization, which we are currently finalizing. The initial push for the privatization of SAEI came from the government, with the objective of adding the discipline of private ownership to a state-owned enterprise (SOE), thereby leveraging the experience gained with an increased commercial structure to improve efficiency, support the airline, and acquire good returns on investment. Our plan for 2020 is to continue our current growth path. Right now, Saudi Airlines (Saudia) has 125 aircraft with another 30 on order, as well as more after that. Our income from maintaining Saudia's fleet will represent 60% of our business; however, we are required to source 40% of our income from third-party customers. To do that, we have started building a new maintenance facility, which represents an investment of $1 billion. It is the largest in the region, and even one of the largest in the world. It will include aircraft hangars, workshops for maintaining components, and a brand new, state-of-the-art engine shop, which will be spread out over 1 million sqm with over 7,000 employees. Therefore, considering our ambitious expansion plans, we expect to train and hire another 4,400 people, which is a challenging task.<br></p><h4>There has been unprecedented growth in the aviation sector in the region with the emergence of new carriers and expanding fleets. How are you adapting to this rapidly changing landscape?</h4><p>Let me add another factor to what you have said: the defense. The defense sector is expanding rapidly, both in the Kingdom and in the GCC region as a whole. We expect that the growth represented by military aircraft will boost our expertise to a significantly higher level. We have upgraded our shops so as to double our current capacity. In addition, we are hiring young Saudi technicians at an increasingly high rate, either from our own school or from the existing technical schools. In Saudi Arabia, we are living in an ideal environment for growth. There is huge government expenditure, a massive emphasis on education, a large abundance of engineers, 22 excellent technical schools, and some 150,000 Saudis working outside the Kingdom. In addition to this, technical schools are being established at a rate of one a month. We are concentrating on hiring new Saudis to mix in with the experienced Saudis who already work with us, meaning we wont face a skills gap. This is important, and we are blessed with the ability to easily transfer knowledge thanks to our high degree of Saudization. A Saudi teaching a Saudi is more effective than bringing in expatriate trainers, because there is no language or culture barrier. That is how we aim to expand our staff to 7,000 people. We see a significant amount of demand for maintaining military equipment presently. We are the number one partner of Boeing's military division in the Kingdom, and we also have a partnership with Lockheed Martin, taking care of the C130 fleet. This is a major contract, because Saudi Arabia has the largest C130 fleet in the world apart from the US, with 75 planes. Our engine shop also signed an agreement with GE to overhaul all the military engines in the Kingdom for the F-15, S-92, Blackhawk, and Apache, for example. Beyond that, we are also in discussions with SaudiGulf Airlines and Al-Maha Airways to handle their fleets that will operate within the Kingdom. We offer a total solution whereby they bring in their A320s, and we take complete care of them, including building a hangar and offering full support for those aircraft. We have the experience and know-how in this field since we already manage 50 A320s for Saudia. The airplanes won't even have to leave Saudi Arabia in order for them to receive full MRO services.</p><h4>What other prospects do you have for expansion?</h4><p>Unlike other airlines in the region, we also have a significant domestic presence. We operate out of 27 airports in Saudi Arabia, and have branches in all of these. We support not only Saudia's fleet, but also other carriers from the Gulf and MENA region. Although our four main maintenance centers are located in Jeddah, Riyadh, Dammam, and Medina, we have branches in all airports around the Kingdom. SAEI also has branches overseas in Dubai, Cairo, Damascus, Paris, Beirut, London, Jakarta, Karachi, JFK New York, and Washington DC, and we conduct our own maintenance facilities in all of those airports. Therefore, we are already expansionary in scope, but we want to take that even further by offering total solutions to other carriers and countries.</p><h4>You have an upcoming IPO in 2015. What are you hoping to gain from listing on the Tadawul?</h4><p>We have already sold 30% of our business to private investors. SAEI is now 70% owned by Saudi Arabian Airlines Holding, and 30% by Tarabut Aircraft Maintenance Company (TAMC). The Holding Company has already offered an IPO for Saudi Airlines Catering, and the next will be for Saudi Ground Services, then Saudia Cargo, and finally SAEI. Hence, this will take two to three years. When we sold 30%, Saudia utilized the funds to initiate growth and expansion. SAEI has a service-level agreement that guarantees us the maintenance of the Saudia fleet until 2025; such an agreement will assist us in securing funds to build our facility. The revenue from expanded capacity and capability will be used to pay off our loans.</p><h4>A regulatory change is expected that will ease foreign investments in the country, which may coincide with your IPO. What opportunities exist for potential foreign investors in the MRO industry?</h4><p>The opportunities available in the Kingdom are massive, especially on the military side. There are huge and lucrative contracts with little competition; therefore, we are concentrating in that area, which is growing all the time. We are participating in many industry events, inviting in key industry executives to demonstrate our capabilities. However, the big jump will be when our new facility opens up. It will provide us with the opportunity to attract high-profile customers and investors from outside of Saudi Arabia. The new facility will help us deal with two-years' worth of backlog maintenance work for Saudia, including 73 “D-checks," which are heavy maintenance and overhauls.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are your organization's projects transforming and evolving the platform to meet the needs of the 21st Century?<br></h4><p>Rail is not new to Saudi Arabia, with the system now being in operation for 60 years. Saudi Arabia is a continent as much as a country; it is half the size of Europe. Therefore, to build a rail network requires huge investments. The idea of connecting cities to industrial centers and ports has always existed, but such projects had required the financing that today the country is more able to provide. With rail transport one needs to distinguish between inter-city connections and inner-city public transport systems; in Saudi Arabia, there is a boom in both. We are connecting cities, ports, and industrial zones. Additionally, we are building public transport systems in our major cities. Saudi Railway Company (SAR) is a state-owned company formed in 2006 to build and operate what was called the North-South Rail line (NSR), a 2,400-kilometer line connecting the Saudi capital, Riyadh, with Qurayyat on the Jordanian border through Majma'ah, Qassim, Hail, and Al Jouf. Part of the NSR is the mineral line that connects the massive and growing mines in the north and center of the country, regions that need to be connected to the manufacturing facilities in Ras Al Khair. The primary mandate of SAR is, therefore, this line. It is in operation and vitally transporting phosphate. Subsequently, SAR was tasked to build the network within Jubail. And a year later, we were assigned to build the Jeddah-Riyadh line, which is a land bridge between the Red Sea and the Gulf. The goal is to transport goods arriving from Europe, meaning that they can then be shipped to the East and vice versa. Currently, for goods coming from China, for example, instead of going around the peninsula, then through the Suez Canal, they can use this line. This saves a huge amount of time and, of course, time is money. This line is currently under design and we will connect it to the network. When all is said and done, we will have a network that is freight, mineral, and passenger ready. This is SAR's responsibility, and is what it takes to connect cities.</p><h4>From your point of view, how will the project you've just described change the way commerce is carried out in the country?</h4><p>Logistics, and transportation in particular, have the power to make or break businesses. When it comes to transporting, for example, petrochemical products, the railway will add competition and bring safety to the roads as well as having a huge positive impact on the environment. To give you an example, we have transported 4 million tons of phosphate to date, consuming only around 30% of the fuel that would have been consumed had the same amount been transported by truck. The impact on the country is not necessarily financial, but nonetheless has an indirect economic dimension that prompted the laying of these rail networks. Saudi Arabia is a huge user of fuel, consuming around one-quarter of what it produces. At this rate, by 2030, we will be consuming our entire production. This needs to change, and we are a part of the change. We need to make fuller use of public transport. In terms of customers, we are building the pipeline and working with the major players, including a company called SADARA, a joint venture between Aramco and Dow Chemical, and Saudi Aramco, SABIC, as well as Ma'aden. Once we start to develop the network further we will approach other major players to improve the network utilization. The government is working on incentives to encourage people to use rail instead of trucks.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Burj Rafal Community is now the tallest residential property in Riyadh, with numerous other projects in the pipeline. What strategies have brought RAFAL to this point?<br></h4><p>RAFAL was set up in late 2007 with the aim of becoming a community innovator in Saudi Arabia, focusing on residential properties for the middle-income segment. Our strategy is to create residential communities based around a compound lifestyle. We create both horizontal and vertical communities, with a concept that is entirely new to Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Tell us about Burj Rafal Community and what factors drove RAFAL to develop a residential skyscraper?</h4><p>The main driver was client demand. We believe that Riyadh has the potential to become a business hub. The objective, then, behind the Burj Rafal Community was to provide a home for newly married couples and people with style seeking an address for their home and a second home for people who need to stay in Riyadh for a few days a week. It is ideal for people who are keen to own an alternative home to the familiar horizontal compound. It offers good quality alternative services and facilities; it appeals particularly to the new generation, who enjoy the idea of living in a landmark property that offers unique views that only high vertical properties can provide. Burj Rafal Community targets upper-income groups, with a focus on upper middle-class clientele who seek an alternative vertical lifestyle. The average clients are well-educated, mid-career professionals who want to provide a good home for their families. The design of the homes in our various projects reflects the segment targeted. Therefore, apartments in the Burj Rafal Community are offered in various sizes.</p><h4>You have numerous partnerships, such as the one with Kempinski Hotel, which you brought to Riyadh and started the operations and management of the Burj Rafal Hotel Kempinski. How do you cultivate these relationships?</h4><p>To achieve success in our line of business, we need collaborations and partnerships with different contractors, operators, and facility managers. Kempinski's move into Riyadh resulted in the first Kempinski hotel in Saudi Arabia. We were looking for a brand that would enrich the property itself, because the property is an iconic landmark, and the highest residential, it is the highest in Riyadh. As it transpires, Kempinski was the perfect fit. Meanwhile, we have also entered a structured partnership with a contractor, Dubai Contracting Company (DCC), for its first project in Riyadh. We are willing to take a risk on a company that prioritizes development and expansion in Saudi Arabia, and also believe in long-term structured relationships. In that regard, ours is a more strategic, rather than an investment partnership.</p><h4>The term “community innovation" has long been familiar in other markets. How have you adapted the concept to the Saudi market?</h4><p>People generally can't afford large properties, which has led to a trend for smaller housing. Until recently, public development and infrastructure was not designed along communal lines. Rather, it was mostly about leaving one's private self-contained home and going out among the general public. In a community-type layout, you leave your home to find yourself in your neighborhood, passing by your neighbors, and only gradually moving into the public space. There are certain challenges you have to face into residential schemes here to reflect the reality of Saudi Arabia. For example, people here tend to work late, women do not drive, and there are limited play areas and gardens for children, which is where the community model comes into its own. Children play in the garden, the streets are safer, you have more interaction with your neighbors, and communal facilities foster greater interaction, such as a communal gym. This setup enables the parents to work late with a peaceful mind, assured of a safe family environment where your home has all the services and utilities you need.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Saudi Oger is one of the most successful Saudi companies and one that has changed the construction industry in the region. What strategies have guided this growth and diversification?<br></h4><p>Saudi Oger is a flexible company with a pro-active approach when it comes to business decisions. The management team at Saudi Oger is always searching for opportunities and business lines that can utilize our wealth of experience, know-how, efficiency, and quality of everything we deliver. This approach is based on logic and the investigation of surrounding markets. Diversification and controlled growth help Saudi Oger to reduce the level of risk in a single sector. This leads to larger and steadier growth, and a more efficient utilization of human and financial resources. For example, Saudi Oger, in conjunction with International Power of the UK, was awarded a contract by Aramco involving the development of four electrical power and steam cogeneration plants with a combined total capacity of 1,063 MW. All of these plants have been in operation since 2006 and are operated and maintained by Tihama Power Generation, a company jointly owned by International Power and Saudi Oger, for a period of 20 years on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. In addition, Saudi Oger and its partners won the first airport privatization in Saudi Arabia. The consortium will complete the construction of the passenger terminal by 1H2015, and shall be entitled to operate the Prince Mohammad Bin Abdulaziz Airport for 25 years. These two examples mentioned are only a sample of how Saudi Oger is flexible and looks for opportunities beyond its traditional construction and facilities management business lines.</p><h4>What further international expansion is Saudi Oger now considering, and how will its local performance improve its competitiveness on a global scale?</h4><p>Saudi Oger's construction and facilities management focus is currently on the local Saudi market, though without ignoring the other opportunities that are emerging in the region. The magnitude of work in Saudi Arabia requires massive resources and simultaneous efforts to finish projects on time without compromising quality. With more than 36 years of experience in Saudi Arabia and abroad, Saudi Oger's competitiveness is evident in all of our projects. Our engineers are always developing new technically advanced systems that can achieve results that are faster, cheaper, and less dependent on a massive workforce. This improves Saudi Oger's competitiveness on a global scale, where skilled labor is hard to find.</p><h4>Saudi Oger has developed many lines of business that complement its core of construction. What is the future of Oger's subsidiaries?</h4><p>We believe in providing our clients with solutions that help meet their objectives and enable them to utilize their projects with maximum versatility and efficiency. With this approach in mind, our development of parallel business lines remains focused and purposeful. As an example, our subsidiary Oger Systems provides one-stop-shop solutions to our customers as well as convenient and efficient IT solutions, smart home technologies, and automation control, as well as fully integrated security systems, thus enabling them to create new opportunities to sell more products to clients and customers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the regulatory environment for diagnostics in Saudi Arabia?<br></h4><p>In Saudi Arabia, and especially in the medical sector, business has been growing very rapidly. The Royal Crown has set rules to empower a Saudi Arabian version of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Saudi Food &amp; Drug Authority (SFDA) is the same. It is very strict and sharp, reporting results directly to the Crown. While I believe that it was a good idea, the first implementation lacked some awareness of the new rules and regulations.</p><h4>Is Roche going to be involved in the King Abdullah Medical Center project?</h4><p>In my position as Head of Diagnostics, I was involved in every Ministry of Health laboratory. The project involved 2,000 polyclinics, from which we received a significant share. We are supplying more than half of the Ministry of Health sites in Saudi Arabia. With our unique instruments and services, we have secured complete customer satisfaction, with many people praising our work. However, the competition is there and it is very strong. Unfortunately, not every company shares the same commitment to better quality for patients in the Kingdom. We continue to try our best to be the partner of choice for in-vitro diagnostics, and to deliver the basis for better medical decisions at the government, Ministry of Health, and private level.</p><h4>How is Roche positioned to capitalize on the healthcare boom in the GCC?</h4><p>Roche is uniquely positioned as being not only the world market leader in in-vitro diagnostics, but as well offers the broadest portfolio of solutions. Roche is among the top-10 companies in the world when it comes to spending on innovation, and everything we do is driven by our aim to deliver what patients need. In the Middle East in particular, we are the only global diagnostics company that has established its own affiliate in the region. We take all decisions locally, close to our customers in the GCC. We have our scientifically trained marketing personnel available to support our team anytime; we maintain a stock of reagents and instruments for the entire region in the UAE, so that we can ensure product quality and availability. Our customer support center takes calls from our end-customers to help them with expert knowledge to directly answer their technical and application requests. All together, we maintain the largest customer support organization in the Middle East in our industry.</p><h4>What role do women play at Roche in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Roche has a new office, and the company has developed an entire department for female Saudi employees. We currently have a private office for eight women who are not salespeople or field service engineers, but medical technologists who are knowledgeable about Roche products. They can work in areas such as technical support, workflow solutions, and the training center. Now, female Roche employees can take part in our organization, and the Roche target is to achieve a 10% total head count for women, as part of our Saudization efforts. Roche premises in Saudi Arabia have fulfilled the requirement to provide all female employees with the privacy of their own entrance and washroom. Before the end of 2013, Roche hired the first woman to join the Roche team in Saudi Arabia, and we aim to hire more women for our team. Currently, we are interviewing to see who has the right degree in medical devices or applied sciences to meet the requirements for working with us.</p><h4>Looking ahead toward the coming two years, what are your targets, and how do you plan to achieve them?</h4><p>We want to become the trusted partner of choice for in-vitro diagnostics throughout the region. We have achieved this with many important healthcare providers, such as the King Faisal Hospital, military hospitals, the Ministry of Health, Sheikh Khalifa Medical City in Abu Dhabi, and the Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Group. But there are a lot of new projects coming up in Saudi Arabia, and we want to ensure that more facilities use us as the provider of high-quality diagnostics to ensure better medical decisions for patients in the Kingdom.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the importance of regulation in the food and drug sector?<br></h4><p>Regulations are essential because they protect the market and the population from counterfeit products. Our regulations apply across the board, to all players in the market, and we do not treat local and international players differently. Our job is to ensure that all the products in the market comply with the regulations. Applying the same standards and principles to both international and local products not only safeguards the market from low-quality products, it also results in local products becoming more competitive.</p><h4>Over the past decade, what have been the main initiatives of the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA)?</h4><p>We are putting our knowledge into action, and implementing our guidelines in accordance with our mandate. We are using electronic tracking to speed up our operations, and we have formed strong ties with leading regulatory entities, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to assist us in our work. We intend to strengthen our collaboration with the FDA even more. One of SFDA's main goals is to standardize its regulations with those of our neighboring countries. The food and drug industry is a fast-moving one, and we need to adapt to it. Even the best regulations become outdated rapidly, and we have to actively cope with such changes.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia is an enormous country with a fast-developing economy. What are the challenges of regulating and enforcing the standards in such circumstances?</h4><p>We are adapting an electronic control system, with the aim of becoming a paperless organization by the end of 2014. We use electronic communications between our head office in Riyadh and our local branches. We also have an ambitious plan for expanding our branch network across Saudi Arabia—we plan to open around 15 new branches within the next four years. It will take some time to find appropriate premises and hire the necessary staff. A particular challenge for the SFDA is that we need to take into consideration certain religious and cultural rules when adapting international regulations for use in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>The SFDA aims to increase the competitiveness of Saudi Arabian producers abroad. What efforts ensure that all the companies in the Saudi Arabian pharmaceutical market are competing on the same level?</h4><p>We have a number of procedures; the first is that we visit the company to ensure it complies with the regulations. We also make sure that any imported product is marketed in its country of origin. Then, the product goes through the registration process. After that, we analyze samples. We also collect and study samples after a product is in the market. Along with regulating the products, we are making the market as competitive as we can, because consumers benefit from the competition. The guidelines and regulations are clear, and we collaborate with the government agencies in the countries that we have relationships with to make sure we apply the same standards as they do. We also collaborate with international agencies to ensure our supply chain is secure. By controlling the market ,we increase competitiveness. The percentage of counterfeit products in Saudi Arabia is extremely low compared to other developed countries. It is less than 1%, according to our surveys.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you use partnerships to further prepare students for the job market?<br></h4><p>This is actually one of the main strategic objectives of King Saud University (KSU). One of university's main objectives is to build strong relationships with companies in the private sector. Our university has nine strategic objectives, one of which is to build bridges with private companies, whether they be local or international. Relationships with SABIC, Aramco, or any other major private company are important to KSU. We already have established strong relationships with several companies, including SABIC, which has a branch and operates on the university campus. SABIC provides opportunities for KSU's students and staff to collaborate with its branch here at the university to conduct research and join in its daily work process. We have studied carefully to find the best universities worldwide and formed close relationships with them. KSU has agreements with the Imperial College in the UK, the University of Munich in Germany, and the University of Wuerzburg, among others. I recently returned from Canada, where KSU signed an agreement with McGill University and Toronto University. KSU also has two agreements with South Korean universities. All of these agreements are designed to facilitate the exchange of students and academics for joint research, in addition to giving our teaching assistants in the medical school the chance to spend part of their training residencies at these universities. KSU is keen to strengthen this new administration, and we are spending significant efforts and resources to facilitate these kinds of agreements. We look forward to achieving great results.</p><h4>How are you advancing the goal of making KSU a hub for research in Saudi Arabia and increasing the number of papers published by your students and staff?</h4><p>In addition to what has been made available from the government budget for supporting research, the government also allows KSU to generate its own income to support education and research. In this regard, the university has come up with multiple options to boost its research and publishing in terms of quality and quantity. KSU has, for example, created scientific chairs. Some of them are created and supported by wealthy people in the community. They want to promote research, meaning they grant money to endow a chair. The remaining chairs are supported by the university. Whenever KSU finds someone among our faculty who is especially bright and committed to research, we give them a chance to head the chair and support him or her with funding. Then, we evaluate their work, and according to the evaluation, KSU either continues funding them or shifts the funding to a new chair if the performance is not up to our standards. If it meets KSU's standards, we try to market the chair that we sponsor to people from the community to participate and fund. KSU has also created international research groups where our academics and researchers try to form links with international research groups and find and propose topics of research and publish together. The university also created research centers in each college, whether it is in the humanities, science, or health, with an annual budget to support researchers. We have a collaboration project as well with the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology. It provides every university with the chance to apply for grants out of their budget. Every year, KSU gets about 50% of that budget. KSU has also created the King Saud University Awards for Scientific Excellence and this is the second year that we have awarded them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where do your stakeholders originate?<br></h4><p>We are a Saudi real estate development company established in Saudi Arabia in 2006, and we initially focused on middle income housing within integrated housing communities, which we target because it is the primary growth segment in the Saudi market.</p><h4>What community development format are you trying to achieve?</h4><p>We are developing communities, but that is not the whole story—we are developing integrated communities. This involves developing the infrastructure and superstructure and incorporating all end-user requirements and needs, such as hospitals and clinics that reflect the size of neighborhood, in addition to schools, mosques, and commercial strips. For commercial strips we need to make sure all the facilities are there, be it a laundry, grocery, bakery, or whatever other services are required to make sure that we are developing a fully integrated community.</p><h4>Which projects are you most excited about?</h4><p>Our first project, Manazel Qurtoba, is an integrated quality housing community with full services, like schools, mosques, and housing for different segments, starting from single bedroom apartments to five- or six-bedroom villas. We've developed the mosques, strip malls, and schools in the neighborhood. All of the infrastructure is in place and I consider it a successful business model. It is already sold and people are living there. We are starting the final stage of the project having begun in 2008, and receiving occupants in 2009.</p><h4>How are the changes in the Saudi mortgage law helping end-user financing?</h4><p>We cannot talk about the impact of the mortgage law on the market because it hasn't yet started, but we are expecting a negative impact on the market and the region because of the high down payment required by the authorities.</p><h4>How do you maximize cash flow into the market?</h4><p>We depend on self-financing from the projects through early sales. In such a scenario, we sell a number of units within a stage of the project and proceed to subsequent stages accordingly. We change the pace of the project stages to ensure the cash flow is as planned.</p><h4>What are your plans for expansion over the next several years?</h4><p>Our main strategy is to deliver 10,000 units by the end of 2017, and have already developed 1,000 units, with 2,617 units under construction. By the end of 2017, we should deliver about 10,000 units. We want to have a sustainable business plan of delivering 2,500 units per annum.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia has a housing shortage. Are you contributing a solution?</h4><p>Part of our work involves social responsibility as part of our core beliefs: we are not only business-oriented; we are pleased to contribute to society by developing suitable housing.</p><h4>What do you do to help increase the human resource potential within the Kingdom?</h4><p>Actually, within our company here, more than 40% of the staff are Saudi. We have an orientation and training program for our employees, and we usually hire local graduates and train them on a yearly basis to grow up within the organization. So far, this program has seen limited success, and we are developing it further.</p><h4>What is your biggest challenge?</h4><p>Currently, the primary challenge is in fact human resources and labor. The contractors we work with have seen some difficulties regarding staffing, and it will take a year or two for those to level out. The related immigration reform will impact costs by a minimum of 10%. It is always important to watch cost, quality, and time, and so we try to deliver projects on time to ensure our targeted return on investment.</p><h4>What is the competition like regarding human resources?</h4><p>It is generally hard to find qualified people, and this makes for strong competition for the right employee. We operate a retention plan, with such incentives as stock options, and we offer something like a fixed-bonus paid after five to 10 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does Saudi Arabia fit in Zain's regional strategy?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is one of the most important markets for Zain Group, from both a volume and value perspective. Today, after five years of operations, we are proud to serve 8.5 million subscribers each and every day. From a revenues perspective, we are the largest operating company in Zain Group, although we have by far the lowest market share in Saudi Arabia. This makes Saudi Arabia the biggest growth opportunity within the Group. We were fortunate to start our operations in Saudi Arabia with the latest in mobile telecommunications technology. In fact, we were awarded the first mobile telecommunications license in Saudi Arabia that allowed the use of 4G mobile technology.</p><h4>How do you plan to build on the progress Zain has seen here in order to push the company forward in the coming years?</h4><p>The way that we communicate continues to change. Today, our customers make more use of smartphones, apps, and our fast data network than ever before. We live in a rapidly changing world, where advances in technology have enabled us all to communicate more often, in a radically different way than before. Zain plays a vital part in enabling this communications revolution. Critical to our success is that we offer our customers the best possible customer experience and that our customers genuinely perceive that we care. Our customers continue to rely more and more on our services to keep in touch with their family and friends, as well as be a source of information and entertainment. We understand that mobile data communication is uniquely relevant in Saudi Arabia, and in response to our customer's demands, we have optimized our network to provide a best-in-class user experience when accessing social networking sites and streaming video services, such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.</p><h4>What about Arab-language content and the creation of applications in the country?</h4><p>In the Saudi Arabian market, we believe we have to preserve our culture. We would like to adapt all the applications and services of the world to our local culture to preserve our Saudi Arabian identity. This is what we will be doing, and I believe that the country can be an important generator of Arabic and Islamic content. By having the correct telecommunications infrastructure, mobile services will extend into banking, media, television, agriculture, education, and health.</p><h4>Where do you hope to take Zain by the end of your tenure?</h4><p>Each time we reach a milestone, we think that we have made enough progress, only to then discover that there is more to be achieved. A telecommunications operator is an enabler; whatever the country needs and whatever Saudi Arabian citizens need, it is our duty to provide it. Saudi Arabia is number one in terms of Twitter users globally, and we have 90 million views on YouTube per day originating here. This places us under pressure to deal with such colossal growing demand.</p><h4>How has mobile telephony changed?</h4><p>I am proud of the fact that since the first cellular telephone call on April 3, 1973, this industry has grown to support over 7 billion connections, approximately one for every inhabitant on the planet. During this time, I have seen the industry evolve into the dynamic customer experience centric-environment it is today. As mobile operators, we all have access to the same technology as our competition, we excel in the way we delight our customers, and provide the best-in-class voice, data, and video mobile communications.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Saudia Cargo began as a part of Saudi Arabian Airlines, but separated from that company and is evolving on its own. Where do you fit into the Saudi Arabian and GCC market space, and what are your broader ambitions?<br></h4><p>Saudi Arabian Airlines is the flagship airline for the country, and, like all airlines, cargo is usually one of the products sold in addition to passenger space. The privatization vision of the Saudi Arabian Airlines group allowed Saudia Cargo to become an independent entity focused on pursuing its own growth strategy. This was met with success when a 30% stake of the cargo business was sold to a group of private investors and the company was formed. The sale introduced a private sector mindset into a public sector company. This mindset is part of a transformation to become more competitive and aggressive in the marketplace. Once that joint venture was established in 2008, various structural changes took place, and we experienced enormous growth as the company became more focused and driven. The types of challenges we have as a business are quite different from those that you would find in most parts of the world. Our problems are ones linked to growth, whereas many other companies struggle with the other side of the coin. Our business is mainly divided into two focus areas. The first area is our global cargo airline business. The second area is our cargo ground handling company. For the global cargo business, we have 100% access to our sister company Saudi Arabian Airline's belly capacity. In addition, we have our own large freighter fleet. If you compare us with other airlines in the region, we are a significantly large freighter fleet operator as we have 15 dedicated cargo aircraft. Most regional air cargo companies are more dependent on belly passenger capacity. Geographically, where we do not have enough capacity on the passenger side, we operate our own freighters. We also recently added two 747-8s into our fleet, and we are looking at adding even more capacity in 2015.</p><h4>What is your medium-term growth strategy?</h4><p>We have the responsibility for handling cargo, both ramp and warehouse, for ourselves and other airlines at all of the main international airports in Saudi Arabia. This includes the King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, King Fahd International Airport in Dammam, and the airport in Medina. In addition to that, we handle cargo through outsourcing arrangements in the rest of the Kingdom's airports. We have our own development plans for how we see the future, and are investing heavily in expanding and enhancing all of those cargo facilities. Due to our fast growth pace, warehouse capacity has become a constraint as we have reached the design limitations of most of the existing cargo facilities. We have, as I mentioned, an interesting problem, which is one to do with growth. A challenge we face today on the ground is how to channel more volumes through the existing warehouses in support of the growth while the new facilities are being built. These are temporary solutions that we will rely on until we expand our facilities. These facilities will not stop at buildings, or at warehouses. We are also exploring the concept of cargo villages.</p><h4>In terms of the split between the international and the domestic cargo business, how do you foresee that developing?</h4><p>In the Kingdom, we support the country's logistics infrastructure and provide the public with a faster, more specialized mode of cargo transportation that compliments the existing infrastructure of sea, road, and rail. Most of where we operate, however, is in the international arena with all of the air cargo coming into the Kingdom and being exported out of the Kingdom. Not only that, but we also provide our customers with a global air cargo network as we bridge east, west, north, and south, benefiting from our geographical location in the heart of the Middle East.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Bahri contributed to the economic development of the country as a whole?<br></h4><p>Our economy has more exports and imports compared to our GDP than many other countries in the world. This is why the maritime sector is so important as most of the transportation needs are met via the sea. Saudi Arabia's long coastline and major investments in infrastructure including ports has helped the industry to grow with tremendous activity in our Ports. Today, Bahri vessels frequently call on many of these ports, especially in Dammam, Jubail, Jeddah, and Ras Tanura. Actually, the idea for the establishment of our company The National Shipping Company of Saudi Arabia (Bahri) in 1978 was a government and private sector initiative to help strengthen the nation's maritime infrastructure and be more self-sufficient in facilitating our trading requirements. Since then, the company has grown to become a truly global player in terms of size, importance, and diversification. Bahri (or NSCSA as it was referred to then) started in the late 1970s with time chartered general cargo ships, and we did our first new build program in the early 1980s, when the building of four ro-ro ships were commissioned in Sweden, where some of the best ships were constructed. Those ships were retired just last year, after serving the company for almost 30 years. They were well-built, well-maintained, and were in excellent condition, even when they were retired, as per the industry standard. Since then, the company has gone into a number of new build programs and partnerships to grow to what it is today.</p><p>The company has a large history of building successful and lasting partnerships in every field or area where it started. We partner with eminent Saudi companies, such as SABIC and ARASCO, both of which have a significant stake in the respective business segments of National Chemical Carriers (NCC) and Bahri Dry Bulk (BDB), respectively. The latest development is the landmark agreement with Saudi Aramco involving the merger of the entire fleet and operations of its subsidiary, Vela International Marine, with Bahri. This makes Bahri the exclusive provider of crude oil marine transportation for Saudi Aramco on a delivered basis. It also positions Bahri as the national transportation champion in the Kingdom. Today, the asset base of the company is more than SAR12 billion. Post-Vela transaction, which will be finalized by 4Q2014, the asset base will exceed SAR17 billion.</p><h4>What are the benefits of the merger with Vela's fleet and operations?</h4><p>This merger is good for the nation, Saudi Aramco, and for Bahri. It is good for Saudi Arabia because it will further strengthen the maritime industry, give it a new profile, and open the door to further development in the sector. It is good for Saudi Aramco because it widened its control and access to guaranteed tonnage in an efficient way. And for Bahri, it will give us access to a huge, exclusive business, with the potential to benefit from economies of scale. It also opens the door wide for further collaborations with Saudi Aramco in the future in other areas. The transaction involves Vela's 14 VLCCs, a floating storage VLCC, one Aframax tanker and four product tankers, and operations including related employees both offshore and onshore. The transaction is valued at $1.3 billion. This will be satisfied by Bahri making a cash payment of $832.75 million whilst, the rest will be paid via the issuance of 78,750,000 new Bahri shares to Saudi Aramco at an agreed price of SAR22.25 per share. The new Bahri shares held by a wholly owned Saudi Aramco subsidiary will represent a 20% shareholding interest in Bahri.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where do you currently stand in the market, and what strategies have brought you to this point?<br></h4><p>Our consistent hard work has earned us the reputation we have in the market. We are known for our quality of work and for our on-time delivery. We always endeavor to avoid any conflicts with our clients as well as our subcontractors. Since its inception in the early 1970s, Almabani has participated in major public projects, mainly airports, roads, and government buildings, as well as military construction. We have been able to prevail in periods in which there was a construction boom as well as when the market was depressed by doing our best to preserve our human resources. This is why you can find people who have been working at Almabani for over 30 years, myself included. Our human resources are our greatest asset. We do not have people who come and go; we have people who come and stay. We have always focused on public-sector projects, working with the ministries of defense, the interior, and transport. One of our main clients is the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA). Almabani has worked on 14 airports around the country, upgrading their runways and taxiways. We have recently built or upgraded three airports and terminals in four regional airports at Yanbu, Madain Salah, Al Ula, and Najran, and we are the second lowest bidder now in Abha. We focus mostly on the airport business, and are known as the main airport contractor. Besides airports, one of Almabani's landmark projects is the extension of roads that cross the airbase inside Riyadh. What brought us here is the consistency of our work, our commitment to our clients to deliver on time, the quality we give, and the fact that we always do our best to finish a job without any conflicts.</p><h4>There is significant spending on major infrastructure projects at the moment. What makes you competitive in this environment?</h4><p>There are contractors from many foreign companies operating here, such as Turkey, South Korea, China, and Spain. We deal with this is by training our people to ensure that they are up to the task, to seek more efficient ways of performing, and we have become specialists in certain types of work where we think we can have the advantage over other companies. We focus on niche work where we have superior expertise, and where we can perform more efficiently and productively vis-í -vis our competitors. We also ensure that we allocate the necessary assets and resources for our projects so that we are never short of manpower, equipment, or other essentials.</p><h4>What are your main areas of expertise?</h4><p>Almabani's focus is infrastructure and roads. We just won the metro project in Riyadh. We are a member of the BACS Consortium of four companies, namely Bechtel, Almabani, CCC, and Siemens. We won $10.1 billion worth of projects out of the total $23 billion for the metro project, meaning we have almost 40% of the entire metro project in Riyadh, which is a five-year job. We are one of three consortia that share this $23 billion project. For our part of the project, Bechtel, Almabani, and CCC will perform the civil work, and Siemens will manufacture the rolling stock and do the signalization for the project. This project alone has taken Almabani up to a new level. We now compete with international companies on similar large-scale projects. We worked hard to get this project, and it is a significant achievement that will open up new horizons. First, we have to consolidate a deal for the large resources demanded for this project. In the medium term, we seek annual growth rates of 20% to 25%, for the next five to six years at least. In 2013, we grew at a remarkable rate—70%—because of the metro project. We hope to maintain a strong rate of annual growth. Eventually, after a period of consolidation to deal with the volume of work ahead of us, we want to branch out overseas.</p><h4>Where do you see yourself in 2020 in terms of business and your market position?</h4><p>Right now, we are one of the top-five contracting companies in Saudi Arabia, with a yearly volume of $1 billion, and we are aiming for 20% to 25% annual growth. The construction boom will continue for the coming five years. Once it subsides, and if it subsides, we will look at maintenance and development projects, and also at finding new markets in the MENA region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What efforts are you making to address the needs of local and international companies in what has become a technology-heavy economy?<br></h4><p>Technology Control Company (TCC) is all about bringing in technologies from international companies. And, in 2008, when the company was founded, we realized that there was a need for local critical solution ICT to be built utilizing the best technologies available. There is a distinct lack of technology transfer and a need for a local means of sourcing the latest technology for local firms. From the beginning, we decided not to be box movers for international companies; we decided that we have to be a hands-on operation, keen on building our local capabilities. We are not resellers or distributors; we facilitate technology innovation for locals. There are certain niche sectors that we work in, such as security. Work in this area must be local and, therefore, our participation is key.</p><h4>In terms of security, what trends are you currently observing?</h4><p>Cyber security is a current trend that everyone is talking about. Business and personal consumption alike are today increasingly looking to cloud computing. Security has therefore become a crucial consideration and awareness is, in some ways, more important than the tools and techniques used to ensure it. Information is now shared and everything is mobile, which is precisely where we provide our services. We secure information from the end user to the service provider, and this instills confidence in the public when using their personal information. We are working in the areas of security and encryption; that is to say, making sure that end-user data is not in any way compromised. This is a large undertaking requiring considerable investment. We are developing a local service and participating with international partners to build and customize it.</p><h4>This year has been described as the “Year of Encryption." Moving forward, do you have any plans for growth regionally?</h4><p>Yes, absolutely, this is our core business. We have just launched our new secure token “Makeen." It is a national product, the first Saudi national encryption token, and the backbone for many encryption systems. The related device can encrypt and protect your data at a personal or corporate level. It was developed 100% by a local R&amp;D team. This said, we enjoy a healthy information exchange with experts at universities all over the world that enables us to expand our capability. We are training our Saudi team, which is a long-term process, but an essential one that will provide them with the skillset needed to develop their own techniques and methodology, and tailor it for the local market. We are in a position today to release a number of our products and offer our experience abroad, especially in the GCC. Security quite simply has to be a localized, leveraging technology that is native to your region that can be customized for the local market.</p><h4>Technology, and especially encryption, is a very fast-moving field. What trends do you see on the horizon that you'll have to respond to going forward?</h4><p>Moving from a local desktop network to a wireless one, people increasingly conduct business by smartphone. They do not want to be dependent on a certain location at a certain time. We need to give them the flexibility to work from anywhere, and in order to do that we need to protect transmissions. Cyber security, in that respect, is more important than ever.</p><h4>Where do you hope to see TCC in five years in terms of growth and market position?</h4><p>We have a set strategy and are continuing to build our capability. We're also considering an entry into infrastructure, a new business line for us. TCC is, therefore, set to become a holding specialized in different critical solution systems. I hope that within five years we'll have become a regional company, with an especially strong presence in the GCC.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Saudia Private Aviation (SPA) gone from being a part of Saudi Arabian Airlines to today being a separate company on the verge of privatization?<br></h4><p>Since the 1970s, there has been a strong relationship between global GDP and the number of passengers. Our industry tends to automatically move in line with macroeconomic trends. The aviation industry worldwide contributes approximately 3.4% to average global GDP. And this is around the same ratio that the aviation industry contributes to Saudi Arabia. Obviously, the Middle East's GDP growth is around 7.9%, most of which comes from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries in the Middle East. The industry employs roughly 300,000 people, directly or indirectly. The nice thing about our industry is the fact that it provides good jobs and a good quality of life for employees considering the fact that, with a high-school degree, you can be a co-pilot or an aircraft mechanic with a great starting salary. Basically, in terms of contribution to the economy, we generate about SAR53 billion ($14.13 billion) per year. Private aviation has become a part of these statistics. There were 15,700 private aircraft worldwide in 2010 and that figure is expected to double, reaching 30,000 aircraft by 2020. That is a CAGR worldwide of about 6.9%. In the Middle East, out of those 15,700, there are roughly 400 aircraft, and 60% of those 400 are linked to the Saudi market. In that regard, the Saudi market is considered to be a major player in private aviation. The private aviation business in Saudi Arabia consists of five key segments: the Royal Family, corporates, government officials, travel agents, and brokers. As far as privatization goes, we are one of the strategic business units of Saudi Arabian Airlines. The whole objective of having an investment business unit as part of the privatization project that took place at Saudi Arabian Airlines was to overhaul the company from an organizational and financial point of view, with the eventual objective of becoming fully efficient with a private company mentality. Eventually, we would like to go and participate in an IPO. SPA is not just a company, but the largest operator of Dassault Falcons in the region. At the same time, we have a good share of the domestic market via our small, six-seat aircraft. This aircraft addresses the dynamic lifestyle of the new businesspeople of Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How will the new airports coming online affect your business?</h4><p>As a matter of fact, it will complement our strategy because, basically, infrastructure is considered to be the bread and butter of our business. SPA's new fixed-base operator (FBO) in King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah is a good example of this infrastructure. We have full-sized lounges and complete facilities that include a boutique hotel for flight crew. Infrastructure is a strong foundation for future growth. Likewise, the new King Abdulaziz International Airport, with all of its new facilities, will be positive for all the operators around the airport. Airports usually come with highway and transportation improvements, and we are going to take advantage of this improved accessibility.</p><h4>Where do you expect to see the firm by 2020?</h4><p>I think our two successes are our customer satisfaction and the fact that we can meet our shareholders' expectations from a commercial point of view. Success, for us, is being able to grow with the market, being able to compete, and being able to adapt to change. I think we have geared up with a lot of analysis and a lot of groundwork taking place over the past several months to come up with a strategic plan that will ensure our position in 2020. Our strategic plan counts on our ability to diversify our revenue avenues. That includes maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO); ground handling; expanding the charter business; aircraft management; and eventually providing elite shuttle services between key cities in Saudi Arabia and the region. That is very much in the pipeline at this stage, but it will be a semi-scheduled entity in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The growth of the aviation industry is one of the many positive changes taking place in Saudi Arabia, and the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) plays a major role in this sector's development. What does GACA expect to achieve from the transformation process now being carried out in this sector?</h4><p>In November 2011, a number of Royal Resolutions were issued calling for the separation of GACA from the Ministry of Defense and Aviation and directly linking it to the Council of Ministers. These Resolutions really constituted an important turning point in the history of Saudi Arabia's civil aviation sector, due to the great momentum and independence they have given the sector to enable it to accomplish more progress and prosperity in the country's air transport industry. This industry is no doubt one of the major economic drivers capable of attracting capital and investments, and it employs thousands of people both directly and indirectly, besides its great contribution to the development of many Saudi cities and villages. In December 2012, the Council of Ministers issued a resolution approving “The Comprehensive Strategic Plan for the Advancement of the Civil Aviation Industry in Saudi Arabia." The strategic plan can be summarized in the following way: the resolution seeks to raise the sector's efficiency, and enable it to play its role using modern standards; it seeks to expand national and international private sector participation through well-planned strategic programs; it will maintain international safety and security standards and raise the aviation sector's contribution to the Saudi economy from SAR30 billion to SAR100 billion a year; it will help cope with the developments taking place in the regional and international civil aviation industry; and it will help exercise and organize the powers and functions specified in the Civil Aviation Regulations. Moreover, the resolution will also help assure a sufficient number of flights are provided, to meet the increasing demand for travel, by granting more licenses and incentives to air carriers for serving domestic airports. It will also improve GACA's organizational chart and financial system, while expanding and upgrading airport infrastructure and the air navigation system. Finally, the plan will help develop the necessary legislation for liberating the civil aviation sector, and separate the legislative and monitoring aspects from operational functions. Saudi Arabia's civil aviation sector has the necessary resources to play an important role as a kind of “air bridge" between eastern and western countries, and attract international air traffic to Saudi airspace and airports, as well as huge investments. These specific resources include: Saudi Arabia's religious status, its distinctive strategic geographical location, various aspects of its political and security stability, having an airport network composed of 27 airports well distributed in the different parts of the country supported by integrated navigational systems. We also have significant economic, financial, and oil power, as well as our ambitious development plans, and important tourist attractions. In view of the aforementioned, we can confidently say that Saudi Arabia's civil aviation sector has a promising bright future.</p><h4>In 2007 GACA opened the door for privatization in some of its sectors, and in 2012 it granted domestic and international air carrier licenses to Al Maha Airways and SaudiGulf Airlines. How can GACA's legislations encourage competitors to enter the Saudi market?</h4><p>GACA has granted a scheduled national air carrier license to SaudiGulf Airlines in which Gulf Air acts as a technical partner, but the airline's capital is 100% Saudi. The second license was granted to Al Maha Airways, which is a Saudi Airline independent from Qatar Airways. As for GACA's initiatives to encourage airlines to enter the Saudi market, GACA has prepared a Domestic Fares Manual, which was approved by the GACA Board of Directors and is expected to contribute to the increase in number of domestic flights. Under the existing guidelines featuring low domestic fares and other aviation charges, which have been applicable for quite a long time now, no airline will be able to operate profitably. A committee was formed by GACA and other concerned authorities to study the reduction of fuel prices in the Saudi airports and the committee's recommendations were submitted to the supreme authorities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Rail has a long history in Saudi Arabia that began with the Hejaz railway. What is the Saudi Railways Organization (SRO) doing to expand the rail transport platform in Saudi Arabia today?<br></h4><p>After the Hejaz railway, Aramco started constructing a railway between Riyadh and Dammam via Hofuf and Haradh in 1951, and the line stretched for 560 kilometers. SRO was established in the mid-1960s and constructed a direct passenger line in the 1980s between Riyadh and Hofuf. Now, SRO's activities cover passenger links between Riyadh and Dammam, as well as cargo. We have 10 scheduled passenger services on that line, five from each end, and we recently added another two from Dammam to Hofuf. We have 16 cargo trains operating daily from Dammam to Riyadh, transporting containers from the seaport in Dammam to the dry port in Riyadh, which we also operate. In 2013, we moved 534,000 containers, and we plan to increase this number even further. We also carry cement from the factory to the port in Dammam for export. In addition to this, we are also increasing our transportation of imported cars from Dammam to Riyadh. We currently have 20 wagons solely for that purpose, and intend to build on this operation. SRO has a program to add more locomotives; we have already taken delivery of some, while more are currently being manufactured. We signed a contract with a US company to manufacture 500 wagons to carry cement, corn, and limestone. In addition to that, we are currently in the bidding stage to develop more freight lines, such as the 213-kilometer stretch for a double line from Haradh to Riyadh. This is part of the larger project for the Dammam Port, and the great plan to expand the port's capacity, both in terms of cargo and its ability to receive ships.</p><h4>How will the Haramain high-speed train change the experience of pilgrims, and also energize commerce in western Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>In global terms, high-speed rail is not new; however, in Saudi Arabia we face particular challenges in terms of design and the type of rail systems needed to suit our conditions. The line will run from Mecca to Medina, passing through Jeddah and King Abdullah Economic City. It will be 450 kilometers in length, with an operational speed of 300 km/h, using electrically powered trains. Phase I of the project consists of two packages, the first one for civil engineering, and the second for the passenger stations. There will be five stations, at Mecca, Jeddah, King Abdullah Economic City, Medina, and a station connecting King Abdulaziz Airport that will support this project. Phase II will be carried out by a Spanish consortium. There are 12 Spanish companies involved in total including three government companies and two Saudi companies on the project. They are working together to construct everything, including the rail, communications, control centers, and training centers, as well as carry out maintenance and operations works for the next 12 years. Under that contract, 70% of the workforce will be Saudi Arabian nationals before the completion of the operation period, and, of course, they will be trained throughout the project. Because it is going to connect Medina to Mecca, even without the Hajj pilgrims, the network will move at least 50 million passengers a year. When it is complete, I believe everyone will take the train, which will enable the freer movement of human and intellectual resources across the region. This development will have a huge impact on the people and the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Al Balad Al Ameen Urban Regeneration and Development Company (ABAM) has an impressive array of projects in Mecca, including urban regeneration, rail, and more. What are the larger goals and aspirations that govern your activities?<br></h4><p>Al Balad Al Ameen is fully owned by the Municipality of Mecca. It is incorporated as a commercial arm of the Municipality through a Royal Decree. The main objectives in incorporating the company are to develop the city—which includes urban planning and regeneration of 65 unplanned settlements spread across the city—to provide affordable and high quality housing for the local population, and to develop the suburbs.</p><h4>How, since the beginning of your efforts, has the mandate or the goal of your projects developed?</h4><p>Considering the short life of the company, we have already created the following four subsidiaries, which are executing various projects together in partnership with the private sector. Bawabat Makkah is developing the suburbs within an area of about 100 square kilometers around the Mecca-Jeddah highway. Wahat Makkah was created to build 4,000 dwellings and apartments, of which 500 units have been delivered, and 1,500 were due to be delivered by Ramadan 2014, while the rest will be finished in two years time. The Makkah Metro Company was created with the objective of developing an underground and light rail in the city of Mecca. A master plan has already been developed, and the budget for the first phase of this plan has already been approved by the government. The tender for project execution is under preparation and the remaining formalities for awarding the contracts are due to be completed. The Diyafah Company was created to focus on hospitality and IT-related developments, which will serve pilgrims and visitors. Furthermore, another three companies are currently under creation. One of them will manage the regeneration of the biggest unplanned settlement, which is strategically quite significant, due to its close proximity to the Holy Haram. Since 2011, we have been working on this project and now we have signed a shareholders' agreement with some prominent investors in the Kingdom. Other necessary formalities for creation of the company are being completed, and the Board of Directors will be appointed by summer 2014. The second company is being launched in partnership with a consortium of Emirati and Saudi firms to develop furnished housing units within a gated compound. This will cater to the increasing housing demands of white-collar staff in the hospitality sector, which is being developed around Holy Haram. When complete, the facility being developed will accommodate 20,000 single workmen and 3,000 families. Work is in progress for this project. The site is situated between Mecca and the Jeddah highway, about 30 kilometers from the Holy Haram. The third company that is being incorporated is focused on environmental issues. This entity will oversee and supervise the treatment and disposal of solid waste generated in the city of Mecca.</p><h4>How do you look to incorporate the private sector into these major developments?</h4><p>The mandate given to us through the Royal Decree is meant to engage the private-sector in developing the city, and the aforementioned projects all include the involvement of private sector investors or developers. We identify the projects and then create Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), inviting private-sector to invest in the SPVs, and execute the projects.  To give maximum leverage and comfort to the private sector investors and developers, we sell them 80% to 90% stakes in the SPVs. While we prefer to engage local developers and investors,  some projects require high levels of technical expertise, and we invite consortia of multinational firms, in partnership with local firms, to invest in and develop those projects.</p><h4>Where do you see Mecca in 2020 compared to where it is now?</h4><p>The skyline and landscape of the city, especially in and around the Holy Haram, will be dramatically changed; hopefully by 2020 most of our megaprojects, including the first and second phases of the rail project, will be fully operational. Optimistically, all these projects will be running and operating by then, and Mecca will be included in the global list of “smart cities."</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Al-Khodari Sons has had a long history in Saudi Arabia, starting in the 1960s. What changes led to your diversification, and what has led the company to invest in the sectors it is currently in?<br></h4><p>In the 1960s, when the company was formed by my late father, it was mainly involved in the small building sector. In the late 1960s and the early 1970s, we diversified into road construction, building most of the eastern and northern road networks in Saudi Arabia. However, Al-Khodari's diversification started on a wider scale by the end of the 1970s, and beginning of the 1980s, when the company moved into two new sectors: the operational maintenance of road networks, and city cleaning as well as waste management. In a few years, we became one of the largest city cleaning businesses in the Middle East. It is a business that never ceases, regardless of whether markets are up or down. In the 1990s, the Gulf War presented a major challenge for us, testing our logistics capabilities. The coalition forces worked with Al-Khodari as one of their main logistics contractors. We had over 1,000 assets leased to the forces for use at various locations, including the desert, across borders, and in rough terrain. In mid-1990s, we began getting into more vertical construction work. Today, more than 50% of our business is vertical construction. Further diversification in the 1990s included entry into insurance, medical insurance, travel and tourism, fabrication, industry, and industrial trading. However, when we went public in 2010, we carved all those businesses out, and just took the core business of construction public. Now, when we talk about Al-Khodari, it does not include those other businesses, which are now subsidiaries of the holding company. Al-Khodari currently has over 20,000 employees, with ownership of over 3,000 pieces of equipment and assets in our construction and city cleaning business. We operate in Saudi Arabia, and we have carried out business in the UAE, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Ghana. However, most of those international operations have slowed down to a large extent because of the spending that has taken place in Saudi Arabia; therefore, we have pulled back a lot of our talent and resources and deployed them in Saudi Arabia. Talent is scarce, and you have to put it where the money is today.</p><h4>How has the management of the company evolved with your change from a family-owned company to a listed one, and from a diversified company to a strong core business?</h4><p>Within the family, it was agreed to separate ownership from management long before floating the company. This is always a challenge, but becomes far easier once the company goes public. We ensured that family members' needs and concerns were all fully addressed using a forum where we would all get together. It is a process whereby everybody knows they are being heard. It is important to keep the flow of information going. An annual general assembly was being held prior to listing to instill the institutional culture. Restructuring was a priority for the company. My father never had the luxury of going to school, and therefore could not read or write. He created an empire; however, it lacked the appropriate procedures and governance that you want to ensure sustainability into the next generation. Prior to taking the company public, we really had to enforce and abide by corporate governance, which is vehemently dictated by the regulators. At that point, we started carving out businesses that were irrelevant to construction sector, to avoid confusing potential investors about what kind of business Al-Khodari was.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, what does the foundation and legacy of GSK allow you to do in Saudi Arabia?<br></h4><p>GSK is a science-led global healthcare company that researches and develops a broad range of innovative products in three primary areas of pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and consumer healthcare. We have a significant global presence with commercial operations in more than 150 countries, a network of 86 manufacturing sites in 36 countries, and large R&amp;D centers in the UK, the US, Spain, Belgium, and China. GSK has had a presence in Saudi Arabia for more than 50 years. In 1992, GSK formed a joint venture with Banaja Holdings, GSK's distributor and one of the Kingdom's leading pharmaceutical distributors, establishing Glaxo Saudi Arabia Limited (GSAL). The facility came into operations in 1997, and manufactures a number of GSK products for local customers including antibiotics and vaccines. Over the last two years, we have added many of our products into local manufacturing. We are different to other pharmaceutical companies in the country, as we are the only one to have a joint venture pharmaceutical manufacturing company. Approximately 60% of our annual turnover originates from this joint venture. GSK has operations in Riyadh, Jeddah, Mecca, Medina, and Dammam, with nine premises in total including the headquarters in Jeddah, as well as the manufacturing site in the Jeddah suburbs. We employ just under 500 people locally. GSK is the largest pharmaceutical company in Saudi Arabia, supplying both the private and public sector with pharmaceutical products and vaccines. Saudi Arabia is an important market for GSK, both in terms of improving access to medicines for patients, and strategically for GSK in developing our business in the Gulf. The Saudi Arabian pharmaceuticals market is the largest among the GCC and the whole Middle East region.</p><h4>What forms of scientific information exchange do you employ?</h4><p>We have multiple methods of scientific exchange with healthcare professionals. The basic objective is to keep the local medical community updated on the latest developments in the field of medical sciences. We invite international experts to the Kingdom for symposia, seminars, and congresses to develop forums for discussions with the local medical community. We are also working with local medical societies to establish websites as part of continuous medical educational initiatives. We also have a team of medical advisors who engage with physicians to answer queries they may have in relation to GSK products. We are also employing other forums such as webinars and videoconferencing to keep Saudi healthcare professionals engaged with global experts.</p><h4>Are there any changes that you expect down the road, and how do you plan to develop your business?</h4><p>GSK has a significant presence and strong commitment to the people, healthcare providers, and the government of Saudi Arabia. Our aim has always been to bring our innovative medicines to the Kingdom soon after they become available in the West. The availability of any product in the country is dependent on the registration timelines set by Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA). In terms of our operating model, we would like to consolidate our local manufacturing operations through portfolio expansion. We are also working with our strategic partners Banaja Group and Arabio to bring vaccines manufacturing capability to the Kingdom.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Saudi German Hospitals (SGH) has a strong history in Saudi Arabia and is today of the largest providers in the Middle East and North Africa. Could you talk about where the group sits specifically in the Saudi market?<br></h4><p>First and foremost, I would draw your attention to the group slogan and core value, “If anyone saves a life, it would be as if he had saved all of mankind." The group was established 25 years ago with one hospital in Jeddah. The second establishment was launched 10 years later in the south of the Kingdom. And between 2002 and 2003, the Group's vision had been set with a goal of building 30 hospitals by the year 2020, and in the process creating employment for 50,000 people. SGH is, therefore, expanding by building hospitals in the Middle East, to date having completed a total of six. Four hospitals are in Saudi Arabia, with one in Dubai and another in Yemen. By the end of 2014, or early 2015, there will be a new branch opened in Cairo.</p><p>Healthcare is a demanding business of high risk and low margins, where the complexities of the HR interface are high. As a result of this, it is not easy to find investors, and those that do, by definition, share our Group vision. One of the founders of the Group—Mr. Batterjee—was determined to enter the healthcare sector, and actively participated in healthcare dialogue between private and government entities, such as the Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Health. He established a healthcare committee at the Chamber of Commerce, and became its first chairman. He was also one of the pioneers to expand beyond the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Dubai and Yemen, among others. The hospital he built in Sanaa for SAR300 million is the only hospital in Yemen, the doors of which have remained open regardless of the prevailing conditions of the country.</p><p>The Group is committed to raising the quality of services provided, maximizing patient safety and comfort, and promoting knowledge exchange. Joint Commission International (JCI) and other national accreditation bodies accredit all group hospitals. We have a strong and comprehensive academic curriculum, and host around 12 international events per year. We also participate at Arab Health, the largest medical conference in the Middle East, where we have received awards on an almost annual basis. In 2013, we won the Excellence in Surgery Services Award.</p><h4>How are the current changes to the Saudi insurance market impact your business?</h4><p>A decade ago, the healthcare industry was not insurance-based. Between 2004 and 2005, a government mandate stipulated mandatory insurance for all expatriates. At that time, the insurance industry was booming as there were 8 million-10 million expatriates in the Kingdom. Today, the insurance companies play a major role in the healthcare business. In some regions (central and western) the insurance coverage accounts for up to 70% of private sector healthcare services. The insurance companies have become a third party in the equation of client and hospital. Insurance is indeed based on premiums, and two factors are key, namely the frequency of visits and the average claim. These determine pricing in the healthcare industry. Providers raise money to cover the cost of a service, and insurance companies minimize their costs by reducing premiums to gain market share. Meanwhile, another change due to occur within the next few years will mandate compulsory insurance for Saudi citizens.</p><h4>How is the range of medical services likely to have expanded by that point?</h4><p>Our main scope is to provide a comprehensive range of hospital services. We are not trying to become a narrowly specialized medical center, although the group is considering the option of setting up a specialized center for cardio or maternity, for example. Meanwhile, we are working on advancing certain services, such as orthopedics, endoscopy, and laparoscopic surgery.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What new programs is the university looking to introduce over the near term?<br></h4><p>We have two new colleges coming. One is for engineering and architecture, through which we will offer architecture and interior design. The other college is for social and human sciences, which will offer law, mainly public and private, as well as mass communications with five or six concentrations. These will be offered from 2014 onward. We also have three Master's degree programs being offered. The first is the executive MBA, which has been approved and implemented since 2009, offered in conjunction with our partner, Furtwangen University from the German state of Baden-Württemberg. Most recently, from the 2012-2013 academic years onward, we have also started implementing conventional MBA programs in business administration and human resources. So, we have three master's degree programs. In addition to the Bachelor's and Master's degree programs, we offer a number of diplomas to reorient Saudis who either have a university degree but could not find employment, or who have employment at high-school level and want to improve their skills and income. In an effort to respond to the needs of the labor market, we currently provide four diploma programs, including tourism, banking, and insurance.</p><h4>What facilities do you have that move your standards of education forward?</h4><p>We have two campuses, one of them being a female campus. All of our programs are offered to both males and females. We boast state-of-the-art technology and employ a learning management system, meaning our students mostly communicate with their teachers through online systems. They can thus work remotely, even if they are in an isolated area. We also have a co-op program that places students with local businesses and other organizations for practical training to prepare them for real life. We have laboratories for language learning, for computer science, and for finance. Our students can try out real life financial systems and learn how to deal with the market via systems linked to Bloomberg and Reuters. We are very satisfied in that sense so far, and the efficacy of our programs is evident in the fact that the majority of our graduates were recruited during training, while the remaining ones are typically recruited during the first six months after their graduation. We recruit our staff from well-known universities all over the world. We have around 22 nationalities represented at this university, from places like Australia, Malaysia, Korea, the US, and the Middle East.</p><h4>How do partnerships complement your strategy?</h4><p>At our financial laboratories, we feature systems provided by the Saudi-British Bank. There are around 20 terminals in three centers at both the male and female campuses, where you can be directly connected to global financial markets. In terms of partnerships, we are also teaming up with a number of universities. Under the “three-plus-one" formula, students spend three years here on campus and one year abroad. We have three agreements so far with provisions for dual degrees. One is with the Grenoble Graduate School of Business in France, where our students can spend a year and obtain a business degree from both institutions. The second such agreement is with the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, where students can, upon graduation, obtain a degree in business from Al Yamamah and a degree in finance from Canterbury. The final agreement we have is with Furtwangen University for an executive MBA.</p><h4>How do you plan to meet the demand for skilled professionals?</h4><p>There has been a huge increase in the number of Saudi higher education institutions over the last 15 years. We jumped from around 10 universities in 2000 to something like 35 or 36 universities and probably 20 colleges today. If you look at the public schools, there are approximately 5 million citizens attending those currently. I believe that we are providing the vast majority of people a higher education at a low cost. A significant number of students from the Kingdom have been pursuing degrees abroad on government scholarships for the last 10 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you speak about the involvement of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in the evolution of Saudi Arabia's economy?<br></h4><p>Right from the onset of the oil industry, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) was established in 1963 to support the sector by providing it with scientists, engineers, and business majors. It started with a two-year diploma for people to complete their BS degree from the US. Three years down the road, it offered BS degrees and then Masters and PhD level studies. Now, we are a fully-fledged, applied science university that supports not only the energy industry, but also the petrochemical and power industries. Today, we have more than 30,000 alumni who hold leading positions in the private and public sectors. More than 50% of Saudi Aramco's professionals are our alumni, and a similar percentage applies to SABIC. The president of the Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) is one of our former alumni. We are producing leaders rather than just employees. We also operate the Dhahran Techno Valley, which is a major hub for oil, gas, and petrochemical research and development in the region.</p><h4>How are you working to meet the demand for Saudi professionals in the economy?</h4><p>At times of high and low employment, we never had problems. During times of fierce competition, we remain number one in the market, with our competitors in distant second. I think we prepare our graduates well. Our model for undergraduates emphasizes experience and not just education. We really emphasize knowledge, skills, values, and behavior, and we do this through multiple programs, including extracurricular activities, study abroad and visitation programs, and cooperative summer training. In addition to that, most of our students reside at the university. Meaning, at the time of graduation, our students are well prepared to join the workforce and they are very sought after by employers. As a matter of fact, they don't even wait for them to graduate. We have 200 students sponsored by SABIC and 200 sponsored by Saudi Aramco, and this happens either in the first, second, or third year of their education. While we always watch what our competition in the higher education sphere is doing, we remain extremely confident that our students are the best, especially because we recruit top graduates directly from high schools. We pick the top 2% from the high schools. Our share of the top students—4,000 in total—is almost 40%, while the other 60% are distributed through other universities.</p><h4>How do you structure the curriculum to integrate both soft and hard skills?</h4><p>We always emphasize the fact that our curriculum is accredited by international agencies, especially those from the US, in particular. Soft skills are important and we emphasize personal skill programs where, right from day one, we ensure that students experience teamwork and develop presentation and communication skills. We also introduce experiential learning, whereby during their program they study real life problems. KFUPM's students are heavily involved in extracurricular activities, such as media, sports, or technical clubs, where they can practice some of these soft skills. There is no specific recipe for this, but through integrated programs we emphasize the hands-on introduction of these skills, and we are able to build these key life skills. People always talk about skills and knowledge, but values and behavior are equally important. For example, discipline is extremely important for us. About 25% of our classes are at 7.00 am and 8.00 am. We want our students to be there every morning to develop this skill. We make sure that our students return their homework and attend classes. These are the kinds of things that are not necessarily important by themselves, but are important to prepare a graduate for the workforce.</p>]]></richbody0content>

How do the business school's programs address the needs of the labor market in Saudi Arabia?<br></h4><p>Manchester Business School (MBS) Middle East Centre already supports more than 250 part-time MBA students based in Saudi Arabia and the blended learning model of the Manchester Global MBA, which combines self-study with a high degree of face-to-face contact with faculty and peers at regular workshops in Dubai, is a perfect fit for experienced working professionals in Saudi Arabia. These students are highly motivated and are already well qualified and experienced; they are looking to accelerate and enhance their careers by developing their skills and applying this new knowledge immediately in the workplace in response to the demands of a vibrant and growing economy in Saudi Arabia, which will present many attractive career opportunities.</p><h4>Many universities around the world are struggling to balance general liberal arts education with qualification-focused curriculum. How do you provide a well-rounded education to students, while also preparing them for a competitive job market?</h4><p>All our part-time Global MBA students are experienced working professionals and many are already highly qualified (around 10% already hold a Master's degree) and in senior roles (around 30% are in C-level positions), and so these are serious businesspeople in their early to mid careers, who have already achieved career success. The MBA is a general management qualification that covers all the major functions of business and this rounded and balanced program content provides students with a broader perspective of business and the tools and understanding— and confidence—to move into management and leadership positions. The Global MBA program also supports the personal development aims of students and offers a careers service, as well as networking opportunities with other like-minded professionals through a network of 2,000 alumni in the region and 50,000 worldwide.</p><h4>How do partnerships with major international corporations fit into your educational strategy?</h4><p>Partnerships and collaborations have been central to the success of the MBS Middle East Centre, which today is the largest and fastest growing center in the MBS international network. These collaborations range from professional bodies such as the ACCA and IMA, partnerships with our hosts in Dubai—Dubai Knowledge Village and Dubai International Academic City—and working relationships with some of the region's major companies on management development programs.</p><h4>Which career qualifications do you expect will be in the highest demand over the next decade, and how will you meet that demand?</h4><p>There is no doubt that the MBA is still the benchmark business qualification and a prerequisite for many companies and business people looking to build serious international careers. Since MBS opened the Middle East Centre in Dubai in 2006, the demand for a world-class business qualification has been very apparent, with more than 1,600 MBA students currently supported across the region. In addition, there is growing interest in a more personalized MBA experience, which includes greater emphasis on personal development alongside a rigorous academic program. In response, MBS has recently launched the more personalized Global Executive MBA (GEMBA) program for senior managers looking to take the next step into leadership and board-level positions.</p><h4>What role do you envision for the university over the next five years?  How do you hope to see education evolve in Saudi Arabia in the medium term?</h4><p>Since launching the Middle East Centre in Dubai in 2006, MBS has successfully established its Global MBA program amongst highly qualified and experienced working professionals in the region.  This is a reflection of the growing recognition of the value of business education in the region and many of the world's top schools, such as MBS, are now present here and offering choice and quality. Attracting and retaining talent in the region is a major challenge, and access to world class business education helps in this process; developing local talent is equally important and we hope to see more schools actively engaging with Saudi Arabia and supporting individuals and companies in developing their talent, through an increasing range of high quality business education options.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-third-way]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has motivated the reengineering of your approach to the Saudi Arabian market, and what changes will make your goal of 20 million passengers by 2020 easier?<br></h4><p>NAS Air—as the company used to be called—had been around for seven years and was struggling. When operating in Saudi Arabia we are faced with two disadvantages. The first concerns regulatory stipulations that prohibit charging above a certain rate on all routes. The second disadvantage is that being a private carrier we do not get a fuel subsidy. The question is learning how to work around some of these realities. This said, Saudi Arabia is growing, and is hosting a larger, more affluent population; people can afford the fares charged and many, including the middle class, are demanding more service and value, which they are willing to pay for. Low-cost carriers, in general, cater to a certain segment of the market, which is substantial: budget travelers and people who just want to get from point A to point B in the fastest, cheapest way possible. Obviously, in Europe and Asia, there are huge numbers of such passengers. In the Saudi market, however, there is a certain expectation, especially when you have excellent carriers in the region, such as Emirates and Etihad. We are one of the few privately owned airlines in the region; the rest are either state-owned or state-backed in one form or another, and we are competing against all of them.</p><h4>Where does flynas fit into the market place among other carriers?</h4><p>The aviation world is now distinctly divided between the full-service and low-cost carriers. We operate somewhere in the middle, which is the hybrid position, and this market is there for the taking. We will be an almost full-service carrier in terms of product offering, but in terms of operations, we will remain a low-cost one.</p><h4>Which global trends are you taking advantage of in terms of new routes?</h4><p>To start off with, I think our program is to attract Muslim travelers bound for Saudi Arabia. That is why our initial focus is the Umrah and Hajj package for all relevant countries. Going forward, we are going to make Jeddah a hub, just like Abu Dhabi has become. It will be a hub and spoke because when the new Jeddah airport opens in 2014, it will be more geared toward transit passengers. I can see someone flying with us to London from Kuala Lumpur, Riyadh, Dubai, or somewhere in Egypt. Ultimately, we will become a transit and spoke carrier on top of being a point-to-point carrier. The beauty is that for average wealthy Muslims around the world, the ideal trip would involve Jeddah to do the Umrah for two days, followed by a business trip to London, a return Umrah visit, and then the flight home. No airline other than Saudia can do that, directly. It seems logical to me to focus on destinations that enable us to tap into a resident Muslim population. Dusseldorf, for example, is home to a large Turkish population. And as of April 2014, we will have flights to Manchester in the UK, which also has a Muslim community. We are firmly on the road to growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Dallah Health Holding's position in the market and what services do you provide?</h4><p>Dallah Hospital started its operations in year 1987 as part of the Dallah Group. In 1994, Dallah Hospital was established as a limited liability company before becoming a closed joint-stock company. In late 2012, we became a public company following our IPO. It was a fruitful move for us, raising more than SAR500 million. We added another business in the middle of 2000 called Dallah Pharma, a pharmaceutical company distributing pharmaceutical brands and products. Now it has exclusive distribution rights for around 80 products. We also created another small business unit operating and managing hospitals for third parties outside of Riyadh. For example, we now manage and operate a hospital in Al Khafji, which is owned by KJO, a joint project between Kuwait Gulf Oil Company and Aramco. We operate another hospital in Mahayel in the Southern Region. As for our original facility, Dallah Hospital, we expanded the bed capacity and added another building to it in 2007, the Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Hospital. In late 2013, we inaugurated the Pediatrics Hospital. We now call this area the Dallah Hospital Complex, because it comprises the general hospital in addition to various specialized hospitals. We also have another building on the way, an outpatient facility that includes dental and ophthalmology services. We also have plans to expand Dallah Pharma. We acquired a manufacturing facility in 2013 in Jeddah in a strong step to vertically integrate our pharmaceutical business. We have strong growth plans for Dallah Pharma. We are also planning to build another general hospital in the southwest of Riyadh. We have finalized the designs and started the excavation designs. We also bought land in the north of Riyadh to build a third hospital. We have set plans to reach a certain size by the end of 2018, and we want to be one of the largest health service providers in Saudi Arabia, the GCC, and the Arab world. Currently, we believe we are leaders in healthcare quality and have the second largest in number of beds among the publicly listed healthcare providers.</p><h4>What is your average customer profile?</h4><p>Our customers are mainly those who are covered by private insurance and other patients of companies such as Aramco, SABIC, and SCECO. We also have a good number of cash patients. There are many people in need of our healthcare and some of them prefer private facilities. On the pharmaceuticals side, the major customers are still pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, and the government.</p><h4>How have the new health insurance laws impacted your business and the sector?</h4><p>The majority of our customers were cash-paying customers until health insurance was made compulsory for all private companies in 2008. Now, most of our customers are insured patients. Our relationship with the insurance companies is good, built on a business integration relationship, and we always look at improving and raising the wellbeing of our patients. We value our relationship with our patients and consider continuous improvement as one of our services. We have increased the number of patients YoY as we have to ensure a reliable, sustainable, and solid relationship with almost all insurance providers in the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Fawaz A. Alhokair &amp; Co started in 1990 and has grown since then to become a major force in retail both in Saudi Arabia and globally. What strategies have governed that growth, and how have they changed over time?<br></h4><p>Fawaz A. Alhokair's strategy over the past 20 years has evolved in three distinct phases. Phase I of the group strategy saw the introduction of international fashion brands into the Saudi market and listing the retail business in 2006 on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul), thus forming the fashion business today known as Fawaz A. Alhokair &amp; Co. Some of our key brands include Nine West, Zara, Marks &amp; Spencer, Oysho, Monsoon, Gap, Nokia, and Accessorize. Phase II saw us stabilizing our retail platform, and this meant creating a distinct strategy, upgrading our IT capabilities to international standards, and implementing corporate governance across all business functions. Our goal was to replicate what had been done in Saudi Arabia into other developing markets. In 2009, we acquired Retail Group Jordan and Retail Group Egypt, thus entering the North African market, followed thereafter by the acquisition of Multi-trends in Morocco. In 2010, we entered the Central Asia and Caucasus region by first launching retail operations in Kazakhstan followed by Azerbaijan in 2011, and both Georgia and Armenia in 2012. During this rapid expansion internationally we continued to grow our retail business in KSA, in conjunction with our sister company Arabian Centres we expanded our retail business into 13 company-owned shopping malls as well has partnering with other major shopping mall developers in Saudi Arabia. The third phase in our group's strategy involved launching our own retail brand, and for this we partnered with George Davies to create FG4 Kids and FG4 women. So, after two decades of growth, today the group has over 1,800 stores in 15 international markets across a portfolio of 80 international brands. Our turnover in 2008 was about $400 million, while in 2014 it will be about $1.5 billion—that's a significant increase. Our market cap at the beginning of 2014 was about SAR16 billion. Our share price sits at around SAR134, but that was after a two-for-one split, so it can be valued at over SAR200 per share if you were to benchmark it from the original SAR23.</p><h4>You mentioned various acquisitions. How do you select brands to become part of your portfolio?</h4><p>As a highly successful franchisee, we understand the requirements of good real estate and the operational management of merchandise, so in acquiring brands and making that transition to brand owner, we look for businesses that have great brand equity, which would be complemented by our skillset, namely our ability to expand worldwide quickly and effectively. This allows us to create a valuable business in short order. In starting FG4 with George Davis, we paired a world-class designer with a world-class store developer, and the brand is now doing excellent for us; it also gave us some useful insight into what makes a brand successful. It is this knowledge that we are now putting to good use in our acquisitions strategy.</p><h4>How important is the company's role in Saudi Arabia's growing non-oil sector?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia has undergone phenomenal growth over the last five years. The market was previously run predominantly by expatriates, which meant that most of the money they were earning was being transferred back to their own country and leaving the Saudi economy. Now that a large proportion of our workforce is Saudi, the money is staying in the country. There is also huge ongoing investment from the government in terms of infrastructure, mass transit, health, and education. Saudi Arabia is going to see tremendous growth over the next 10 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>WorldWide Group is a leader in international health insurance with a 70% market share. What factors led the company to attain such a remarkable position in just 15 years?</h4><p>WorldWide Group specializes in major medical plans, which differ considerably from local insurance. Normally, in the Dominican Republic, the problem is that most market players are major US or European companies that normally sell offshore, with which the local companies lack the critical mass to compete. We have reached this position in 15 years, because we don't really have local competition, but focus on major medical plans, covering up to $2 million per person. We cater to hundreds of clients in sustaining a business of this kind. I think that our work challenges a paradigm. People have the tendency to think that this kind of insurance is something that has to be bought from major names; however, they have started to realize that WorldWide has the same products and the same kind of service and coverage, which is the underlying reason why we have reached this position. This is something we have achieved in Panama, in the Dominican Republic, and something that we can do in any market.</p><h4>What impact do the free trade agreements (FTAs) with the US and the EU have on the overall international health insurance sector in the Dominican Republic, and how does WorldWide compete with the international insurers?</h4><p>FTAs do have an impact; however, in our case it is a positive one. I personally think that the barriers that countries put up in the economy are not good. I am convinced that businesses need to be free and compete with each other. In our case, we may not compete with local companies, but our competitors are large international companies. We sell the same products but at better prices, and people focus on prices. We can compete with mid-sized international companies. I don't see any problem with that, as I view competition positively.</p><div class="quote">“FTAs do have an impact; however, in our case it is a positive one."</div><h4>How have WorldWide's regional operations evolved over the past few years, and what have been the company's milestones of 2014?</h4><p>We have evolved our business model. WorldWide employs two different methods when entering a market. One is direct, such as in the case of the Dominican Republic and Panama. We have an insurance license, and sell directly through brokers, which is something we are extremely successful at doing. Our other entry method is through reinsurance. In some markets, it is better for us to enter indirectly. An example of this would be Guatemala, which we will enter via this model in January of 2015, working with a Guatemalan company that will sell our products and be reinsured by WorldWide. These are the two different entry methods that we use in order to cover the region.</p><h4>What is your expansion strategy, and what other countries besides Guatemala is WorldWide planning to enter?</h4><p>We plan to expand into Costa Rica, which is different from the other countries because it used to have an insurance monopoly for many years and people know little about competitive insurance. In this case, it is a promising market and we will enter it indirectly via reinsuring a Costa Rican company.</p><h4>What trends do you see in demand for the international health insurance in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The exciting trend is in the health sector, where people are looking for treatment outside the country. Many rich and upper-middle class Dominicans who normally go to the US looking for better treatment; however, there are many lower middle-class people or people that due to their work can't have private insurance in the US. They are looking for health treatment outside the US in places such as India, Colombia, and Chile. There are many people in the US traveling to India in order to have surgeries. Another interesting change has been the development taking place in the countries we cover. In developing countries, most people think about insurance because they have something to protect and they realize it is important.</p><h4>What is the importance of the partnership with the German Investment and Development Company (DEG) for company development?</h4><p>It is truly important for us. WorldWide was founded in 1999, and at that time our partner was a local bank, BHD—a prestigious institution in the Dominican Republic. However, we needed a partner that could go with us throughout the region. DEG was created 50 years ago with the aim of investing in the private sector and in companies that promote the development of emerging markets. We are a company that has to invest part of our reserves in our countries, and we, of course, have competitors that sell offshore. DEG realized that this was an excellent investment in order to help develop the economy of the Dominican Republic and Panama</p><h4>What is the significance of the agreements signed with companies such as Allianz, Swiss RE, and RDA Insurance in terms of increasing customer confidence?</h4><p>In order to build up consumer confidence, it is important for us to have the support of major reinsurance companies. That is why we have partnerships with Allianz, the third largest insurance group in the world, and RGA, an US reinsurance company specializing in life and health that is among top-10 insurance companies in the world in terms of life insurance. Such partnerships bring a name and financial strength. These companies, on the other hand, need a partner who knows the region and the product, which is what we know and provide. They have all the financial strength to support this kind of risk, and they rely on us for all of the operations and experience that we have accumulated over the past 15 years. We also have the same type of agreement with Swiss RE in life insurance. We have offered life insurance since 2007; however, I think 2014 has been the year that we really began in the life insurance business. In the past, we didn't have products that could compete with US companies. In the Dominican Republic, there is a tax on insurance of 16% on each policy. Other companies say that this is the reason why people in the Dominican Republic buy individual life insurance in the companies that sell offshore. For me, that is not true. In El Salvador, the tax is zero, and the same thing happens there. Almost 100% of the individual life policies are bought from offshore companies. The only things we need are products that can compete with them. The mortality of our clients is different, and right now we use a different mortality rate table. We have the same products at cheaper prices than some US companies. We started with this business now, and I have high hopes for it. I think that in the case of life insurance, we can do the same as we did in health insurance. In the case of international health insurance, we can perform much better. Foreign insurance companies look at the region and consider our model. One of the factors differentiating us from other sector players is that we don't focus on what the others do, but rather, lead the field. In the Dominican Republic, more than 70% of the claims occur in the US. Of these claims, 60% are in Miami, and for that reason we work with a company located in that city, which deals with our claims in the US. In so doing, we provide our clients with the best treatment at the best price.</p><h4>Looking forward to 2015, what are WorldWide's main objectives?</h4><p>I believe that 2015 will be an important year for WorldWide. We are at a turning point because of our new relationship with Allianz and RGA, as well as the new risk premium. It will be the year for expansion. We will do business in Guatemala and Costa Rica. The other target is Ecuador; however, we are still reviewing the business plan for that country, which is an important market.  The next targets are Colombia and Peru. Perhaps in 1Q2015 we will begin doing business in Costa Rica and Guatemala, and potentially in 2Q2015 we will launch operation in another countries, directly or indirectly.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The rise of Africa is a fact. The continent's economic performance is impressive, not least in Nigeria, which shows staggering growth rates of 6% to 7% per year. The Netherlands is delighted that the Nigerian economy—now the 26th largest in the world—has taken off and is experiencing rapid growth year after year. Nigeria is already our main trading partner on the African continent. Bilateral trade has tripled over the past seven years, and we would like to continue contributing to Nigeria's growth by fostering mutually beneficial economic ties.</p><p>Dozens of Dutch companies are already established and active in Nigeria, not just in the oil and gas industry, but also in agriculture and manufacturing. And more and more Dutch industries are seeking to invest in Nigeria, because they feel that business opportunities are knocking on their door. In order to grasp those opportunities, two things are key: open markets and a diversified economy. We know this from experience.</p><div class="quote">“Dozens of Dutch companies are already established and active in Nigeria."</div><p>Firstly, about a third of our annual income derives from international trade and investment. That is why the Netherlands is a strong advocate of keeping borders open and maintaining a level playing field for all businesses worldwide, large and small, so that they can compete on global markets on the basis of their merits. I am convinced that all countries, including Nigeria, can benefit if they adopt this approach.</p><p>Secondly, a diversified economy is key for each country to be able to compete on the increasingly sophisticated and innovative global scene. In the seventies, our own economy was far from being as dynamic as it is today. Our gas reserves made us complacent, and it took a great deal of political will and far-reaching reforms to create the export-oriented economy we have today.</p><p>So I applaud the fact that diversifying the Nigerian economy—in agriculture, technology, retail trade, finance, and services—is one of the Nigerian government's main priorities. The challenges ahead include achieving equitable living standards for all Nigerians and strengthening the rule of law, which will also help to attract foreign investors.</p><p>My government expects Dutch companies to comply with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is part of our business case. The Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers (VNO-NCW), which is comparable to the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), has embraced CSR as a basic principle of sustainable business. FrieslandCampina, for example, is promoting the further development of Nigeria's dairy industry by working with cattle-breeding Fulani communities. Many other Dutch firms have similar projects in Nigeria and other countries. Sustainable growth requires inclusiveness, and CSR is a key tool for attaining it.</p><p>At the governmental level, too, Nigeria and the Netherlands are partnering for prosperity. In the spring of 2014 President Goodluck Jonathan visited the Netherlands. In June Lilianne Ploumen, the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation headed a business delegation to Lagos. Some 35 Dutch entrepreneurs from the agrifood, maritime logistics, and life sciences and health sectors met with Nigerian counterparts. The mission immediately led to more economic collaboration and new opportunities.</p><p>So let us further deepen our relations, step up our political and economic contacts, and keep building mutual trust and understanding. I look forward to contributing to these goals and I am convinced it will be to the benefit of both our peoples.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry (RCCI) promote strong and stable economic growth?<br></h4><p>If we look at the Kingdom's economy in general, and its GDP in particular, we find that the economy consists of products and services most of which are produced by the private sector. That means that the major components of the economy are derived from the private sector of the economy, including the collective products and services of those companies that constitute the sector. Therefore, supporting and helping companies to grow in the Riyadh region, which comprises more than 300,000 registered enterprises, about 116,000 of which are members of the RCCI, essentially means enhancing the national economy. Our services, however, are not limited to members only; they extend to all businesses within the Riyadh region as well. By helping enterprises, the RCCI indirectly participates in achieving the country's economic objectives through our liaising and coordinating on behalf of the private sector to facilitate their issues and transactions with the government. Our training programs and statistical database help in spotting business opportunities and overcoming difficulties encountered by members and non-members of companies and enterprises. This results in companies producing more goods and services for society in general, which is reflected in GDP. This is how the RCCI looks at the issue.</p><h4>International investment and cooperation in businesses is an important part of Saudi Arabia's future. How do you facilitate these connections?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is one of the largest economies in the region and is a member of the G20. It is also one of the major oil producers and an influential player in the global economy. We, in the RCCI, are aware of these facts and act accordingly in the best interests of the national economy as well as national investors and international entrepreneurs. We believe that international trade is important for the Kingdom and knuckle down to develop the terms of trade both at the national level and the international one. We receive worldwide attention from almost all countries. In 2012, for example, the RCCI received around 150 high-level trade delegations that generally visit the Kingdom for two main reasons; general interest in the country and the pursuit of potential opportunities in both trade and investment. On the business front, and in cooperation with the Saudi Council of Chambers, we are working relentlessly to form a delegation that will take on the responsibility of promoting and marketing Saudi Arabian investment opportunities abroad as well as showcasing our own services. In 2013, the RCCI established the International Cooperation Committee, which includes the chairmen and CEOs of a number of major international companies doing business in Saudi Arabia, through which we aim to officiate more functions and further the cooperative effort.</p><h4>Where do you hope to see the Chamber in Riyadh in the next five years?</h4><p>The Kingdom's economy is growing at higher rates, and the government is fully supportive of the private sector by way of providing for huge opportunities all over the country. Therefore, we should be able to reflect this situation at the cutting-edge of all levels, aspects, and fields. The capital city of the country is on the verge of becoming a dynamic hub for regional business. If you look at the Kingdom's favorable geographic location, political stability, economic reputation, and societal solidarity, you will undoubtedly notice that Saudi Arabia is moving in the right direction. Almost 60% of the population is aged below 30 and is well educated; the Kingdom has sent around 200,000 students abroad for education. All these are good signs that make Riyadh eligible to be a major regional focal point for business and trade, with the RCCI playing a key role as a facilitator. I believe we should consider the picture of the country, including the Saudi economy and the government, as we ultimately need to help Saudi companies achieve their objectives, especially where this would help the government set and carry out its business polices and future development plans.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Jubail and Yanbu are now responsible for 12% of the Kingdom's GDP, two-thirds of its industrial output, and 10% of the world's petrochemical production. To what policies do you attribute this success?<br></h4><p>The success of Jubail and Yanbu as examples of some of the best industrial zones in the whole world can be attributed to many factors, among which are: unique government commitment and support; the application of state-of-the-art international construction and project management methods; excellent co-operation and integration with our strategic partners, such as SABIC, Aramco, and the Ministry of Finance, which ties us together toward one unified objective; the implementation of the city management concept; and the dedication of our professional staff. All of these factors have made our mission possible. The mission is to diversify the economic base of Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What growth do you expect at Jubail and Yanbu, especially in exports, since nearly 85% of products manufactured in the two cities are exported?</h4><p>As stated, we are now responsible for 12% of the Kingdom's GDP. We shall continue to be influenced by changes in the economy and we shall continue to influence this economy by increasing our share in GDP. I am glad to inform you that we are moving toward a new stage of industrial development through the Yanbu Economic Plan, whereby the emphasis will be on downstream industries, especially non-oil products. This shall include, but not be limited to, iron, services, and manufacturing products.</p><h4>The average growth rate in annual FDI at Jubail and Yanbu reached 20.2% in 2013. With infrastructure projects such as transnational rail, a major phosphate mine, and a large port maturing in the next five years, what opportunities do you expect to emerge for domestic and foreign companies in Jubail and Yanbu?</h4><p>Jubail and Yanbu are, no doubt, shrines of industrial development in Saudi Arabia. They both offer a complete platform of infrastructure and service, second to none, with very competitive land-use prices and excellent links to international markets. Jubail and Yanbu are very safe working environments, in a very stable country. What else could you ask for? This is, to say the least, what brought multinational companies like ExxonMobil and Dow to this land of opportunities. However, with our forthcoming economic plans, we hope to diversify our economic base in the two cities to include investment opportunities, especially in downstream industries. We shall be introducing new opportunities in the field of marine, shipment, packaging, iron, and spare parts, especially for power and desalination.</p><h4>As energy demands rise across the nation and the region, how will the Commission fuel the development of alternative energy technologies?</h4><p>The Royal Commission is working with its strategic partners to meet this growing energy demand in several areas. The first area is optimizing energy consumption by using modern techniques such as district cooling systems and smart buildings. The second is utilizing state-of-the-art technology for industrial waste recycling such as plasma reactors, which produce hydrogen and electricity. The third is building photovoltaic power stations, and the fourth is concentrating on secondary industries, thus utilizing the outcome of primary industries as feedstock.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does your organization fit in with the larger goals of the nation?<br></h4><p>MODON is responsible for managing, establishing, and promoting industrial cities all over Saudi Arabia. There has been huge growth over the past six or seven years. As of 2007, we had a 40 million sqm area developed over the past 40 years. Thereafter, we commenced industrial city development, and soared to over 163 million sqm by the end of 2013. We have seen the same success in our electricity business, where, as of 2006, the electricity delivered to industrial cities was 1.6 GW, but by 2013 had risen to 5 GW. Meanwhile, GDP has grown from $91 billion in 2007 to $150 billion in 2013, and these figures together confirm the economic development of the country. We have also announced partnerships with international brands such as GE, Schlumberger, Siemens, ABB, and Isuzu, among others. Our approach to industry is one of contribution to the broader economy. There is huge development underway and ever expanding purchasing power in Saudi Arabia, especially in the development of the oil and gas industry, as well as engineering and healthcare. And so we seek partnerships with companies keen to invest in these sectors.</p><h4>How do you approach international organizations to showcase  the available opportunities in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The market share that we have here in Saudi Arabia is one of the largest in the Middle East. Our huge projects, such as the development of transportation, education, and healthcare sectors are of an attractive scale for those companies looking to invest in Saudi Arabia. In the transportation sector, $500 billion has been officially allocated for the development of the railway system. Saudi Arabia also has huge potential in other sectors like manufacturing, construction, services, design, and project management. We fully understand that the foundation for the development of all these sectors is industry. That helps us provide incentives and support for manufacturers to attract them.</p><h4>Why are planned industrial cities so attractive to companies investing in the Gulf?</h4><p>In 2007, there were only 14 industrial cities here, but by the end of 2013 there were 32. This huge development reflects the overall pace of development throughout the country. We offer different value propositions for different industrial cities. Those located in the larger cities like Jeddah, Riyadh, and Dammam have fewer incentives than those beyond the main cities. For industrial cities located in the promising cities, our government provides 75% of the capital investment. Other incentives in these industrial cities include competitive price advantages for land. We rent the land rather than sell it, and the price starts from SAR1 per sqm per year. There are other incentives, with prices starting from 10 halala ($0.026) and ranging up to 26 halala ($0.069). There is no taxation of industrial businesses, and this is in addition to tax exemptions on raw materials and machinery. In 2013, we built over 300 ready-made factories. We prepare everything, so that the producer can move right in and begin manufacturing immediately. We are the first organization to provide such ready-made facilities for major investors.</p><h4>What trends do you see developing in the MENA region in terms of demand for industrial products, and how is your organization responding to those trends?</h4><p>Exports from Saudi Arabia are on the rise, as local products enjoy a good reputation for quality. To give you an example from the oil and gas industry, five or six years ago most of the equipment for this industry was imported. These days, some of that equipment is manufactured locally. We have a factory under construction with Siemens for the manufacturing of gas turbines. We also opened the first automotive plant in Saudi Arabia, in Dammam, with Isuzu, for the manufacture of light trucks. We are planning to manufacture over 20,000 vehicles over the coming three or four years. These are some examples of how we are working with foreign partners to develop and utilize Saudi Arabia's industrial potential for the benefit of all parties. Those companies have come because of the value proposition of the upstream petrochemicals industry here, and the available gas in Saudi Arabia is also promising. Furthermore, the incentives I mentioned for land, electricity, government funding, and tax exemptions also make it an attractive investment address. The greatest advantage that Saudi Arabia has to offer, however, is its sheer market size, which of course implies strong demand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can you tell us about Tasnee's current involvement in the massive petrochemicals boom in progress in the country?<br></h4><p>Jubail's industrial development is an amazing story, and its reach is not limited to only one location. The region has played host to some of the largest investments ever seen in the Kingdom. Many people know the name of Sadara Chemical Company, which is a joint venture between the Dow Chemical Company and Saudi Aramco. There is also the Saudi Aramco Total Refinery &amp; Petrochemicals (SATORP), which is another joint venture initiative. If you look at the huge amount of production coming from this area, it has grown by leaps and bounds, to say the least, and Tasnee has contributed to this growth. We started the first plant in Tasnee Petrochemicals Complex in Jubail in 2004, which was under the Saudi Polyolefins Company (SPC). The polypropylene and PDH units started in mid-2004 as a joint venture with LyondellBasell, and things took off from there. From 2004 to 2010, Tasnee has grown by a breathtaking 61%. The first company was SPC and then came the Saudi Ethylene and Polyethylene Company (SEPC). We have set up a world-class operation in terms of capacity, with two polyethylene plants. Tasnee produces around a million tons of ethylene and 285,000 tons of propylene from the same cracker. With regard to downstream products, we produce high- and low-density polyethylene. Our output of each of the two materials is 400,000 tons per annum, and they are at full capacity. SPC now produces 720,000 tons of polypropylene supplied from the SPC. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is produced at a capacity of 455,000 tons, with the balance for the propylene coming from the cracker. We have recently ventured into the chemicals sector, and Tasnee, in a joint venture with the Dow Chemical Company, has set up the first acrylic acid complex, which has an annual capacity of 160,000 tons. SAP has a joint venture with Evonik, but it is still in the testing phases. Commercial production was set to commence at end-2Q2014. In terms of future capacity, we will be adding approximately 240,000-250,000 tons of additional capacity. In addition, for the first time, we are producing liquid butyl acrylate at a capacity of 160,000 tons per year. We would like to see this as our contribution to a better industrial outlook for the Jubail area.</p><h4>What is your strategic approach to joint ventures in terms of staying competitive and introducing new products?</h4><p>Cristal Global is the brand name for the National Titanium Dioxide Company. In terms of production, it is now the world's second largest titanium oxide production facility in the world. We recently entered into a joint venture with Toho from Japan, the leading technology supplier for titanium, to produce titanium sponges. Cristal has excellent operational experience, and it has all the required infrastructure needed to produce titanium oxide and its derivatives. It also has the manufacturing know-how and capability. It is trying to capitalize on the energy advantage here. Together with Toho, we can capitalize on both its technology, which is considered the most efficient to produce the sponges, and value-added to production costs.</p><h4>The petrochemical sector in Saudi Arabia is expected to attract some $150 billion in investment by 2016. What do you do to attract external investment?</h4><p>Tasnee has both petrochemical know-how and downstream operations. Today, SEPC is growing. One of projects being built at the moment is a high-end, SAR850 million investment. It will be a part of a different line of products. These downstream activities attract foreign investment, and we are looking for as much as we can get. We will always talk to technology providers, and we are always in touch with the technology suppliers for the target industries we would like to move into, and which would create value for the shareholders of both members of the joint venture. We have proven that we can do that.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Al Safi Danone is a historic joint venture here in Saudi Arabia. How did it come to be, and what strengths do both organizations bring to the partnership?<br></h4><p>Al Safi has a tradition of more than 30 years in the region. At the end of the 1990s under the leadership of Mohammed Al Sarhan, Al Safi thought about taking the company to the next level. One of the choices was to partner with truly global company, and so the talks started and a joint venture was built. What you find now is a 50/50 joint venture between Danone and Al Faisaliah Group. Al Faisaliah stands for a strong local brand, which is Al Safi. We continued to produce the high-quality Al Safi products that consumers are used to, because they have a strong and loyal consumer base and the products have a high value to consumers in this country. However, we added to this truly local brand the expertise of Danone worldwide. We look at the products such as Danette, Danao, and Activia, which enhances the local offerings with international brands that strengthen our presence in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How do you manage those strong brands?</h4><p>What we do is adapt Al Safi Danone brands to the local tastes and needs. We are continuing with Al Safi recipes that are specific to Saudi Arabia consumers, and which have been enjoyed over the last 30 years. Our values are that we deliver high-quality food, freshness, and a consistent taste. Al Safi stands for the true meaning of the word purity, and its great taste in products, such as milk, laban, yogurt, and cream. Then we would adapt the international Danone brand, such as Activia, which is one of the largest global dairy brands known as a “Spoonable Yogurt." Here we adapted a global recipe to a Laban version specifically for Saudi market. We also adapted the Activia brand promise, which is “it helps the digestion," into a format that fits Saudi culture, which is preferred by local consumers.</p><h4>Can you talk about your production strategy here in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The distribution of Al Safi Danone includes the GCC and Levant regions and Iraq. We are operating in a total of 11 countries delivering products from Saudi Arabia. Due to some government restrictions and border issues, particularly in Iraq, we decided to invest in a plant in Erbil in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. We are the first global player in Iraq and Kurdistan. This allows us to effectively and securely maintain a service to the expanding Iraqi market with high-quality products that consumers are demanding.</p><h4>Where do you expect to be in the medium term?</h4><p>We built our ambition, in the sense that in the next four years we want to significantly grow our business. The idea behind that is a simple vision of creating loved brands, delivered by a strong team every day. Talking about loved brands consists of few components: high-quality products, innovation, and a clear connection to the consumers. We have defined our key areas, where we want and will change our game. Then, we built dedicated teams to follow every project's progress. The key projects progress is that we activate different regions according to their potential. First, the turnaround in Saudi Arabia that focuses strongly on Al Safi brand. Second is the GCC market, where we will focus on value-added portfolios, meaning we are fully focused on Activia, Danette, and Danone. Then, third is leadership in Iraq, and all these components will evaluate over the course of the next four years. Behind our ambition there is a significant level of investment into capacity, product recipes, brand activation, chiller space, and people. This directed investment will result in sustainable growth for Al Safi Danone for the upcoming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Asharqia Chamber seek to promote strong economic growth locally?<br></h4><p>Asharqia Chamber, the Eastern Province Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was established in 1952. Since then, it has played a vital role in the development of local trade and industry in line with the Kingdom's sustainable economic growth. To help achieve the country's projected growth rate, Asharqia Chamber has expanded its services and facilities by leaps and bounds, which resulted in the increase of its membership to over 54,000. Asharqia Chamber has played a pivotal role in the country's economic transformation since the majority of the Kingdom's oil-based industrial activities are located in Eastern Province. This new economic era in Saudi Arabia began with the discovery of crude oil in Dammam in the 1930s. Since then, the development of the oil sector has had multiple effects on the economy, leading to the growth of local industries, construction companies, trade and commerce, and the services sector. Eastern Province has become an important region of the Kingdom, contributing over 60% of GDP to the national economy. With its massive growth of industries, Eastern Province is now called the “Industrial Capital of the Gulf." Eastern Province is also contributing significantly to the Kingdom's drive to diversify its income away from oil. Most of the manufacturing industries, such as petrochemicals, chemicals, steel, aluminum, plastics, and foodstuffs, are located in the region. Asharqia Chamber has been providing vital support for the enormous industrial growth in this region, and we are committed to continuing our seamless services for the sustainable, long-term economic growth of the country.</p><h4>International cooperation is essential to a robust economy in a globalizing world. What is the Chamber's role in promoting international trade with Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Asharqia Chamber has been playing a key role in bringing the latest technology and know-how to the Kingdom from outside the country for the development of local industries. Every year, the Chamber hosts many foreign trade delegations, opening up platforms to establish business contacts between local and overseas companies. In 2013, the Chamber received a total of 16 foreign trade missions from major industrialized countries such as the US, the UK, Japan, Germany, Canada, France, Greece, and South Africa. In 2014, we have concentrated on expanding international cooperation, which has led to 11 foreign trade missions visiting the Chamber in 1Q2014 alone. In addition, the Chamber organizes a number of catalogue exhibitions of foreign companies at its premises, which proved to be an easy and effective medium for bringing together local and overseas companies. The Chamber also organizes many seminars, workshops, lecture sessions, and conferences throughout the year with the objective of introducing trade and investment opportunities for local as well as foreign businessmen.</p><h4>Bringing Saudi women into the workforce is one of the nation's goals. How does the Chamber work to advance this goal?</h4><p>The Saudi government has given priority to women's participation in nation-building activities, and Asharqia Chamber has been working to advance this goal. We have set up a separate entity, namely the Women's Business Center (WBC), aimed at providing all kinds of membership services to our female members. In addition to providing regular services, the WBC has launched a unique idea—an Entrepreneurship Development Program—to identify trade and investment facilities as well as employment opportunities for women. The program helps women develop new products and services, and subsequently provides adequate support to introduce these products in both the local and international marketplace. The WBC also organizes training courses, meetings, seminars, and symposia exclusively designed for women to discuss the latest developments in trade and business, new laws, and the rules and regulations formulated by the government. The Chamber has also established a Women's Affairs Committee (WAC) with a view to dealing with problems faced by the Chamber's female members.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-prestige]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you talk about the moral convictions that have led the King Faisal Foundation to conduct itself as it does today?<br></h4><p>To begin with, I think that we take our mandate from the life of the late King Faisal. His goals and achievements inspire us, both as a leader to Saudi Arabia, to the Islamic world, and worldwide. Therefore, we take the goals and aspirations of the foundation from his lifelong achievements. After King Abdulaziz and King Saud, he constitutionalized the model of Saudi Arabia. He put it on the world map as one of the main players in the international arena. He did that with policy and proper leadership, and he achieved a lot in his own country in education and health, as well as in other vital sectors of modern life. He elevated Saudi society from one that was basic, to a certain extent, to one that is sophisticated and modern, following the trends of the world. He established government institutions and many of the laws that we see today. His legacy was in education. This is where the foundation has taken all of its goals. He thought that to have a productive and successful society and country you had to have educated people, and ones who could participate intellectually in their own country's growth, to the world's benefit. I remember when he was asked how you would immunize Saudis from different ideologies—like communism, for example—he said, “education." He said that the only thing we could do was to educate and let them decide by themselves what was right and wrong. That is why the foundation has concentrated on education and cultural research.</p><h4>The King Faisal International Prize is a famous scientific and cultural prize. How do you see the prize through the lens of the region's rise onto the global stage, especially economically?</h4><p>The prize is one of the leading international prizes; probably number two after the Nobel Prize. If you go to the scientific societies, whether universities or research centers, you will find that the King Faisal International Prize is well recognized and respected. As many as 17 of our winners have gone on to win the Nobel Prize after they won the King Faisal Prize for the same subject. It is fair and independent, which is what has made it so famous. It definitely adds to the winners' reputation because it is recognized not only by the foundation, but also by the universities and centers of excellence around the world that nominate the prize, and the judges and committees that chose the winner. The King Faisal International Prize, for us, is one of the jewels of the foundation that we are extremely proud of.</p><h4>How are King Faisal Foundation's investments managed to provide maximum resources and flexibility for its philanthropic efforts?</h4><p>The investment policy of the foundation is a long-term strategy. The foundation is going to be here for a long time, as there are no shareholders demanding immediate profits, and our investments fuel our philanthropic efforts. We look at stability over the long term, and we protect the capital investment itself. That gives the foundation the solid status that it has today. We always add to society through investment. It is not pure investment because we look at other factors, such as how are we adding to the city, and to the economy. Sometimes we do a philanthropic project like what we did in southern Saudi Arabia. We bought a large piece of land, and on part of it we built a village for the homeless. We brought them in, educated them—there were schools and hospitals, for example—and we gave them houses to live in. We trained the adults and gave them jobs. These people were nomads following the rain with their sheep and we settled them and educated them, because we wanted to educate their children, and we could not do that if they were moving. We gave them benefits. By doing this, the rest of the land appreciated in price. We invested the money in a clever way, meaning that when we sold it we actually made money from the whole  project. Therefore, we achieved diverse philanthropic, economic, and investment goals in one project.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-global-outlook]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your group has relationships with many entities all over the world, and does business in numerous markets. How do you leverage partnerships to strengthen your business?<br></h4><p>My brother Abdulaziz started moving in this direction with Exxon, Halliburton, and Shell, though many people disagreed, arguing that it was unfeasible to work with three partners simultaneously. We like to start our projects with technology holders and market leaders. We started researching serious partners in 1978, when looking for air-conditioning manufacturers. We chose a small family-owned firm, San Antonio, and set up a license agreement in place of a joint venture. We then started acting as the OEM for major players like GE among others.</p><h4>How do technology transfers move your business forward?</h4><p>Sound technology is your base, and will be accompanied by good management. Industrial funds and other suppliers and financiers always choose a partner based on their having something strong to offer. This is important for the export market; 35% of all our products in Saudi Arabia are exported globally.</p><h4>How have the labor reforms affected your businesses?</h4><p>We have not experienced any violations of the code because we have been disciplined. Only companies that were acting unethically are feeling the reforms.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the petrochemical sector in the coming years? How have your expectations influenced the proposed merger between Sipchem and Sahara?</h4><p>The greatest step that Saudi Arabia has taken came in the mid-1990s when gas allocation was opened up to the private sector. That encouraged companies to join the program, as a result of which 14 large corporations were established. Some were start-ups—after my brother Abdulaziz retired, and I retired from the Ministry of Commerce, we started Sipchem. It was a public company founded on our professional experience, and people were generally supportive. We decided to carry out the merger because we saw that today only international players survive. They have better credibility worldwide, and larger, more diversified companies will be targets for partnerships. International players will turn to SABIC first, and lead the market, while we will likely rank in second position, which will still be financially beneficial. Final decisions regarding the merger will take four or five months, but it is a worthwhile endeavor.</p><h4>How conducive to foreign investment is Saudi Arabia's regulatory environment with the stock market now open to it, and how does it impact your business specifically?</h4><p>In this country, rather than cash, what we need are people who are serious about investing here for the long term. First of all, regarding the opening of the stock market, we note that certain markets are prone to much speculation, while here, stock prices are stable and speculation absent. Proctor &amp; Gamble is the largest producer of baby products and shampoo in Saudi Arabia and has been present here for 30 years. They are the best foreign partners in the country; therefore, we started supplying them locally and operating a plant with them, and ended up with two plants in total. Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world where custom duties are 5%. Consumer goods are cheaper here then in most of the world, and this is attractive for foreign companies.</p><h4>Where do you hope to see Zamil Holding Group in the next five years?</h4><p>We are moving into the pharmaceutical and medical sectors, and have established Cerna, U.S. IHS Information, and Riyadh Techno Valley. We are also moving into predominantly high-end real estate development.</p><h4>Beyond hospital management, pharmaceuticals, and real estate, what other activities would you highlight?</h4><p>We have what is currently the largest ship building operation in the Gulf. We offer maintenance for oilrigs, as well as service ships for Aramco and the port authorities. Some of our ships are based on Rolls-Royce engine technology, and we used to build them in Japan, Singapore, and India before commencing production here. At over 200,000 sqm, our new shipbuilding and maintenance facility in Dammam Port will be opening in early 2014.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>almajal and G4S have been in partnership since 2006. What do both sides bring to the partnership?<br></h4><p>almajal was established more than 30 years ago. It started out as a facilities management business, mainly working under a Saudi Arabian Airlines contract. Then, it grew to be one of the top facilities management providers in Saudi Arabia in terms of the number of employees. almajal eventually moved into the security sector, where it has an excellent client base and performance record, together with the ability to be flexible in meeting customers' needs. The company also went into the cash business; both cash-in-transit (CIT), which is moving cash from point A to point B, and ATM replenishment. The agreement with G4S was signed in 2006, and its full execution took effect in 2007. G4S brought to the partnership the policies and procedures needed to operate an organization that works in the cash business. G4S has a global presence in 120+ countries around the world, and it brings new technologies, better training, and knowledge of cash transportation to the partnership. As a partnership, almajal G4S is way ahead of its competitors in terms of market share—we have more than 60% of the market in ATMs available for replenishment. Some of the banks have exclusive partnerships with us, meaning they will only give their ATMs to us. As for the guarding business, it is a fragmented market, with more than 300 players; nevertheless, we are growing in this sector. We have created best practices and policies regarding managing guards called “The G4S Way." We also have an electronic security division, which is small, but growing rapidly. There is a lot that G4S can contribute to this market, because it has many alliances with equipment providers around the world. In terms of facilities, G4S brought financial discipline, the ability to manage customer relationships, and account management skills to the partnership. We have had double-digit growth every year since our partnership was established.</p><h4>How do you tailor your services to the Saudi Arabian market?</h4><p>There are over 120 countries where we provide services, and these are mainly in guarding and manpower security services. Every country has its own preferences regarding the hiring of guards. For example, in Kuwait, a guard is not required to be a Kuwaiti national. However, in Saudi Arabia, it is mandatory for guards to be Saudi nationals. The market has a base for it, but the competition is fragmented. A lot of the suppliers do not abide by all the rules, which puts us at a disadvantage in terms of cost. Even with this issue, because we have the best practices, and can demonstrate our advantages in terms of tools and training to our customers, we are winning more professional customers.</p><h4>As the Saudi Arabian market evolves, what do you anticipate for your business?</h4><p>I expect the guarding sector to be much more challenging, and for many of the small players to seek a share of the market. There is a great deal of fake Saudization going on; many companies are using Saudi nationals to claim they have Saudis on their staff. The Ministry of Labor is coming down hard on companies like this. The number of those companies will diminish, and the minute this happens, we will benefit because the market will become a level playing field.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[invest-here]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give us a brief overview of your investment activities and your mandate in Saudi Arabia?<br></h4><p>SEDCO Capital was formed four years ago; however, SEDCO itself was formed in 1976, originally as a family office. In 2010, the Group felt that there was a niche for sharia-compliant investment, as there was a scarcity of products that were both sophisticated and diverse not only in Saudi Arabia, but also globally. We are a local investor with a global reach. You will find us in different asset classes, from public equities to real estate, private equity, timber and agriculture, and commodities. These are our different asset classes, and we invest locally and internationally. When it comes to local investments, we invest in the local public equity markets, but we are also involved on the real estate side, especially when it comes to income-producing real estate. In addition, we see many prospects in terms of residential developments and logistics. On the private equity side, you will find us involved directly in private equity or through local general partners (GPs). Sometimes our clients want to divest or acquire certain types of companies; therefore, we either do it for our clients or sometimes we take it on for our own account. We offer these services to our local clients. On the international front, we are active in real estate, and we pick up properties around the world, from China to the US and everything in the middle. We are again focused on income-producing properties, and in many cases we are able to improve the yield by making enhancements to the properties and it is leasing positioning. It is the same for private equity; as we are involved globally through GPs or co-investments and sometimes through direct transactions. On the public equity side, we currently have over 12 global products covering a diverse range of geographies including developed countries, emerging countries, Asia-Pacific, Europe, as well as having different strategies including, tactical, defensive, active, and passive.</p><h4>What is the benefit of having a niche in sharia-compliant investment?</h4><p>There are several benefits of investing in a sharia-compliant fashion. The first is the fact that one of the main parameters of sharia is leverage, and the size of financing you are allowed to take. You are allowed to take up to 33% of total market capitalization. That 33% is a prudent measure of risk. If you go beyond that level, it puts your investments at risk. We think that sharia-compliant investing and financing is prudent because it keeps the level of financing to a tolerable level, which is one angle; the other angle is that you are not allowed to sell what do not own. An important element is that we are also responsible investors, meaning that we invest in things that add value to society and the economy. The risk factor helps you from a performance perspective, and responsible investing helps the economy and the society you work in. We are at the cutting edge of what is happening around the world regarding sustainable and ethical investment, according to the UN's Principles for Responsible Investment.</p><h4>What guides your choices for investment, particularly in agriculture?</h4><p>Agriculture is an asset class for us, and of course we see the full agriculture story, which is a scarcity of fertile land and potable water, in line with Saudi Arabia's food security program announced a few years back; these factors directed us toward investing in agriculture. Another interesting area related to agriculture is timber, which, if done properly, investors are able to receive yield on a regular basis, and at the same time there is a healthy capital appreciation on exit. Usually, in timber, a certain area is bought where the trees are cut; new trees are planted that also grow quickly. This assures the continuous presence of crops from where you receive your profits. We have done such timber projects in Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, and Australia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since 2009, you've been making selective investments according to a set of goals. What results are you looking to achieve?<br></h4><p>Sanabil was established as a commercial entity, and we are a for-profit company fully owned by the government. At the same time, we aim to play a role in introducing new industries and transferring technologies to the Kingdom, which is one of the company's added values. Today, Sanabil's activities include asset management, which is focused on liquid investments, a private equity program focused on investments in private equity funds globally, and a direct investment program.</p><h4>In terms of your direct investments within the Kingdom, what is on the horizon?</h4><p>So far, we have closed one deal in the Kingdom, and a further one or two are scheduled for this year. All sectors are potentially open for direct investment, but we do prioritize some over others, such as energy, education, and healthcare. We have made one investment in the energy sector, and are considering other investments in the education and healthcare sectors. Sanabil can hold up to 49% of the equity capital of a private company, while ensuring adequate minority protection rights. We also seek international companies to invest in Saudi Arabia. We believe that Sanabil represents a perfect partner, or partner of choice, for foreign companies keen to invest in Saudi Arabia. We can invest up to SAR1 billion in a company or project, and are typically long-term investors, which provides comfort to our investment partners.</p><h4>How do you respond to regulatory changes in regard to healthcare and mortgages?</h4><p>There had been a gap in legislation in both sectors you've mentioned. Our shareholder, the Public Investment Fund, is considering investing in mortgage financing companies and has also been tasked with the setting up of the country's real estate refinancing company. I can't go into details, but I can say that we see  great potential in the mortgage sector, and we believe that strategic partnerships with foreign investors are essential in terms of adding value. In the healthcare sector, we are evaluating  two potential investments in Saudi Arabia, and we believe that recent health regulations will make the sector more attractive for investors. In general, we believe that in both sectors the demand is there but that an investor's strategic positioning within the sector and differentiation are the key factors for a successful investment.</p><h4>How will the solar power agreement with SunEdison complement your investments in renewable energy in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>ACWA Power is a project developer and operator of both conventional as well as solar power, while the agreement we signed with SunEdison is to jointly fund a feasibility study to assess the viability of a solar materials project in the Kingdom, and, hence, we believe the two are complementary, although it is as yet too early to discuss the project with SunEdison in detail. In terms of solar radiation, Saudi Arabia enjoys one of the best locations in the world, and, therefore, it seems logical to embark on this project especially given the continuously declining cost of solar power and the improvements in solar power technologies. Therefore, we believe that there is great potential for the renewable energy sector in Saudi Arabia, and for solar power in particular.</p><h4>Where would you like to see Sanabil in 2020 in terms of return on investment?</h4><p>I expect 90% of what I'd like to see Sanabil achieve by 2020 is already done, particularly in terms of HR and the business structure. I would also like Sanabil to be able to conduct all operations in-house, and also increase its assets under management. To date, we deployed a large part of our capital; hopefully, by 2020 the profits we will generate from the existing investments will allow us to expand our investments further and bolster management to enable complete in-house operations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your operations developed here in Saudi Arabia?<br></h4><p>ExxonMobil has been delighted to be a partner in the country's growth for more than 80 years. We started years ago selling kerosene for lanterns. In 1948, we joined the Aramco Consortium, and, of course, both of our heritage companies were part of Aramco, which ultimately became Saudi Aramco. We are truly proud to be a part of that history. The footprint that we have today came about just over 35 years ago, when we undertook investments in major refining and petrochemical facilities. The investments on the petrochemical side were carried out as 50-50 joint ventures with SABIC, while the investment in the refinery is a 50-50 joint venture with Saudi Aramco. Since then, there have been many additional investments in each of the facilities to expand capacity and improve performance, and currently we are in the midst of two multi-billion-dollar projects. In the case of our refining operation, SAMREF, we are near completion of a “clean fuels" project that should reach mechanical completion early 2014. At Kemya petrochemical plant, a joint venture with SABIC, the elastomers project is in its early stages. As the country develops, it is looking to expand its downstream footprint into the production of synthetic rubber or elastomers for the domestic market. This project, when completed, will provide the Kingdom with the ability to produce elastomers for the first time.</p><h4>What global needs do the elastomer project and the new refinery project meet?</h4><p>Let me start with cleaner gasoline. The specifications for fuels are increasingly strict. If refineries are to remain competitive in the global economy they are going to need the ability to produce fuels that meet the increasingly stringent specifications that are being enforced globally. In addition, Saudi Arabia has already laid out its vision of increasing the stringency of fuel specifications here in the Kingdom. The goal is to reduce the sulfur content in gasoline and diesel to 10 ppm. Overall, this improvement and investment will give the refinery the ability to meet the Saudi specifications when they are put in place within a few years, and at the same time to maintain its competitiveness in the global market. On the elastomers side, the Kingdom today uses many elastomer products, but they are almost all imported. Elastomers are a key step in the evolution beyond commodity chemicals that the kingdom has predominantly produced thus far. The impetus behind this investment is to provide the raw materials that can then be used by other investors to build local businesses. It is a complex challenge, but the elastomer project creates the opportunity to build out the downstream elastomer industries as independent investors, whether local or international, and to recognize the opportunity to create and market and sell elastomer-based products in the Kingdom.</p><h4>Where will the Higher Institute of Elastomers Industries (HIEI) and ExxonMobil's other vocational training ventures fit within its operations in the Kingdom?</h4><p>We are particularly pleased about the HIEI, an institute in Yanbu, that it is now up and running. It has welcomed its second year of students, having opened its doors in the fall of 2012 with 63 students, adding a further 70 students this past fall. The whole course is a 2.5- to 3-year curriculum that focuses on higher technology-based skills that  the students will need to work in industries that manufacture elastomers. In setting up the HIEI, we partnered with the University of Akron in the US, as it is the world's leading elastomer technology institution. HIEI also hired Saudi university graduates who had an interest in teaching and sent them to the University of Akron for two years of training. As a result, today, we have 15 Saudi instructors on the ground in Yanbu. Having Saudis training Saudis, and having put in all the hard work up front to develop a strong curriculum, will make this one of the best training institutes in the Kingdom.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Shell has joint ventures with Saudi companies, specifically Aramco, all over the world. How is that partnership, which reaches so far beyond Saudi Arabia, reflected in operations here?<br></h4><p>I think that we have, through our actions, earned ourselves the status of partner of choice for Aramco, and we are proud of that. We work together successfully, and feel we bring complementary skills to those joint ventures. I believe that the Motiva joint venture is Aramco's largest venture outside of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and it has been ongoing for decades. That shows a long-term commitment from both sides, from Shell for the Kingdom and from Saudi Arabia for Shell.</p><h4>Another major Saudi company that you have a joint venture with is SABIC—through Sadaf—that you are trying to expand. What does that mean for the relationship between Shell and SABIC?</h4><p>At the core of that venture was the desire for the Kingdom to produce more advanced chemicals, create new industries based on those chemicals, and keep jobs within the Kingdom. The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources has pushed very hard in particular to diversify and retain employment within the Kingdom. In that respect, when we talk about the Sadaf expansion, both partners will continue to co-invest, which will ensure that the current joint venture continues beyond the contractual period; all contracts have a specific end-date, but we will allow that venture to continue going forward. Secondly, we are considering investing a couple of billion dollars in delivering a different product slate, whereby we will be producing different types of petrochemicals that public industries in and around the Jubail industrial area can consume. We will then make products that are now typically made beyond the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia has a desire to bring such activities here in the country by promoting industrial diversification and employment. This can only strengthen the relationship.</p><h4>The government currently has programs to prospect for natural gas in the country. What will Shell's role be in the natural gas industry as it develops?</h4><p>I believe that the Kingdom took a very courageous step a decade ago when the then Crown Prince Abdullah, now HRH King Abdullah, invited international companies to jointly prospect for gas with Aramco. At that time, the need for additional gas was already becoming obvious and, going on what we are seeing today, it was a very wise decision. Since then, additional gas has been discovered by Aramco, but there remains a challenge in that an even greater volume is required. We are excited to continue our gas prospecting partnership with Aramco to expand it beyond its current form and to search for those resources.</p><h4>What training and vocational programs does Shell engage in to enrich Saudi Arabia's workforce and transfer its expertise?</h4><p>The joint ventures involve highly specialized tasks that make it imperative for us to ensure the development of our basic skills. To this end, some of our joint ventures actively work with vocational training institutes to get new recruits up to speed. That comes at the start of the journey. Once people enter the joint ventures they undergo an extensive training process. These are assigned coaches and mentors and qualify for training, not only within the joint venture, but also through the training that Shell itself provides. I think that an additional element is of course that in our joint ventures, globally, our goal is to bring in experienced expatriates; people who have seen it all, done it all, and who are then posted in those ventures with the specific purpose of transferring that knowledge to the Saudi workforce. We are proud that our joint ventures have a very high Saudization rate of 85%. In all of the countries in which we work, we feel it is our responsibility to nationalize those positions as quickly as possible.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you get to the stage of implementing multi-billion-riyal projects across the country?<br></h4><p>Tabreed started about 15 years ago in Abu Dhabi, and has proven to be an efficient and reliable utility company. Saudi Arabia is booming economically, we anticipated what the needs were in the Kingdom, and decided in 2005 to launch the District Cooling Schemes Development covering the Kingdom as a whole. We began promoting district cooling, and we succeeded in penetrating through a tough conservative market. The first project was with Saudi Aramco. It was a 32,000-ton district cooling scheme, and we have successfully put the system into operation in August 2012. Our growth strategy is strongly aligned with the Kingdom's needs and requirements to further optimize energy consumption for cooling systems, which is the major contributor to power consumption. The main focus is on our outsourcing mechanism via long-term BOO/BOOT frameworks for our district cooling schemes throughout the Kingdom, namely for megaprojects. Again, if we talk about what the need is in Saudi Arabia, 70% of the consumption of electricity in Saudi Arabia is due to cooling. If you compare district cooling to conventional air conditioning, we are talking about a 50% saving in electricity. Therefore, by comparing this formula, you will see that district cooling can reduce the electricity consumption of Saudi Arabia by around 50%, which is a huge saving.  There are many megaprojects ongoing and infrastructure spending has been a major piece of economic growth.</p><h4>How are you positioning yourselves to benefit from those trends?</h4><p>Indeed, the Kingdom's spending for the past three years was focused on infrastructure more than any time in its modern history, for example in hospitals, schools, universities, government centers, and mixed-use developments. Our role is to promote energy-efficient solutions, namely with the Ministry of Water and Energy and the Ministry of Finance, as both face continuous pressure in meeting new power demands in line with the various developments taking place across the Kingdom, in addition to the budget allocations and tight timelines of implementation for the Ministry of Finance. We do have close collaboration with the various government entities, to streamline the development of megaprojects in an efficient manner and under innovative frameworks, and we are moving forward with the megaprojects. Saudi Tabreed is present in all the megaprojects in Saudi Arabia. For example, we are operating and maintaining two plants (50,000 tons each) in the King Abdullah Financial District.</p><h4>Why do you think that district cooling is important to the Kingdom's future?</h4><p>District cooling is an effective and sustainable key solution for energy optimization in the Kingdom. It's the heart of its developments and key competency when it comes to energy savings and the proper utilization of allocated budgets for spending and civil expansion. In fact, a mandate was already streamed via the Riyadh City Development Council to adapt district cooling solutions to any of the megaprojects within the city of Riyadh. We expect the district cooling industry to evolve under the same mandate to cover all the cities in the Kingdom, where government entities and real estate developers alike are mandated to introduce district cooling schemes in their current projects as well as futures plans. The collaboration with the Saudi Energy Efficiency Center is, on the other hand, a key factor as we go forward with district cooling implementations and regulations across the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia is a country where six months of the year are extremely hot. Saudi Arabia is really expanding and it is a large country, and in line with that the demand for cooling is really growing. Saudi Arabia is one of the countries with a population that is growing. The government faces many hard challenges to provide sufficient electricity to the Kingdom. District cooling is one of the best solutions for the government and private sector as well, and it is improved technology that will satisfy the demand for cooling, as well as save energy and the environment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What stage is the mineral sector at now, considering Saudi Arabia is the most mineral-rich country in the region?<br></h4><p>Mining goes back to 1935 in Saudi Arabia, although it had a very low profile until as late as 2007. It was mainly focused on gold, with a total investment of around $400 million and no more than 1,000 direct jobs. After 2007, things changed; the government decided to build up the mining industry to diversify the economy, create more jobs, and develop remote areas. New infrastructure was built to complement this desire for expansion, resulting in the construction of industrial railways and a mining city with a deep port at Ras Al Khair. Ma'aden has attracted leading global mining companies to partner with us and we now have a real mining industry in which we have invested around $17 billion since 2007, but we plan on investing up to $35 billion over the next 20 years. We have four major projects we are working on right now. One is a $1 billion project that involves the development of four medium-sized gold mines using treated wastewater from Turaif. The second is the Ma'aden Phosphate Company with investments worth over $5.5 billion. The third is a fully integrated aluminum project with Alcoa worth about $10.8 billion and the fourth is the $7.5 billion Waad Al Shammal phosphate project, which involves the development of a new mining industrial city in the remote north of the Kingdom. Underneath all of these efforts, Ma'aden's mission is to build mining as the third pillar of Saudi industry, beyond oil and petrochemicals. To do this we are encouraging the growth of mining skills and the mining service and supply sector, but we're also developing the capacity of Ma'aden itself in order to achieve our vision of becoming a world-class minerals enterprise.</p><h4>How does the development of infrastructure help the mining industry?</h4><p>It is only with focused investment in infrastructure that the Saudi mining industry has been able to boom since 2007. The Kingdom's mining sector is being supported by mega domestic infrastructure that includes a 1,500 kilometer railway, which now makes the exploration and production of phosphate and bauxite deposits in the north of the Kingdom viable. We are now able to move volumes of minerals from northern Saudi Arabia to Ras Al Khair, which is home to our integrated aluminum plant and the Ma'aden Phosphate Company-integrated fertilizer facility. It also hosts a deep-water port, another example of must-have infrastructure to sustain mining industry growth and prosperity in the Kingdom.</p><h4>Do you plan to invest in continued exploration in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Exploration is the basis of any mining company. We are the main explorers in Saudi Arabia, which is largely underexplored compared to other countries where mining is an active sector. We have an aggressive exploration scheme, and an exploration division with over 100 geologists. We have brought a number of international drillers and explorers to help us as well. Ma'aden has over 50,000 square kilometers of land licenses, which is impressive even by international standards. Our exploration team carries out not only regional greenfield exploration programs, but also near-mine brownfield exploration and resource evaluation for several commodities in phosphate, metallurgical bauxite, gold, copper, and magnesite.</p><h4>What role do joint ventures play in your strategy for growth?</h4><p>The fastest way to learn is through joint ventures. It is a proven model to build Saudi Arabia's mining capabilities, and has also been a proven model in the oil industry. Joint ventures have helped Ma'aden achieve the level of capability it has today. In our first project, the challenge was marketing. We looked to work with the best in the world, and SABIC has an excellent marketing scheme so it was our first partner. For our second partnership, the challenge was technology and know-how in manufacturing in the aluminum business, so Alcoa was our partner there. The third significant partnership was for the Waad Al Shammal project, which required experience in phosphate ore and phosphate processing, as well as marketing so we brought two partners into this. One was Mosaic, the largest phosphate producer in the world and based in the US. But we also brought in SABIC again to support us with its global marketing network.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the successes of the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI) under your leadership over recent years?<br></h4><p>This Chamber of Commerce was the first in the Kingdom, and it was already a successful entity before I came on board. All of my colleagues, past and present, have contributed to building a successful organization that has been operating now for around 70 years. When I took over five years ago, a solid infrastructure was already in place, as well as an established and prestigious name, and we are continuing to leverage this. We have a large project already underway set to officially open in 2014, namely the Center for Development and Unemployment, which will crucially provide people with an opportunity to find work. We do not believe that finding employment in itself is the only way, as we also hope to create opportunities for people to find work either by starting their own business, or by building partnerships, and I forecast the center officially opening in 2014 to the advantage of the Kingdom and the Arab region.</p><h4>Aside from the many initiatives to create employment in the Kingdom, the JCCI also works to promote trade between the Kingdom and in the rest of the world. Where do you see the JCCI in a global sense?</h4><p>A new location in the King Abdullah Economic City, north of Jeddah, will play a key role in developing trade between all Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) countries. I am the Chairman of the Islamic Chamber of Commerce (ICC), as well as the Chairman of the JCCI, and between these two chambers we have major plans to develop trade among OIC countries.</p><h4>How do you perceive OIC trade as a unique niche for KSA?</h4><p>We regret that trade among OIC countries has been low; it is especially a shame given our proximity and common historical relations. The ICC supports a plan that has raised the level of trade from 11% in 2008 to its current level of 14% or 15%. This is still not sufficient, and a lot of infrastructure has yet to be developed, which is what we will seek to achieve with the next project.</p><h4>By 2020, Saudi Arabia will have become a very different country in the wake of numerous megaprojects. Where do you hope to see the JCCI by that year?</h4><p>We will be an active player in such initiatives, and these megaprojects underway will continue in different fields. For example, we will construct a major new convention center and other facilities to advance our mission. Additionally, we will be a major player in facilitating growth and international cooperation. By inviting trade delegations and encouraging Saudi companies to take advantage of government initiatives, we hope to see many local companies expand abroad and take on joint-venture partners here in Saudi Arabia. Through the reputation we have established and on the strength of our geographic location, we will work to make a name for Jeddah as a port and an international city of commerce, and to promote Saudi Arabia as the regional economic force it already is. Infrastructure projects such as King Abdullah Port, the Economic City, the new railways, and the King Abdullah International Airport will make these goals a reality when combined with the efforts of the Chamber and businesses across the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abunayyan has been successful in Saudi Arabia and has participated in some of the nation's most important infrastructure projects. What strategies have helped Abunayyan to achieve this impressive record?<br></h4><p>Our company has grown to become the leading solutions provider for water and power in the Middle East and North Africa. Today, we comprise 14 companies, which we refer to as Strategic Business Units (SBUs). Our companies basically design and innovate solutions in the water and power segments, which are extremely important for any society, but more so for Saudi Arabia. Focusing on the whole value chain is one of the reasons that our strategy has been a success, and this is why we are today the leading solutions provider in the water and power segment. We have grown by building this core business value proposition.</p><h4>How are you positioning yourself to take advantage of the development of a knowledge-based economy?</h4><p>We are unique in our local integration capabilities, providing total turnkey solutions that we design, produce, and implement. As a result, our customers feel secure that they don't have to work with three or four different companies trying to find out what works and what doesn't. We have contributed many milestone projects in the country. For example, in October 2013 we commissioned the largest reverse osmosis desalination plant in Saudi Arabia in Jeddah, providing 240,000 cubic meters of desalinated seawater a day. We have contributed highly advanced technologies in wastewater treatment and recycling, and have just started the final commissioning of the Najran plant. This facility employs membrane bioreactor technology (MBR), a highly advanced form of wastewater treatment technology. We built the largest barges in the world used for seawater desalination, comprising two barges capable of desalinating 50,000 cubic meters of seawater a day.</p><h4>How do you see your role in the development of Saudi Arabia as an economy?</h4><p>The world is facing a major shortage of potable water resources, and these are under continuous stress around the globe. Scarce supply, pollution, and changing climatic conditions lead to the uneven distribution of water, and each of these are major long-term problems for the globe, not just for Saudi Arabia. These will become more challenging, particularly in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia gets little rainfall, and our underground water is limited and exhaustible as a result. Saudi Arabia will be one of the countries that faces some of the biggest challenges in terms of providing its citizens with potable water.</p><h4>As the Saudi economy grows and diversifies, which of your lines of business do you anticipate will see the strongest growth?</h4><p>We believe our power and water business will continue to grow, simply because of the demand/supply gap that we see, and also considering the plans that have been officially launched by the Saudi Electric Company (SEC) in power generation capacity as well as the National Water Company's initiatives and projects aimed at further developing the water infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, through strategic storage tanks, treated sewage effluents, and wastewater facilities and networks. We also believe that our oil and gas business, which is small today and still in incubation, will expand, and will make further investments into this sector by focusing on the local transfer of technology and integration. We are now investing in two plants in Dammam, one for the manufacturing of electric switchgears, and the other for the maintenance of turbines and other power generation equipment.</p><h4>Do you plan on going into renewable energy?</h4><p>This is one of our growth areas, and we plan to focus more on renewable green energy. ACWA Power International is currently building the largest solar power plant in the world in Morocco. It is 160 MW, and uses concentrated solar power technology. In Saudi Arabia, we have a company called Sun &amp; Life that's focused on solar power. Recently we partnered with Teqnia, which has acquired 50% of Sun &amp; Life, and the company is now called Teqnia Solar. The aim of the company is to build engineering, construction, and project management capabilities, including the transfer of solar power technology to Saudi Arabia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The global economic recovery is beginning to expand to include more of the developed countries. However, a number of challenges remain, particularly the monetary policy shift in the developed countries, especially in the US, from an unconventional approach to stimulate the economy to a traditional one. This shift represents a challenge, particularly for the economies of emerging markets and developing countries.<br></p><p>The discussions at the G20 meetings and the IMF/World Bank meetings held recently in Washington, DC highlight the need to continue adopting supportive economic policies that promote a balanced, sustainable recovery. The G20 countries have committed to adopting strategies to promote growth by focusing on reforms in employment, investment, competition, and trade to boost global growth rates by 2% in the next five years, underscoring the international community's commitment to act in concert to preserve the gains achieved in recent years. The Kingdom, as a member of the G20, presented its strategy for growth at the meetings of the G20 working group tasked with this work. The Kingdom's strategy is based on the orientations of its development plan. It provides for continued action to promote investment in infrastructure, education, and health and to promote the role of the private sector and public-private partnerships (PPPs) in further diversifying the economy, creating job opportunities, and improving economic productivity and competitiveness in a stable financial and monetary environment.</p><p>As regards our national economy, it has clearly enjoyed positive conditions over the past years. This is due to the economic policies and reforms launched by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. On the occasion of the Ninth Anniversary of the Pledge of Allegiance of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, I congratulate His Majesty the King and the Saudi people.</p><p>His Majesty's reign has been filled with initiatives aimed at the country's prosperity and growth with a focus on reform, integrity, combating corruption, enhancing government performance, empowering women, and adopting programs and policies, which have helped the economy grow at unprecedented rates.</p><p>During the past year, the Saudi economy achieved real growth of 3.8%, despite the decline in oil sector growth. Government spending has supported growth in the non-oil economy, and the private sector has performed well, growing at a rate of 5.5%. Saudi Arabia's economic policies are designed to achieve financial and monetary stability and to improve the business environment. These policies are reflected in the solidity and strength of the Kingdom's economy and solvency, with Fitch Ratings recently raising the Kingdom's sovereign rating from AA- to AA with a stable outlook.</p><p>In reference to these efforts, the report of the Article IV Consultations of the IMF for 2013 emphasizes the superior economic performance of Saudi Arabia among the G20 countries in recent years and the favorable outlook for the Saudi economy. The Fund's Executive Directors have welcomed the measures adopted by the Saudi government to strengthen public financial management and the government's ongoing steps to support fiscal development and strengthen financial regulation and supervision. They have also commended the large expenditure on education and training. The Fund expects the Saudi economy to grow at a rate of 4.1% this year, and 4.2% in 2015.</p><p>Key developments in the Saudi economy during the past year include the approval of the Code of Procedures and the organization of the Public Transportation Authority. Progress was achieved in the implementation of public transport projects (including the signing of the largest contract of its type for public transportation in Riyadh as a single integrated project), the Promise-of-the-North Mining Project, and the General Education Evaluation Commission. The Saudi Arabia Monetary Agency (SAMA) issued licenses to engage in real estate finance and finance lease activities. The Civil Aviation Authority successfully closed its second issue of instruments—exceeding SAR15 billion—for financing the King Abdulaziz International Airport Project in Jeddah and King Khalid International Airport Project in Riyadh.</p><p>The 2014 budget focuses on development projects in the areas of education, health, security, social services, water, roads, electronic services, and support for scientific research. A total of 2,330 contracts worth SAR157 billion were tendered last year. The specialized government funds have continued to provide credit for the implementation of PPPs, which we hope will further promote the private sector's role, particularly in creating job opportunities for citizens.</p><p>Due to the importance of housing in improving the population's standard of living, government policy has given it the priority it deserves. The implementing regulation for the Real Estate Finance Law is expected to promote sustainable real estate financing by creating the necessary institutional framework for encouraging banks and financing companies to provide financing to citizens and real estate development companies.</p><p>SMEs enjoy major support. The Saudi Credit and Savings Bank is making major efforts to coordinate and provide financing for this vital sector, which is an important source of employment. The Kafalah program, which is managed by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, plays an important financing role in cooperation with the commercial banks. On this occasion, I would like to express my gratitude to the commercial banks for their cooperation and involvement with the program and my hope for more of the same.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>There are many examples of strong collaborations between our two nations. Petro Rabigh, as a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Sumitomo Chemical, has solidified its reputation as one of the world's leading ethylene centers. Toyota Motor Corporation went all out in helping grow the Saudi-Japanese Automobile High Institute. The institute has already trained more than 1,000 automotive engineers.</p><p>Isuzu Motors recently inaugurated a new truck assembly plant in Saudi Arabia. That was in December 2013. These companies and their Japanese staff are genuinely committed to training future generations of Saudi Arabian engineers in the core essentials of manufacturing craftsmanship as bred in Japan.</p><p>There are some who are eager to put fresh Japanese crops on your tables in the Middle East. From the field of medicine, there are also others who yearn to contribute their expertise, for example, in diagnostic imaging and emergency medicine to the medical advancement and the expansion of health care throughout the region.</p><p>Japanese solar panels are already known for their durability. I am confident that the collaboration between us, Japan and the Middle East, will equip the panels with further resistance against harsher environments, such as sand storms. The new sources of electric power that Saudi is developing, using Japanese assistance, will put the Kingdom at the core of the vast grid stretching from Asia to Europe.</p><p>As a country where its water system has amongst the lowest leakage rates in the world, I am certain that Japan will also be able to make contributions to the development of modern water infrastructure in the Middle East. Does anyone here have any idea as to how much water is being leaked in Tokyo? It is only 3%. Can you then guess what that rate was a half-century ago? It was as much as 30%. If Japan has done that, then there is no reason why Saudi Arabia cannot do the same. We want to help make it happen.</p><p>In the years ahead, Japan and the Middle East will make a leap beyond the dimension of trading oil and gas, and strengthen our economic and business ties across all sectors. That process will place our mutual relations on a significantly higher level and lead us into an era of expanded cooperation hitherto beyond imagination.</p><p>When you combine Japan's industrial prowess with the vitality of a young and vibrant Middle East, a Middle East of promising growth, and a Middle East that aspires to achieving industrial advancement, how might that synergy materialize? The answer is that it will translate into enormous growth opportunities for both the Middle East and Japan.</p><p>In my country, I have launched a three-pronged package of stimulus measures designed to revive the Japanese economy. Those three prongs, or arrows as I call them, are monetary policies, fiscal policies, and economic growth strategies. I am now shooting them in one fell swoop, resolutely and swiftly, so that Japan could gain vitality afresh.</p><p>Economically vibrant again, Japan should be ready to work with Saudi Arabia toward finding solutions to the challenges it faces. Working with the Saudis in the Middle East, a resurgent Japan would bring over here its industrial experience, know-how, and technology, while creating jobs and, as the Kingdom's running mate, jointly climbing up the value ladder.</p><p>Long gone are the days when bilateral relationships were defined by a one-way street with Saudi Arabia selling oil on one end and Japan buying oil on the other. Even within the domain of energy resources, Japan stands ready to transfer such technologies as renewables or nuclear power generation, which rank among the safest in the world.</p><p>Japan and the Middle East are partners that share the same interests and concerns. For Japan and the Middle East, the 21st Century will be one of coexistence and co-prosperity, or al-ta'í¦ish.</p><p>Collaboration, or al-ta'í¦un, with you is what my country is after. For many in my country, nothing is nobler than the perspiration of diligent labor. According to their belief, the sense of harmony and tolerance grows when you perspire working together, and upon which you share your sense of accomplishment.</p><p>This was exactly the reason why I was delighted to hear that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had requested that Japan send technical advisors to their governments and organizations, and not be concerned about the expenses involved. Let me make an announcement now that soon my country is going to launch with countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE what we call a “cost-sharing technical assistance" framework. This new approach will involve the deployment of highly experienced JICA specialists, with the associated costs to be defrayed by the host countries.</p><p>I believe that JICA's engineers will be able to transfer their know-how as masters of their manufacturing crafts, and at the same time serve as “missionaries" capable of cultivating a spirit of cooperation, attitude of harmony, and tolerance among the people they are going to work with. Conversely, I also believe that those Japanese engineers, through their deep interactions with the local people, will gain first-hand knowledge about Saudi Arabia's faith, love for others, acceptance, and Islam's rich reservoir of tolerance. They will learn tremendously from your al-ta'í¦ish, al-ta'í¦un, and al-tasí¦muh, and return to Japan as missionaries able to convey your wisdom to the people in Japan.</p><p>This is why I want to increase our exchanges at the people-to-people and academic levels with the countries of the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Turkey. Over the next five years, my government will invite business trainees from the Middle East and send in return to the region Japanese instructors. The two-way exchanges should amount to 20,000 people.</p><p>We also plan to increase the number of Middle Eastern students studying in Japan. Over the past seven years, the number from Saudi Arabia has expanded from 30 to 500. From the UAE, around 60 students are currently in Japan, but that total, too, should be increased to 500. The number of female students among them, I am sure, will soar to something like several dozen.</p><p>One leap involves a transformation from our resource-centric relationship to the one marked by full-scale economic ties and a quest for coexistence and co-prosperity. The second leap comprises an evolution from purely economic ties to a relationship marked by cooperation in the quest for regional peace, stability, and growth. This process will give rise to a relationship of multifaceted synergy. In other words, ties traditionally defined by energy will be supplanted by ties of fully fledged synergy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>South Africa and Saudi Arabia are both high growth G20 economies. Since 1994, when Nelson Mandela visited Saudi Arabia and began diplomatic relations, how have trade ties between the two nations evolved?<br></h4><p>Since the visit of former President Nelson Mandela to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1994, trade ties between the two countries have steadily progressed. Former President Mandela described Saudi Arabia as an important and influential country in the Middle East, and it remains a valued and strategic partner for South Africa in the region. This is underscored by the fact that Saudi Arabia is currently South Africa's major supplier of oil. Our oil imports from Saudi Arabia totaled ZAR72.903 billion ($6.87 billion) in 2013, representing about half of our total crude imports. The reality is also that our reliance on Saudi crude has led over the years to a significant trade deficit between the two countries. The focus is currently on encouraging a significant increase of exports to the Kingdom in order to offset the trade deficit.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia is among the world's largest exporters of capital, and in 2013 South Africa was among the world's top destinations for foreign investment. How will FDI from Saudi Arabia to South Africa be facilitated over the coming years?</h4><p>In 2012, a ZAR20 billion joint investment fund, the Saudi Arabia-South Africa Holding Company, was established with investment in priority sectors, including mining, petrochemicals and agro-processing being its main focus. In addition, the South African government offers an array of incentive schemes to stimulate and facilitate the development of sustainable, competitive enterprises by providing accessible incentives that effectively support national priorities. A variety of incentive schemes seek to support the development or growth of commercially viable and sustainable enterprises through the provision of either funding or tax relief, thereby ensuring the creation of new and sustainable jobs. The government of South Africa and its private sector, therefore, encourage international investors to explore and favorably consider the major investment projects in South Africa, which will ensure high-levels of returns on their investments.</p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of Africa-GCC trade to both parties in light of the continuing economic recovery in developed markets?</h4><p>Africa looks forward to the expansion of trade as well as inward investment into its myriad investment opportunities with the GCC to help it overcome the challenges of security, poverty, inequality, and unemployment. Africa is a fast-growing region and public-private partnership deals to boost trade and investment with the economically strong GCC region would be to their mutual benefit. The GCC countries have the major benefit of having extensive capital in the billions of US dollars in their sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), which are used for investments abroad. The African continent with its high growth now and into the future will present the GCC member states and their SWFs with opportunities for high returns on their investments. The expansion of inter-Africa-GCC trade and investment go hand-in-hand in benefiting the long-term advantage of the peoples in both regions.</p><h4>Where do you hope to see relations and trade between South Africa and Saudi Arabia in the year 2020? What initiatives are pushing those ambitions forward today?</h4><p>We fully expect that the bilateral trade deficit between our two countries will have lessened considerably with increasing use being made of the high-quality South African goods, products, and services in the Middle East. We also expect that the level of inward investment into South Africa from Saudi Arabia and the Middle East region will have increased considerably given the highly lucrative returns that such investments will reap. The existing Economic, Trade, Investment and Technical Co-operation Agreement with Saudi Arabia and the annual Joint Economic Commission between the two countries will continue to provide the framework and structural mechanism through which multi-faceted bilateral relations are promoted, with a specific focus on the promotion and strengthening economic, trade, and investment. South Africa is open and ready to do business, and we will remain so.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>I had the privilege of making my introductory visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in November 2013. It was an honor for me to visit not only the vibrant and bustling cities of Riyadh and Jeddah, but also the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Singapore values Saudi Arabia as an important partner in the Middle East region. There has been a steady stream of senior Singapore leaders to the Kingdom in recent years. These include then-Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, who led the way for our deeper engagement after his visit in 2005. This was followed by visits by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in 2006, then-Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew in 2006 and 2008, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean in December 2012. Such high-level interactions have allowed our leaders to establish a comfort level and familiarity with their Saudi counterparts, and have provided the impetus for strengthening bilateral cooperation.<br></p><p>Our economic ties with Saudi Arabia are significant. We imported more than SAR40 billion of crude oil from Saudi Arabia in 2013. However, we can do more to diversify our economic relations away from crude oil. Singapore companies have built world-class expertise in environmental engineering, transport and logistics, info-comm technologies, and the oil and gas sectors, and are keen to collaborate with their Saudi Arabian counterparts in these sectors. There have been several successes. For instance, Singapore companies have built oil tanks in Jubail, provided operations management services at Dammam's King Fahd International Airport, and are constructing the second container terminal of the King Abdulaziz Port in Dammam.</p><p>Singapore can also serve as a base for Saudi Arabian companies to springboard into the ASEAN region, China, and India. I am happy that prominent Saudi companies such as SABIC and ARAMCO have taken the decision to base some of their business activities in Singapore and welcome more Saudi companies to do so.</p><p>Both our governments can help our companies through the signing of trade agreements such as the Gulf Cooperation Council-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (GSFTA). The GSFTA, which entered into force on September 1, 2013, is the first FTA concluded by the GCC with a non-Middle East country. This marks an important milestone in our relationship and I would like to thank Saudi Arabia for its support. Both sides are presently looking into the implementation of the agreement. The GSFTA will further enhance the close economic ties between Singapore and Saudi Arabia as well as the other GCC countries.</p><p>While our respective governments can build bridges to encourage cooperation, sustained economic engagement can only be achieved through the cooperation of the private sector. In this regard, I applaud the efforts of the Saudi-Singapore Business Council (SSBC) in promoting business and trade relations between our two countries.</p><p>My visit to Saudi Arabia has convinced me that there is great potential for cooperation beyond the economic sphere. We must encourage more people-to-people and student exchanges so that there will be greater appreciation of each other's culture and history, especially among young Saudis and Singaporeans. We can then build the foundation for a long-lasting friendship and cooperation, based on mutual trust, respect, and understanding.</p>]]></richbody0content>

How do you plan to create more opportunities for Saudi Arabia and Ireland to conduct commerce?<br></h4><p>Taoiseach Enda Kenny's successful visit, accompanied to the Kingdom by Ireland's Minister for Jobs, Enterprise, and Innovation Richard Bruton and 100 senior Irish businesspeople representing 86 Irish companies, was the largest ever Irish trade delegation to Saudi Arabia. During his visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Taoiseach met with senior Saudi leaders, including HRH Crown Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, to discuss potential areas of bilateral cooperation. The Taoiseach decided to step up Ireland's engagement with Saudi Arabia, and this work is ongoing. A major priority for Ireland vis-á-vis the Saudi market is to expand our agri-food and technology footprint in Saudi Arabia. Ireland's Minister for Agriculture, Food, and the Marine, Simon Coveney, led a successful agriculture and food focused trade mission to Saudi Arabia in October 2013, which included 45 Irish companies. Minister Coveney also held talks with Saudi Agriculture Minister, HE Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Balghunaim, with a strong emphasis on achieving improved access for Irish beef supplies to the Saudi market. Minister Balghunaim has agreed to visit Ireland later in 2014 to further develop bilateral cooperation in the agriculture and food sectors. Ireland's food board, Bord Bia, recently appointed a Middle East Regional Manager in order to further promote opportunities for Irish companies to successfully conduct business in Saudi Arabia and indeed throughout the Middle East. In addition, Enterprise Ireland, the Irish government organization responsible for the development and growth of Irish enterprises in world markets, strengthened their team in Saudi Arabia, earlier in 2014, by appointing a Senior Market Advisor for the Health Care and Life Sciences sector.</p><h4>In 2012, the Ireland Saudi Arabia Business Council (ISABC) was formed to promote trade, technology transfer, and investment between the two countries. Are there plans for further forms of formal cooperation?</h4><p>Since its establishment in 2012, the ISABC has grown from strength to strength, assisting the successful visit of the Taoiseach to the Kingdom in January. Since then, the ISABC held productive meetings in Dublin in June, and members of the Council met with Ireland's Minister of Education and Skills in April to discuss additional areas of cooperation in the education sector. There are currently over 3,000 Saudi students in Ireland, with the majority of these beneficiaries of the King Abdullah Scholarship Program (KASP). We hope to welcome many more students from Saudi Arabia to Ireland in the future. Ireland's Minister for Education and Skills delivered the keynote address to the 5th International Exhibition and Conference on Higher Education (IECHE), in Riyadh in April 2014. The Saudi Minister for Higher Education, HE Dr. Khalid Al-Ankary reciprocated by visiting Ireland in June 2014. The Joint Economic Commission (JEC) is an important forum for developing government-to-government cooperation. The Ninth Ireland-Saudi Arabia Joint Economic Commission took place in Riyadh in February 2014, and Irish and Saudi officials explored areas for closer cooperation in the fields of higher education, agriculture, water and electricity, science and technology, and civil aviation.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia continues to be a strong exporter of capital. What opportunities does Ireland offer foreign investors?</h4><p>There are great opportunities in Ireland for companies looking to establish a base in Europe. Over 1,030 overseas companies have chosen Ireland as their European base, and Ireland was recently recognized by Forbes magazine as the best country in the world for business. In 1Q2014 our GDP grew at an annual rate of 4.1%, the highest growth rate since 2011. Ireland's government debt is rated as investment grade by all major ratings agencies. We have raised ‚¬7 billion in the bond markets so far this year—more than 87% of our total funding target for 2014—in bond sales which were heavily oversubscribed by investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Saudi Arabia is a founding member OPEC and its largest producer. What role does Saudi Arabia play in OPEC's current policy objectives?<br></h4><p>Saudi Arabia is OPEC's largest producer, with major reserves and potential, and an experienced and highly skilled workforce educated both at home and internationally. But there is far more to Saudi Arabia's role than just its size; it is vital to OPEC's decision-making process and in helping achieve the central objective of oil market stability. In this regard, it is always looking to find positive solutions to any challenges the Organization may face, and to work constructively with all the other Members. In terms of the history of the Organization, Saudi Arabia is a founding Member, has hosted a number of OPEC Ministerial Conferences, has held the OPEC Conference Presidency on several occasions, and afforded the Organization a Secretary General in the 1960s. In addition, it also hosted the Third Summit of OPEC Heads of State and Government in 2007, which concluded with a Solemn Declaration in which principles were set out to guide the future work of the Organization. Saudi Arabia has contributed much to the Organization. We respect and appreciate its support and input. And this goes for all Member Countries: each of them has a voice and their views are important to the Organization's present and future.</p><h4>OPEC has predicted an increase in oil demand in 2014 by over 1 million barrels per day (bbl/d). At the same time, it also suggests that non-OPEC countries will meet this demand increase. What does this mean for expanding OPEC production in the years ahead?</h4><p>Yes, we expect that supplies from non-OPEC producers will meet the expected global oil demand increase this year. We have recently seen an expansion in non-OPEC production, particularly in the US with tight oil. These developments are welcome—we need diversity in production. There is room for all sources of energy, and oil, in particular. However, we also need to keep our eyes on the long term and where supplies will come from. When we talk about our future, we are not just talking about the next few years. What is clear is that significant OPEC capacity expansion will be required. We expect to see the call on OPEC liquids increase by over 10 million barrels a day—to over 47 million bbl/d by 2035. This is greater than the expected increase in non-OPEC liquids supply over the same period, at just under 9 million bbl/d.  Of course, OPEC continues to invest—to maintain existing capacity and add new production—to meet these future expectations. And as it has done for many decades, OPEC and its Member Countries will continue to monitor the market on a daily basis, and make sure that production and future investments are in line with how we see the market in the coming months and years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As far as being a female business leader in Saudi Arabia, what ethical convictions have driven your desire to step out as an international figure as well as one in Saudi Arabia?<br></h4><p>You find people who like challenges straight from the start. I was always the one in my family who was pursuing challenges in my education and hobbies. The other component is being in the right environment, and I think that Saudi Arabia's growing economy has a lot of demand, but not much professional supply, and that makes starting a company here an advantage for me. I see a lot of demand. I love challenges and am in the right environment to allow me, as a woman, to able to start and scale my own business.</p><h4>Could you explain what TIME Holding is engaged in currently?</h4><p>We started with an entrepreneurial idea that is maybe not new for the rest of the world, but definitely is here. We realized then that we had to start as an events development company because there are so few aside from those in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Then, we started TIME Events because we wanted to create opportunities for our talents, stemming from our desire to create good content and entertainment. We ran the first Saudi comedy tour, which went to nine states in the US as well as the UK. We also did an art auction for Syrian refugees where Saudi art was auctioned off, and we actually exceeded our target. We also hosted World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) for the first time in Saudi Arabia, while our next move will be to host Cirque du Soleil. We want to bring in global events and take local artists, comedians, directors, photographers, and exhibitors to the world. We have become a bridge with TIME Events, but have realized that there is a lot of content that we are not recording, producing, or selling. So that is why we are starting TIME Production, which is a collaboration between Karim Sarkis, who owns Synch Media, and myself. TIME Production will take the amazing content of these artistic talents from the Middle East and turn them into film and YouTube videos.</p><h4>Can you talk a little bit about how you perceive the business atmosphere here for women on a larger scale and how you manage it yourself?</h4><p>I am not sure if my answer will be fair in that I do not represent all women. I created an open environment that many women do not feel comfortable working in, but for women like myself, this is a great country to work in due to the fact that many people do not expect a woman to know what she is talking about. The other part is that people really want to empower women, be they CEOs, government officials, or ministers. The WWE was a huge obstacle that I was able to overcome, especially being that I am a woman from Saudi Arabia. It is about having the right women in the right places; however, not all women actually want to be in that place. For those who are like me, this is a beautiful environment.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for content?</h4><p>We are tired of having content driven by people who do not understand our culture and talents. We are creating shows that you will see in 2015 that are written by Saudis, acted by Saudis, and co-produced by Saudis. There are some shows that are pan-Arab, but we don't simply want to adopt an Arab format. This is how TIME is different; we do not take global formats, but rather create our own. Shows like Arabs' Got Talent, Arab Idol, and The Voice are all global formats.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Global Vision, Local Promise]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[global-vision-local-promise]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What overall approach do you take in investing abroad, and how would you characterize the current investment environment in emerging markets?<br></h4><p>At KBW, we invest in a diverse array of businesses around the globe, from established businesses in the construction industry to promising technology start-ups. The key is to select investments that align with the changing needs of a particular region. KBW was born out of the recognition that synergies do exist between diverse companies, and their growth can be greatly enhanced if their efforts are synchronized. This is true in both established and emerging markets. I learned from my father to invest in companies that matter, looking particularly for those with a solid history or clear vision for the future. Naturally, I invest in companies that I feel passionate about.</p><h4>The Brazilian market has been of particular interest to you, although some investors have fled Brazil over the past three years. How do you see the country's prospects over the next five years, and what sectors do you see as most promising?</h4><p>I've studied the Brazilian market closely over the past two years, and in that time have seen an increasing role for the private sector, particularly related to infrastructure projects. For Brazil to continue growing, it will need to invest in infrastructure such as railways, highways, and ports. That's why we have chosen to focus specifically on infrastructure projects, as well as oil and gas, logistics, and mining. In Brazil, I see the most promise in services that are pegged to the US dollar, such as oil and gas, and with product prices that are defined by international markets, such as commodities. As one example, KBW has invested in a SAR1 billion ($430 million) infrastructure complex, Petrocity Portos S.A., that will serve the oil industry in Brazil, based near one of Brazil's large new oil-producing areas. We have also supported Royal Minerals—which explores for iron ore, gravel, and granite—and Arcadia Engenharia do Brasil, a construction and engineering firm. Importantly, as we invest in Brazil, we are working closely with local and regional governments to understand what they need from the private sector. For instance, during my last visit to Brazil, I met with local and regional governments in Espirito Santo and Santa Catarina (where KBW's South American head office will be located). We had a firsthand look into what the Brazilian local governments would like to see from the private sector, particularly from private-public partnership (PPP) initiatives.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia is showing very strong GDP growth and is investing billions in infrastructure and services. What ambitions do you have for the Saudi market?</h4><p>One of my greatest ambitions is to see this next generation realize its full potential and entrepreneurial promise. The young people of Saudi Arabia hold the keys to our future—but we must help them channel their creative energy in effective ways. Start-ups provide the energy, vitality and dynamism essential to any growing economy. By supporting them, we can help bring greater opportunity to the youth of Saudi Arabia—and in turn, help their success become the country's success. Investing can help, but we also need to work together to build a supportive environment that sets innovative thinkers up to succeed. That means making it easier for start-ups and budding entrepreneurs to be creative, to start new companies, and even to fail sometimes in the process. For example, the King Abdullah Scholarship is vital to helping entrepreneurs succeed. However, the vision that King Abdullah and his advisors have for this amazing program needs to be supported with actual opportunities for young graduates to go out and stand on their own two feet, instead of being chaperoned constantly. They need the opportunity to try, and even to fail, in the real world. You only learn from your mistakes.</p><h4>Where do you hope to see KBW Holding in five years in terms of its size and portfolio?</h4><p>A private equity portfolio consisting of the assets of a variety of different companies has many variables that impact the overall result, so this is not an easy question to answer. Simultaneously, there are a number of decisions that will impact our size. For example, something we are discussing within the firm is whether to accept or not accept new investors. It's a decision that will inevitably bring changes, specifically in the regulatory aspect. So time will tell, but suffice it to say I am confident about our future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[group-theory]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has allowed the group to not only grow, but diversify in parallel with the growth of the Saudi Arabian economy?<br></h4><p>The group's main business is healthcare and real estate. One of our companies is the largest healthcare provider in the region, Saudi German Hospital. We are a growing organization, and have operations in the UAE, Yemen, and Egypt. We have 10 hospitals currently, and 10 more under construction. Therefore, we are growing our brand in other countries as well as other territories in Saudi Arabia. We are aligning the vision of the company with the boom here in Saudi Arabia. We are actually the only company that is using the word Saudi outside of Saudi Arabia. Meaning, if you go to Dubai, our company is called Saudi German Hospital. Many Saudis are proud to see our company's name used outside the Kingdom.</p><h4>In terms of healthcare and real estate, what has made you continue to focus on these two core pieces of the business?</h4><p>These are defense industries; they are recession-proof. It has been the strategy of the family to maintain these core industries because of the stability they provide. We are also focusing on education now. We have started the largest private medical university in the Middle East in Jeddah. It is a huge project worth around $150 million.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the short- and medium-term evolution of the housing market?</h4><p>It is a huge opportunity for investors. However, I do not think it will last for a long time. The demand is high, and supply is catching up. Many business people are realizing the opportunity and coming in. It is a great time to invest now, but many people are not sure of the opportunities down the line in maybe five years as real estate is cyclical. Already, the banks are getting financing and they are giving it on 20- to 30-year terms. Of course, it is not as advanced as the mortgage sphere in the US, for example, but you can use a mortgage for other things, such as education. It is not that flexible, but many housing loans do exist today. Another concern now is the upcoming tax on property law. I am not so sure that will happen but we have to be optimistic.</p><h4>What are the goals of Shababco, your lifestyle company?</h4><p>Shababco is a subsidiary of the group, and we are proud to have it. It is a company dedicated to the youth and women especially. We started that by entering the fitness industry, as we were already a captain in healthcare. Just as we got into education and helping the sector in the country, we also felt the duty of getting into health and fitness as a preventive care element. Saudi Arabia has one of the highest percentage rates for obesity and diabetes in the world. One of the reasons for this is because it's a hot climate, which limits your ability to go out and walk, run, and do sport—especially for women. Therefore, we felt fitness is a great solution not only to help the health of people, but also to provide sharia-compliant entertainment for the new generations. We brought in a leading franchise from the US, and now we have the largest sports gym in the world here in Jeddah. We have 10 clubs today, and our vision is to expand the chain to 200 branches across Saudi Arabia and Turkey. We started the first women-only gyms in Saudi Arabia. We have the only gym chain that is physiotherapy driven, as we wanted our gyms to have a medical emphasis and an advanced element to them. We are also the first to launch chiropractic service in Saudi Arabia. We pioneered the women's health and medical gym business. We are proud of this as it is really elevating the lifestyle of women here and it is considered gone of the pinnacle investments of the family as far as society wellbeing impact shift.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What tends to attract foreign firms to Saudi Arabia, as opposed to other markets in the region, such as the UAE?<br></h4><p>Foreign investment in a country is essential for the transmission of new ideas, technologies, and business skills among different nations. There are many reasons for investing in the strategic sectors where Saudi Arabia has great comparative advantages. Saudi Arabia is at the heart of the MENA region and is one of the world's 20 largest economies. Investors from all over the world are joining Saudi partners to set up ventures, attracted by the Kingdom's political, economic, and social stability, modern infrastructure, inexpensive energy supplies, and strategic geographic location. The government's established foreign investment policy assures investors that it will refrain from imposing any restrictions on the flow of money into and out of the Kingdom. Furthermore, the Saudi riyal is one of the world's most stable currencies, with no critical changes in its exchange rates during the last three decades. This stability is attracting large foreign investment in the Kingdom. Foreign investors also benefit from Saudi Arabia's low inflation rates. Saudi Arabia is an ideal destination for projects that depend on energy consumption. It has a number of promising natural mining resources and a good location provides easy access to the European, Asian, and African markets. The Saudi market also has high purchasing power and continuous expansion, which is why it is known to be one of the fastest-growing countries worldwide.</p><h4>Is there any specific advice you would offer a potential foreign investor looking to avoid pitfalls?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia represents a very attractive investment destination when energy prices are on the rise. But some investors question the long-term sustainability of the country's economy given its dependence on a limited resource like crude oil and whether or not the government's diversification into other industries will work out, which remains to be seen. Foreign investors should consider Saudi Arabia's dependence on crude oil since the Kingdom derives the vast majority of its revenues from crude oil and other forms of energy, which means that any downturn in the price of crude oil could have significant negative effects on the country. Furthermore, investors must also consider the monarchy—Saudi Arabia has a monarchy form of government, whereby the King combines legislative, executive, and judicial functions; this has resulted in higher corruption ratings by bodies like Transparency International. That said, there are an abundance of benefits in investing in Saudi Arabia, such as the significant capital to spend. Saudi Arabia regularly runs strong account surpluses thanks to its significant crude oil revenues, which gives the government funds to spend on economic development programs to stimulate the economy further. The recent privatizations of certain industries in the country, such as electricity and telecoms, have exposed the Saudi market to further investment from the outside, particularly in the non-energy markets.</p><h4>What role do you foresee for private companies in the long term, especially considering the government's appetite for megaprojects?</h4><p>On April 11, 2000, Saudi Arabia made it easier for foreign investors in the Kingdom by introducing a new law giving foreign investors the right to the same benefits, incentives, and guarantees offered to Saudi individuals and companies. At present, 48% of Saudi Arabia's GDP is represented by the private sector of the economy. The future of the commercial sector is promising. Saudi Arabia's membership in the WTO boosts commercial activity and provides Saudi products with more opportunities in global markets. Another positive development is the formation of free trade zones that Saudi Arabia has undertaken with several neighboring countries.</p><h4>To what extent do you feel traditional family businesses need to adopt corporate culture, and what are the benefits?</h4><p>As the number of foreign companies and investors grow more in number, the need for traditional family businesses to adopt corporate culture becomes more necessary as the competition in the market increases and the market advances. It also allows traditional family businesses with the opportunity to attract investors to invest in their company, making it more effective in their operations. It can help business within Saudi Arabia to expand to more networks and markets that can ultimately allow them to compete on a global scale.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When you started in 2010, was part of your strategy to capitalize on the difficult time many markets were having?<br></h4><p>External conditions were not the only reason we started so steadily and continued to grow. On the other hand, the Saudi market, since the founding of Maceen Capital, has experienced steady growth and continuous expansion, which was of great benefit and had a positive influence on our business and services. The conditions of the global crisis were nothing but an opportunity for the international markets to improve performance and avoid past mistakes, and we at Maceen Capital take into account the needs of the market and its requirements in the long run. Our competitive advantage was, and still is, our knowledge of the Saudi market; knowing that, we were able to seize opportunities as they arose, whether from real estate, debt capital markets, or private equity. We at Maceen have invested in all of these sectors, but our major investment was in the real estate sector as we developed 14 real estate funds.</p><h4>How do you anticipate the effects of foreign investment regulations on the market?</h4><p>Knowing that foreign investment has its merits and disadvantages in any given economy, the relevant authorities must take into account the methodologies of the local market, which does not accept changes easily, and, at the same time, must take into account the value-added of foreign investment in the market. From our experience, foreign investors fail to compete with local market players because legislation does not take into consideration the conditions and investment environment for each party. Therefore, I think it will be a major task for the parties in the relevant legislation, regulation, and justice systems to ensure the highest standards of business ethics in global business.</p><h4>How are labor reforms affecting infrastructure projects, construction firms, and real estate developments?</h4><p>There are certainly some delays in the completion of projects that are under process, but there are no doubts that they will be finished. We are facing some issues related to land development due to governmental rules and restrictions, since it might take up to a year and a half to receive permission to develop land. If we can diminish this period, it will definitely have a positive effect on the residential and housing industry compared to other industries and parties. I think that the new legislation with regard to the labor laws in Saudi Arabia is positive, leading the market to improve the working environment to attract more of the most efficient and serious workers. In normal conditions, authorities face resistance to changes in legislation, but as we have witnessed so far the business community quickly accepted it and returned to work with full force.</p><h4>Which sectors and investments appear the most promising over the coming two to five years?</h4><p>The Saudi market is a promising market for all sectors and industries, because it is in fact an emerging market and we at Maceen will be focusing on private equity, as this is a large and untapped opportunity. Private equity is a major driver in the growth of the economy, and will even affect the capital markets in Saudi Arabia. Some of the most successful stories originate from a venture capitalist investing in private equity and entering the capital markets. There are a number of institutions today, such as King Saud University (KSU) and Silicon Valley in Riyadh, which incubate these entrepreneurs. The cement sector is also very promising. A royal decree has approved the participation of the cement sector in the capital markets, and this process has to follow a methodology that requires them to be established as venture capital, and that transition should take place through investment banks or companies specialized in fund management. The Saudi market is a promising market for all sectors and industries. However, I think the most influential industries are petrochemicals, cement, imports, construction and real estate development, administrative advisory services, tourism and hospitality, telecommunications, financial services, and investment banking.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Growth For Change]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[growth-for-change]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has MASIC evolved from a Saudi Arabia-based investment group to one that is making investments all over the world?<br></h4><p>Something we are particularly proud of is that MASIC was one of the first players to evolve from a family-run company into a fully-fledged institution run by a team of professionals, which took on resolute decision-making. Becoming an institution is not as easy as it may seem. MASIC's change all began with a doctorate in corporate governance setting the groundwork, followed by a constitution agreed upon by the entire family. This involved tasking independent board members who were professionals from outside the family with decision-making. The same process established our executive committee in a project that began just three years ago. I suppose that over its 83-year history, the company has evolved into one of the leading entities in the country, and has set a certain role model to follow.</p><h4>In terms of investments in Saudi Arabia, what sectors do you pursue historically?</h4><p>First of all, we have major homebuyers in our market. Regular asset allocation strategies tend to tell you to invest widely, with a smaller portion set aside for an emerging market such as Saudi Arabia. Yet, we in contrast began in Saudi Arabia. Our wealth was created here, and this will remain the case. We also do very selectively invest abroad. Saudi Arabia has been an area of extensive attention for us, especially in the financial sector, which incubated Bank Albilad, Jeddah; and in the real estate sector. We have under our umbrella operations MASIC Real Estate and a number of closely affiliated companies. We will continue to expand in these fields given our substantial growth opportunities. The demographics work in our favor. We've also branched out into logistics. We've also put together the largest third-party labor accommodation project in Riyadh, soon to be replicated around the country.</p><h4>What are your international investments?</h4><p>We have a mixture of developed and emerging markets to work in. Regionally, we have set up a company called Fajr Capital in partnership with Khazanah Nasional, the investment holding arm of the Government of Malaysia and a few other companies. Fajr Capital invests in unique private equities that are regional, focusing mostly on the countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). They've invested in the Bank of Brunei and certain oil companies; soon they are set to announce investments in industrial companies both in Saudi Arabia and abroad. Beyond the Middle East, we've invested in developed markets both directly and through funds. Directly, we've invested in companies such as Tri-Alpha (Santa Barbara, California), which is a nuclear energy company that uses a unique fusion technology. We also think that security systems are greatly important, and have invested in a company called Password that builds facilities to screen containers. Through a fund, we've also entered Indonesia in terms of real estate. We also partnered with Charles Schwab and have raised our hopes for Asian markets. The demographics are highly favorable, and we, therefore, see Asia as one of the areas to deploy good capital internationally.</p><h4>We've been reassured by many financial experts that the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) is likely to open up to foreign investment in some form this year or in 2015. How will that affect your investment strategy?</h4><p>First of all, I think matters have progressed in a timely manner in terms of what is required by Saudi investors, and local investors have been educated regarding the possibilities. Our domestic investor market is highly liquid. There have also been channels enabling other investors to enter the market through swap deals. Whether the market becomes fully open will be determined based upon on the legal aspects. Yet, I don't believe that the market is still hungry for further liquidity. Regardless, our strategy of identifying a good investment with a good return and value will not change.</p><h4>What is the extent of your agricultural investments?</h4><p>We have an interesting agricultural palate in aquaculture, namely shrimp farming. The same technologies are being used to raise shrimp in an indoor facility in Saudi Arabia, which is the largest unbound shrimp farm in the region. It is the second largest employer both in general, and in terms of women in the city. We'd like to replicate that experience in fish farming. Also, fish could be found in areas that are less popular in Saudi Arabia, such as in the north and south of the country along the Red Sea. Once we expand there, we'll be able to employ more local Saudis and raise their economic standing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are you doing to protect investors?<br></h4><p>The Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul), by virtue of law, sits as both the national securities exchange and sole securities depository in the Kingdom. As such, we are in a privileged position acting as the exclusive gateway to the Saudi capital markets. As a result of this exclusivity, we are not only a commercial entity seeking to grow our business with the aim of generating strong and sustainable financial performance, but we are also a national interest entrusted with tremendous social and economic responsibilities, primary amongst which is upholding the integrity of our capital market and protecting its stakeholders. We will continue to honor this privilege and responsibility by continuously acting with due regard to our corporate socioeconomic obligations, and by empowering our issuers, members, data vendors, and investors with cutting-edge market technologies and a highly liquid and efficient trading platform. We must also require and foster a high degree of disclosure, transparency, and corporate governance among our issuers by evolving ourselves into a representative beacon of excellence. It is by these fundamental means that we protect our investors.</p><h4>There is a rumor that you are hoping to open the market to FDI. Is there a timeline for that?</h4><p>As far as the Saudi capital markets are concerned, I think that the issue of allowing direct foreign portfolio investments has been discussed and debated at many levels and, ultimately, I believe it is a simple matter of “when" rather than “if" Saudi Arabia enacts policies to allow such investment flows. As a member of the global community, we have implicit harmonization commitments that we must continue to work actively to honor. In this respect, it is worth mentioning that the Saudi Stock Exchange is already positioning itself well for any potential changes to foreign investment policy. Indeed, the IFSAH issuer disclosures system, since its launch in June, 2013, has enabled all of our listed companies to announce their periodic financial results in both English and Arabic. We will continue to lay down the required groundwork to ensure that the Saudi Stock Exchange is ready for this highly anticipated policy shift.</p><h4>How does the Saudi Stock Exchange promote economic diversification?</h4><p>We promote economic diversification by providing companies with an efficient venue for accessing capital. We augment this operational aspect of our business by conducting various marketing and educational activities. Indeed, the Saudi Stock Exchange has been very active in reaching out to family-owned businesses across the Kingdom with the aim of enhancing awareness about the virtues of becoming a listed company, particularly in areas related to business continuity, corporate governance, inheritance, and succession planning. Over the course of the last two years, we have conducted three IPO events in three of the key provinces in the Kingdom. These events have attracted the attendance of more than 220 family-owned businesses, resulting in more than 70 one-on-one meetings, of which around 50% have culminated in companies seeking further counsel from licensed financial advisors. Ultimately, we are committed to growing the economy by offering value-added capital raising frameworks for all sectors, with a focus on SMEs. New developments in our ecosystem will provide us with the right tools to achieve this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[power-house]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has ACWA Power leveraged its position to get where it is now?</h4><p>ACWA Power was founded pursuant to the policy adopted by the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2002 to open several sectors of the economy for private ownership and operations, including the water and power sectors. The two initial shareholders of ACWA Power were Abunayyan Group and AlMuhaidib Group. They saw this as a unique opportunity to get involved in a broader value chain, but recognized that it was a completely different type of business and needed, therefore, to have its own new enterprise that over time can become a sustainable long-term business with a balanced portfolio. ACWA Power was founded specifically with the objective of doing nothing else but to develop, invest, own, and operate power generation and desalinated water production plants. The aim was then to sell the product on a long-term bulk supply basis to credit-worthy off takers. We are not a traditional utility company in the sense that we do not sell to retail customers; however, we are a bulk service provider. The first transaction that we tendered ourselves we won, which was unusual in itself. We then went on to win the first five in different configurations, and these are extremely large transactions. The sixth was canceled mid-procurement. Of the next five tenders, we won three and lost two. Today, the plants we own and operate generate 12% of the electricity and about 48% of the desalinated water produced in this country. We have another 30% of the Kingdom's power generation capacity currently under construction.</p><h4>Could you briefly characterize the potential for renewable energy solutions in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The reality is that given where renewable energy prices are today with costs having come down significantly, without thinking, we should be moving 15% of our load to renewable energy as it is the most competitive solution to provide for this segment of the load when fossil fuel, which is the alternative, is priced at market prices. We are blessed with a situation where we do not even need to shut any existing fossil fuel power generation plant to then use renewable energy as an alternative and thus factor this additional cost into the equation, but of course we need to shut down and replace the rapidly growing old fleet, which is extremely inefficient, and, thus, produces low power output compared to the amount of fuel that is put in. Our demand is growing; hence, instead of continuing to build fossil-fueled new capacity, we should simply build renewable power plants at least till the peak load segment is fully served by renewable energy. Right now, we have 1,400 MW of gas turbines that are fueled and even in some instances are fueled by oil, which is even more inefficient. This should be the first segment that should be switched to renewable energy.</p><h4>How are you able to finance your business?</h4><p>There is a significant pool of money out there in the Islamic financing market. In order to generate more investment and free up and refinance assets more efficiently, we will utilize the sukuk market in due course. While we were founded by three private sector shareholders, and a few years later we were joined by five others, from day one we recognized that providing water and electricity even in bulk to state-owned utilities or large industrial consumers is still very much an activity that will attract the attention of the public given its fundamental significance to the social and economic development of communities and countries; hence, we will in time also come to further widen that ownership to progressively include the public sector and ultimately the public at large. In 2013, we brought in two public sector agencies, a subsidiary of the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Saudi Arabia and the Public Pensions Agency as shareholders. Then, in 2014, we will broaden the shareholding to include the International Finance Corporation, the private sector affiliate of the World Bank, and in time to come we will further broaden the shareholding base to ultimately fulfill our objective of having the most diverse shareholder base possible. By adding all these new shareholders, we have continued to issue more share capital, which has, therefore, continued to add to the cash we have available as a company to utilize and grow our asset platform.</p>]]></richbody0content>

The projects announced and in progress since 2010 by Saudi Aramco and the government of Saudi Arabia have provided the private sector in the Kingdom and the GCC with tremendous opportunities for growth. Abdel Hadi Abdullah Al-Qahtani &amp; Sons Group has invested in growing its existing infrastructure-related businesses by doubling and even tripling its capacities as well as establishing new related businesses that would allow the group to grow with the changing requirements of the Saudi economy.</p><h4>What strategies have been most important to the group's expansion, and how have you modified your approach over the years to adapt to changing conditions?</h4><p>Abdel Hadi Abdullah Al-Qahtani &amp; Sons Group's strategy has been to concentrate on our core businesses first, and then look to acquire related businesses that have strong potential for growth. The key underlying theme has been to concentrate on businesses related to infrastructure development of Saudi Arabia and plan for future growth.</p><h4>What is your strategy for successful joint ventures with foreign firms, and what are your criteria for which products or services to partner with?</h4><p>In all joint ventures, we look at the market for the specific products and services in Saudi Arabia and the GCC. Technology transfer is vital for our joint ventures; we are constantly looking to introduce new and better technologies into the Kingdom and the GCC as a whole. We then look to establish a meeting of the minds between our group and overseas partners. If we feel that we have a shared long-term vision, we move forward.</p><h4>In 2013, the group entered in the airlines business as a new segment for the group.  What trends inspired this decision, and how will you capture market share in this rapidly growing market?</h4><p>Abdel Hadi Abdullah Al-Qahtani &amp; Sons Group won the second national flag carrier license in early 2013. We looked at this as an infrastructure business, which is much needed in Saudi Arabia to accommodate the growing domestic and international travel requirements of domestic and foreign nationals residing in Saudi Arabia. Our decision to enter this challenging field was based on a detailed analysis of the Saudi Arabian aviation market, projected growth, and our confidence in being able to deliver a service level that would exceed market expectations. We have recruited one of the strongest professional core management teams to drive this effort. Our core strategy is to introduce the latest technology aircraft, with the most up-to-date in-flight services, and a level of service not previously available in the market making traveling on SaudiGulf Airlines an absolute pleasure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where are you positioned in the Saudi market in 2014?<br></h4><p>In IPOs, we are the largest investment bank when it comes to equity capital market (ECM) deals, and not only in Saudi Arabia, but in the whole of the Middle East. We were the largest not only in number of transactions, but also in the size of these transactions. Our pipeline in 2014 is massive. The Saudi market is one of the most active markets in IPO and ECM transactions.</p><h4>What services are you providing to meet emerging demands?</h4><p>The Basel III requirements are putting pressure on the banks, meaning they cannot lend as much as they used to. Therefore, the number of sukuk issuances is increasing, as are their sizes. Also, more and more semi-governmental institutions will go out and start issuing sukuks. We handle these transactions. The other line of business we are doing is asset management. In asset management, we have 17 funds. We just launched two recently, a real estate fund and an equity income yielding fund. In 2013, the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) was up over 30% and our flagship fund was up over 40%. We had more than 11%-12% outperformance, so that is an excellent result. We think 2014 is going to be a good year, too, especially if the market opens up, and we think it will. The market is ready on a technical level to be opened, and everyone is anticipating this. From technical, legal, and regulatory standpoints, we are ready. Hopefully, that will happen soon.</p><h4>Where do you hope to see Saudi Fransi Capital by 2020?</h4><p>We have three major activities: investment banking, asset management, and brokerage, and we are now looking at specialized services, whereby we cater for the corporates and institutional investors. We are now the first independent exchange-traded fund (ETF) market maker. Also, we do fund administration and custody for institutional investors' DBMs and their funds. We want to maintain our position in investment banking as the bank of choice and the largest investment bank. In asset management, we have superior performance and we want this to be married with the size of our assets under management (AUM), because the size of our AUM is not reflecting our performance. This is mainly because the largest AUMs you find in the Saudi Arabian market are coming from the banks that have the largest number of retail clients, which is something that we don't have. I think with the new endowments we have in Saudi and the new government spending and investments, we are hoping to get some of these assets managed under Saudi Fransi Capital. On the brokerage side, I think our brokerage platform is an award-winner and we continue to develop and enhance this and the features we provide. I am hoping we will gain a double-digit market share. This is basically what I am thinking of for Saudi Fransi in 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges do you face in implementing a strong regulatory framework?<br></h4><p>Our mission is to make sure electricity and potable water supplies are adequate, of high quality, and at reasonable prices for consumers. We are trying to balance these requirements. The major challenge, of course, is the high growth rate of demand for both electricity and desalinated water. Over the past five years, the average growth rate in electricity peak demand has been about 8%. The average growth rate of energy sales was around 4%. Of course, the gap here is widening. Peak demand reflects the required amount of investment, while the sale of energy represents the revenue of the electricity sector. We have to make sure the gap is filled, one way or another. The other challenge is to raise efficiency. The rate of consumption per capita is high. Even if we correlate energy consumption with GDP, it remains high, and is increasing. We conducted a study a few years ago to identify various areas where efficiency could be achieved effectively. Our data indicated that 50% of our consumption went to households. Meanwhile, 80% of electricity goes to buildings, whether households, commercial, or government premises. Furthermore, 70% of that 80% is accounted for by air conditioning. In that respect, almost 56% of electricity is going to air-conditioning in buildings. The study showed that any efficiency programs to be implemented should target buildings first. A royal decree in 2012 mandated the insulation of all buildings. The Saudi Energy Efficiency Center was also established to monitor efficiency programs across various sectors, and not only in terms of electricity, but also buildings, industry, transportation, and so on. A decision was also made not to allow any air-conditioning units to enter the country unless they met a certain standard. The decision was implemented in October 2013. We expect these two mandates to reduce consumption in buildings, if implemented correctly, by about 50%, which is substantial. We are also considering energy efficiency from the supply side. Many existing power plants are of the open-cycle type and have low efficiency ratios of about 30%. We are requesting all power plants today to have a combined-cycle, which means higher efficiency in the range of 50%. The power plants located on the coast have been requested to provide a provision for future expansion to also produce water. This could raise efficiency to 80%. The other measures we are taking involve developing a restructuring plan for the Saudi Electricity Company (SEC), currently a vertically integrated monopoly. From service providing to the supply side, it is planned to separate its major activities into generation, transmission, distribution, and services providing in the future to enhance competition in supply and service-providing activities. Generation owned by SEC represents a dominant position in the generation industry and will be broken into four companies, again to promulgate competition. This step will ultimately encourage investment. The private sector is keen to invest, but needs clear rules and regulations and a level playing field.</p><h4>What will be the role of private sector companies in electricity and desalination?</h4><p>The private sector's role is going to be essential, and we would like to see more participation in that respect. Currently, the private sector is participating in generation. There are several power plants owned by the private sector producing more than 10,000 MW, and we would like to see more coming online. We expect more activity on the transmission side, where transmission lines could be built by the private sector. We would also like to see more competition in the distribution sector. Companies will probably be established in various regions to provide such services, which is a low-risk venture. And once the distribution companies are established, we expect to separate distribution from service provision.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of your business?<br></h4><p>First of all, the history of desalination in Saudi Arabia goes way beyond just a few years ago. The first desalination unit was in Jeddah, and it started operations in the early 1900s. Since then, the capacity has grown from 300 cubic meters per day to 3.6 million cubic meters in just 50 or 60 years. The momentum and decision to go for desalination was strategic, simply because no renewable water was made available to satisfy the needs of Saudi Arabia. There was also another factor behind that, which is our aim to provide adequate water not being limited to the people of Saudi Arabia. Our values as Muslims include the belief that we must supply adequate water not only for human beings, but also for all creatures on Earth. Therefore, there are multiple driving factors. Part of it is the ability to acquire adequate water, another part is value driven, and the final part is that it is required for national development requirement.</p><h4>Where is Saline Water Conversion Corporation (SWCC) today in the journey toward greater privatization, and what might that look like a few years from now?</h4><p>I think the issue of privatization is just a means of achieving more advanced goals. We look at it as a vehicle for producing more from the assets with no need for extra resources to be built. An example of resources that we can utilize is the abundance of land that we can offer to other businesses to support our industries. For example, brine water reuse, mineral extraction from brine water, energy recovery, and the business of utilizing carbon are currently underutilized, but can be developed along with the production of the same amount of water. More importantly, we look at efficiency as the ability to utilize our business for purposes other than just desalinating water. We have a network of almost 7,000 kilometers of pipelines to transmit water from coastal areas to the major cities inland. That number will grow shortly to 10,000 kilometers, and all of these are coupled with a fiber-optic network for communications, meaning that we can utilize such a business as part of our mandate to expand the business and utilize assets. Basically, we look at privatization as a way of utilizing our current assets to produce more for the same value. The stage that we are in is the dream stage; we are trying to corporatize SWCC. In corporatizing SWCC, we will be able to change SWCC to be operating as a corporate entity with autonomy, transparency, and self-driven goals. We will be able to focus dynamically to take advantage of opportunities much faster. The privatization program has been approved by the Supreme Economic Council; however, it is just the mechanics of how and where we should start.</p><h4>What factors do you examine when determining whether to invest in an alternative energy, plant a conventional plant, or an upgrade of an older oil-burning plant?</h4><p>This is something we look at seriously. Operational excellence is another one of our core strategies. Part of operational excellence is a major portfolio or program to enrich our function of energies, and not to be limited only to fossil fuel. Therefore, we need to expand to explore energies other than fossil fuels, for example solar energy or other means of renewable energy. We tackle this issue through multiple means. Number one is a joint venture with the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) to jointly build the first solar energy Al Khafji desalination plant, which will produce 30,000 cubic meters of water. The plant is under vetting now to be constructed, and we will be the off-taker for that plant, and will both jointly oversee this project as a gateway to utilizing renewable energy in desalination. Stage II is that we collaborate with the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy to explore more potential in the Western Region to see the economic and technical viability of multiple technologies that can fit in some of the locations we are in. We will be able to explore more economically how we should run those desalination processes on renewable energy. The third aspect is through our R&amp;D center, which has already made collaborations with advanced technology firms to utilize the latest technology in renewable energy sources.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the key highlights at Union National Bank (UNB) over 2014?</h4><p>Reviewing our financials, we have maintained a consistent growth course, recording a profit of AED1.584 billion for 9M2014, achieving an increase of 10% compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. Our profit for 3Q2014 was AED552 million, up notably by 22% compared to the same quarter of 2013 and an impressive 6% QoQ, principally driven by an increase in volumes across our various business segments. The UNB Group's performance in 3Q2014 maintained its upward trend, with the Group announcing a record profit. We remain focused on sustainably growing our franchise and business. The key to success of our business model is its strong customer-oriented strategy, providing a wide array of award-winning products and services and our persistent endeavor to enhance the customer's experience.</p><h4>How would you describe the position of UNB in the UAE's financial sector?</h4><p>We have consistently strong ratings from Moody's Investors' Service Ratings, Fitch Ratings, and Capital Intelligence, with all three ratings reporting a “stable" outlook for the bank. At UNB, we have improved our activities, services, and products over the years in order to be a good partner in the banking industry so as to support the economy and the country. We have an Islamic finance arm called Al Wifaq Finance Company. UNB established the first brokerage company in the UAE, Union Brokerage Company (UBC), as well as a sales and marketing services company, Injaz Marketing Management. We understand the market fully, and we focus on this aspect of our business. We are selective about where we engage outside the UAE. Currently, we have a presence in Egypt through a 96.6% owned subsidiary. While UNB has a representative office in China, and a presence in Kuwait and Qatar, we are not aggressive about expanding to every country in the world. We select markets in which we are able to manage our business.</p><div class="quote">“In retail banking, you need to always be cooperative and have an understanding of customer needs as these needs change."</div><h4>How have the bank's activities grown since it was first established?</h4><p>We started as a small bank in the early 1980s. When this bank was established, it was mainly a corporate finance bank. After about a decade and a half, we started introducing retail banking aggressively, but in a planned manner. Now, we are a major player in retail banking and SME activity. We have an active investment group taking care of our customers' needs and priorities. We manage different types of business from retail to corporate to small business, investment, and structured finance and we continue to make investments in support of future growth.</p><h4>In terms of retail banking, how would you describe your customer base, and what are their financial needs?</h4><p>When we talk about retail banking, we are talking about consumers, such as individuals who may be salaried or unsalaried and are starting small businesses. In terms of customer numbers, our customer base is between the third and fifth largest in the country. The products that we provide are well designed. We have an experienced and well-qualified team that has been involved in retail banking for a long time. UNB is active in retail, which is necessary because the competition in the market is strong nowadays. We are able to maintain our market share, but the most important thing is maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction.</p><h4>When it comes to your products, how do you compete with other banks in the UAE?</h4><p>In retail banking, you need to always be cooperative and have an understanding of customer needs as these needs change. Retail is detail; you have to see the market, see the competition, and customer needs. It is easy to introduce a new product and even easier to be copied by the competition. When you introduce a product you publish all the details, which means you make it available to the competition before even making it available to customers. Competitors can take products and bundle them in a different way or add extra benefits but the one thing that cannot be copied is the quality of service. You have to be service oriented, honest, and transparent with your customers. For banks involved in retail banking, this is the main factor that differentiates one bank from another. We are the number one in providing quality service, and it is our main focus.</p><h4>How have the needs of customers changed in recent years?</h4><p>The main trend is a growing need for electronic services. The new generation is very familiar with this, and they do not want to come inside the branch and stand in a queue. They want to be able to do their banking while sitting in their office or on their phone. The development of these kinds of capabilities is very crucial for any bank that thinks about the future trends of customer needs and satisfaction. With mobile banking, we are making good progress in that regard and our teams are looking at making improvements so that we are available to the customers wherever they may be.</p><h4>What is your analysis of UNB's 10% increase in profit in 3Q2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013?</h4><p>First, we have a strong credit culture. We plan our actions well, and we do not take excessively high risks. It is well known that UNB is more conservative, which was at one point taken as a negative. When 2008 came, it turned out to be a great point in our favor. Many others began complimenting what we had done. We are consistent. We stick with credit principles and take calculated risks. We identify the segments we want to deal with, and we understand them. We have specialized people in each industry. The bank understands in detail the customers' needs and plans, and it works as a partner with the customer. We take the necessary action when the time is right. We are not the kind of bank that changes according to the news. We are consistent because of our conservative approach.</p><h4>How have the central bank's policies affected UNB and the financial sector as a whole?</h4><p>The central bank has definitely been pro-active and has made solid decisions, although it caused some pain for the banks and affected profitability when they started dealing with certain regulations related to ceilings and the retail business. I believe this was a great step because it's not a matter of giving money to each and every individual who may not be able to afford the repayments. The central bank realized this and put in place certain guidelines. When we talk about high exposure, the banks felt happy to invest in the government because it is risk-free—almost. The banks have been trying to focus on what the government needs and directing their resources in that direction. Different sectors require different needs just to make the economy grow. Putting a ceiling on banks in this regard pushed them to look for viable business, which was good for the economy.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the growing Islamic finance segment?</h4><p>As with conventional finance, it is a matter of putting in certain guidelines to mitigate risk, but if you go deep into Islamic financing, you will find the risk elements are the same. I cannot see a difference in risk; the difference I see is in the titles that have been used for certain Islamic financial products and services. It is a growing segment, but at the same time it is not a replacement for the conventional way of banking. We, at the banks, look at the customers' needs, and if there is a niche in the market for sharia-compliant banking, we cannot ignore it. Our Islamic finance company Al Wifaq is focused mainly on the retail business. This segment is growing, but at the same time, it is still an alternative to conventional banking.</p><h4>How is UNB expanding and increasing its network reach?</h4><p>We have increased our ATM network and have over 250 ATMs in the UAE today. In 2013, we opened 10 branches in the UAE and four new branches in Egypt to further increase UNB's presence in these markets. With the expansion of cities here, we go to where our customers need us. Our first priority is to keep our level of expansion internal. The second priority is to be in GCC countries. We are in two now, Kuwait and Qatar. Saudi Arabia is a major market, and if we have the opportunity we will expand there also. We are also looking to Oman. We have doubled our capital in Egypt, and we are also doubling our capital at Al Wifaq. However, our first priority will always remain the UAE.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have the milestones been for Bombardier in the UAE over the past year?</h4><p>One of Bombardier's main objectives in the region is targeting aircraft sales, but we have other goals to increase our customer services and presence. Bombardier has significantly increased its presence in the region over the years. Most of the sales force is now based in the UAE. We have also expanded in the sense that Qatar Executive is our maintenance provider throughout the region. We have expanded that into Saudi Arabia as well with ARABASCO, which is our service provider there and in Turkey with MNG, which is our service provider to maintain our aircraft in the region. In that respect, it has been a very successful year in terms of what we wanted to do—to expand our office here and our wings on the maintenance side. On the sales side, it has been a very healthy year for us in the Middle East region and in Africa.</p><h4>What is the strategic importance of the UAE and Dubai for Bombardier's operations?</h4><p>We already have a partnership in the UAE with ExecuJet, which is our service provider. However, let's not forget that we based ourselves in Dubai, too. The office we are in presently has expanded from eight people to 24 now, and we are still expanding. We chose the UAE obviously for the basic elements it provides us with, such as businesses in the city and airlines including Emirates, which provide us with connections between the Middle East, Africa, and our home in Montreal, Canada. It is easy to fly from here, and it is an easy center to use. That is really why we decided on Dubai, and we have been here since 1998.</p><div class="quote">“Bombardier is a leading company in terms of business aircraft."</div><h4>What is the main profile of the clients you like to approach in the region?</h4><p>We look at our past history, the economy, and the political conditions in the Middle East. By having these three elements, we can work on a forecast. The other thing that you have to realize is that business in the Middle East has changed. It used to be that business people focused on their own country, but now they are looking at pan-Arabia. They are expanding into the region, so they need to travel. The other thing is that there is only a limited commercial airline network that can service our customers' needs in smaller cities. Currently, you can't go direct from Dubai to Alexandria, for example. All of this has created another business for us, and that is why you see our trend of expansion in the Middle East. It's a similar thing if you work in Africa—obviously, the airport infrastructure and travel in Africa are very limited, and business people in mining and oil exploration need to travel into areas that even commercial airlines cannot go. This is another thing that helps us to sell in our business.</p><h4>How important are public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the development of the aviation sector?</h4><p>We actually tend not to have partnerships, as much as we have clients that we build partnerships with, such as Qatar Executive and ExecuJet, whereby they provide a service for us. Bombardier has just become closer to Royal Jet in Abu Dhabi, as it bought four airplanes from us. That is another expansion we have had in the region. The partnership works on the product plus the maintenance side. We don't intend to invest in manufacturing facilities or maintenance facilities ourselves; we always find private investors that can help us on that because our focus is on manufacturing aircraft.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Bombardier's financial performance in the Middle East in 2013?</h4><p>Bombardier is a leading company in terms of business aircraft. We expect to increase that for the next few years, especially with what's happening in the Middle East today, even with the political unrest, the need for travel and for private jets is increasing. Plus, the airports being built in the Middle East will increase our business. I see business in 2015 being very good. We have done very well in 2014 and we will continue that into 2015.</p><h4>What are the main strategies of Bombardier for approaching new clients?</h4><p>We depend not only on our relationships, because this is a word-of-mouth business, hence we have expanded on that. Bombardier has gone and explained its presence to the market, and not just at events that relate to business aircraft. We have also gone to boat shows, horse riding, and polo events, amongst others. We are trying to use events where we can target our customers. We have found our customers, so we are spending more money on the marketing side, not only in one country, but in many countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Nigeria. We are also following the economic booms and trying to have a presence in those places. We are working to increase our presence at most of the air shows the Middle East hosts. By using these events, not just business aircraft events, we are trying to target more customers.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that the aviation sector will face in Dubai in the medium term?</h4><p>In the UAE, the new Al Maktoum International Airport is great and we have invested a lot of money there. However, Dubai International Airport is very crowded and busy, and there is probably no more room for business aircraft there. We feel that this is something that is going to work against users of business aircraft. They might have to go and use Jebel Ali, which is quite a long way from the city. Business people want to fly in and leave the same day, so they need to come to a closer airport. That's probably going to be an issue for us. Otherwise, we don't have problems in Dubai. We would like to see more fixed-base operators (FBOs) at the new airport. I think ExecuJet has one and DC Aviation has one as well, but it would be nice to see another one there because the traffic would be able to take that. We can see some expansion in Sharjah and Fujairah, but that is still too far away from the main business city, which is Dubai.</p><h4>What is the significance of R&amp;D and innovation for Bombardier in the region?</h4><p>The region is extremely limited in R&amp;D because it is more about sales here. The only facilities that Bombardier has are in Morocco, which is more of a manufacturing plant for small parts. Our main R&amp;D work is done in Montreal and Toronto, in Canada, and in Belfast, Northern Ireland. We have always insisted that our products are at the cutting edge of technology. We have now developed a new Challenger 650 airplane, and we have invested heavily in the Learjet 85, and the model. Now we have the Global 7000 and the Global 8000, which will be delivered in 2016 and 2017. We are still upgrading our airplanes. We have committed to the market that every year we will come up with something new, and we always try to be leaders in technology.</p><h4>What is Bombardier's role going to be in the development of the aviation sector in the region?</h4><p>Bombardier is a leader in the aviation sector, both in commercial and in business aircraft. We have always intended to maintain our investments not only in R&amp;D, but also in the region generally, as we have to create some returns from the business we generate in the region. In the UAE, we have limited it to the spare parts circle. In terms of R&amp;D, if there is an opportunity, I am sure Bombardier will consider it in the future.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Xerox's position in Turkey supporting its business development in the emerging economy?</h4><p>Xerox is well positioned in Turkey, and 2015 will be the 25th anniversary of our presence here. Xerox was one of the first companies in this sector to base itself in Turkey, and recently our competitors have also entered the market, mostly through purchasing their distributors and partners, which is the strategy that we used to enter Turkey. Throughout these 25 years we have invested heavily, particularly on the channel and partner development side. Xerox has one of the most effective partner networks in the country. We also have a service company that offers significant career opportunities to locals, and together with our partners we have a network of some 1,000 employees around the country. These positions could be sales-based, service-based, or operations; we also give management print services, and we are the leader in the sector for management services. Xerox makes an important contribution to the labor market of Turkey, and by paying taxes we are contributing to the Turkish economy. There are no manufacturing facilities in Turkey at this stage, although the possibility is under consideration. Xerox is changing from a technology-orientated company to a service-orientated one. While there is a demand in the technology industry, there is even more demand for infrastructure and business process outsourcing, in which we want to be a major player.</p><h4>What is Xerox doing to combat the informal economy?</h4><p>Xerox plays an important role in this campaign by working to eliminate counterfeit products, which is well documented in the press. Xerox is also working with Interpol and the Turkish police, although this involvement is minimal on our part. Our primary focus is on our day-to-day business, on investment in the area of security and recruitment. Otherwise, we have price harmonization policies across the world; under this agreement, prices are similar across all countries and territories. These prices are audited heavily; in fact, I used to be part of this auditing process. This facilitates the free movement of goods with price differences. This challenge is not unique to Turkey.</p><h4>How do you strike a balance between offering low costs and developing R&amp;D and new technologies?</h4><p>Xerox has been very successful, both at a country level in developing markets, and at an organizational level in terms of controlling costs. In the Central Eastern region, we have reduced our cost base by 30%-40% over the five years I have been at the helm. Our strategy is to reduce inefficiency to the lowest possible level, and we accomplish this through effective reporting, which allows us to measure our progress. Xerox is very good in terms of having data available for control and measurement, which promotes increased efficiency, and allows us to invest wisely in the market. This is important because the market is very cost sensitive, and the operation of high-end printers is even more cost sensitive. As I said, Xerox is a very good vendor, because we offer products from the smallest to the largest size, and that is an advantage because we can shuffle between products and invest in the business. However, sometimes Xerox can find itself at a disadvantage when its competitors are focused on one product, and we are focused on the whole range of products.</p><div class="quote">“Printed electronics is the revolutionary technology to produce electronic circuits on the surface of different materials."</div><h4>Xerox is best known for its copiers and printers. Would you say that the company's strategy is shifting away from manufacturing these products and focusing on services?</h4><p>Rather than ceding its advantage in technology, the current strategy is a form of diversification. But with technological developments, the market has limited overall growth potential in the near future, although there are still growth opportunities, especially with print houses. For example, print houses are migrating toward digital printing. This means that Xerox, and vendors like us who are in digital printing, are hoping to grab a share of this action. However, traditional printers and copiers are a limited area of growth and, therefore, to satisfy our shareholders, Xerox has added the services business to its portfolio, which offers a more rapid growth rate and has more growth potential in the future. Therefore, it is not our intention to abandon our traditional strengths, and we have every intention of maintaining our market leadership.</p><h4>Are there other technological opportunities that Xerox is currently reviewing, such as 3D printers?</h4><p>Xerox is not particularly interested in producing 3D printing devices. Printed electronics is something that Xerox is interested in and well positioned itself to capitalize on this trend. Printed electronics is the revolutionary technology to produce electronic circuits on the surface of different materials such as plastic, silicone, glass, and textiles. However, nothing has been officially highlighted at this stage, especially in printed electronics, which is something that could be an incredible opportunity not only for Xerox, but for all industrial production processes in general.</p><h4>Are there digital products or services that Xerox works with that have growth potential in the Turkish market?</h4><p>Xerox is definitely the leader in the printer market, but in terms of the inkjet market we are new. In light of this, we recently acquired Impika, a company in France. Impika is the market leader in inkjet printing and represents a major opportunity for Xerox, both in Turkey and globally. This is especially the case in digital printing, as these machines are capable of printing millions of prints in a very efficient manner, which is what makes these inkjet machines so exciting.</p><h4>How do you see the ICT sector in Turkey developing moving forward?</h4><p>ICT is a fast-growing market, but it is consumer oriented, rather than technological. In other words, ICT is developing in terms of consumer needs rather than in terms of infrastructure and technology. This needs to change in favor of more technology investments by both companies and the government, which has picked up the pace over the last five years. The consumer-orientated market is changing, but it threatens to eclipse the technological developments on the corporate and state level. Regardless, being able to sell value is something that will remain critical in Turkey, which is something that Xerox knows how to do best.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TBY talks with Luis H. Pérez, President of Universidad Autónoma de Occidente, on Colombia's expanding higher education offering, meeting international standards, and extending access to the deserving.</h4><h4>What is Colombia's potential to become a global educational powerhouse?</h4><p>Over the past two decades, higher education has received an important boost from the Colombian government in terms of improving program quality. As a consequence of this policy, Colombian universities have a solid reputation at the national and international level. Secondly, the student population has increased significantly in the same period and, thirdly, research activities have been consolidated at the most advanced universities. However, work needs to be done in order to improve the quality of regional and local universities not yet benefiting from the national policies. The fact is that only 28 higher education institutions in Colombia out of 286, including Universidad Autónoma de Occidente, have been accredited for high quality standards by the National Ministry of Education.</p><h4>In which fields does Colombia excel in higher education?</h4><p>Since Colombia is a country rich in biodiversity, there has been an urgent need for environmental programs at many universities. Our university, for example, has an undergraduate program and a Master's degree program in Environmental Management. We also offer a course on culture and biology of environmental diversity, jointly with an American university, which is popular with many American students. At the same time, the University is doing significant work on renewable energy in association with national energy providers. This is only an example of the many projects that are now in progress at our university and at certain others in Colombia, in the promising field of environment and sustainable development.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the measures implemented by the government to broaden access to higher education for students of limited economic means?</h4><p>Colombia has taken crucial decisions toward the democratization of higher education over the past decade. As a result, 13% of students at the Universidad Autónoma de Occidente have benefited every semester from the so-called budget quotas, reflected in subsidies and credit lines for students of low-income families, belonging to levels one and two of the Colombian socio-economic scale. In this way, many academically able students from poor families have the chance to study at high quality universities. In this setup, universities assume up to 25%, while the government provides 75% of the total value of these credits.</p><h4>What are the goals of universities belonging to the Mutis network?</h4><p>We are convinced that integration with other universities to combine strengths fosters the development of projects of high social impact. Given that we live in a globalized world, it is necessary to adopt identical operating standards and parameters and pursue strategic alliances with other universities around the world that will contribute to the achievement of our own goals and those of the entire educational system in Colombia. A clear example of the value of the network is design and development of a doctoral program in engineering by the Red Universitaria Mutis, a goal that has been difficult to achieve by each of the universities that are members of this network.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of your Campus for students?</h4><p>Our campus represents the essence of a high quality educational institution in Colombia. We try to provide the best quality of life for our students, since we know that the better the student feels, the better they perform in their studies. Our campus offers a wide spectrum of activities related to welfare such as a leadership school, a social facilitators' school, sports, and cultural facilities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the highlights of your strategy of the past decade?<br></h4><p>Our main objective is to ensure the welfare of families involved in the coffee industry, as well as the communities around the areas where we grow coffee. There are over 560,000 families involved in the coffee industry, which equates to around 30% of the agricultural workforce. This proves the importance of the coffee industry in Colombia, as no other agricultural activity can be compared to it. Indeed, there is no other economic activity, beyond the energy sector, with a higher share in GDP. The main strategic lines of our policy over the past five years have targeted productivity, as in recent years the country has witnessed decreased production levels. We have also prioritized research, and safeguarding the environment. Related measures have enabled us to achieve a 30% rise in productivity, totaling over 11.5 million coffee bags.</p><h4>In your opinion, what makes Colombian coffee among the best in the world?</h4><p>Colombian coffee has traditionally enjoyed a high competitive level in international markets, and people are willing to pay extra for it. Over the past few years, Colombia has worked vigorously in several market niches toward greater specialization and certification in products, such as organic coffee. Today, 43% of the coffee Colombia sells abroad is recognized as extremely high-quality produce, and almost 60% of our exports comprise specialist coffee.</p><h4>What is the social role of the Federation regarding the welfare of coffee producing families in Colombia?</h4><p>We prioritize the social welfare of the communities around coffee production areas. That is why we implement several education programs, as well as work toward the preservation of the environment, fauna, and diversity of the communities. We recently exported the education model we use in our rural areas to Vietnam, another large coffee producer. These are just some examples of the wide variety of programs the Federation engages with to support the communities and the families involved in the coffee industry.</p><h4>How would you assess the competitive level of the Colombian coffee industry?</h4><p>Over the past four years, we have incorporated over 550,000 hectares into production, which has resulted in a 30% rise in productivity. If we compared Colombia's circumstances and production to that of neighboring markets, we have considerably improved our competitive level, as neighboring markets have suffered from unfavorable climatic conditions and high vulnerability to disease. The three key phrases defining Colombia's coffee industry are: being a major supplier, a reliable one, and purveyor of a high-quality product.</p><h4>In your opinion, what are some of the key public measures that should be adopted to boost the development of the sector?</h4><p>The government has provided the right type of support to the industry in terms of market price fluctuations; they have offered direct subsidies to prices in 2013-2014 that totaled $1.2 billion. The government has also provided valuable support to small coffee producers. In addition, we conduct joint research with the state to better reach the rural areas of the country. For example, the Federation has over 1,500 extension agents who provide a direct link to conducting successful research in the field.</p><h4>How can the sector benefit from the several free trade agreements (FTAs) the country recently signed?</h4><p>We greatly value the FTAs in place, as the sector exports 95% of its current production. These FTAs offer us greater opportunities, and fewer bureaucratic and tax barriers to reach new markets and boost our competitiveness.</p><h4>What are your growth expectations for 2014 and 2015?</h4><p>So far, 2014 has been a very positive year, and we expect to close it at the same level as 2013; this amounts to 11.5 million bags of coffee. We believe we must continue increasing our productivity, as the high-quality segments of the market have shown interesting dynamism, and we believe we can increase our market share here; gourmet and high-quality coffee consumption grows every year at an average rate of 5% to 6%, and we are a significant part of this market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was dbJet's initial strategy when entering the Colombian market?<br></h4><p>We were founded in April 2012; however, that was after seven years of work. Our idea was to supply a service to the executive market. If you consider the amount of wasted time at airports in terms of money, you grasp the importance of the service we provide, such as our seat by demand service. By this, I mean that if you want to go to Medellí­n you just pay for the seat and fly without being concerned about the rest of the plane. For example, a trip to Medellí­n involves picking you up from wherever you are in a Volvo XC-90, delivering you directly to the aircraft, and flying you to your destination where another Volvo picks you up and takes you to your meeting; there are no reservations required. All you have to do is make a phone call. This way the flying time is your time. It also offers complete piece of mind in terms of combining time for your job and your personal life.</p><h4>How do you manage the logistics while providing your services at this impressive level of flexibility?</h4><p>We will ultimately have 40 aircraft. There will be five in Cartagena, five in Bogotá, five in Cali, five in Medellí­n, and so forth. We are creating an intelligent software suite with a company in San Francisco that will adjust to the travel patterns of executives in Colombia. The beauty of this is that when I have to move a plane it will not fly empty. We are going to be donating that time to foundations and NGOs so that people can travel anywhere in the country at no cost. Why not use that empty flight to help people?</p><h4>Do you provide services to destinations beyond Colombia?</h4><p>With the same format you will be able to fly to destinations abroad. Furthermore, once I have this format established in Colombia the idea is to sell the franchise to other countries and start the same idea around the world.</p><h4>What is the current state of your fleet, and how do you expect to expand it?</h4><p>We are about to receive 40 aircraft. There will be three Phenom 100s for local flights, and we will fly to Europe in a Gulfstream 280, which is a larger aircraft. In the future, the idea is to have over 450 employees, of whom more than 100 will be pilots. We also aim to realize 2,000 flights a month within Colombia.</p><h4>What do you think of the transport sector in Colombia in terms of competition?</h4><p>In our case, we do not have any. I do not foresee competition either in the commercial area or for cargo. Nor would I be in competition with charter planes because they charter the plane for a specific flight, and I will be taking care of most of the regions around the country. Our idea is also to serve the east of the country, which is drastically underserved.</p><h4>What are your average prices per flight?</h4><p>Medellí­n, our most requested route, would cost around Ps1.1 million per seat for a round trip. If you compare that with commercial airlines, you are just comparing the transportation part and not with an included stay in a hotel, for example. In our case you do not have to stay, you can return the same day. The price includes all office services at the airport as well. If you need such services you just plug in your computer, use the internet, send any documents you need to our printer at the airport, and when you get there the corrected papers are ready for you to go.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The construction sector grew 10.8% from January to September 2013. How would you assess the development of the sector regarding public infrastructure?<br></h4><p>We finished 1Q2013 on over 10% growth, with over 8% in 2Q2013, and a unique 24.8% in 3Q2013. These impressive figures made the construction sector the leading economic engine for the country during this period. By comparison, in 3Q2013, the second fastest sector in the Colombian economy was agriculture with over 6% growth. In this context, housing played a key role. Colombia generated attractive incentives for companies, ramped up investment, constructed over 100,000 free housing units, and employed 1.4 million workers in the sector. Our construction sector is now at the regional forefront, positively reducing unemployment. In fact, Colombia has generated the most employment in the region on a per-capita basis. During Pastrana's administration, the country built 280,000 housing units, while during Uribe's first administration it built 340,000, and in his second administration 560,000. With President Santos, we plan to end on 920,000. This represents an 80% increase compared to the previous government. In 2013 alone, we built 260,000 housing units, representing an all-time record for the country. This activity has not only contributed to the development of the construction sector, but to other related sectors, too.</p><h4>What are the government's plans regarding free housing?</h4><p>We have an integral housing strategy reaching all levels of society, especially the low-income segment, where informality is still high and poverty, although reduced, is still a major issue. Our government offers these people real possibilities to access the housing market through the free housing units program. In 2014, we will complete 60,000 housing units for this segment of the population.</p><h4>How would you assess the work being done to improve access to drinking water?</h4><p>We have implemented important investments in drinking water infrastructure and, today, thanks to our work, 4 million more Colombians have access to drinking water for the first time. Now, we need to further invest in rural aqueducts to increase access to drinking water, while also improving sewage systems across rural areas. That would also boost industrial activity in many areas and create more jobs.</p><h4>How well shielded is Colombia from a real estate bubble?</h4><p>We do not have such a deepening of the mortgage credit sector as, for example, Spain, which suffered from a real estate bubble. Our deepening of the mortgage credit sector stands at 5.1% of GDP, while in Spain it exceeds 50%. Also, Colombia enjoys excellent risk management standards as compared to other countries, and we do not give mortgages to those people who have to allocate more than 30% of their income. In addition, we only concede mortgages between 50% and 70% of the value of the property. We also have to mention that, in Colombia, we only construct housing projects when all the units have been sold. Additionally, Colombia's credit default level stands at 2% nowadays.</p><h4>Where would you say lie the best investment opportunities for foreign developers and constructors?</h4><p>The fact that both Colombian and foreign players compete at the same level is a clear tool that attracts foreign companies to the sector. That has led to a current scenario in which many foreign companies develop construction projects in our country. In fact, I think housing, port, and tourism construction are attractive sectors with great development potential.</p><p>What is the level of commitment of the Ministry to further generate employment opportunities in the sector?</p><p>In December 2013, we reached the a record level of employment in the sector, at 1.4 million people. If we take into consideration the 21 subsectors that benefited from the growth of the construction sector the figure rise. As investment continues to flow, and as transparency and formality levels continue to increase, so will employment opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What underpins the current strength of the Colombian real estate sector?<br></h4><p>Colombia has registered growth over the past decade that has generally come from civil works, namely construction. This economic growth has given the Colombian people purchasing power, whereby the demand for housing has grown.</p><h4>What leads you to believe that this is not just a real estate bubble?</h4><p>A real estate bubble usually occurs for reasons related to demand. The last real estate bubble in Colombia, in around the 1990s, stemmed from the money generated by the illegal drug trade that allowed properties to be acquired at any price. Today, there is no bubble because the source of the demand is from people who are actually buying housing for personal use. It is a rising standard of living that has led to robust demand. Meanwhile, major cities such as Bogotá, for example, today face a shortage of construction space, while high demand raises prices.</p><h4>In which areas of the country do you expect the greatest growth in real estate?</h4><p>The free trade agreements that Colombia has recently signed will boost the development of many sectors. For example, the Pacific Alliance will require more ports. There is considerable potential in road construction as well, and cities on the Atlantic Ocean like Barranquilla will see considerable development opportunities.</p><h4>What is the current function of CISA and what kind of solutions do you offer people in debt to the state?</h4><p>CISA was created in the 1970s as part of a major group called Banco Central Hipotecario. This group had three subsidiaries, one of which was CISA. The initial purpose was totally different, mainly because Banco Central Hipotecario underwent nationalization. The government takeover saw several years of dormancy for CISA. The financial universe of Colombia fell into a deep crisis between 1998 and 2000. At that time it was divided into the private and public sectors. The government created credit lines as a lifesaver for the private banks to survive the crisis and liquidated all state sector banks. The assets remaining from the official financial sector, were transferred to CISA. Its purpose was to move all of those assets, coming from debt or as goods, which CISA did for the first decade of the 21st century, recovering billions of pesos in the process. The government has also tasked CISA with the responsibility for moving all unproductive assets owned by the state, and handling outstanding debt, which is today limited in nature. We also receive real estate from various governmental entities, such as the Ministry of Trade. Accordingly, it transferred the free trade zones to us, including Barranquilla, Cartagena, Cali, Cúcuta, and Santa Marta. The purpose of CISA is not to own assets, but rather to monetize them and transfer the resulting revenue to the National Treasury.</p><h4>How does the state benefit from CISA's management?</h4><p>The benefits are huge, as we divert our energy to assets that create costs for the state. If you visit any city in Colombia, the local government has assets that it cannot monetize, and is therefore losing money. Our core function is to be a source of revenue for these entities. Money can be channelled wherever needed, and invested in such areas as education, infrastructure, or health. We have generated more than $5.5 billion for the state since inception. In 2013 alone we made deals for the state in the order of Ps0.5 billion, or $250 million. We are now also going to auctions, doing exactly the same thing as we do with the other assets. We help monetize idle assets, and those wishing to participate at auctions merely log into CISA for all information on our assets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Colombia represent for Impala's overall operations?<br></h4><p>Impala is expanding globally on every continent, and Latin America is no exception; Colombia and Brazil combined represent the largest market in the region, and as such we are convinced that our investments are going to change the pattern of the Colombian logistics business and help the country realize its full potential.</p><h4>Impala entered the Colombian market three years ago. How have your activities developed over this period?</h4><p>The government is open to transforming the sector by opening the door to investment, and is willing to sit down and discuss options with producers and potential investors, thus paving the way for promising opportunities for us. We found that the government was eager to receive substantial investments such as ours, and that producers were open to increasing their investment in production if a new and efficient mode of transportation was available to them. Once we had identified opportunities, we worked closely with the government to obtain the requisite licenses and permits. That completed, over the past two years we have been committed to constructing the port with operations set to commence in October 2014. It has been a rapid process that has benefited from collaboration among ourselves, our potential customers, and the government.</p><h4>You are investing $500 million in ports and terminals in the country. How will this impact your operations?</h4><p>The investment will allow us to offer an efficient and reliable multimodal transportation solution for Colombian industry. Our initial investment only envisaged a transportation alternative for the Caribbean; however, with our recent acquisition of a majority share in the Pacific Railway Concession (FDP), we have expanded our offer to cover both oceans, providing a truly integrated solution for the Colombian sector. We are now investing in a multimodal logistics solution for the Pacific, using the current FDP concession, and developing the infrastructure to offer transportation opportunities along the Magdalena River. All combined, the investment is worth more than $1 billion.</p><h4>What sectors will have the most potential for growth over the coming five years?</h4><p>Agriculture is set to see rapid growth in Colombia. The country has set its sights on becoming a major producer and exporter, and we can facilitate this because the terminal is located in the heart of the country and it is easy to transport by river or by road directly to a particular region. We see the importation of fertilizers and other materials needed by the sector as an excellent opportunity for us. The other type of cargo that we have recently found particularly attractive is what is known as specialized or project cargo.</p><h4>What is your transport capacity in Colombia?</h4><p>Impala's transportation infrastructure is already capable of moving 1.5 million tons of dry cargo and approximately 80,000 barrels of hydrocarbons per day. Our expansion plans involve moving a myriad of other types of cargo, in fact everything from grain to steel, coal, and clinker. Our equipment is more than ready to absorb this added capacity and meet our customers' demand.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of Impala in Colombia?</h4><p>Simply put, the strategy behind Impala's investment in Colombia is to develop and improve the country's competitive stance by gearing its strategic infrastructure toward simplifying the movement of goods, with a special focus on the export of hydrocarbons, coal, and other essential commodities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where did your story in the logistics market begin?<br></h4><p>I started as a delivery boy in one of Colombia's main packaging and forwarding companies. This experience gave me the opportunity to discover the wonders of this industry. Within three years, I reached the Department Manager position. After several further professional experiences, I decided to go solo with Pasar, a company that first started operating without industry licenses, working basically on commission for other freight-forwarding companies in the sector. In 1978, we officially started as a customs agency, and in these 35 years we have grown tremendously. For example, when we knew that FedEx wanted to enter the Colombian market in 1993, we applied for the representation rights, securing them. As a result, we represented FedEx in Colombia and Ecuador for 18 years. Only after that period, did it decide to launch its own official business activity. TNT, a leading company in the industry in Europe and some sectors in Asia and with activities in over 200 countries, is another example of our growth story, since it came to us based on our reputation and prestige, offering us its representative duties in the country. That was in 2011, and since then we have invested significantly to make sure we grab a significant piece of the market. At the moment, we own 4.5% of the market and expect to reach a 9% share within the next seven years.</p><h4>What have been the company's landmark achievements over these 35 years?</h4><p>The main one has been to get to know, in detail, the Colombian market, as well as entering neighbouring markets such as Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. In this context, we have managed to consolidate our business activity and become a rather reputable international logistics and freight-forwarding company in Colombia. We have expanded the size of our operations to reach customs, storage facilities, fast packaging, road transportation, also within ports to facilitate the transportation of goods from and to Bogotá, express packaging, and air transport. Overall, we have become a provider of fully integrated logistics services in the country and the region, with good prospects to grow more on the international stage.</p><h4>Who are Pasar's main clients?</h4><p>We have a broad customer portfolio that includes corporate clients, manufacturers, industry-related companies, and clients from sectors including pharmaceuticals and commerce. Also, we are deeply involved in online commerce and the delivery of online purchased goods. This latter section enables us to better reach individual clients. According to the figures, in the corporate segment alone we have more than 4,000 clients, whereas in terms of individuals, this figure exceeds 10,000.</p><h4>How would you characterize competition in the Colombian logistics industry?</h4><p>Competition is rather strong in our sector in Colombia. Despite the fact that we are not an active player in the domestic market, I can say that Servientrega is a leading actor. We compete in the international market from Colombia, and TNT has strong competition in that segment. Our strength is to be able to offer competitive advantages to our clients. For example, we have better transit times and more flexibility than many other players in the industry. We have the strength of being an international company with domestic flexibility. However, we have to keep in mind that we are a rather new player in the sector, having entered the market two years ago with TNT.</p><h4>What are the company's main goals for 2014?</h4><p>We expect to reach over a 5% market share due to our hard-working sales force and by offering added value to our clients. We have vast experience of working under pressure and in line with international standards. Additionally, TNT is also undergoing an international campaign to further improve its services, and I believe we will manage to sustain growth in this demanding sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How committed is the Colombian business sector to the peace and reintegration processes?<br></h4><p>Expectations are high for a lasting peace agreement for the whole country. In this context, the defense industry is highly committed to the peace process and the transition period that will follow it. Such a commitment is palpable not only in the main urban areas of the country, but also in rural Colombia. We are all focused on one common goal; to build a peaceful society in Colombia.</p><h4>How did the launch of the ARC Golfo de Tribugá, COTECMAR's first amphibious landing ship, contribute to the country's security?</h4><p>This kind of ship is the culmination of a learning process that began over 15 years ago to strengthen the defense of the country. Over the past 10 years, we have been producing different types of maritime and riverine equipment that have taken advantage of, and improved, our level of technology and know-how. This Colombian Navy ship has unique technology and is envisaged to provide support in security and defense activities, as well as humanitarian aid and cargo transportation.</p><h4>How would you assess the first stage of the implementation of COTECMAR's methodology and strategy regarding offshore protection?</h4><p>The first stage of our strategy ended in 2014 and the goals achieved are important; we have provided the support and solutions to all operational activities of the Colombian Navy. For example, we have modernized all warships and boosted their capacities. We have also become an exporter of maritime technology and equipment to other armed forces, in particular to Brazil. We have talked about the Amazon Patrol Ship project to develop vessels to protect the common Amazon rainforest area. The goal is to develop the design of this Patrol Ship in 2014. As for future prospects, we will change our plans to correspond with the new Presidential Cycle starting in August 2014. However, we can presume that the main strategy will target a further level of connectivity within the country through its rivers.</p><h4>What are the main guidelines of The Colombian Navy Development Plan for 2030 and what is COTECMAR's role in this?</h4><p>In our country's current situation we envisage the incorporation of new capacities in terms of vessels for the Coast Guard, for example Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV) and Coastal Patrol Vessels (CPV), and also the well known Riverine Support Patrol Vessels (RSPV) and High-Speed Patrol Boats (LPR) for the Colombian Marine Corps. COTECMAR will provide its integrated solutions to complete these projects.  We are also focusing on the replacement of Colombia's current frigate fleet with local technology developed by COTECMAR.</p><h4>What role does the relationship between universities and COTECMAR play in your overall R&amp;D strategy?</h4><p>The ARC “Golfo de Tribugá" vessel is the perfect example of collaboration between the higher education sector and ourselves; it was the result of the thesis project of two naval engineering students in a leading maritime academy in Colombia, Escuela Naval de Cadetes Almirante Padilla. This is just an example, because we also collaborate closely with Colciencias and other centers of higher education. There are three universities behind the establishment of COTECMAR; Universidad Nacional de Colombia and two private ones: the Universidad del Norte (Barranquilla) and Universidad Tecnológica de Bolivar (Cartagena).</p><h4>What is the current size of COTECMAR?</h4><p>The past few years have been active as we introduced innovation of the highest standards to the Colombian Navy, which has been part of the government's main strategy. Between 2008 and 2013, we carried out the Orion Plan, which enabled us to double the size of our operations; last year we had more than 1,250 direct employees. Other sectors have also benefited from our increased activity, because the vessels we produce are like small cities and we require many different providers. COTECMAR's turnover in 2013 reached Ps200 trillion. Right now, we are undergoing a transition process, and while we wait for the government's new four-year development plan, we are also looking to open new markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Cali and the Cauca Valley rank among the leading industrial and economic areas of Latin America?<br></h4><p>Improved road infrastructure and the expansion of the Pacific Alliance are two crucial elements for the continued development of the region. Cali needs to complete, among other infrastructural requirements, the highway to Buenaventura, as well as build the connecting railway between these two cities to become a more competitive city. Today, in some cases it costs more to transport a ton of any product from Cali to Buenaventura than to transport that product from Buenaventura to its final destination. Additionally, I think we need to make the region's ports much more competitive. In this context, the Buenaventura Port, which handles the greatest volume of import/export goods in Colombia, needs to become more efficient. The government needs to tackle the current level of underdevelopment that affects the Pacific coast. Essentially, Colombia has to realize that to fully take advantage of its position on the Pacific coast; it must boost development in the region.</p><h4>How has Ingenio Providencia developed its operations over the years?</h4><p>The company was founded in 1926 and Modesto Cabal Calindo was the main developer behind it. He also set up two additional sugar refineries, one now defunct. Ingenio Providencia has had one idea in mind; growth. We have always applied this concept to all areas in which we saw business opportunities, diversifying revenue sources. This has elevated us to among the leading companies in the sugar industry. Furthermore, we have always been a pioneering company; for example, we were pioneers in the production of ethanol and electric energy co-generation. Today, we sell 50% of the energy we produce, which is surplus and hence of greater benefit to the national grid. We are also the sole producer of organic sugar in Colombia. Today, around 42% of our income stems from diversification, while just few years ago our entire revenue stream came from the production and commercialization of sugar.</p><h4>How did the company perform in 2013 and what are your expectations for the sector in 2014?</h4><p>Climatic conditions affect the entire agricultural sector, and the sugar industry is no stranger to this. Production last year was badly affected by the weather conditions of the past two years' winters, namely due to heavy rains. For example, we lost almost 3,000 hectares of sugar cane crops to floods, which dented production. For this reason, we saw a marked decrease in both production and income during 1Q2013. Our expectations for 2014 include grinding 3 million tons of sugar cane, which would mark an important rise from the 2.847 million tons of the previous year.</p><h4>What efforts are being made to discover new varieties of crop within the sugar industry?</h4><p>Lacking additional land for regional growth, we need to boost production productivity within the current area, in other words, to produce more sugar cane per hectare. This is only achievable by cultivating new varieties of sugar cane, such as those being researched at the Sugar Cane Research Center. Cultivating specific agricultural crops in accordance with the area and soil in question is another way, as well as applying Farmer Precision Technology to achieve higher production levels per hectare.</p><h4>How has the company diversified its business activity over the years and what is your growth strategy?</h4><p>One of our chief successes as a company has indeed been the diversification of business activity and the establishment of our new electric energy co-generation plant. The plant had an initial investment of around $55 million and a production capacity of around 40MW/hour. It has enabled us to meet our energy needs and sell surplus production (around 50%) to the national grid, generating extra revenue for the company in the process. We also established a new ethanol production plant with a capacity of 300,000 liters/day. Our key objective is to offer our clients the highest quality products in compliance with environmental protection requirements. This has enabled us to successfully meet the needs of even the most demanding clients with the most competitive prices in the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the focus of Unifianza over the past year?<br></h4><p>We have worked over the past year to educate people about the rental market. We publish rental studies every four months and release statistics to show people how the real estate market is developing and functioning, how rentals are performing, what the yield is, and where real estate investment in Bogotá is more attractive. In Medellí­n, as well as in Barranquilla, we are studying the rental market, so the information we send to potential clients includes three of the most important cities.</p><h4>What do you expect from 2014?</h4><p>Many developers from Bogotá are looking to alternative destinations, and the construction sectors in Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cali, and even Medellí­n are huge. Construction of real estate projects in those cities is on the rise, and Bogotá is going to face less supply, especially in social housing. This is directly influencing developments in 2014. Many find housing prices high in Bogotá; this leads to speculation that prices sill shortly decline. Yet this is not our view. When you have supply with demand, the demand absorbs it, and prices remain unchanged. We predict that over the next couple of years, housing supply for medium- and high-income families will exceed demand. In Colombia, the real estate market plays a key role in our economy. It is dynamic and has been growing consistently. There were years during which the annual appreciation rate was between 8% and 10%, while now it is nearer 6% to 8%.</p><h4>What functions does Unifianza perform?</h4><p>We work mainly with real estate agents and companies, and warranty tenant rent defaults. Management property in Colombia is different from other countries in Latin America; it is big business for real estate companies. They manage the property for the owner and warrant that their investment is going to grow through the years. In Colombia, the real estate companies are the lessors of the property, not the owners. If there is a problem with the lease contract and rent is not paid, the real estate company sends a report informing us about it, which takes place three days after the first month of non-payment. Next, we send a letter. After that, the lawyers start calling, and finally we go to the Chamber of Commerce. Thus, the owner relies on us to ensure that rent is paid, and the real estate investment is protected. Our services also include warranty for rents, maintenance, water, telephone, and electricity provision, and we pay for any damage if the tenant is responsible.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the latest advancements in the Colombian cultural sphere?<br></h4><p>There have been many; for example, we have taken decisive steps toward the development of the cinema industry after the adoption of a new law. Before the adoption of this law, we had legislation that set the establishment of a mutual fund to boost Colombian productions, and that worked out very well. Thanks to that fund, the Colombian cinema industry produced 53 films. The establishment of that fund more than 10 years ago gave the industry valuable economic resources totaling Ps60 billion, providing the cinema industry with a much-needed boost. When we started promoting our productions worldwide, it occurred to us that we needed to implement a law on incentives for the cinema industry. The ideas behind this new law were to attract foreign productions to the diversity of Colombia, to strengthen our local cinema industry through strategic partnerships between it and foreign partners, and, finally, to promote our country through cinema. The law stipulates that if someone decides to come to Colombia to shoot a movie, or part of one, we will return 40% of the investment directly related to production expenses, plus 20% of the logistics expenses, such as flight tickets, accommodation, and so on. We have already started receiving interest from foreign productions to come to Colombia, and we have an initial fund budget of around Ps25 billion ($12.5 million). We expect to give the green light to at least five productions within this business model. Another relevant law that we have recently implemented is the so-called “Public Show Law." The performing arts had a massive tax burden that made it almost impossible to remain in the loop, and it was not really encouraging the arrival of major foreign stars, due to the 33% income tax they had to pay when visiting the country. We removed a lot of this burden by reducing it to 8%, and we have already managed to attract big names, such as Paul McCartney, Madonna, and Beyoncé, while reducing tax evasion within the sector and increasing formality levels.</p><h4>What are the main strategic actions that the Ministry carries out at the international level to promote Colombian culture?</h4><p>Although Colombia is a rather young player in the cultural sector, little by little, we are creating public policies and strategies to strengthen ourselves. We put a lot of effort on intangible heritage, as Colombia is a rich country in this regard. We aim to preserve and promote that. For example, nine of our cultural traditions and indigenous heritages have already been named in UNESCO's World Heritage list. This is a great way for the world to get to know our wonderful country better, and for us to preserve and promote our rich demographic and cultural diversity. We are the first government that is actively promoting traditional cuisine through public policies. Additionally, another of our main priorities is literature and reading. We believe that, through knowledge, we can reduce social gaps in Colombia. For example, in the next four years, we will build 100 new public libraries. Also, we want to motivate children aged around five-to-seven years old to take up reading as a hobby, because we believe this is the best age to should take up the habit of reading for pleasure. These are just two examples of the strategies implemented within the nationwide plan, called “Reading is My Story." Overall, we have over 1,400 public libraries, and we are boosting technology levels as well by providing internet access and computers to all public libraries in order to increase technology literacy among Colombians. Additionally, we have increased economic resources for these public libraries to have all the latest books from international authors, as well as subscriptions to newspapers and magazines. All in all, 32% of our budget goes to this particular project to increase reading habits among Colombian children, as we believe we can achieve great social goals through such an intensive program. We have also signed an agreement with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which granted us $3.2 million to become a pilot country to increase connectivity and technology literacy among workers in public libraries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As of today, Nigeria has over 70 health maintenance organizations (HMOs) spread across the country. How do you see this number evolving in the future?</h4><p>I see consolidation on the horizon. Within the existing regulations, the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) has pursued a reaccreditation of the HMOs to look at their minimum requirements to operate. The foremost requirement is that HMOs that are operating in all states and geo-political zones of the country (called national HMOs) should have a minimum capital of NGN400 million, slightly above $2 million. The deadline for the HMOs to meet the requirements was August 31, 2014. This criterion is one thing that could bring about a lot of consolidation in the form of HMO mergers and acquisitions. With this consolidation happening, the number of HMOs will come down from the present 77 and the remaining players will be financially stronger. Something similar just happened here in the banking sector; it has also happened in the insurance sector. Another reason why I feel it will happen and the health insurance industry will become strengthened is that there is a National Health Insurance Commission Act that has been passed by the parliament and the senate. It is now waiting to be signed by the president. Once that is enacted then the NHIS will no longer be the NHIS in its current form. It will be repealed and this new act will come into play, which will be more like the National Insurance Commission (NIC). It will be called the National Health Insurance Commission. The commission will have a number of members; there will be a commissioner and an executive council with other members. There will be nominees from the NIC and from the Central Bank of Nigeria. It will be a financial cum healthcare regulator in practice. Look at the case of Tanzania, for example. There, health insurance is regulated as just another insurance company. There are a lot of drawbacks because of this, and that sector cannot grow. It is just a tiny portion of the insurance business. But here, one great thing is that it is regulated separately. The healthcare providers (the hospitals) are a critical player in the healthcare segment, and any regulation of health insurance without a correlated regulation of the healthcare providers will not bring about the desired outcomes in the healthcare sector of the country. That is one of the most positive things about Nigeria relative to some other African countries. And so, it has its own strengths, and I would say that the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. You only need people with the skill and the will to execute the model.</p><h4>What is Hygeia HMO's customer segment? Do you see any other market in the population potentially in need of your services?</h4><p>The market has different segments. One is employees in the formal sector. It is easy to identify them. Naturally, the client is the employer because in this case they are the ones paying for it. That is one of the factors that has contributed to the growth of health insurance in Nigeria and even in other African countries. In India, for example, it does not happen that way. Employers do not even pay for their employees' healthcare except in very few companies or industries. In our case, what we normally do is differentiate employers by size in terms of the number of employees, because for us the size of the employer is what matters. That is not in terms of revenue or profitability, it is in terms of number of employees. We operate today in segments where there are at least 10 employees. There are multiple definitions for SMEs, but this is what we do. From 10 up to 50 employees is an SME. We have plans for them. Then we have differentiated that into various levels. Up to 200 or so is “corporate" and up to 500 is “large corporate." The idea is to have structured pricing and product packaging depending on the level of the client. We have clients with more than 65,000 enrollees also. We only do SME and corporate business today. But as far as the needs of the nation are concerned, or the potential of the market is concerned, we must bear in mind that the majority of the population is not formally employed or they are employed in organizations with three or four employees. It is the people who are either employed in the informal sector or on their own, in SMEs, who are looking for coverage for themselves and their families, or themselves and their two or three employees. That is the next market. Reaching out to them is the biggest challenge. Customer retention in this segment is also a problem. If they do not feel that there is value for the money they are spending, they will not renew the next time. At the end of this year we will venture into the SME sector for the high-end market. The mid and low segments will follow. We will not venture into the lowest segment of the market, as our not-for-profit venture called Hygeia Community Health Care (HCHC) is handling that segment of the market.</p><h4>Do you foresee coming up with any special plans to serve these sub-segments of the market??</h4><p>Yes. Today we have HyEssential Plus, HyPriority Plus, HyClassic Plus, and HyPrestige Plus. Our vision is to be fully up to international standards. All of our existing plans only cover domestic care. You are not up to international standards if you do not provide coverage outside of Nigeria, because there is care that is not available in Nigeria. Providing coverage outside of Nigeria is part of the strategy. We will be venturing into that direction this year. Hygeia is the strongest brand in this business in the country, and we will be building strategic partnerships with the strongest international brands. That will be the stepping-stone for us to start venturing into the SME segment and the retail segment in a big way. When we start that, by the end of 2015, we will venture into the next segment down. So by the end of third year we will be fully into retail. This year we are investing in technology and building the capability to support the business ambitions I just mentioned.</p><div class="quote">“I see consolidation on the horizon."</div><h4>How can the country hit the Universal Health Coverage goals for 2015 and provide 30% of Nigerians with health coverage?</h4><p>There are a lot of things changing. The regulators are working very hard to achieve change. The players in the market also feel that they have a duty to the nation to make this possible. Yes, the margins might be low, but the numbers are huge. Even if you are able to give people the most basic primary care coverage, don't you think that you are adding value to their lives? I think we need to look at it that way. If you find a person who is not able to have three square meals a day, and you say that you will not give him something unless you have the resources to give him three meals, then you are living in an idealistic world. Give him half a meal and he will be better off than he was. Make tomorrow a better day. There is no “best day." Maybe the 2015 deadline is ambitious, but I'm positive about it.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[foreword-to-the-business-year-dubai-2014]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In recent decades, the UAE has become a recognized leader regionally, and across the wider Middle East. The great progress of our cities is admired worldwide and held as a model for pro-active vision. This year, in particular, has seen the nation take significant steps forward on the path to playing a major role beyond the MENA region, in the global economy and society. In taking a leadership role across several frontiers, the UAE has remained true to its aspirations since the establishment of the Federation by our Founder President, the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan. The leadership and directives of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, continue to inspire the nation to look beyond the immediate to paint a canvas of exhilarating possibilities. Needless to say, much of the country's achievement must be attributed to the energy, creativity, courage, and commitment of our people—all of which have propelled us into a new era that will script new pages in our history books, of new beginnings.</p><p>It is the extraordinary and collective efforts of our people that have contributed to Dubai's success in being awarded the Expo 2020 this year by the 168-country members of the Bureau of International Expositions in Paris. Expo 2020 will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the UAE. Our theme for Expo 2020—Connecting Minds, Creating the Future—concisely sums up the UAE's strategic objectives as a country, and our positive contributions to the people of the world. Dubai took another bold step in declaring its intent to shape the Emirate as the “global capital" of Islamic industry, economy, and finance. A date has been set to achieve this intent—three years from now. And, to help translate the aspiration by 2018, the Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre (DIEDC) has been created with a mandate to guide partnerships between public and private sector entities engaged in this key domain. Even as we dream big, we remain cautious. We continue to adopt a prudent approach with regards to fiscal policies in our priority to ensure a secure tomorrow for the UAE's people. In our determination to excel today and in our ambition to carry the success of our efforts well into the future, we are aware that we need to empower future generations with the skill, will, and motivation to perform. Guided by this conviction, we are working to build the best functional government and enabling education system befitting a 21st century destination country. As part of this priority, the UAE has announced its participation in the launch of a space expedition to Mars. We are indeed proud that we are the first Arab country to join a select group of eight other countries in the important scientific exploration of interplanetary space. Our unrivaled efforts towards technological advancement resulted in the launch of a two-year Smart Government Initiative earlier this year. The program has been designed to facilitate interaction with government offices through simplified applications on smart phones and tablet devices. Through m-Government, we now reach our people instead of their having to reach us, making their lives easier. With programs going back more than a decade, the UAE is currently ranked number one in the MENA region and second in the world in the Government Usage of ICT Index, released by the World Economic Forum. From being ranked the happiest country in the Arab world and securing 14th place, ahead of the US, Germany, and the UK according to a recent United Nations report to enhancing our record of sustainable initiatives and transparency, the country is today poised on a growth trajectory that is anticipated to attract more distinctions and stun the world. The run-up to the Dubai Expo 2020, and the ambitious strategic plans unveiled by individual emirates, as well as the Federation at large are certain to help the UAE repeat a feat that we have routinely accomplished throughout our illustrious history—to be the best.</p><div class="quote">“Expo 2020 will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the UAE."</div><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, the tourism industry in Colombia will grow by around 6.2% in 2014. What is your view on the development of the sector?<br></h4><p>Colombia is one of the most emergent and promising markets in the tourism industry, which the government is perfectly aware of. The main objective of the national government is to attract 4 million visitors by 2015, with one million in Bogotá alone. Today, 52% of all tourists in Colombia visit the capital. For example, we are only five hours away from both New York and Sío Paulo. Meanwhile, Bogotá has also positioned itself well in the MICE tourism sector, consolidating itself as the primary destination of many tourists and businessmen when arriving to Colombia. The city follows a similar strategy as that of the national government when it comes to tourism, with diversification being a key consideration. We want people to stay beyond the working week, and enjoy a weekend too.</p><h4>What strategies do you implement to diversify tourism activity in Bogotá?</h4><p>We have an ambitious international promotion strategy, appreciating the importance of promoting Bogotá internationally. We have a budget of Ps18 billion for promotion and media advertising. We also plan to participate in all the main fairs and tourism events such as the Proexport fairs. Thus, our main efforts go toward internationally promoting the Bogotá brand, making this destination attractive beyond the MICE segment.</p><h4>How would you assess the image of Bogotá within the international community?</h4><p>Bogotá has positively changed its image abroad thanks to efforts to bolster security. Today, we have the lowest crime rate of the past 30 years. In this context, we know that such efforts increase the attractiveness of Bogotá as a tourism destination. We have also developed segment-specific strategies to boost the image of Bogotá as a tourism destination. For example, we doubled efforts to better promote the city's history and areas like La Candelaria, also improving lighting, tourism signs, and guides. We have increased the number of Touristic Information Points (PIT). We are basically talking here about efforts to be better prepared to receive visitors. Interestingly, we have also prioritized the promotion of the rural area of Bogotá. Around 70% of Bogota's surrounding area is rural, which is something few people know. We already have touristic routes around some of these areas, focused of showing visitors local agricultural and rural processes. We mainly showcase agritourism, and have conducted research to identify the key ecological areas for the citizens of Bogotá. We are set to start offering tourism packages around the seven most voted-on areas, so that visitors can see those areas local people value the most. Other segments we strongly focus on are cultural, gastronomic, and religious tourism.</p><h4>Since you were recently appointed, how can your professional background benefit the further development of the institution?</h4><p>The institution has highly qualified professionals. My area of expertise is strategic management, and I was appointed for that reason. In the past, the IDT lacked a better articulation within the institution and with other tourism agents. The idea to better promote Bogotá requires a joint effort from all parties involved in the process. My main duties will be to internally articulate the institution and improve ties with other tourism agents. We see great potential in Bogotá as a language learning destination. The pronunciation of people in this part of Colombia is perhaps the most neutral in South America. We need to better articulate partnerships with universities to jointly achieve a better positioning of the city within this segment. In this context, one of the main challenges ahead has to do with your previous question; we need to increase efforts to show how much Bogotá has changed over the past decade, as the international community still holds to old stereotypes about our city and country, especially when it comes to security issues. We also work toward training local people to facilitate the transmission of tourist information to visitors. These opportunities also encompass taxi drivers, 3,500 of whom have received training to date.</p><h4>What are the principle countries of origin of Bogotá's visitors?</h4><p>Around 29% of visitors come from North America. There are also many visitors from Venezuela, though over the past few years, the number of Venezuelans visiting Colombia has decreased due to the political issues there. Spain (9%), and Ecuador (5%), are two of the main countries of origin. Our future efforts will be directed to Latin American countries, particularly Mexico and Argentina. Looking into other regions, we will also focus on directing efforts at Europe, for example Portugal, the UK, and Asia. We recently confirmed around 30,000 reservations from Portugal for 2H2014. Asia is a destination that we jointly target within our Pacific Alliance efforts. Let me add too, that we have a Tourism Observatory, a body conducting research into tourism movements and the reasons why people visit Colombia. The results of this research have enabled us to better position new touristic products and campaigns. We will also increase efforts to better promote sports tourism, especially regarding golf activities, as Bogotá features unique golf courses, as well as tennis courts aplenty.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2013, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurrí­a formally launched Colombia's accession process with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, and Colombia has surpassed Mexico in FDI receipts, ranking only behind Brazil and Chile. In this context, what is the outlook for the Colombian economy?<br></h4><p>Our perception is that Colombia will see a continued increase in FDI over the coming years if it continues to focus on two of the pillars that attract it, namely improved infrastructure and a modernized public administration. It is also crucial for growth to maintain government transparency, while taking measures to ensure public security. Meanwhile the OECD's invitation confirms that Colombia is advancing in the right direction. Foreign investment has helped change the world's perception of the country, which is the first step toward generating confidence among international markets. Furthermore, Colombia is playing a key role in the Pacific Alliance, an interesting and dynamic Latin American integration process, which was officially launched as a trading group in June 2012 at a presidential summit in Chile. It currently brings together Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, and is set to include Costa Rica, Panama, and Guatemala in due course. AYESA has headquarters and strategic projects in all Pacific Alliance member states. At AYESA, we perceive this opportunity as a testing ground for key projects that can be replicated throughout all current member nations of the alliance and in those that may join in the future.</p><h4>From its subsidiary in Bogotá, AYESA provides coverage in areas such as civil engineering, water and environmental engineering, oil and gas engineering, and telecommunications consulting. How has AYESA been consolidating its leading position in engineering consultancy?</h4><p>Public entities are being modernized and the government is supporting this modernization, providing the necessary legislation. Compared to other local and foreign companies, AYESA provides tools that already incorporate much of the requirements of this new legislation, and is well-versed in the necessary steps an organization must take to adapt, and perhaps more importantly, those to be avoided. This experience is embodied in the strategic projects that we are developing in Latin America and in the references of satisfied clients. We have found that this combination is highly appreciated by our customers in Latin America, and look forward to contributing our know-how to this modernization process.</p><h4>The Bogotá Capital District government awarded AYESA a contract for the auditing of advanced basic engineering studies of the city's first subway line. What does AYESA's advice entail?</h4><p>AYESA audited the technical design for Line 1 of Bogotá's underground metropolitan railway, which consists of overseeing, coordinating, and ultimately controlling the project for the contracting entity. Having accumulated invaluable experience in design, construction, and the auditing of subway lines in cities as diverse as Seville, Barcelona, Malaga, New Delhi, Warsaw, and Mexico City, we are supremely positioned to implement such schemes. We were also selected by the government of Panama to oversee the design, construction, and commissioning of Line 1 of Panama City's metro system. This project allows us to present a more dynamic profile of AYESA, where we combine the services offered by our civil engineering wing with those of our technology wing; this is probably our definitive differentiator among our competitors. Few companies can offer a turnkey product if they lack strength in these two areas. This added value is what has made project implementation possible within such a short space of time.</p><h4>What are AYESA's prospects for growth in Latin America and your priority markets?</h4><p>AYESA has been present in Latin America for over a decade, with operations in Mexico, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Brazil, and we are conducting market research in at least three other countries. The company's unequivocal focus on Latin America is on achieving sustainable growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Claro's milestones over the 2012-2013 period?<br></h4><p>We have been working toward the integration of systems and networks, both fixed and mobile, in order to be able to move forward into convergence services. This requires some time, but we will soon see that come to fruition. The other milestone for us is 4G. After much discussion regarding Claro's participation in the 4G auction, the issue was resolved and we became one of the main players in the ICT arena, offering 4G services to our customers. These are the two emblematic elements in terms of innovation within the ICT industry at the present time.</p><h4>What is unique about Colombian customers?</h4><p>Colombia in general has been slow in implementing new technologies, but once it starts, it happens very quickly. With the mobile market, innovation started in 1994, five or six years later than the average Latin American country, but it still reached 100% penetration very quickly, probably faster than other markets in the region. Another good example is represented by computer usage; many companies are looking at Colombia as a growing market at this point in time because it is taking off really fast, and this is not confined to computers alone, but essentially applies to any other service. In addition, I consider Colombian consumers to be highly price sensitive. For example, mobile rates are probably the lowest in the region and perhaps the world. The average price per minute rate in Colombia is about $0.06, while Claro's is probably about $0.045. Colombians talk a lot, almost twice as much as other Latin Americans. They talk about 210 minutes a month, while an Argentinian speaks closer to 130 minutes per month.</p><h4>Can you talk about Claro's Wi-Fi hotspots?</h4><p>We are expanding our Wi-Fi coverage with the idea of being able to complement the two networks, to funnel traffic from the wireless side into the wired side, and to use that capacity throughout the country. Given the restrictions we have on the deployment of infrastructure, this task is something that is not under our control in terms of managing traffic from the two networks.</p><h4>Which areas of the IT sector have more potential for growth?</h4><p>Broadband, as well as data services, remain our growth drivers. Today, for example, we have 250 municipalities covered by cable. About 80% of that is already bi-directional, which allows you to provide not only TV, but also all other services as well. It is clear that huge investments will be necessary, provided that we can resolve the instability that we are seeing today. I believe the cloud will be the engine because I think companies will very quickly start offloading all the things that actually bring down companies—things that are outside of their core business.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the ICT sector in Colombia for 2014, and for the role of Claro in it?</h4><p>For the ICT sector, it is clearly a year for investment and 4G will be the key driver of that with many companies testing different business models. In keeping with our present business model of offering mobility to Colombians, Claro's future plans will be no different from the past. We are reinvesting about 70% of our profits year after year and Claro is a large corporation compared to the size of the country, so the amount of investment is remarkable. The other area of focus will be the customer service area, which we are working to improve. We want to make sure people get the answers and have the services they need. This is a challenge, but we are investing in many new points of sale, customer service centers, and call centers, as well as in diverse channels to become better on that front.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Plaza Mayor is both nationally and regionally recognized as one of the leading conference centers. What is the secret behind this reputation?<br></h4><p>Plaza Mayor has 40 years of experience in the market, and we have worked from day one toward making Colombia and Medellí­n internationally recognized. Our success is based on providing our clients with what they need to conduct business; we are a business platform as opposed to a conference center. However, we do not simply conduct business transactions at Plaza Mayor, we build long-term relationships. This sustainable approach is a central factor in our success.</p><h4>What strategy is Plaza Mayor implementing to raise awareness of its activity and of Medellí­n abroad?</h4><p>We have an aggressive trade agenda beyond Medellí­n and Colombia. For example, in 2013 we visited 16 countries to promote Colombia, Medellí­n and, of course, Plaza Mayor. We visit countries that seek business opportunities in Latin America, especially in Colombia, and take time to talk to the players in each economic sector. Currently, we are working diligently to establish lasting trade ties with Spain, Italy, France, Germany, China, the Middle East, India, and Switzerland, which is the second biggest buyer of exports from the Antioquia region. 14.9% of Antioquia's exports are destined for Switzerland. The mining industry is also playing a key role in the expansion of the region's economy and in our strategy of building durable ties with other countries.</p><h4>What is the strategy behind the “City Marketing" campaign?</h4><p>The idea is to brand the city, and associate its name in the collective consciousness with a particular field. For example, if I say cinema, which city comes to your mind first? Los Angeles, and perhaps Cannes. We think of New York and Tokyo when I say stock exchange. What comes to your mind if I say Medellí­n? Nothing, which means that we have work to do to internationalize the city's name. Research suggests that Medellí­n is becoming increasingly known for its innovation, so we intend to develop this idea and establish our city internationally, making it more attractive to investors.</p><h4>How would you assess Colombia's potential in the film industry?</h4><p>Our strategy in terms of city marketing is to make Medellí­n known for one idea, while simultaneously strengthening other potential sectors. Colombian soap operas are currently very popular worldwide, but they depict stereotypes and an anachronistic image of Colombia. For example, around 50% to 60% of inquiries we receive are due to the information viewers receive from soap operas. To counter this, we are implementing an active strategy to balance the impression of Medellí­n internationally by showing a positive, modern image of the city. We aim to develop closer ties with Hollywood, Bollywood, and certain European cinema industries to strengthen our local industry, improve our visibility, and learn from their experience. Such a strategy will also help us position our brand and promote our culture worldwide, giving Colombia the opportunity to inspire others. In addition, the cinema industry can be a successful tourism attraction and should increase the number of visitors.</p><h4>What main events does Plaza Mayor plan to organize in the near future?</h4><p>We have two ministerial summits coming up in the next few months, namely the Inter-American Conference of Ministers of Labor and the American Summit for Ministers of Defense. Additionally, we will host the first Security Summit of the Organization of American States (OAS) outside Washington, as well as the International Urban Forum, and further down the road we will work on hosting the International Tourism Assembly, an event that will welcome tourism entrepreneurs from over 150 countries.</p><h4>What are the company's plans for 2014 and beyond?</h4><p>We find ourselves in a solid position regarding relations with the government and its ministries when negotiating contracts. We are the official event organizer for the Ministry of Education, Information and Communication Technologies, among many other public institutions, and are particularly active when it comes to internationally-oriented activities. We have over 250 employees, and we create an average of 25,000 indirect jobs. In 2013 we organized over 1,250 events.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In May 2013, the 12 Colombian banks reported a profit of Ps2.49 trillion, while in the same period of 2012 that figure was Ps2.17 trillion. What lies behind Colombia's banking strength nowadays?<br></h4><p>The Colombian banking system has a highly efficient regulatory framework that has allowed the optimization of the bank's role in society. Colombia suffered from a severe financial crisis in the late 1990s, which led to reforms in the regulatory organ of the financial system, bailing out many banks and establishing more efficient regulation. The country also improved the monitoring and supervision of financial institutions operating in the country and the market itself. Today, we have a very robust financial system in terms of the supervision and monitoring of banking activity. Additionally, the Colombian economy has been steadily growing for the past 12 years, and keeping in mind that Colombia has a robust domestic market, the country is in a good position to overcome possible adverse economic situations. Besides, confidence in the country has increased significantly, and this has boosted both domestic and foreign investment. Therefore, the current situation of the banking system in Colombia is due to the efficiency and the favorable economic conditions the country enjoys.</p><h4>What strategies has the banking sector implemented to boost banking penetration in remote areas of Colombia?</h4><p>The country has over 70% of its population concentrated around urban areas, and 52% of these people live in either large or medium to large cities. Therefore, banking services and activities focus on these areas, where people tend to have regular and stable income, as well as proven credit quality. In this context, rural Colombia has some of the worst social development indicators, such as increased poverty and low banking penetration. Banking intermediation costs are high and reaching these areas is, in many cases, not profitable at all for banks. However, there have been some policies to reduce these costs from the government. As per Banco Agrario de Colombia, we have 742 bank branches and 6,400 banking correspondents. We are a banking institution with a presence in areas where no other banks can be found, such as rural Colombia. We have 500 branches located in towns where there are no other banks.</p><h4>What other strategies do you have lined up to raise banking penetration in Colombia?</h4><p>We have an ambitious plan to open 1 million Banagraritos accounts, in which we will bring banking services closer to children, whilst teaching them the benefits of having a financial history in the future. We would like to boost the savings culture among children in rural areas, as they are the future of the country. We also want to develop a program for teenagers aged 18 and over providing access to financial services, and creating special conditions for them to access to their first credit. Banco Agrario will play a major role in the post-conflict period in Colombia. The bank has a presence in 720 municipalities, and in over 500 of which we are the only financial institution operating.</p><h4>How has the bank contributed to the government's plan to address the national housing shortage?</h4><p>Estimates show that there is a shortage of 1.9 million housing units in urban areas of the country, whereas in rural Colombia, this figure climbs up to 2.3 million. The government has implemented policies and plans at both the urban and rural level. Our institution, using funds provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, manages the plan at the rural level. These funds are made available to municipalities, which extend them to the lower ends of society in rural communities. The Universidad Nacional de Colombia plays the role of external agent to analyze the applications made by municipalities. From there, it continues under a particular framework to make these funds fully available. To date, we have provided housing units in around 599 municipalities, 66,875 have been contracted, and 42,072 have already been handed over. In this context, we are contemplating the possibility of granting productive loans to those families that have been awarded these houses, because they usually have enough land to operate productive agricultural activities or other related business activities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since we met in 2012, what have been the milestones of Bolsa de Valores de Colombia (BVC)?<br></h4><p>This has been a difficult year, and I think that for Colombia it has also been one in which we have come from a period of great optimism back down to reality. Reality in the sense that the world is still facing a highly complex environment with much residual uncertainty regarding the monetary policy needed to develop the right amount of economic growth in countries like the US, and in Europe. The exchange has been affected, as have most emerging markets, but nonetheless in relative terms Colombia has done well. In fixed income instruments, the correction in interest rates has been significant. There has been a correction of around 150 basis points in Colombian securities, which is fairly large. All of these conditions put us on a solid, but more realistic footing. In terms of liquidity and monetary conditions locally, Colombia is still enjoying a favorable environment, and the low interest rates are greatly positive for investment. Colombia is probably the country with the highest rate of investment as a percentage of GDP, close to 29%. I consider this positive, and it is this that will drive growth over the next two years. Thus, having low interest rates at levels that Colombia has not been used to, is highly positive news for the local economy moving forward.</p><h4>How successful was the MILA Day held in New York in mid-2013?</h4><p>It went very well, and we had the opportunity to reach out to the New York investment community and tell the story of MILA, not only from the BVC's, but also from the government's point of view. We had the participation of regulators from the three countries, and also saw the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs join in, indicating the global strategy of those countries that are already linked via MILA. Our conclusion is that this is a story that you need to tell over and over again because the audience still needs to be more educated to see the benefits. We are continuing to work under the MILA umbrella to further the depth of integration.</p><h4>You are focusing on e-trading: a new way of doing business. What is your opinion of these technological improvements?</h4><p>We launched e-trading in Colombia in 2009. Despite being a slow start, the brokers are now investing in new technologies, which I think will make it easier for investors to reach the market. There has been some discussion about the costs of doing business through electronic trading platforms, and we are working with the broker community to make it more efficient for both clients and brokers to have access to the market through e-trading. Currently, only 4% of trading is done via e-trading. We reached a peak of 7%-8% at some point in 2011-2012, but we need to work to further this rate, which we believe will really empower investors in the local market.</p><h4>What do you imagine to be the role of the BVC in providing the framework you are describing?</h4><p>In terms of the infrastructure sector alone, over the next five years we are talking about our need to mobilize $40 billion-$60 billion. This is where the capital markets have a crucial role to play. We have a number of listed construction companies and others that will probably become listed to raise capital through the exchange. As the banking sector will also be providing resources to these new initiatives in the infrastructure sector, it requires long-term funding so that it can match the length of the programs with the maturity of the debt raised. We have a direct role to play, particularly in channelling resources to the investment sectors that are going to be demanding resources over the coming years. We are also moving forward and empowering investors to seek more information and educate themselves to become more familiar with the issues that are important when investing in the markets. We want to have many more investors, but we also want to have educated and responsible investors who are aware of what they are doing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The fiscal terms for E&amp;P activities in Colombia are considered one of the most interesting in the world. Why do you think that is the case?<br></h4><p>The ANH has a contract for E&amp;P activities, and a second contract to undertake technical evaluations (TEA) over specific areas. Contracts are awarded through an open bid process, by which participants bid by offering a share of their future production to the ANH and additional investments to the established minimum exploratory program. The current fiscal model includes royalties (set by law and non-negotiable), participation of the ANH, area rental fees and a high price payment clause, which is a type of windfall profit tax collected directly by the ANH. It's worth mentioning that studies by independent agencies and reviewers have stated that Colombia is one of the most competitive fiscal regimes in the world. The price for farming into an onshore contract for conventional exploration in Colombia is basically the same as in Texas, which is one of the most efficient and competitive markets in the world. Regarding unconventional and offshore resources, which are clearly frontier opportunities, we hired expert consultants to give us advice on how to increase competitiveness in these markets. First, in 2012 and taking into consideration a study from IHS, we modified the high price payment clause for unconventional blocks, in order to increase economic incentives. This clause is triggered by two factors: price and cumulative production. The price trigger was raised from $42.54, to $81 (currently at $87.48), while the cumulative production remained unchanged at 5 million barrels. We also extended the exploration period from six years to nine years consisting of three phases of three years each, and extended the production period from 24 years to 30 years. Abandonment of the areas is only until the end of the exploration period. Furthermore, a reduction in royalties was passed by law, making royalties for unconventional resources 40% less than the rate for conventional fields. In the offshore segment, we commissioned a study by Wood Mackenzie last year, knowing intuitively that we were not particularly competitive in the offshore segment. Based on this study, we again addressed the high price payment clause. For deep-water exploration (depths from 300m to 1,000m), the price trigger was raised from $42.54 to $82 and cumulative production was raised from 5 million to 200 million barrels. For ultra-deep waters (depths over 1,000m), the price trigger was raised to $100, and cumulative production to 300 million barrels.</p><h4>Colombia produced an average of over a million barrels of oil in 2013, with a 6.6% increase in the production of crude compared to 2012. What sort of production do you expect for the next few years?</h4><p>A significant share of the state's fiscal resources stem from hydrocarbon production (approximately 25% of national income), so it's important to increase production. However, our principal goal is to increase reserves. I think production will be stable in the years to come, but as we incorporate new reserves, we will start going beyond the difficulties we faced in the past, and surely an increase in production will follow.</p><h4>The ANH is to auction 18 million hectares for exploration in 2014. What areas will be included in this auction?</h4><p>Ronda Colombia 2014 is comprised of two stages. The first stage has 95 blocks, 19 of which are offshore, 18 are unconventionals, and 58 conventionals. Of those 58 conventional blocks, 11 are the so-called discovered undeveloped deposits. These are small blocks that companies have declared non-commercial or undeclared discoveries. We believe that YD blocks offer a low-risk opportunity that will certainly catch the eye of smaller service companies due to the exploratory program's flexibility. During the first phase of the program, companies will review and reprocess information about the blocks, and then decide whether to continue exploration efforts or to withdrawal from the contract. In the second phase, operators are obliged to drill a well, or enter a pre-existing well. The second stage that is set to take place during the second semester of 2014 will encompass exclusively Coal Bed Methane (CBM) opportunities, of which there are eight blocks.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>GeoPark has a history of rapid growth in Latin America. What does Colombia represent for your regional operations?</h4><p>We started in Colombia two years ago by purchasing three companies. Today the operation accounts for over half of the company's overall production. Colombia accounts for at least 40% of our EBITDA and reserves, and all eyes are on this market and our rapid growth in it. GeoPark has 400 employees, of which 130 are in Colombia. It is a small team compared to our current activity level.</p><h4>GeoPark entered the Colombian market through the acquisition of Winchester Oil and Gas, La Luna, and Hupecol in 2012. How would you evaluate this process?</h4><p>The negotiations were simultaneous. The Winchester and La Luna acquisitions were closed in February 2012, and Hupecol's one month later. I witnessed the challenge and the success of merging various companies, cultures, and teams. Finally we put together a strong team in a highly competitive market. GeoPark acquired 10 blocks, four of which we operate. Those blocks are in the department of Casanare, while the others are in Magdalena, Catatumbo, and also in Casanare.</p><h4>What are your seismic and drilling plans for the remainder of 2014 and 2015?</h4><p>We have no plans to pursue further seismic activity for the time being. GeoPark acquired approximately 1,500 square kilometers of seismic data during 2013, with 350 square kilometers in Colombia. Our 2014 budget includes the drilling of 18 to 23 wells, some of which will be drilled contingent upon results.  As of June 30th we had drilled 12 wells and are confident of meeting our yearly drilling target. We are still working on the 2015 plan and budget, but I would expect an active drilling program.</p><h4>How much production are you expecting for 2014?</h4><p>As of December 2013 we had increased production in Colombia by 20% and our reserves by 23%. Today we are producing nearly 20,000 gross barrels per day (bbl/d); for the second quarter of this year production is up 68% in comparison with the second quarter of 2013. This increase is mainly a result of the new discoveries in the Tigana, Tigana Sur, and Aruco fields in the Llanos 34 Block, as well as the development and appraisal of the Max, Túa, and Tarotaro fields. GeoPark operates with a 45% working interest (WI).</p><h4>What do you think the public and private sectors must do to overcome challenges in the industry like infrastructure and the delays in obtaining permits?</h4><p>Infrastructure includes both roads and pipelines. With respect to roads, national and regional authorities are currently working on programs to improve certain roads and build new ones, but these are, in most cases, not roads leading to our fields. Infrastructure efforts should be led by the public sector. However, as active members of the communities, we are investing significant resources in maintaining the regional public roads we use. Regarding pipelines, we believe this effort should be left to the private sector, either producers or midstream companies. This however, still requires considerable government support.</p><h4>What opportunities does Colombia offer for further investment in the energy sector?</h4><p>Legal and political stability are important factors for a good investment environment. We still have aspects to improve as a country, and here I speak as a Colombian, but that is just a natural part of growing pains. The country has demonstrated steady growth year after year in an improving environment, which I believe is always a good sign for investment.</p><h4>How do you envision the future of the energy sector in Colombia, and what role will GeoPark play in shaping it?</h4><p>Colombia urgently needs more discoveries; large and important ones that would allow it to replenish national reserves. For that purpose, it needs to improve the environmental permit process and recognize and support the industry's efforts and investments in the regions that we work in and with our communities. GeoPark is deeply committed to Colombia and its regions. This is why we will contribute to expanding the national reserve base, in working closely with our communities, in having an environmentally committed operation, and in working jointly with the authorities to strengthen the overall process.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you expand on your company's economic and social contribution?<br></h4><p>We play an important role in the Latin American plastics industry, with significant presence in the Colombian, Peruvian, and Ecuadorean markets, with polypropylene market shares of 80%, 20% and 40%, respectively. For years, our main objective has been to build long-lasting commercial relationships with our clients. Nowadays, we have a wide spectrum of clients in different countries, such as Guatemala, El Salvador, Mexico, Bolivia, and Brazil, amongst others. And through leveraging various opportunities we have been able to expand our reach to clients in Spain, Turkey, and even China. In addition to the production of polypropylene, which represents our core business, we have included the commercialization of polyethylene in our portfolio. Even though Ecopetrol has a production plant in Barrancabermeja for only one type of polyethylene, its capacity does not satisfy total domestic demand. Finally, one of our subsidiaries (COMAI) with the production of Master batches has allowed us to complement our offer of solutions. These types of products enhance resin properties in order to enjoy different benefits during the plastic transformation process. A clear example is the production of plastic bags, making them easy to open, or in the case of plastic chairs, allowing them to be colored. We complete the chain, in the sense that Ecopetrol delivers the propylene to us, we produce polypropylene, and commercialize polyethylene in addition to producing master batches.</p><h4>Why is demand for resin growing so strongly, and are there any innovations that may achieve a greater harmony with the environment?</h4><p>On a global scale, both polypropylene and polyethylene are resins with great levels of demand, due to their use in a wide variety of applications. Polypropylene is much more resistant, while polyethylene is more suitable for the production of delicate products, such as light plastic drinking containers. In the automotive industry, polypropylene has been preferred over different types of plastic for the fabrication of robust pieces that require high strength. Also numerous products that were previously made from wood and glass are now being substituted with polypropylene, which possesses great benefit of being recyclable. As part of its strategic vision, Propilco is developing “the closing of the plastic cycle," which consists of recycling polypropylene to create prefabricated houses. In Cartagena, we recently built six houses made from this material for our contractors. Clearly then, we can conclude that polypropylene is highly beneficial due to its resistance, while possessing the ability to be recycled.</p><h4>How important is the petrochemical industry for the hydrocarbon industry in general?</h4><p>By the nature of the process, propylene is a byproduct of the refining of gasoline. Since we transform propylene into a usable product for human consumption, we are adding an important value to the hydrocarbon industry. In the case of shale gas, which is booming worldwide and assuming an important role in the North American industry, it is interesting to note that a part of this gas can be used for the production of polyethylene, as ethane is a key constituent of shale gas. Another substance contained in shale gas is propane, which can be transformed into propylene, whereby the hydrocarbon industry has a highly interesting future thanks to the petrochemical industry.</p><h4>In late 2012, Propilco was preparing an investment of $500 million. What were its goals, and what are the opportunities for foreign companies to become partners?</h4><p>This project still remains our goal, and it is what we call a propane dehydrogenation (PDH) plant. It will allow us to convert propane into propylene and ultimately into polypropylene, with hydrogen as a by-product. Our proposition is to convert a portion of the propane produced by the shale gas industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background story of Mario Hernández?<br></h4><p>We opened the first stores under the name of Cuerolandia in the early 1970s, whereas the factory, Marroquinera SA, only opened in 1978. The story of Marroquinera is complex, because it was born out of a merger between two small companies, Cuerolandia and Marroquinera, after I acquired most of the shares of both from close friends. We incorporated the production of Swiss Bally. Over the years, we also opened in New York; an experience that helped me realize that Marroquinera was not the best of trading names. After some international market research, I decided to change the name of the company to Mario Hernandez. That meant a fresh start for the company, and in the intervening 17 years the company has been growing both nationally and internationally. We now employ over 500 people and have manufacturing activities in several countries, all determined to produce products using the best raw materials available. We strive for progress and product differentiation through quality, endurance, and social responsibility. The Mario Hernández brand is famous for hand-crafted leather goods inspired by an affinity for well-made products.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the international presence of the company?</h4><p>Today, we have 55 stores in Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Aruba. In all, we are present with Mario Hernández stores located in the most prestigious shopping malls. In terms of future expansion, we prioritize existing for the long term. Our five-year plan foresees the company reaching 120 stores and increasing international activity, with a special focus on the US, which will be our top priority.</p><h4>How would you assess the development of the Colombian leather industry?</h4><p>The number of players has declined compared to a few years ago. Previously, we used to commercialize rather cheap leather and there were many manufacturers, thanks to high demand from countries like the US. However, that changed some 15 years ago, and leather became a more expensive product, changing also the manufacturing patterns in the industry toward more traditional and unique methods. That drove prices up and reduced the number of players in the industry leaving those with brands focused on consumer experience. Over the past decade, Colombia has been working hard to promote its leather as one of the finest quality in the world, and make our leather production highly recognized in the international arena. The supply chain is diminished due to the flight to lower labor cost countries. However, the biggest challenge is procuring raw materials and hardware.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of your company?</h4><p>I think we are unique in terms of service, quality, and manufacturing methods. We believe that differentiation is the only road to success in the globalized world, and for that reason we have worked hard to achieve the denomination of origin in Mario Hernández, something we proudly did some years ago. Another of our distinctive features is our products' unique identity. Our challenge for the future is to ensure our business grows.</p><h4>How has the company developed over the past five years and what are your key future plans?</h4><p>We have been growing at an average annual rate of between 15% and 20%. In terms of future priorities, we plan to expand our international profile, while acquiring more international expertise in the industry with some of the best professionals out there. We are on the way to building a global and international brand, and we have already drawn the attention of several global investors. So far, we have refused any potential deals, as we think we still have a long road ahead of us and there will be a moment, in the future, when we will be in a stronger position. So far, we are prioritizing re-investment in our utilities and continuing our expansion in terms of international activity and store number.</p><h4>How closely do you work with Marca Colombia and Proexport Colombia?</h4><p>They both hold us up as a solid business exemplar for companies keen to expand their activities to other international markets. Overall, we collaborate closely with them, as the government has offered its hand to many companies to grow internationally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-rules-of-the-game]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have recently been named Central Banker of America. To what do you attribute your success?<br></h4><p>This success is thanks to a team that works with complete independence within a framework of inflation-targeting with a flexible exchange rate. The objectives of this framework are to maintain low and stable inflation and to smooth output fluctuations around a sustainable growth path; both objectives have been achieved. Inflation has been hovering at around 3%, our long-term target, for almost six consecutive years, and over the past decade economic growth has been exceptionally high and stable. The flexible exchange rate with a pre-announced, clearly communicated intervention has also been an integral part of Banco de la Republica´s strategy for implementing monetary policy. This was a point also stressed by The Banker when it granted me the award.</p><h4>According to the IMF, Colombia has maintained sound macroeconomic performance and a strong and competitively managed policy framework. What does this evaluation mean for Colombia?</h4><p>It is important for us. There is no doubt that the Colombian economy has exhibited strong resilience in the face of adverse external shocks, and this has been possible because of the presence of the three “pillars" of our macroeconomic framework: low and stable inflation in an inflation-targeting regime, a sound and responsible fiscal policy, and strong financial supervision and regulation. This framework, constructed and improved over the years, has allowed us to pursue counter-cyclical monetary and fiscal policy and has given us room for manoeuvring and dealing with external shocks.</p><h4>There has been a rapid expansion of Colombian banks in Central America. How would you assess the benefits, and the main challenges, of this expansion?</h4><p>The expansion of Colombian banks abroad has important benefits for the Colombian economy and financial system. Colombia and the economies of Central America are subject to different shocks, and respond differently to common external shocks. Therefore, there is an increasing diversification of macroeconomic and financial risks stemming from the investments of Colombian banks in that region.</p><h4>In what ways is Colombia becoming more involved in the global economy?</h4><p>This is happening through both international trade and investment. For example, over the past ten years, Colombian exports and imports have multiplied by more than tenfold. Something similar has happened with FDI. At the beginning of this century foreign investment was at around one- to one-and-a-half billion dollars a year. In recent years it has increased to $15 to $16 billion. Likewise, at the beginning of this century Colombian investment abroad was at a few hundred million dollars per year. In recent years this has increased to $4 to $5 billion per year.  And both trade and foreign investment are now more diversified than ever.</p><h4>What policies is the Central Bank implementing to encourage trade and investment?</h4><p>Central Bank policies have made important contributions to macroeconomic and financial stability. This improves the country's risk perception and creates a favorable environment for investment, both from domestic and foreign investors. These efforts complement an institutional framework characterized by clear and stable rules for foreign investors and the signing of free trade agreements with several countries, including the United States.</p><h4>How is the inflation rate being kept stable?</h4><p>Our main instrument for monetary policy is the short-term interest rate. When aggregate demand falls below its sustainable level and the economy faces inflation below target, our policy reaction is to lower the interest rate. In contrast, once the economy recovers its growth pace and threatens to overshoot the inflation target, we increase the interest rate. Inflation in 2013 was at 1.94%, below our 3% target, mostly due to temporary positive supply shocks. We expected some reversal of that in 2014, which is exactly what has happened. Our forecast for 2014 is a rate of close to 3%.</p><h4>What is your economic forecast for the country in 2014 and the medium term?</h4><p>For 2014 we are expecting the Colombian economy to grow at a similar rate than that of 2013, which was 4.7%; and inflation should hover slightly above 3%, which is our long-term goal. In the mid-term, we want to keep inflation at around 3% and we believe the economy can grow sustainably at a rate of around 4.5% to 5%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[legal-wellspring]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has oil production evolved in Colombia over recent years?<br></h4><p>There has been an overriding increase in the production of oil and gas over the last 4 years. In 2013, for instance, we had an average of 64,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) more of production than in 2012. Although in 2014 we have seen lower production levels due to social problems, protests and damage to infrastructure, we have managed to raise security levels around oil activities thanks to coordinated efforts between security entities and the Ministry, nevertheless. This has been a great achievement, in which we focused on the prevention of potential attacks. Also, we have improved the environment around oil production and distribution facilities, which is greatly valued by companies. All these actions have been aimed at returning to previous oil production and export levels. Every inoperative day, for example, of the Caño Limón pipeline represents losses of $2.17 billion, revenues that, incidentally, are the main source of financing for oil-related projects in the region.</p><h4>What have been some of the key measures and actions taken by the Ministry to reduce the effects of social protests on oil industry activity?</h4><p>It is crucial to strengthen communications between operating companies and the communities that are affected by oil operations. In this context, there is a national strategy of social and regional development in which one of the main objectives is precisely this. We also try to bring to the dialog table all the parties involved: communities, local and regional authorities, and private companies. Also, we have understood the need to listen to the claims and complaints of the local communities in a better manner, and they have appreciated the steps taken. Our goal is to reach long-term agreements that satisfy all parties involved, whereby companies enjoy a better and more efficient working environment in these communities.</p><h4>What steps have been taken to protect traditional mining activities over illegal mining?</h4><p>We understood the need to differentiate between traditional mining, illegal mining, and modern mining. In this context, we learnt to give traditional mining a different treatment, offering those participating in the activity an outstretched hand. At the same time, we give no quarter to illegal mining activities and combat this strongly and continuously. Also, we have sped up formalization processes for those aiming to legalize their activities. In addition, we have consolidated mediation tools between small mining activities, including traditional and illegal, and large corporations or large owners of mines. It is important to boost cooperation between these two parties. In fact, we have had a very positive pilot project with Continental Gold, a company that recently signed five cooperation agreements with small mining communities. There have been other pilot projects to fight illegal mining in departments like Cauca, as this type of mining does not contribute to regional development. Again, we have developed several tools to offer these illegal mining activities a chance to legalize, as we know of the importance of government support for this transformation. One of the main goals of the legalization process is to standardize operations and develop them within the right environmental international framework. One of our main efforts focuses on the eradication of the usage of mercury in illegal mining activities.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of the Colombian mining and energy industries for foreign investors?</h4><p>In 2013, some regional countries saw a reduction in the arrival of foreign investment, something that did not happen in Colombia. Foreign investment grew by 8% in Colombia last year, reaching a record $16.8 billion. A great part of this figure went to the oil and energy industries. This figure also shows the reliability of Colombia as an investment destination, due mainly to political stability in the country, and clear and stable rules of the game. Colombia is a highly competitive country for foreign investors, even more so than other regional superpowers like Brazil and Mexico. Also, our country offers attractive and interesting returns on investment. I think we experienced a highly positive trend in terms of investment and production, and we expect a better economic performance of both the mining and energy industries for 2014 than in previous years. These sectors are set to remain among our key economic drivers, financing the development of other sectors and infrastructure. For example, in 2013 the energy and mining industries represented 28% of tax income for the Treasury, also reaching 31% of current national income.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Possibly the most interesting news from ISA over 2014 has been the contract for the construction and operation of a transmission line in Lima, Peru. What is the importance of this news, and what does ISA offer Peru in this particular project?<br></h4><p>ISA is the main transmission company in Colombia. We are the owners and operators of something like 75% of all the transmission capacity of Colombia. For 30 years, we have been in the process of locating investment opportunities outside Colombia, and the company has been very successful. First, we started our international business in Peru and we have two transmission companies there. We also operate approximately 70% of the Peruvian transmission network. ISA has won most of the bidding processes put in place by the Peruvian agency in charge of grid expansion. So at this moment we are making investments in new transmission lines in Peru that are worth close to $700 million. ISA is developing a vision of becoming the most important transmission company in Latin America. We been able to enter into the Brazilian market, and right now we are the transmission company in the state of Sío Paolo through our subsidiary. ISA is also making huge investments in Chile. We were awarded two projects two years ago and we are now in the process of building those transmission lines. We are investing a little over $1 billion in Chile. We also have investments in transmission lines in Bolivia, and we are in the process of developing the electricity connections between Colombia and Panama. In this way, ISA is connecting the Isthmus of Panama and Central America. So what you find here is a Colombian company that has been able to become the main player in the electricity transmission business in the region.</p><h4>Could you offer us an assessment of your main achievements in 2013?</h4><p>In 2012, we began a process of reviewing our strategy in finding new ways to generate value for the company. We found out that in the last 20 years that ISA was very successful at entering new markets in the region. During this review of our strategy, we arrived at the conclusion that the main priority was now to capitalize on that experience and to try to make those assets more profitable. We defined several strategic focuses. Firstly, we want to continue growing in a very profitable way. That is a simple statement. We had to become careful in our investments. We prioritized efforts to become more efficient, and in that way made our investments more profitable. ISA today is a world-class company in terms of asset size, and our regional geographical presence. We found that we still could have made some improvements in our operational practice in order to become one of the most efficient companies not only in Latin America—we know that we are the best in the region—but to become one of the best in the international arena.</p><h4>Over 2013, ISA carried out a number of important projects to improve network reach and capacity. How important were these for the company's operations, and for the national interest?</h4><p>The important thing is that in Colombia, the expansion of the transmission system is done through a system of public bidding, in which the government offers potential investors the possibility to build these new infrastructure projects. In Colombia, we have three main companies interested in competing for these projects. ISA is one of these, of course, but there is also EEB and EPM. Sometimes we are responsible for building these projects. In other cases, we have EEB or EPM doing this. In 2014, we are going to put into operation the transmission line to connect the new Hidrosogamoso hydroelectric power station in the region of Santander, to connect the hydro-station to the national grid. This is a central station of ISA, but the line to connect the hydropower generation to the national system is our responsibility. And in the near future, the government is opening up for tender several projects estimated at some $1.5 billion in size that are important for the development of the national grid. ISA is participating in all of those tenders, and hopes to win a number of them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What examples can Medellí­n set for other countries in terms of security and innovation?<br></h4><p>In the past Medellí­n was known internationally as the most dangerous city in the world. We have changed that, and today the city has become the most innovative and one of the most resilient cities in the world. Medellí­n has achieved such unique and incredible changes thanks to investment in education and innovative urban developments strongly linked to mobility in public spaces. Our society was highly unequal, but with such investment, we have achieved an equal urban development and higher levels of coexistence. Just two decades ago the city had a homicide rate of 380 people for every 100,000 inhabitants. By 1H2014, the rate had dropped to 28. All achievements in terms of security have been possible thanks to the joint efforts of all authorities, security bodies, and other agencies. I think Medellí­n represents a strong example of how to invest in education to create future opportunities for the youth, as well as a sense of urban equality through investment in infrastructure.</p><h4>How has Medellí­n managed to be awarded most innovative city in the world?</h4><p>The reasons why we were awarded such distinction reside in the innovation we have introduced in our urban development projects. Perhaps the design of these developments is not innovative in itself, but their innovation has to do with, for example, the different usage the city has given to them. For example, the cable railway's innovation lies in how Medellí­n has used it as mass transportation, and today there are many cities copying our system. The same can be said about the escalators set around the city to reach mountainous and less accessible areas in the city. We applied innovation to solve the daily problems that our society faced.</p><h4>What are your housing priorities within the 2012-2015 Urban Development Plan of your administration?</h4><p>The urban development plan has a record budget in the history of our city of $10 billion—12% of this represent operating expenses, whereas the rest is pure investment. The plan foresees investment in education, infrastructure, environment, and housing, among others. In fact, education and health are the two spheres receiving the highest proportion of this budget. Additionally, we have increased traditional investments in mega infrastructure projects, which includes the construction of several parks that will combine to form an 18-kilometer long natural park along the Medellí­n River. We will be developing this ambitious project through a combination of public-private partnerships (PPPs). We have also prioritized the development of the Metropolitan Green Belt, a similar project, but one that is located around the outskirts of the city, as we aim to limit the growth of the city through sustainable projects. These two megaprojects run in parallel with our commitment to our housing project; we aim to provide over 100,400 units through a project that incorporates new housing units, as well as the renovation, legalization, and regularization of existing housing units. In this context, Medellí­n has capitalized on the National Government investment in the social interest housing project; 10% of the 100,000 housing projects that form part of the National Government's plans were built in Medellí­n.</p><h4>What kind of support is your government providing for the industrial expansion of the Medellí­n area?</h4><p>We know that in order to further attract industrial investment from national and foreign investors, we must continue working to increase security levels. We must also support their activity through urban transportation platforms to make their business more competitive. For example, we are set up to operate the first tram network in Colombia. This is an innovative project that will run on pneumatics rather than steel wheels. We also believe that it is essential to continue investing in human resources; people from Medellí­n are known for their affable and entrepreneurial character, and we need to support that with education and training. We know we can provide this basic support to domestic and foreign investors; however, we are also implementing specific strategies. For example, we have set up the Medellí­nnovation District, a kind of Silicon Valley that will develop solutions for health, energy, and ICT. Companies establishing operations in this district will enjoy tax incentives and will be able to benefit from an innovative, creative, and knowledge-focused environment.</p><h4>What are some of the landmark achievements of your administration in terms of healthcare, and some of the challenges facing this sector?</h4><p>We have invested heavily in the improvement and expansion of health infrastructure, and are currently building five new health centers and four new hospitals. Additionally, we are setting up the first pedagogic health institution to work exclusively on prevention, as well as the first integral center to provide support to women and families, as well as a children's hospital. We saw the lowest rates for maternal mortality that we have ever seen in Medellí­n in 2013.</p><h4>What is the municipality's strategy to boost Medellí­n's role within the education sphere?</h4><p>We need to invest to improve the quality of education at both the primary and secondary levels. Our biggest challenge is to build bridges between secondary education and technical and higher education. We have plans to build two new university campuses, each one with a capacity of 10,000 students.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the healthy growth of local construction sector mean for Colombia's economy at large?<br></h4><p>I think the boom the sector is enjoying is the direct result of the boost the current government has given to the construction sector in recent years. Government policies have contributed to providing lower income citizens with housing units. I think that there have never been so many favorable tools for people to access the housing market with, such as low interest rates, the result of which is the sector's current buoyancy.</p><h4>What role do public-private partnerships (PPPs) play in the sector?</h4><p>PPPs are a great tool to promote the development of infrastructure projects, and boost activity in this segment, rendering Colombia still more competitive within the framework of the several free trade agreements (FTAs) it has recently signed. We have also seen a growing trend lately to implement PPPs within the housing segment to boost the development of such projects in municipalities across Colombia's regions.</p><h4>In your opinion, what kind of housing project does Cali require the most today?</h4><p>Cali and its neighboring municipalities have a characteristic demand trend. Over the past few years, Cali and its environs have received people from other regions, which has increased the demand for low-cost housing units. Therefore, average demand for such properties is higher in Cali and neighboring towns than elsewhere in the country. In other words, 33% of the housing transactions in Cali and neighboring municipalities are for these low-cost types of properties. Since demand is still more than relevant in this segment, we foresee an increase in demand in the market for properties within strata 3, 2, and 1. I think the future of the construction and real estate sector in Cali is quite bright and promising.</p><h4>What challenges have you encountered through the years?</h4><p>The construction sector is a rather cyclical one, and our company, like others, has not been oblivious to the crises blighting the sector over the past two decades. The industry suffered from one of the worst crises between 1995 and 1999, a period that saw many companies go bankrupt. Despite its financial difficulties, our company managed to stay afloat thanks to the unconditional and valuable support of its shareholders, and we managed to reverse the situation, positioning the company among the leading companies in the sector in Colombia today. The crisis of the late 1990s taught many companies and authorities to be more cautious when measuring risk. For example, the country adopted the pre-sales model in the industry through real estate trustees, increasing the feeling of security among buyers and making sure constructors appropriately use the money they receive from buyers' down payments. Financial institutions also became more prudent when granting mortgages. The financial and construction sectors are, therefore, stronger thanks to the lessons learned from the crisis. We currently have great interest in expanding business activities to cities and towns around the so-called “Coffee Production Belt" of Armenia, Manizales, and Pereira, and also in Bogotá.</p><h4>How was 2013 for Constructora Meléndez?</h4><p>We closed the year with a property sales value of around $90 million, with $70 million from housing properties and $20 million from selling corporate solutions. These are the two main segments in which we concentrate our activity today. These were impressive results thanks to the consolidation of projects we launched into the market between 2011 and 2012. The housing properties we sold were praised for their high-quality designs and unbeatable surroundings. Our main goal is to contribute to the development of the city and its communities through several construction projects. Such ambition proves, once more, our commitment toward the development of the city and the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your economic outlook for Colombia in the medium term?<br></h4><p>Predicting economic performance in a changing world is a difficult task. Today, we find it hard to believe that the crises of the last two, five, or even 10 years occurred at all; the countries where we have a presence enjoyed sustainable growth. It has been a decade of learning for us, showing that discipline can achieve long-term results. Institutions and regulations have become stronger, with very active internationalization processes under way in the case of Colombia. As well, international corporate capacity has expanded and there is a great potential for economic development. We feel optimistic despite the difficulty in anticipating results in a global economy; however, the world economy will perform better in 2014. Projections made by the IMF in October 2013 point to global growth this year, with the main thrust coming from industrialized countries. Although emerging economies will grow at a faster pace, the former ones will monopolize most of the recovery. The growth rate will increase from 1.2% in 2013 to 2% in 2014. Acceleration is also expected in the US economy in 2014. The macroeconomic environment for Colombia now looks more favorable. Labor market indicators, including unemployment and job creation, imports of capital goods, retail, vehicle sales, petroleum production, and construction licensing, among other things, reflect that household consumption, construction, commerce, and credit in 4Q2013 recorded higher levels than before and are more positive. Inflation is low at the global level, as well as in Colombia. However, I think it will pick up in 2014 because, in 2013, it was at 1.94%, the lowest level since 1955. We want to develop flexible solutions that save time through events that impact positively on the quality of life of people and realize our humane banking philosophy across the 10 countries where we are present: Colombia, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Nicaragua, Peru, and the Cayman Islands.</p><h4>Bancolombia currently has a presence in 10 countries. What kinds of synergies have resulted from the company's many acquisitions?</h4><p>Over the past three years, Bancolombia has implemented a growth strategy with a strong focus on foreign markets. Arriving in new countries poses several challenges, and we always aim for those markets that enjoy legal stability with potential new companies that will create further added value for our shareholders. This strategy led the company to become a leading player in the banking sector in other countries through the acquisition of several banks abroad. At the same time, we face challenges such as creating the right synergies to exchange good business practices, to understand the national culture, and to create job opportunities within the local market, while also integrating local staff within the group's regional strategy. Overall, we are a global company with a presence in 10 countries, serving 9 million clients and with 46,000 employees.</p><h4>What are the characteristics that allow Bancolombia shares to represent an interesting investment for foreign portfolios based on the management, revenues, and profit?</h4><p>Bancolombia is the leader in its target market—it has a 22% share of the market in Colombia based on assets and 30% in El Salvador as of June 2013.Bancolombia has a well-balanced business; with a loan portfolio diversified by geography, industry, product, and debtor. We are confident of our growth in the short and medium term because we are the leaders of a growing market. Banking penetration is increasing, we are diversifying our markets, our goal is cost effective, efficient, and sustainable growth, and we have stricter capital requirements that make us fully compliant with all new financial regulations. We also have countercyclical provisions that enable us to anticipate and shield the institution before potential events; our profitable growth will be leveraged in a diversified portfolio—commercial 19%, individual 25%, mortgage 31%, leasing 16%—and, with assets and a portfolio totaling Ps131 trillion ($61 billion) and Ps90 trillion ($45 billion), respectively, we have the leading banking platform in Colombia and we are leaders in market share. We are the leader in share of total assets in Central America, and this year we will focus on consolidating our investments abroad. Our conservative risk profile brings us sustainable growth in that respect. Finally, our portfolio is properly anchored. Our group is supported primarily by our deposits.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the performance of the automotive sector in 2013 and what are your prospects for 2014?</h4><p>The automotive sector in 2013 had a total volume of 294,000 units. During 2013, it suffered a slowdown of 5.1% compared to the previous year, even though 2013 was historically the third  best year for the Colombian industry. We cannot complain about the size of the market, but for many companies, that slowdown brought some commercial stress as the expectation had been for sustained growth of the kind achieved in 2011 and 2012. There were 300,016 units sold in 2012. For 2014 we expect further growth to 305,000 units. We consider the reelection of President Santos  positive because a change in government would have brought some stress to the economy.</p><h4>Which models are you bringing into the Colombian market, and which are more successful?</h4><p>For non-business use, commercial/passenger vehicles and SUVs are the most popular. We have the Nissan Qashqai, which is the best selling model in Europe. We also have the Nissan X-trail, which is also important for our sales figures. Currently, those two models are receiving a complete makeover. They are brand new to the market, and we rely on them in the SUV segment to boost our sales. These are our volume sectors. In addition, we have the Nissan Pathfinder, which comes from the US. Since the FTA with the US, the Pathfinder has benefited from not incurring import duties.</p><h4>What were your sales like in 2013 and what do you expect for 2014?</h4><p>We are expecting to increase our sales volume by close to 12%. One reason for that is the introduction of new models, and the fact that we have a better supply now compared to 2013. We get most of our cars from Mexico, which is responsible for supplying the US and South American markets. Since the American markets have started to improve, demand has increased, whereby we have experienced difficulty sourcing our cars from Mexico in 2013. The good news is that Nissan has since opened a plant in Mexico—Aguascalientes—a technologically-advanced facility of remarkable efficiency. Another plant was opened in Brazil, which will mean that the Mexican production chains will be freer to supply other South American markets such as Colombia.</p><h4>What is the importance of medium-sized cities for your Colombian operation?</h4><p>Bogotá accounts for perhaps 46% of demand. Medellí­n will represent probably 13% and Cali 10%. We really need to focus our attention on smaller cities than that, to achieve a presence in 23 cities of the country. The early models that we sold in those cities in the 1960s and 1970s were 4x4 vehicles, which were ideally suited to the poor condition of the roads at the time. We managed to sell many of those units and now the brand has a good reputation. We have operations in those smaller cities and sell entry-level vehicles there, which are typically smaller sedans and pickups. The demand for 4x4 vehicles has changed more to rural transportation for farmers, with vehicles such as pick up trucks becoming more common. We sell a high volume of pickups in the smaller cities, and are the leader in the sale of pickups in the Colombian market overall.</p><h4>What is your medium-term forecast for the Colombian automotive sector?</h4><p>Colombia has huge potential, not only for the automobile sector, but also as a country. The Colombian consumer has gained significant purchasing capacity over time. We have developed, as an economy, strong potential for consumers yet the number of vehicles per 1,000 people is still low compared to many other countries, whereby the potential to sell more cars is high. We think that in the not too distant future, perhaps within four years, the market could grow to between 400,000 to 450,000 units per year, which would make Colombia an attractive market for the automotive business. We are confident that we can reach this level. One thing that will help increase the size of the market will be the government's 4G projects as we will have more quality roads and cities will become better connected as a result. Nowadays traveling by road is time consuming. Sometimes it is even more efficient time-wise to fly, but once we have better roads, people will have more impetus to drive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has underpinned your success?<br></h4><p>When PPG acquired Colpisa in Medellí­n, it provided additional production capacity in Colombia, which has helped us grow in the region. Our success is also the result of diversifying the end-use markets we supply. We have a sustained focus on petrochemical and oil and gas industry coatings. However, since 2012, we have also entered other markets, such as transportation, automotive, and refinish, which we distribute to the market through a third party.</p><h4>How has your product portfolio evolved in recent years in Latin America?</h4><p>PPG is known in Latin America for its technological advantage. One of the benefits of the Latin American market, and more specifically, Colombia, is that we have the technology available first-hand. We offer our customers the commercial benefit of unique and innovative products. This means that apart from reducing costs, they can also differentiate themselves from their competitors. Our portfolio provides them with the tools needed for growth.</p><h4>How would you characterize the competition in Colombia?</h4><p>Ours is a highly competitive market. Architectural applications account for 50% of the coatings segment, not just in the region, with the remainder spread between industrial coatings and associated products for the oil and gas segments. Colombia is becoming a mature market today, as we are witnessing the consolidation of the sector and a reduction in the number of companies. Technology is available through both joint ventures and, as in our case, direct participation. This consolidation will likely continue, whereby in five or 10 years, perhaps five or six large companies will have acquired the small-scale manufacturers and captured the market.</p><div class="quote">“The legal protection that Colombia affords foreign investors is one of the key reasons why PPG and other foreign entities are investing in this country."</div><h4>What is the potential for growth in the Colombian market?</h4><p>PPG in Colombia acts as a regional hub. We see it as an opportunity for the Andean region. Despite recent years of slow growth, we foresee the economy growing at an average of around 5% per year for the next five or six years. With these figures, the government needs to implement the infrastructure expenditure that had been postponed in the past. That will give the industry the opportunity to grow.</p><h4>What are your targets for expansion in Latin America?</h4><p>Latin America is a key focus region for the company. We currently have operations in Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina, as well as operations in Colombia. We would like to position ourselves to be among the Top-two companies in the retail industry.</p><h4>In terms of the legal and regulatory framework, what advantages does Colombia offer?</h4><p>The legal protection that Colombia affords foreign investors is one of the key reasons why PPG and other foreign entities are investing in this country. This said, there is a need to broadly modify the legal framework in such spheres as environmental law. This could provide the company additional growth potential and increase the appetite of other companies to continue investing in the country.</p><h4>What are your main environmental sustainability objectives?</h4><p>We aim to remain the world's leading coatings and specialty products company with a focus on sustainability to ensure the success and lasting presence of our company for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our shareholders, our neighbors, and our suppliers. We act in a manner that helps to ensure the longevity and resilience of our environment, our economies, and our society. We aim to reduce spills and releases by 10% per year, hazardous waste to landfill by 20% by 2020, non-hazardous waste to landfill by 10% by 2020, and greenhouse gas emission intensity by 1.5% per year. In addition, we aim to reduce PPG illness and injury rates by 5% per year, and implement wellness programs at all PPG facilities globally.</p><h4>What coating applications have the greatest commercial potential in Colombia?</h4><p>There are opportunities across all segments. A combination of technology and innovation enables the customer to launch a better, and occasionally, a unique product to the market. All segments represent an opportunity and could be viewed as strategically important for us and the local market.</p><h4>What is PPG's short-term investment plan for Colombia?</h4><p>We are constantly investigating opportunities, and any prospective venture that makes sound business sense merits evaluation. We are committed to the country once we identify where we could best support the industry and our stakeholders, and adapt to it accordingly.</p><h4>What is your medium term outlook for Colombia's industrial sector?</h4><p>Government policy will play an important role—open business and free trade agreements (FTAs) are important in helping our sector thrive. And while these may pressure the industry, once it adapts and fully comprehends the nature of the competition, it has the potential to grow stronger. If Colombia continues to focus on bringing value and generating more local knowledge and innovation it will be able to grow, while industry becomes more sustainable. On the other hand, if the region seeks protectionism, it is likely to fail. An industry cannot grow by being safeguarded by the government, as it needs to focus on what can be done in order to improve current standards. I am a true believer in the fact that the Colombian industry will continue to grow, and that we will isolate niches in the market where we have advantages that can exceed those offered by foreign trade.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on the success Colombia's government has achieved with its transversal policies?<br></h4><p>We are implementing a digital revolution in Colombia; an inclusive revolution for all Colombians, especially those of limited economic means in rural areas of the country. This revolution is geared at broadening internet penetration and reducing the cost of access. For example, we increased the percentage of connected Colombian households from 17% to the current 50%, an increase that has had a significant impact on lower-income families. This digital revolution also includes Colombian SMEs, with the percentage of connected companies exceeding 60% in 2014. The digital revolution also impacts education; we plan to distribute 2 million computer units to decrease the current computer deficit from one computer per 24 schoolchildren to one computer for every four schoolchildren. The digital revolution is also linked to public workers and the increase of available e-services. For example, Colombia is a leading country in the region in terms of e-government. Colombia's digital revolution also encourages responsible web usage. For example, we are active in taking measures against children's internet addiction and work on training people to spot the risks and take preventative measures. Thanks to the digital revolution, we also boosted entrepreneurship among Colombians and are educating as many as 55,000 entrepreneurs as a result of our program. In fact, for our country it is vital to meet the potential of new technologies thanks to the pool of skilled and creative young people we have. There has also been a notable impact for farmers and rural communities in general, where we have set up 7,000 community centers, known as “Digital Kiosks," that boost connectivity in rural Colombia. We will have a fiber internet connection in all our municipalities in 2014. I would also add that our digital revolution includes the disabled, in a bid to increase their participation in daily life, and thus we have nationwide programs to boost inclusiveness in society through new technologies.</p><h4>What will be the main benefits of the nationwide implementation of 4G technologies?</h4><p>Recently, we carried out a kind of auction in the 4G field that brought more competition to the sector (from three operators to six) and we have also managed to draft a clearer and more commercially attractive regulatory framework. In this context, operators have already started working and will be able to reach a diversity of social groups across all cities, while also boosting the wider take up of new technologies. This strong interest from operators shows the potential of this segment of the industry, which in the near future will see key advances in the technological development of society.</p><h4>What were the main achievements of the Ministry's “computers to educate" program?</h4><p>It achieved something very important: a highlighting of the role that new technologies can play in improving national education levels. However, we should keep one thing in mind, namely that providing schools with computers and tablets is only useful if there is a robust strategy behind it to train teachers and provide them with effective tools to actually improve education. In this context, one of the program's lasting achievements is greater public awareness of the potential of new technologies. As a result, we are effectively boosting innovation in the education sector.</p><h4>How is the policy of subsidizing studies on new technologies structured in Colombia?</h4><p>The most important consideration to our thinking is to develop talent among our large young population, clearly our nation's greatest advantage. We try to bring together both things and make sure the country has a deep pool of talent in the IT sector. We run a national program in which students receive programming training at 350 high schools, and where we provide loans to pursue IT-related careers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of National Health Insurance Company (NHIC)?</h4><p>The NHIC was established by the Social Health Insurance law in 2013 to manage and operate the National Health Insurance Scheme, better known as Seha. The project itself stems from the human development pillar of the Qatar National Vision 2030. A key element of this human development pillar recognizes that a productive society needs to be a healthy one. There are several initiatives that revolve around this pillar of the strategy. On the healthcare front, this led to the development of the National Health Strategy (NHS), which evolved into around 40 projects, each of which tackles a necessary development for the transformation of Qatar's healthcare sector. One element of the NHS focuses on the establishment of a social health insurance scheme to provide equitable access to healthcare services for people living in the country. In turn, it also targets bringing greater efficiency and transparency to the operation of the Qatari health care sector. Seha acts as a catalyst for change across both the NHS and other initiatives within the healthcare sector in the country. Additional benefits are, for example, an increase in transparency and data collation from all providers. This, in turn, allows for better planning of the types of issues that are prevalent in the country, trend spotting, and overall planning of the types of facilities, and geographical placements for these efforts. On the macro level, this leads to greater transparency and efficiency in the allocation of healthcare spending by the government.</p><h4>When fully implemented in 2015, what will be the impact of Seha on the healthcare sector when looking at the balance between public and private healthcare providers?</h4><p>A key point to note is that we do not discriminate between public and private healthcare providers. All licensed providers, be they public or private, are welcome to join the scheme. Having said that, Seha is, if anything, more of a boost to the private sector. Healthcare in Qatar has traditionally been dominated by public providers, with only those who could afford it or who had private health insurance seeking out treatment at private facilities. With Seha, the playing field is leveled to a great degree and our members now have access to great quality and choice when selecting a healthcare provider. The competition this creates should over time lead to better quality service. Moreover, giving people access to private healthcare through Seha opens up new opportunities that could spur new private investment in the country's healthcare sector.</p><div class="quote">“The establishment of the NHIC is a significant component in realizing the National Vision 2030."</div><h4>After the completed implementation of Seha, will there still be a role for the private insurance companies in the field of healthcare?</h4><p>The system we are implementing in Qatar is not dissimilar to what you see in many parts of the world, where you have a mandatory scheme that guarantees a minimum level of healthcare for the citizens of a country, with private health insurance available as a supplementary service for those who want it. Private health insurers will therefore have an important role to play in providing supplementary and complementary and potentially quite lucrative coverage for additional services not included under Seha.</p><h4>How does Seha fit in the national objective of elevating standards in Qatari healthcare services?</h4><p>For the insured, Seha offers more choice by providing access to both public and private healthcare providers. This creates competition among providers to attract members, ultimately resulting in higher quality care and better service. Moreover, with more people having access to private healthcare, we should see more private investment in the healthcare sector over the long run, which brings benefits to both individuals and the state. As such, we could see newer, more modern facilities, a wider range of specializations, and better healthcare access in towns and cities across the country. More broadly, Seha plays an enabling role for many of the goals set out in the NHS. The NHS constitutes some 39 projects that seek to transform the healthcare sector in Qatar in a comprehensive and holistic nature, bringing greater efficiency and transparency to the operation of the Qatari healthcare sector. Seha will also be a vehicle to implement international and national standards of care delivery set by the Supreme Council of Health. This will affect the whole pathway of patient care from, amongst other care pathways, prevention to rehabilitation. Seha will lead to the better management of healthcare costs through the implementation of internationally accepted healthcare management systems.</p><h4>What challenges do you expect to arise during the process of full implementation of the Seha program?</h4><p>We are now one year into the scheme. Stage one was launched in July 2013 to cover Qatari national females aged 12 and above for maternity and women's health issues. This was in many ways a pilot, giving our providers and us a chance to ease into the new system with a smaller population group and a restricted set of services. In April 2014 we introduced stage two of Seha, expanding the scheme to cover Qatari nationals of all ages and both genders for the full spectrum of basic healthcare services. The rollout has gone remarkably smoothly thus far, which is a testament to the high levels of cooperation by all parties involved. As of August 23, 2014, we had just over 300,000 doctors and hospital visits by Seha members, 266,000 of which have taken place since the launch of stage two. So in terms of challenges, the hardest part is now behind us. The learning curve for the system itself for future stages will not be as steep as for that of stages one and two. With each stage we learn and improve for the next one, and when we come to future rollout we will be at a point where the requisite systems have been up and running for some time, where providers have become used to the workings of the scheme, and the main challenge boils down to the logistics of accommodating greater numbers.</p><h4>How do you foresee the role of foreign investors in the future of Qatari healthcare?</h4><p>Seha opens up access to private healthcare for its members. This should be a boon to private providers, whose customer base has been limited to those few who can afford private healthcare or who had private insurance, estimated at around 17% at end-2012. As such, over the long run, I would anticipate increased private investment, both foreign and local, in the Qatari healthcare sector.</p><h4>How does the Qatar National Vision 2030 inspire you in managing the NHIC?</h4><p>The establishment of the NHIC is a significant component in realizing the Qatar National Vision 2030. I and the rest of the NHIC team are very conscious of this in everything we do and it does in fact inspire us to do the best job we can to make the vision a reality.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Suriname holds the pro tempore presidency of UNASUR for the 2013-2014 period. Which of UNASUR's objectives have you made your priorities?<br></h4><p>Having been isolated on the continent over the past 400 years because of our colonial history, being a member of UNASUR today means that we are working tirelessly to integrate into the South American community in all sectors, and thereby contributing to the strengthening of its unity. During our pro tempore presidency we continue to encounter challenges in the process of unification. As an organization we try to overcome these by focusing on democratic principles and a shared vision about our joined future, through dialogue. This demonstrates the level of maturity of the integration process. At every UNASUR meeting, it is noticeable how all heads of state are permeated with the significance of their mission. And I am so proud that Suriname was able to not only chair the organization, but also share some of its virtues with the rest of the continent. UNASUR is a young organization and I see a lot of similarities in the stages of development present in our own young country. At this stage it is necessary to reach higher levels of coherence, as well as greater political convergence, in order to build our path to sustainable development in harmony with the environment. Among the strategies we are implementing are a renewed vision on the use of natural resources, the strengthening of our democracies, and the establishment of South America as a nuclear weapons-free zone. Suriname offers the world a unique example of how a multicultural people can live in harmony, by unifying around common interests and adhering to tolerance toward each other's differences.</p><h4>Colombia was chosen to head the South American Defense Council (CSD) with Suriname as co-chair for one year. What is the importance of this collaboration between Colombia and Suriname?</h4><p>Cooperation among UNASUR member states is further implemented through councils. For the first time in the history of the union, Suriname and Colombia hold the chairmanship of the UNASUR Defense Council simultaneously. One of the key issues that the co-chairs have focused on is the protection of natural resources. It is widely known that the South American continent harbors a vast amount of the world's natural resources. UNASUR has a clear vision about utilizing its natural resources for the well-being and welfare of its peoples and the achievement of national development goals. The co-chairmanship of the Defense Council with Colombia has proven useful already. Through the process of consultation required on a constant basis, which results in frequent communication on a wide range of issues and the sharing of knowledge, more information about Colombia now exists. Insight into the interests and circumstances that are underlying Colombia's policies is increasing the collaboration between the two nations in other sectors as well, such as health, energy, and finance. The cooperation between Suriname and Colombia within the Defense Council is conducted on the basis of complete parity. As co-chairs, both Ministers of Defense chair the meetings and are very much aligned. It is inspiring and revealing to observe that two countries with such disparities in their histories of national defense—and subsequently, different national security needs—have been able to apply themselves in such a way so as to support and achieve a common security policy for the region. Meetings at the technical level have been concluded, and it is expected that proposals with regard to the protection of natural resources and cyber crime will be presented at the ministerial level by the end of this year. On another note, we have registered some interesting developments in our private sector regarding Colombian investors. A Colombian cement production company has invested in a joint project in Suriname and is now producing quality cement for our booming housing sector. Also, the State Oil Company is on the brink of cooperating with Ecopetrol to explore and exploit oil, one of the main commodities of our economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the landmark achievements of the period in which Colombia chaired the Pacific Alliance?<br></h4><p>The Pacific Alliance is a fundamental part of the strategy to position Colombia in regional integration initiatives as well as outreach to the Asia Pacific region. One of Colombia's foreign policy priorities has been to strengthen and consolidate this Alliance. Between May 2014, when the VII Presidential Summit of the Pacific Alliance was held in Cali, and June 2014, the date on which Mexico took over the presidency of the Alliance during the IX Summit, Colombia was President Pro Tempore of the Alliance. During this period, we led the negotiations of the Trade Protocol of the Pacific Alliance Framework Agreement, signed in February of 2014 in Cartagena de Indias, and is one of the most important and visible achievements of the Alliance. Another vital aspect of the Alliance to highlight is private sector involvement in the process.</p><h4>What plans does the Ministry have regarding other partnerships such as UNASUR and CARICOM?</h4><p>Colombia is actively involved in UNASUR as we consider it the right platform to strengthen political dialogue and promote cooperation, as well as the economic and social development of South American countries. It is also a mechanism to carry out actions, programmes and integration initiatives in areas such as infrastructure, health, energy, education, and culture, and against transnational organized crime. Moreover, UNASUR has played an important role in supporting and monitoring electoral processes that have been carried out in the countries of the region. As for the Caribbean Community—CARICOM, Colombia is an Observer State.</p><h4>How do you assess the benefits of the FTA with the US?</h4><p>More than 1,600 companies that had not sold anything to the United States between May 2010 and December 2011 did so within 20 months of the agreement coming into force. Most of these companies (75.9%) are from the manufacturing sector, 12.9% are dedicated to clothing manufacture, while others (10.2%) produce agro-industrial goods and a small number (1%) provide editorial services.</p><p>Since May 2012, when the Agreement came into force, 350 products not traded between both countries in the two years prior to the agreement have been marketed in the United States. In those 20 months, the country sold to the US market a total of $32.2 million, among which, 82.4% are mining and energy exports and the remaining 17.6% are agribusiness, industry and agriculture products. Imports totalled $26.200 million, of which over 90% includes machinery, raw materials and intermediate goods and 80.7% of these imports are goods that are not produced in the country.</p><h4>What have been the main achievements of your government regarding environmental issues?</h4><p>One of the main achievements is the encouragement and leadership of Colombia in the process of formulation of Sustainable Development Goals as part of the new post-2015 UN Development Agenda. Here, we seek to generate structural changes in our economies and societies to irreversibly overcome poverty and preserve the planet. Under Colombia's leadership, the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean (AILAC) was established as a formal negotiating group of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to move towards development models with lower carbon emissions resilient to the adverse effects of climate change. Among other key moments, in April 2014, Medellí­n hosted the VII World Urban Forum (WUF VII), considered historically the most successful. The forum sent a strong message to the world through the Medellí­n Declaration, highlighting the importance of cities in the new development agenda. Regarding chemicals, we signed the Minamata Convention on Mercury, along with 94 counties. We have been awarded the "Mercury Club Bronze Award" from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) for being a leading country in the negotiation process to mitigate the adverse impacts of mercury on the environment and human health. We hosted the 10th Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention, the so-called miracle of Cartagena for achieving the landmark agreement that prohibits developed countries from exporting hazardous waste to developing countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2012, the EU approved a multilateral trade agreement with Colombia and Peru in order to promote trade between the two nations and the EU. How is this cooperation reinforcing commercial relations in each country?<br></h4><p>There is a long tradition in Peru and Colombia in working together on integration projects, such as the Andean Community, which was established in 1969, and the Pacific Alliance, which came about in 2011. The agreement that we both have signed with the EU equally benefits our countries, as well as creating new opportunities for us to pursue in the future with optimism. Besides the multiple benefits of every trade agreement, this one strengthens cooperation between Colombia and Peru by promoting similar trade and investment policies. This homogenization also includes social issues, for example, democratic clauses, and the commitment to defend the human rights of citizens.</p><h4>In June 2013, Peru and Colombia signed the Plan de Desarrollo de la Zona de Integración Fronteriza. Why is border integration important for both nations, and how is this plan impacting populations settled in the border regions?</h4><p>Peru's border integration area comprises more than 2 million km2 and five neighboring countries. Colombia and Peru share around 277,000 km2 of border integration area, with more than 600,000 persons in poverty and extreme poverty living in that area. It is a particularly vulnerable borderland, not only because of its difficult accessibility and population dispersion, but also because it encompasses an important area of the Amazon rainforest, which involves the need for sustainable development programs and projects. The signing of the Plan de Desarrollo de la Zona de Integración Fronteriza is a sample of both countries intention to have a tool to guide common initiatives to seize the opportunities of border integration. We are looking forward to an intense work agenda in order to achieve positive results in the coming years. In this regard, I would like to highlight the recent creation of our National Commission on Border Development, which certainly will allow us to facilitate our common agenda. The challenge for Colombia and Peru is to integrate our countries effectively in those border areas, where it has always been more difficult for our states to arrive and provide adequate services to our populations.</p><h4>What are the advantages of the Pacific Alliance for Colombia and Peru?</h4><p>Peru and Colombia, together with Mexico and Chile, are part of the Pacific Alliance, which aims to promote economic, political, as well as social union within the four countries. The Pacific Alliance is, indeed, one of the most successful integration mechanisms in the region. It is also an effective platform for different cooperative projects beyond trade and investment. As I mentioned before, Peru and Colombia share an important Amazon rainforest area. Thus, every single intention of economic growth projects in the borderland between our countries must be linked to sustainable development concepts. There is no doubt that environmental issues and sustainable development projects will also be an important part of the Pacific Alliance commitment to the world. In 2010, Mexico held the UN Climate Change Conference and, in 2014, Peru will be the host. This is certainly a great chance for us to highlight the relevance of sustainable development concepts in economic growth and development projects.</p><h4>In 2011, President Humala and President Santos met in order to discuss the common ground and strong bonds between Peru and Colombia. What is your opinion on future bilateral relations between the two nations?</h4><p>Peru and Colombia have not only similar opportunities toward development, but also akin threats and obstacles to overcome. Bilateral meetings, as well as signed agreements and integration mechanisms, serve as instruments to strengthen our relations. I firmly believe our future with Colombia is positive and full of promise. During the past few years, we have been working effectively in different areas, such as border region development and our active participation in the Pacific Alliance, which will allow both countries to provide the world with plentiful investment and trade opportunities, and to attract international cooperation in order to continue making efforts toward social inclusion and sustainable development projects. In my opinion, we can talk about firm joint development policies if we try to project bilateral relations between Colombia and Peru.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you comment on the mutual commitment that exists between the UK and Colombia?<br></h4><p>Both governments understand the potential opportunities that exist to increase trade and job creation. Two years ago, we committed to doubling our bilateral trade by 2015. Since then, we have worked tirelessly to achieve this objective. And I am pleased to announce, still a year from the target date, that we have reached our goal. The UK has become the second largest foreign investor in Colombia and is increasingly present in trade, in business services, automotive, and retail, as well as in the machinery and equipment sectors.</p><h4>What is the growth potential of this relationship?</h4><p>This is still just a fraction of the growth we could achieve. Only 1.4% of UK exports come to Latin America as a whole. For example, a market the size of Colombia is roughly equal to that of South Africa. But despite this fact, there are many more British companies in South Africa than in Colombia. Now is the time when Colombia is emerging as one of the leading markets in Latin America, with an economy that is increasingly open; it has a large labor force, and a huge customer base that has a strong interest in British goods and services.</p><h4>What do you perceive as the UK's strengths in advancing this bilateral relationship?</h4><p>The government of Colombia has committed to ambitious reforms that will open up the economy and ensure a more stable and prosperous future. So, it's time for us to improve our game. That's why I'm here at the “Business is Great" event as one of the highest representatives of the British government ever to visit Bogotá. I have also brought the largest delegation of high-level British companies ever to have visited Colombia. To show that we mean business, the governments of the UK and Colombia are establishing an even higher objective—to increase our bilateral trade to £4 billion by 2020. This would triple the size of UK exports to Colombia over the next six years.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on the main agreements that will help you meet your goal for 2020?</h4><p>Firstly, in energy, UK oil and gas company Amerisur Resources will be investing $700 million over the next three years to help Colombia meet its energy needs. The British company BG Group has also signed an agreement with Shell to acquire a 30stake in Shell's oil exploration areas off the coast of the Guajira. Secondly, in the transport sector, with a new agreement for £47.3 million, British railway specialist Holdtrade Atlantico will help Colombia transport its goods more easily and competitively around the world.</p><p>Finally, Colombia is playing a decisive role in determining the objectives of international sustainable development areas for the future. British company Lifesaver, which provides water purification systems, is to participate in a program valued at £30 million to provide drinking water to the poorest communities of Colombia. Also, the engineering firm Atkins has won a $500,000 tender to produce sustainability plans for the city of Cali through the Eco City Program. These are just some examples of the range and variety of British companies and organizations that can succeed in Colombia. This includes education and research: these are two fundamental areas for us to develop the skills and innovations that will strengthen the future growth areas of our countries.</p><h4>Regarding education and innovation, what is your vision for the development of the mutual relationship?</h4><p>As a graduate of the London School of Economics, President Santos knows that the UK is home to some of the world's best universities, colleges, and schools. We have a wealth of knowledge available to help Colombia in its reforms and invest in its education system. I am pleased to announce that, with the generous support of Amerisur Resources, we will now triple the number of Chevening scholarships to study in the UK.</p><p>I am also pleased to announce a new fund of £4 million for science and innovation in Colombia, which will strengthen research collaboration between our two countries. The fund will go hand in hand with our new Innovation Award. This award recognizes the best research collaborations between the UK and Colombia and will focus on finding solutions to the major social challenges facing Colombia, thus allowing people to find more information about how to participate in trade between the UK and Colombia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The Congress of the Republic and the government I have the honor to preside over can show a positive balance to the nation because, since 2010, we have achieved changes and reforms that have transformed and will continue to transform the lives of our countrymen for the better. The laws and constitutional amendments that were approved during this time are building a new Colombia, one that moves toward peace with social prosperity and that sets ambitious goals such as being the most educated nation in the region and bringing about the complete eradication of extreme poverty.<br></p><p>In developing a doctrine in which I have believed for a long time, the 'Third Way,' we have proven that major changes are best achieved with thoughtful and well-implemented reforms rather than with revolutions or arbitrary acts of power. We passed more than 300 laws and constitutional reforms, projects that many said were impossible to bring about, and which now stand out not only for their quantity, but also for their quality. These acts of legislation include royalty distribution reform, the law on land use planning, and the law on victims and land restitution. This legislative work has enabled our economy to become strong and dynamic, recognized and praised all over the world. It has also generated the resources necessary to advance an inclusive social policy. They are progressive laws, which have given Colombians more guarantees regarding respect for their rights, as well as giving global investors the confidence to plant the seeds of progress in our soil. I am sure that we will achieve as good or even better results with the new Congress, continuing to work toward what is best for our country.</p><p>Amidst this positive outlook, there are still many challenges we must address. We have created unprecedented levels of employment, with two and a half million jobs, most of them formal, but there are still a similar number of unemployed people. We have lifted millions of Colombians out of poverty and started to reduce inequality for the first time; however, one in 10 Colombians still lives below the poverty line. And, above all, our biggest challenge, a challenge that is possible to overcome, is to end the armed conflict that has bled us for over half a century, and build a lasting peace. Congress played a key role in preparing the path to achieve this, with legislation benefiting victims, and reforms that have established the applicability of transitional justice. The new Congress will have in its hands the enormous responsibility of supporting the implementation of the agreements and to legislate for a new, post-conflict nation.</p><p>Colombia is changing. It is leaving the burdens of war and hatred behind. When the time comes, the task this Congress will have at hand will be to pass the statutory law developing the legal framework for peace. The idea is not to sacrifice justice to achieve peace. The idea is to achieve peace while ensuring the maximum justice—a justice that respects the rights of victims. And then we will have our great task as a nation: the post-conflict era, which we shall assume from the perspective of reconciliation and opportunities.</p><p>What we want is that all Colombians may access the circle of opportunities and start generating income and improving the situation of their families. We want is for the regions to continue empowering themselves, and for the most remote areas of the country to become incorporated into the process of national development. Peace will generate greater trust and investment. It will attract tourism, and will allow us to allocate more resources to what Colombia needs the most: education, health, housing, public services, agricultural development, technology, entrepreneurship, and innovation. If the Colombian economy was the fastest growing economy in Latin America during the first quarter this year, second only to China in the whole world, just imagine our potential without the conflict. Peace must come hand in hand with social prosperity.</p><p>Social gaps in our country are still very large, and therefore public spending should be focused and targeted toward correcting inequality and increasing opportunities. More victims should be compensated and farmers should be able to recover the land that was forcefully taken from them. We need to provide more housing for the poorest and more basic services for those who do not have them. We need to connect all municipalities to broadband internet, and to develop the most ambitious highway program yet, which will create jobs and prosperity.</p><p>We want a Colombia in which all students in public schools enjoy free education, with more young people being trained at SENA's (National Learning Service) education programs, and more beneficiaries of zero real interest loans from Icetex (Colombian Institute for Educational Credit and Studies Abroad). We want to see more senior citizens and Families in Action receiving financial support, and more children in early childhood receiving comprehensive support services.</p><p>We must turn our energy and efforts to the countryside so we can compensate for 50 or more years of neglect and backwardness. The Rural Mission and the Great Agrarian Pact “A Countryside for Everyone" are underway, and we are meeting our commitments with farm laborers and agricultural producers. This Congress will have three bills in store that will complete the task. The first one is the Rural Development Act, which adopts a territorial approach to rural development, and requires that policies and investment decisions are made in each locality, giving priority to the most vulnerable. The second bill is the Barren Land and High Plains Development Act.</p><p>Today the world is demanding more food than ever before and the FAO has identified Colombia as one of the seven countries with the greatest agricultural potential on the planet. That is why we have to provide clear rules and legal security to those who want to invest in the high plains, a region with an enormous potential where the agricultural industry and the rural peasant economy can coexist in harmony and mutually benefit each other. There will be a third bill to formalize rural land ownership, to help farmers to register their land with legal security and stop land dispossession.</p><p>In the field of education, we have taken important steps in the early childhood program, with free education in public schools through the “Everybody Learn" program; increased slots and resources in higher education; and the great challenge of further improving the quality of education, including the promotion of excellence in teaching and the gradual implementation of the single school day. That is our challenge if we are to reach the standards of other countries that have grown because they have focused their efforts in the formation of children and youth. We are aware of this and that is why, in 2015, the education budget will, for the first time ever, be the highest among all sectors, including defense.</p><p>With regard to health, I would like to start by thanking Congress for approving the statutory health law, which establishes health as a fundamental right and is the first statute of a social right in the 23 years of our Constitution. We need to finally overcome the effects of the financial crisis, which involves the payment of debts with hospitals and the definition of conditions of financial empowerment and stricter oversight for the EPS (Health Promotion Entities). Finally, we have to continue improving the quality and timeliness of health services. We have already achieved universal coverage. Benefit plans have been leveled. We have included hundreds of drugs and treatments in the benefits plan, and drug prices are under control. Our commitment must now focus on quality and prevention.</p><p>Our government has maintained the offensive against illegal armed groups, criminal gangs, and common crime. Proof of this is that not only did the top two leaders of the FARC fall in combat, but more than 50 heads of fronts or columns were also neutralized. Crime rates such as murder and kidnapping are at the lowest levels in more than three decades, all thanks to our Military Forces and the National Police. We will continue to strengthen and modernize our law enforcement, and will continue working for their legal security, their well being and that of their families. We will increase their number by another 25,000 police officers, since in the first term of this government we increased their number by a similar number to ensure public safety, which remains an absolute priority. Furthermore, we will submit the new Police Code to the consideration of Congress, with exemplary corrective measures and more clout for the authorities to fulfill their task.</p><p>Environmental issues will also play a key role in our new term in office. We declared the Estrella Fluvial de Iní­rida (Iní­rida River Star) as an area of international importance; we doubled the size of the Chiribiquete National Park; we promoted the law that puts an end to the use of mercury in mining and industry; and we presented to the world a successful proposal to meet Sustainable Development Goals. We need to urgently improve the regional management of our environment and therefore we will bring a reform to Congress we have been judiciously preparing, for the CAR (Regional Autonomous Corporations) and the National Environmental System. We will also introduce legislation to protect Moors, which are special water sources in our country.</p><p>Colombia is now breathing new air. We are confident in our capacities and in our future. The world is looking at us with admiration and expectation, and every day we can travel to more countries without the burdensome requirement of visas. The possibility of a new Colombia is in our hands: a Colombia that can join in the cheerful game play of our national football team and instill pride and unity among its citizens. Hopefully, in four years time, we will deliver to our successors and to the next generation a country of which we can all feel proud. A country of opportunities, a country of peace.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Juan Manuel Santos visited Spain in January 2014, his third official visit since he was elected. Could you comment on this historic relationship and how this meeting served to strengthen ties?<br></h4><p>Relations between Colombia and Spain are a good example of multi-partisan continuity in foreign affairs. Regardless of the political orientation of any given government, our bilateral relations are stable, with an intensity only comparable to the bonds that unite us, and our level of understanding. However, when I arrived in government, I wanted to give Colombia the prominence it deserves in Spain's foreign policy. Colombia is now one of the best allies of Spain in the world. Along with Mexico, Colombia was the first country I officially visited as President of the Government of Spain, in April 2012. In May 2013, I returned to Colombia to participate in the Summit of the Pacific Alliance in Cali. President Santos also came to Spain in 2012 for the Ibero-American Summit of Cádiz, and in 2013 he made a stopover that ended up having such fruitful content that it was more of a working visit. Notably, His Majesty King Juan Carlos attended the inauguration of President Santos' second term in office. This was an exceptional trip, the first since his abdication and the first such event he had attended in decades. It is no coincidence that Colombia was the chosen country.</p><h4>Juan Manuel Santos has hailed your initiative of eliminating visa requirements for brief stays by Colombians in the EU. What makes this goal so important for the Spanish government and what did the diplomatic effort to convince Brussels entail?</h4><p>The initiative to persuade the EU to revoke the Schengen visa requirement for Colombia and Peru implied an intense diplomatic offensive, meant to explain the new reality of Colombia. My government and the ambassadors of Spain in the 28 European capitals were mobilized for this purpose. With strong arguments, conviction and determination, we went from just one single country in favor—Portugal—to full consensus in less than three months. Spain showed, with concrete evidence, that it strongly supports Colombia. This initiative was an act of justice. Hence its relevance: there has been a recognition of Colombia's progress, and of the contribution to our development of the hundreds of thousands of Colombians living in the EU. In Spain there are about 400,000 Colombians, a number that decreases as they acquire Spanish citizenship and become dual nationals (more than 200,000 since 2000), demonstrating their perfect integration. Now, for the first time since 2001, their families will come to visit them and they will be able to be together again without the difficulty of the visa requirement. It is an initiative that benefits citizens and, as such, is extremely positive. It is also an acknowledgment of the progress of Colombia in recent years, particularly in terms of economic growth, international integration, security, and social cohesion. The efforts, perseverance, and sacrifices of Colombians have paid off. Colombia's recent governments have made a wise bet in trade liberalization, legal certainty and security. The Multiparty Trade Agreement between the EU, Colombia, and Peru, which entered into force on August 1, 2013, provided a great argument for the abolition of the Schengen visa requirement. Colombia could not be the only country in Latin America, along with Peru, from which the EU required a visa despite having a free trade agreement (FTA) in force. Colombians had to be able to perceive that free trade is good and benefits them directly. With this initiative, Colombians will soon be able to access, without a visa, the largest area of free movement in the world. I believe that, in early 2015, the Schengen visa will have become history for our beloved Colombians.</p><h4>You have declared that you “believe that the Pacific Alliance is a magnificent idea. It represents many opportunities, more freedom, greater legal certainty and, above all, more jobs, wealth and well-being, here in Spain and throughout Europe." What is the significance of maintaining a close relation with this alliance for Spain?</h4><p>My government has paid special attention to the Pacific Alliance since the beginning. The Framework for the Pacific Alliance Agreement was signed in Cerro Paranal on June 6, 2012. Spain became the fifth observer state, the first from the EU, five months later. Today, there are 32 observer states, including the US and China. Spain must differentially support those countries that believe in trade openness, legal security, and clear and predictable game rules. These countries have strong and independent political institutions that give confidence to investors and public welfare. It is the economic integration process that resembles the most to that of the EU and that has never been seen before in Latin America.</p><p>Like the EU, the Pacific Alliance has four fundamental objectives: free movement of goods (and the creation of a comprehensive internal market), services, capital, and people. The Pacific Alliance is getting closer and closer to a real and deep integration. To mention only a recent achievement, the incorporation of Mexico into the Integrated Latin American Market (MILA), announced at the IX Summit of the Pacific Alliance in May in Punta Mita (Mexico), means the creation of the largest stock exchange in Latin America in terms of capitalization and number of trading companies, rising from 565 to 986, on an increase of 43%. Let me stress that I wish the same level of success to Mercosur as to the Pacific Alliance. I believe in integration in itself because, as a European citizen myself, I know about its benefits for citizens. The concept of integration implies openness, inwardly and outwardly. I also support the development of Mercosur and of it's relations with the Pacific Alliance, which could boost intra-regional trade, so far limited to 20%.</p><h4>What areas will Spain and Colombia focus on, and how do you foresee relations between both nations developing in the medium term?</h4><p>Colombia and Spain must constantly raise their level of ambition in terms of bilateral relations. We are two countries with a special tune and therefore a willingness to cooperate in all areas. Spain has long been betting on Colombia. Spain has been betting on Colombia for a long time. We have never had doubts about Colombia's capacity to overcome the adversity of conflict. If a peace agreement is finally reached, as it is our wish, Spain will be there, offering whatever cooperation Colombia may need. On the other hand, we have numerous companies with international experience that are already contributing to the development of the infrastructure that Colombia needs, as illustrated by the expansion and modernization of the iconic El Dorado airport in Bogotá, among other examples.</p><p>Climate change, rural development, science and technology, energy, and talent mobility are just a few areas we can work together on. Nothing from Colombia is alien to us, and everything that is Colombian interests us. In fact, we should note that despite the crisis, Spain's investment in Colombia continued to increase, from ‚¬5.79 billion in 2010 to ‚¬6.12 billion in 2012, an increase of 5.7%. The increase in Spanish exports to Colombia is spectacular; between 2009 and 2013, exports rose by 97.2%. With the entry into force of the Multiparty Trade Agreement between the EU and Colombia on August 1, 2013, we can expect that our trade to increase further and reach the level we should aspire to. Spain also needs Colombia, especially its companies, and the talent and resourcefulness of Colombians. Colombian companies are internationalizing, in Central America in particular. It's time for them to come with conviction and determination to Spain, which offers nothing less than the entry door to the world's largest integrated market, the EU. I think we should target higher Colombian investment in Spain, a figure that currently stands at only 30 million. In this sense, we need to take advantage of the full potential of the Multiparty Trade Agreement in force between Colombia and the EU. This FTA includes a national treatment clause, by which Colombian companies may invest in Spain like Spanish companies, with the same facilities and without discrimination. I hereby encourage Colombian companies to invest in Spain, with a long-term perspective, taking advantage of this great new opportunity. Finally, Spain will continue to support Colombia in its further international integration, as we have done for the country's coming entry into the OECD, the club of good government practices for the most advanced countries. Colombia also helps Spain, as it did for our entry into the Pacific Alliance as an observer state. As I said at the Universidad Sergio Arboleda in Bogotá when I received its Doctorate Honoris Causa on April 19, 2012: I believe in Colombia, and I say it wherever I go.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2013, Trinidad and Tobago held the Chairmanship of the Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM. How is CARICOM's reform process proceeding, and which of its objectives have you prioritized?<br></h4><p>During the conference I stated that CARICOM is conscientiously working toward creating a more efficient integration movement. The process of reform in the community has also been proceeding apace, and we have been seeking the input of all our stakeholders via consultations undertaken by a team of change facilitators, led by the secretary general. To date, national consultations in all member states and two associate members have been completed. With respect to the Draft Strategic Plan for the Caribbean Community 2015-2019, which was presented to the Heads, it is integral that the plan, once approved, becomes a living, vital document for our community and should be used as a standard for assessing our performance and progress. Trinidad and Tobago wholly supports the thrust of the proposed vision, mission, and core values for the Community, which were formulated through engagement in a broad, public process. The six integrated strategic priorities—building economic; social; environmental; and technological resilience; and strengthening the CARICOM identity, spirit of community, and community governance—have further been elaborated into a strategic framework. The integration of the strategic priorities is important as we must seek to avoid an entangled landscape of overlapping programs with inconsistent goals.</p><h4>Colombia is Trinidad and Tobago's third largest import partner. What is the importance of this trade relationship, what tariff benefits does it enjoy and what competitive exports can the country offer Colombia in order to boost bilateral commerce?</h4><p>In 2011, Colombia was recorded as Trinidad and Tobago's third largest import partner, with imports from Colombia accounting for approximately 11% of total imports for Trinidad and Tobago. An analysis of the trade between both countries revealed that Trinidad and Tobago recorded a negative, primarily declining trade balance with Colombia during the period 2006-2011. We are the leading CARICOM exporter to and importer from Colombia. Our exports are significantly composed of energy products and include other liquefied petroleum gases, natural gas, urea, anhydrous ammonia, methanol, and bars and rods of non-alloy steel, while our imports from Colombia include other sugar, other raw cane sugar, palm oil and its fractions, and coconut, palm kernel, and babassu oil. My government regards Colombia as an important trading partner as Trinidad and Tobago is focused on expanding access to markets in Central and Latin America given their geographical proximity. Colombia is regarded as an interesting and viable market for CARICOM.</p><h4>Trinidad and Tobago's Health Minister, HE Dr. Khan, said he intends to visit Colombia to seek specialists. What is your government's vision of what Colombia's health sector can offer your nation?</h4><p>A high level team from our Ministry of Health visited Colombia in 2013. The team visited several health institutions in Bogotá, Medellí­n, Barranquilla, and Cali to gain exposure specific to the clinical operations of high-quality medical institutions in Colombia, and to discuss the provision of low-priced medical services, the recruitment of foreign healthcare professionals, and the training of local medical practitioners. A follow up visit by our Chief Medical Officer and several consultants in the fields of cardiology, oncology, and pathology is currently being planned. Colombia has been interested in developing health linkages with Trinidad and Tobago, and we welcome the opportunity to partner with Colombia as my government strives to provide quality and affordable healthcare to our citizens.</p><h4>Last year, Colombia's Foreign Relations Minister, HE Holguin, agreed to convene a meeting of airlines to examine the prospects of enhancing air links in the wider Caribbean and South America. How is Trinidad and Tobago advancing toward better air links with its Latin American partners, and what benefits do you see in linking with Colombia?</h4><p>In June 2013, consultations on airline connectivity were held in Santo Domingo in the context of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS). Trinidad and Tobago's Minister of Foreign Affairs was present at the meeting. Discussions centered on the potentially great synergies between our local national airline, Caribbean Airlines (CAL), and AVIANCA, which could be beneficial to Colombia and Trinidad and Tobago as well as Latin America and the Caribbean. Officials from CAL and AVIANCA have agreed to examine potential scenarios for fares, schedules, payloads, new routes, and/or sharing existing routes. With my government's initiative to aggressively target the emerging markets of Latin America, improved air links with Colombia would offer another incentive for potential investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for Colombian foreign trade for the near future, and what strategies are you implementing to strengthen the industrial network within the framework of the free trade agreements (FTAs) Colombia has signed?<br></h4><p>Colombia has developed into a country that generates opportunities; Colombian producers, for example, have access to over 1.4 billion consumers without tariffs and tax barriers. And this is thanks to the several FTAs we have signed over the past few years. Colombia's economic model is a successful one, based on international integration, stability, and growth. For these and other reasons, Colombia has increased its GDP and reduced poverty levels—over the past three years, more than 2.5 million people in the country have risen out of poverty. In this context, we have expanded the Colombian middle class and considerably reduced unemployment levels nationwide. This environment has encouraged many Colombian companies and entrepreneurs to look abroad for new markets, taking advantage of the internal situation and the continued international integration of our economy. Having said that, the energy and mining sectors still account for a rather large share of the total. Therefore, the challenge is to diversify both exports and destination markets. We plan to achieve this with modern and active industrial policies based on innovative production processes and chains, and the internationalization of our companies. Additionally, we aim to increase the competitiveness of our industry through tax and regulatory frameworks for this purpose.</p><h4>How is the Ministry targeting a further integration of production chains between sectors and regions of the country?</h4><p>This undertaking is key to the industrial strengthening of the regions. I truly think that the establishment of sectorial clusters in the regions will bring about industrial development and the integration of production chains, as the areas around those clusters develop industrial activity geared toward them. In this context, such steps will make it easier for the Colombian industrial network to establish links with the main economic sectors, boosting the industrial development of the country without leaving behind the regions. In this context, I think the Pacific Alliance is also set to play a key role in achieving this integration of production chains not only in our country, but also in all markets within the Alliance, making us more competitive at the international level.</p><h4>How was 2013 for Colombia from an industrial perspective, and what are your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>In 2013, we saw an overall drop in international demand and must accept that it was not an encouraging year economically at the international level. That led to lost dynamism in our industrial sector. For this reason, the government implemented ambitious plans to reactivate certain sectors like construction and infrastructure. Moreover, the state provided favorable funding tools for the modernization of the industrial sector, and protectionist policies for Colombian producers facing unfair competition. These measures led to an increase in production based on innovation by late 2013 that continued into early 2014. We expect to continue along this line and to close the year with industrial production growth of between 3.5% and 4%.</p><h4>Could you tell us a bit more about the Country Vision 2019 and 2032?</h4><p>Public policies must have a long-term vision that contributes to the transformation of the production system in Colombia. Innovation is the key word among our strategies; we allocate 10% of profits from the energy sector to boost innovation, and introduce tax concessions for those investing in R&amp;D, among other incentives. In this context, institutions like Colciencias are set to become more relevant over the next few years. Our main goal from the government's perspective is to transform Colombia's production system in order to export more goods and products of higher value-added, which will eventually increase the competitive level of our companies and, by extension, our economy. This is something we have to undertake by uniting the public and private sectors with a common objective.</p><h4>What role do Colciencias and iNNpulsa Colombia play in this process?</h4><p>Overall, the government allocates a large part of its budget to the promotion of innovation. In this context, iNNpulsa Colombia aims to promote entrepreneurship among Colombian society, as well as strengthen regional institutionalization supports at work in this field, such as the chambers of commerce and business incubators. Meanwhile, Colciencias focuses on science and the educational development of Colombian citizens within the technological, scientific, and innovative fields. Colciencias is set to boost human capital through closer ties with the higher education network in the country.</p><h4>How will hosting the international assembly of the World Tourism Organization in Medellí­n in 2015 impact the development of the tourism sector?</h4><p>The tourism industry is one of the economic sectors set to gain in relevance to the national economy. In fact, our faith in this sector allows us to target the 4 million visitor per year mark. We will implement actions to create unique and differentiated tourism experiences for our visitors and position as many Colombian destinations as possible as top tourism venues in the international arena, such as the Coffee Route, the Caribbean coast, and the Amazon. Nowadays, the tourism industry generates 1.6 million jobs, and through our ambitious strategy we expect to increase this and other metrics within the sector. Colombia is a highly diversified country and has much to offer visitors, and we must now establish the conditions to make a visit thoroughly appealing, such as package offerings, flight connections, and human resources training to strengthen our position in the sector.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the development of the Colombian economy?<br></h4><p>Currently, our main economic partners, namely the US and Europe, are growing slowly. In addition, with regard to commodities, we observe that China, despite impressive growth in recent years, has seen its economy grow at lower rates than before. However, we should highlight that one of the commodity prices that has remained pretty stable is that of oil, which is one of the most important for our economy. This global economic context has had a negative impact on our economy; nevertheless, it has been expanding at a moderate pace of 3.5%-4%. We are optimistic that positive economic prospects for 2014 at an international level will give us a further boost, as rising demand in markets such as the US and Europe will allow us to take advantage of recently signed free trade agreements (FTAs).</p><h4>Which trends do you see in the development of the national economy?</h4><p>From our own statistics, it is difficult to guess, since we serve a segment the output of which is mostly focused either on generating sufficient economic income to make a living or on generating profits in traditional activities (rather low on technology or innovation). For this reason, we do not identify special trends in the segments in which we work; however, from a broader perspective, we believe that the most interesting growth is taking place in the sectors that are being promoted under the Programa de Transformación Productiva, which has been developed by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism.</p><h4>What is your take on the housing market?</h4><p>Our institution was established in 1982 to support small enterprises in Colombia. In 2003, the government decided to boost the expansion of social housing, and we were directed to step into that particular segment by providing guarantees to people who wanted to purchase these housing units. Ever since then, we have focused on the lower end of the market and the Vivienda de Interes Prioritario program. Nevertheless, our participation in this segment is rather limited: it only represents 3% of our overall activity, whereas the remaining 97% is business activity. From 2014, we will also most likely have subsidies available through a special program in cooperation with the Ministry of Housing called “86,000 housing units," so that the cost of our guarantees will be covered by the government, rather than being paid for by the borrower. Also, this program has other types of subsidies and economic support for people making use of it. For example, it provides economic support to cover the down payment, and the interest rate on the loan will be below market levels.</p><h4>What are the general requirements when applying for guarantees from FNG?</h4><p>It is simple, actually. If you are an SME that would be entitled to obtain a bank loan, you simply have to comply with the bank's requirements. In fact, banks have the last word on whether to grant guarantees within a maximum amount assigned by FNG to each institution. The whole process is done over the internet between the bank and FNG and the SME does not have to do any paperwork. We mainly target banks, because we believe that by doing so we can facilitate access to credit for many people.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>In 2013, we are going to guarantee loans in excess of $5 billion. In terms of future prospects, FNG has been growing along with SMEs in Colombia and the dynamic is working well. I would say that we will close 2013 on around 4% growth, but that this figure should improve in 2014. In the longer term, I foresee a sustained growth scenario for the national economy. We have made significant progress over the past few years regarding the business environment, but more must be done.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your basic strategic goals for Colombia?<br></h4><p>The bank has four areas of intervention in the country, the first being institutional. What we have is countries that are advancing in economic and social terms, but governments and private sector institutions that are not upgrading in tandem. On the governmental side, one key problem in the case of Colombia is the inability to manage investments well. We are working extensively with the national government and the National Investment Agency (NIA), which oversees the $25 billion infrastructure program. In general terms, the government is behind what we would like to see as actual investment management. This is particularly important for sub-national governments that have responsibility for 30% of public expenditure and over 50% for investment. We have worked on a credit line of $600 million for sub-national governments to be invested in two sectors, the first being fiscal and managerial capabilities.</p><h4>Unemployment in Colombia has decreased to 9.3%. What are your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>I think that Colombia is one of the three or four countries in Latin America that could make the jump within the next 20 years to becoming a developed country. In order to do so, we need to focus on competitiveness. Colombia is now at the crossroads; it could be considered a middle-income country. This title means that the country has grown roughly by 4% every year from $5,000 per capita to $10,000 in 20 years. However, the economy is not sufficiently diversified, and infrastructure is not yet adequate, while institutions and the business class are not fully modern. There are those who are aware that competition is a key to growth, and those who fear it and seek subsidies. If we were all to work toward being competitive, I believe that unemployment would fall even further and that Colombia would attain the status of high-income country.</p><h4>The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has signed a loan with the Colombian government for $40 million to address climate change. What is the significance of this project?</h4><p>Up to 25% of our work portfolio must be dedicated to climate change according to an agreement we have with country members. I think that there is caution over climate change. Nobody can deny that whatever we can do to reduce our carbon footprint is good for the economy and for humankind. We are working on a new energy model by trying to shift from carbon-based to renewable energies. On the other hand, public income comprises just 14%-16% of GDP in Colombia, compared to over 20% in similar countries in the Americas, such as Brazil at 34%, or the US at 36%. In a country with 14%-16% of public income, you have to think hard about what you are doing in terms of new technologies that might not be ready to be sustained in financial terms. We are currently financing a $40-million renovation of the bus fleet of Bogotá in a shift from diesel to hybrids. We think hard about the consequences of the shift because the good part of the story is that we are going to have less carbon emissions. The bad part of the story is the cost involved. The problem is that if the cost of this technology is such that you cannot pay for it with the tariffs that the local government is willing to impose on the public, the operation of these buses has to be subsidized by the voters. With public income at 14%-16% of GDP, I have to wonder which hospital, school, or street is not going to be maintained correctly, or not going to be built. We do not want to push in the direction of new technologies if these are incompatible with the fiscal side of the equation. We are being responsible by both pushing forward with a new energy model, while maintaining fiscal responsibility.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Cauca Valley has managed to attract and successfully host international events such as the VII Pacific Alliance Summit and the World Games of 2013. How has the region worked to better position itself in the international arena?<br></h4><p>Those involved in regional development have the common goal of building trust. Fortunately, too, Cali and the region are two prosperous areas of Colombia that for unfortunate reasons suffered from serious deterioration in the past. However, over the past few years, the local authorities, along with the national government, have worked to turn that situation around. This is why building trust is important, and I have to say that we have succeeded so far.</p><h4>What advantages does the Pacific Alliance offer to the Valle del Cauca region?</h4><p>I think such initiatives are key to strengthening the formalization of employment in the region. For example, our free trade zone (FTZ) brought in a business model that hadn't been implemented here before. Such elements boost the industrialization of the region, too, improving the development of regional cities and generating employment opportunities.</p><h4>What role does CELPA play in the government's efforts to generate formal employment opportunities linked to the development of Buenaventura?</h4><p>We operate in a city where unemployment and informal employment once had a major impact on the local economy. I would even say that the ports were the only two entities generating significant formal employment opportunities before our arrival. In this context, we were established in 2012, and we implemented an employment strategy along with the national government that included large investments and the generation of qualified human resources that, in turn, made investment in our FTZ more attractive. In this context, we started implementing training courses in 2H2013 to teach a broader section of the local population about the technical and operational aspects of FTZs.</p><h4>How relevant is the Maritime Port of Buenaventura for Colombia? What role does CELPA play in the development of the Port of Buenaventura?</h4><p>Colombia offers a highly attractive, competitive, and interesting FTZ business model. In this context, CELPA enjoys a privileged geostrategic location next to the main maritime infrastructure on the Pacific coast, which handles roughly 50% of Colombia's foreign trade. This activity impacts Colombia's entire economy. CELPA is the base, offering services that address the demands and requirements of the Port of Buenaventura. The port is in a process of specialization and we are the industrial and logistics platform that will achieve this.</p><h4>What are CELPA's plans to develop the 348,000-sqm site?</h4><p>We plan to invest $50 million in the urbanization and development of infrastructure in the FTZ. Currently, we have already invested $15 million as part of the first stage of development of the overall project. We are aware that we hold in our hands a promising and interesting project; however, we need to build trust among the investor community, which is only achieved by demonstrating the tangible development of the project itself. In this context, certain large banking institutions that believe in this project are supporting us, which definitely helps to build credibility. Also, I think we have achieved a common understanding between local authorities and the private sector on the future development of the city and the wider region. Therefore, this has been our main focus at this stage of development; to build trust and show that we are developing an economically viable and significant project.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of CELPA as an FTZ?</h4><p>We offer a promising and real platform in Buenaventura that did not previously exist. We are an industrial and logistics platform that offers total legal security and support, located next to the Port of Buenaventura, which helps to reduce production costs. CELPA allows investors to get a return on their investment within five years thanks to the tax environment that we offer, which means more efficient and profitable companies make the FTZ their base.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Colombia and Guatemala signed a Free Trade Agreement in 2007, which was subsequently ratified in 2009. The treaty initially allowed 53% of fisheries, mineral, fuel, vehicle and chemical products to circulate without tariffs, a percentage that was to rise to 70%. Could you evaluate what this Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has achieved for both nations?<br></h4><p>The FTA you mentioned has just opened the door to future and deeper trade links between both countries. Ever since we signed and ratified it in 2009, commercial and trade ties have become stronger and we have seen an important rise in the arrival of foreign investment from Colombia in projects such as electric energy infrastructure. I think the FTA was great news for both countries, and will become an even more relevant trade tool for them.</p><h4>The Colombian government has been helping Guatemala improve its training of police officers and use of crime-solving technology and intelligence since 2011. Could you comment on the goals of this alliance, and on other sectors in which both nations could deepen their relationship?</h4><p>Public policies regarding security are one of the main interests our country has in Colombia. Current excellent ties between the two countries have enabled us to take advantage of Colombia's expertise in this field, and train our security officers and staff, while modernizing the public institutions that engage with these activities. I would also like to mention cooperation in the agricultural sphere; Guatemala is also a relevant coffee producer and we have learnt much from Colombia's experience in this area.</p><h4>In 2013 Guatemala reached an accord to eliminate visa requirements for Colombians. How has this been made possible and what mutual benefits do you expect from this decision?</h4><p>By removing visa requirements for Colombian citizens, we have managed to make trade and tourist traffic between both countries more fluent and dynamic. I think Colombia has become a true leader in the region and this move confirms that the country has gained the trust of other regional countries to revoke any kind of barrier, and promote deeper ties between them and other countries. Finally, we view this step as one of the prerequisites to achieving one of our key national goals; namely to become a full rights member of the Pacific Alliance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Yobel has become one of the leading South American companies offering outsourcing services in supply chain management. What factors have led to this success?</h4><p>The service we provide is based on our customer requirements. We are highly flexible and design all our infrastructure and service platforms based on our customers, and they leverage our technologies and our unique operational know-how. We have implemented a world-class warehouse management system with a lot success for our customers, while, additionally, our executive staff are certified in Lean Six Sigma and, next year, we are going to spread this to the entire organization. Another relevant factor is that, as a subsidiary company of a Peruvian corporation, we have vast knowledge of the Latin American market. These factors are differentiators for us because most players in this industry are from Europe, the US, or Asia, or have partnerships with local companies, while we are proudly Latin American and operate our own branches.</p><h4>Yobel offers services in supply chain management in 11 countries throughout the Americas. Considering your company's wide reach, what role does the Dominican Republic play within your international portfolio?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic today is our largest operation in the Caribbean, although Puerto Rico and Panama feature, too. For this year and the next, the Dominican Republic will maintain the leadership of our corporation in the Caribbean, but Panama is experiencing rapid growth and I believe that, by 2016, it will have become the company leader. For the corporation, the Dominican Republic is very strategic because from here we handle, manage, and assume all regional operations. In Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Panama the market is in continual growth. We don't have a sizable market share currently, but we are expecting this to change, and are confident of growth in the Dominican Republic. Today we have notable demand from the pharmaceutical industry; it has recognized our expertise and unique solutions in the sector. We have implemented a strong quality system for that sector and have considerable experience with consumer goods, cosmetics, technology, and food and beverages, so the business in the Dominican Republic is important and there is a wide portfolio of services on offer. Our biggest market is the multinationals.</p><h4>Are Dominican SMEs willing to use your outsourcing services as well?</h4><p>We do work with a number of small businesses, for which we leverage our capacity to compensate for their lack of infrastructure, capital, and transport units to fully reach sales points. But most local SMEs still don't know the service, and also lack the business structure to outsource those functions.</p><div class="quote">“The Dominican Republic today is our largest operation in the Caribbean."</div><h4>How does the regulatory environment in the Dominican Republic affect Yobel's performance and the logistics industry as a whole?</h4><p>Our business operates within a supportive environment of political and economic stability, which greatly impacts both economic development and international trust; the country has a stable growth rate of over 5.5%, while inflation is within the acceptable range, and the currency is stable, although we face other challenges. I consider the labor law complicated, for example. There is a movement among the private sector to propose its amendment, which goes beyond our industry. The employee is currently over-protected under this law, giving a company little space for negotiation when it comes to a dispute. This is something that hinders the normal development of operations and is a sensitive issue among many sectors nowadays. This is reinforced by labor unions, as is the case in the transport sector. This factor can be seen favorable for our business since our customers may avoid those complexities by contracting the third-party logistics services.</p><h4>How would you rate the quality of the infrastructure in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>I think it is adequate for the market today in terms of warehousing and roads. Yet any serious attempt to transform the Dominican Republic into a hub will demand more modern infrastructure and a regulatory law. For example, the Port of Caucedo being constructed in partnership with DP World right now is building some infrastructure for our business to establish logistics centers in the port.</p><h4>What impact will the expansion of the Panama Canal have on the Dominican logistics industry, and how will Yobel respond to the changes that its expansion entails?</h4><p>The canal expansion will help us because it will increase the traffic of goods, but it is a challenge, too. In the same way we must ensure our regulatory environment, because Panama has many laws that assist companies not based in Panama. So it's not only the expansion of the canal, it's also the integration of policy that must be checked. And since we have operations in Panama, we are thinking about that movement. We have a lot of demand in Panama. Yobel grows in Panama by approximately 30% yearly, which is a huge number. In the Dominican Republic we grow by 20%-25% annually, which presents an opportunity, although it is a challenge for the country to maintain its competitive advantage in the region.</p><h4>The Dominican Association of Freight and Maritime Area (ADACAM) and the Shipping Association of the Dominican Republic (ANRD) are considering creating a Logistics Cluster. What is your view of the idea?</h4><p>The development is interesting in terms of shining a light on the logistics sector. In contrast to the previous lack of promotion, ADACAM and ANRD are doing a good job of promoting the sector. As Yobel SCM, we support those initiatives since it helps with the development of the sector.</p><h4>And how would you assess the Dominican Republic's potential as a regional hub?</h4><p>Creating the cluster will help the government to make the Dominican Republic a hub. The Dominican Republic in the short term has considerable opportunities as the political situation is very steady. It is good right here. We have a strategy oriented to tourists to increase the number of visitors to the Dominican Republic to 10 million. This is significant as such strategies encourage organic growth of the economy through the development of related sectors.</p><h4>What is Yobel's short-term growth strategy in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We are facing a lot of factors. Right now we are investing a lot of money in training of our staff to spread some methodology in our operations. We have become a Lean Six Sigma company, so I think that this strategy will help us to grow and other strategies that we can't publish right now. But we have a lot of changes in storefor the future in our corporation.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main highlights of the World Satellite Business Week in Paris?<br></h4><p>The summit provided the opportunity for satellite operators and industry participants from around the world to meet and discuss launching and satellite services. For Mexico, it was excellent because Telecomunicaciones de México (TELECOMM-TELÉGRAFOS) has been participating in the sector through MexSat, which is the system operator of three satellites. We already have one satellite in orbit today; will have two more in 2014, and finally a fourth in 2015. Meetings like these provide a medium of interaction with a wide range of businesses that improve both our knowledge of the technology out there, and also our commercial relations. What we plan to do, in light of the agreement signed with other telecom operators, is to promote Mexico in this area. To do this, we intend to stage a summit in here as of 2014 to give a Mexican perspective. TELECOMM-TELÉGRAFOS is active in the sector and operates MEXSAT.</p><h4>The Secretary for Communication recently launched two satellites and said that two more would be launched in 2014, what is the significance of these services for the telecommunications industry?</h4><p>MexSat contains three satellites so far, and is a Mexican system operated by Telecomm. Currently, we have the Bicentenario satellite in orbit which works in the C and KU extended band, and 2014 will see the launch of the second satellite, the Centenario, which will operate on the L band, to be followed by a third, Morelos 3, which also operates on the L Band. These systems will enable us to provide services for social programs and also for security for those entities that require them. This will also provide us with a guaranteed system capable of meeting the demands of the Mexican government in the provision of public services.</p><h4>Will reforms in the telecoms sector attract foreign investment?</h4><p>Fiber optics is currently licensed to the Federal Commission of Electricity (CFE) as is moving into the telecoms arena. This means that it will become the fiber optic operator, and according to the new projects planned for 2014, we are poised to work with the private sector in developing a more robust fiber-optic network of 700 megahertz bandwidth. The network will be shared by private sector companies and the public sector alike as part of the development plan we have undertaken. From a Telecoms and telecommunications perspective, this marks a huge change, yet it is also a good opportunity for the private sector to participate in order to bring services as a carrier-to-carrier service. According to what the private sector wants, I think we can find ways of jointly working in order to gain a better position in the industry for the people of Mexico and companies hoping to invest here. The major changes are already in place, under the necessary constitutional amendments, allowing any company interested in participating in the Mexican market to join. I think we have an open market, as well as the opportunity to be able to have 100% of foreign investment in the satellite sector. One of the main questions that we heard being asked during the World Satellite Business Week concerned foreign company participation in the sector according to the new legal framework. And the answer was exactly the same; the satellite sector is 100% open to foreign investment, and the broadcasting sector to foreign ownership.</p><h4>Are these reforms going to increase the contribution of the sector to GDP?</h4><p>Yes, and this will develop an economic base. Therefore, it is not only a major change, but also a positive one. These reforms take time to mature. Overall, we have the expectation that it will make a positive contribution to the economy, and materialize in the short term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main business areas that Biaani is developing in the market, and who are your key clients?<br></h4><p>Biaani is an IT company that has two business models. First, we create software that we distribute to markets all over the world aiming to satisfy global demands on innovative technologies. Others incomes come from the development of tailor-made software for our clients' specific requirements. Biaani focuses on government and private initiatives; its main clients are companies that belong to the financial and insurance sectors.</p><h4>How does your Zabani app help to treat sleep apnea and contribute to the health sector?</h4><p>Zabani was developed with the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT). It works on smartphones and a large variety of feature phones, so when a customer experiences sleep apnea during the night, the app provides a recording of this and generates statistics that can tell you more about your problem. The overall objective is to prevent diabetes. For example, many people who have apnea do not know they have it; nevertheless, when you do not sleep well and feel tired, your body cannot respond as it should and as a result you eat too much during the day to counter tiredness, and a new problem appears. One of our goals with Zabani is to get endorsed by sleep associations and laboratories in North America in order to provide them with useful data.</p><h4>Which other financial products have you developed in the market?</h4><p>Another product that we have created is WalkBiz. We produce it in Google Android and iOS for iPhones, iPads and tablets. WalkBiz is an app builder for SMEs to promote their products and services and ultimately increase sales. The app helps the business to segment its market, run marketing campaigns, build communication channels through push notifications and generate sales in real time. WalkBiz has enabled over 400 clients to increase their sales by about 35%, and we believe that these strong results have been thanks to our marketing strategy.</p><h4>How do you see the sector in general, and what is your strategy for approaching other markets?</h4><p>The Mexican government runs different programs that stimulate SMEs to cross borders and expand their markets. We have entered some of these programs to get funds and build many apps. And we had great results. In general, the Mexican financial sector is in good shape; combined with government initiatives, they provide us help to become better known in Mexico and abroad, and we are now working on exporting our products. For example, we have established contacts with hospitals in the US for Zabani and started building our network to provide our users with excellent benefits. One of our main partners is the US-Mexico Foundation for Science (FUMEC in Spanish), which is helping us to internationalize Biaani.</p><h4>Where do you see Biaani over the coming decade?</h4><p>Our primary objective is to build three new apps to collaborate with restaurants, hotels, and SMEs in general. The strategy for 2014 is to generate about 40% of revenues from innovation. We want to reach CMMi Level 3 so that we can position Biaani comfortably in the international market. Today, there are 40 people working at the company, but our hope for the next three years is to increase our staff to 200. We believe we can do this because our apps are selling particularly well, our clients are happy with our products, and the investors are supporting us and believe in our work.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The much-awaited reforms in the Mexican telecommunications sector were passed into law in June 2013. What are your expectations?<br></h4><p>This is the first time that there has been a reform that deals with the different issues needed to create changes in the telecommunications sector. The barriers to entry in this market have not budged for many years; they have existed for a long time and have made competition difficult. The latest reform does contain the necessary changes and establishes asymmetrical regulation. This involves treating the incumbent differently, whereby access has to be provided on an equal basis and at a reasonable cost with prompt delivery. The new legislation also eliminates exclusivity regarding suppliers of terminals and on contracts that are frequently negotiated based on the incumbent's size and power. For example, I am referring to the providers of smart phones that give the incumbent a window of two or three months; a period within which other service providers cannot have access to those phones and, therefore, suffer a competitive disadvantage. Exclusivity also concerns distribution, and there are many ways that distribution chains can be forced to give the incumbent exclusivity, such as contracts designed so that commercial chains obtain a greater retribution if they allow only the dominant firm to distribute its services. It also refers to the provision of the last mile to competitors by the incumbent. This last issue has always been a problem. All these elements have been considered in the constitutional reforms. These reforms will certainly break the monopoly in Mexico, but in order for this to be implemented in practice and have the effects desired by the President and congress, we need by-laws that ensure the implementation of constitutional reform, which has not yet happened.</p><h4>How has the company managed to win a 20% market share?</h4><p>It has been a combination of factors, but key among these has been the construction of a network that has national coverage and can provide excellent quality of service. When comparing the performance of the different networks, ours invariably ends up on the top in terms of speed and reliability, and it is also top in terms of quality of service and geographical coverage. We have also been creative in designing campaigns and products that are attractive to our customers; we have tariffs and products that are quite original—and frequently copied by others. By the time our commercial innovations are copied, we are generally ahead in the acquisition of customers. Another innovation that we have been able to achieve is in technological progress and the ability to introduce it. For example we are the first and only company to have introduced voice messages that are automatically converted into text. We were also the first to introduce value-added services on our smartphones. Being the first to introduce innovations is a true advantage in this market, and it is how we were able to establish a foothold.</p><h4>How does Mexico fit into Telefónica's operations within Latin America?</h4><p>We are comparatively small in relation to the size of the market; our revenue is about 11% of the wireless market. That is exceptionally small, but we are relatively larger if you consider other criteria. We have 20 million customers and a large investment in the geographical area that makes us larger than other medium-sized firms in the telecommunications industry. However, we still have a long way to go if we want to become true competitors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the priorities set for El Economista for the next two years?<br></h4><p>We should focus on three tracks. One is the digital highway, while the second concerns quality. A lot of information is available for free, so the only way to maintain an organization made up of professional journalists is to rely heavily on quality. This means developing the talent here and understanding that the media business is not different from other businesses. There are a lot of things we have to learn from other businesses, especially from the creative industries. The third path is hyper-specialization. Everyone is talking about the crisis in the media business, especially in newspapers and magazines, but I think that, somehow, it has hit the general newspapers and magazines harder. I think being specialized and recognized as such is, in a way, a safety net. The biggest challenge is to become better at what you do best.</p><h4>How have the printed and online editions of El Economista developed in recent years, and what are your future projects?</h4><p>The printing business is a long horizontal line. We have to expand our geographic area. We have a newspaper in Querétaro and we have made some moves to be in a better situation even in Mexico City. It is a large geographic area, and it is not exactly well covered. We are trying to improve our distribution in major cities such as Guadalajara, Monterrey, Tijuana, and Cancún. We do not just have the newspaper, but we have six magazines, most of them in the luxury market. We are trying to ensure the magazines get to be real national magazines. One of them is about equestrian lifestyles, while another is about watches. I would say our newspaper is related to how people work and make money, and the magazines are more related to how they spend it. The readership of the online edition is growing. Every year the numbers grow about 20% to 30%. On top of that, advertising revenue grows by 45% to 50%. But that is not such a great success story as it is a small part of the total revenue, at around 8% to 9%. The real challenge is to make a business model that really works not just for our company, but also for our readership. You have to think big.</p><h4>What are the main trends within the journalism and communications industry in Mexico?</h4><p>Even though paper is not fading, mobile is growing really fast. In order to be excellent, you have to translate what you are doing in the paper to the desktop and to the mobile, but you have to be careful not to think that what works in one is going to work in the other. Something we want to get more into is interactive social media. Being the type of newspaper we are, everything is related to informative flashes. Everything is changing very quickly and we must be prepared to change our minds every year. The readership has real power and you have to take it very seriously.</p><h4>How will the telecommunications reform impact the communications industry in Mexico?</h4><p>The impact will be huge, but having said that it is very hard to make a prognosis for the future. We are going to see new companies and enjoy a more competitive environment, especially with the ongoing technological revolution. Concerning foreign investment, it would be good if we could make some kind of warning to incoming ventures to take it very seriously and to learn about Mexico before investing. There are a lot of opportunities, but they are not necessarily easy to get at. You have to be prepared to dive into a complex society. For Mexicans, we have to be prepared to compete with the best that can come from any country. You have to be aware, and in a way, paranoid about that competition.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the advantages of what is Mexico's largest inland port, and how will it turn Mexico into an international platform?<br></h4><p>The origins of the Interpuerto Monterrey project are related to the logistics of the location. The other key point is the connectivity between road and rail. Interpuerto Monterrey is one of the few places in Mexico where Kansas City Southern and Ferromex converge, connecting Interpuerto Monterrey to major sea ports—both Atlantic and Pacific—as well as inland ports within the US. The NAFTA agreement borders are erased, and we can have goods moving seamlessly between the US and Mexico. By establishing operations at Interpuerto Monterrey our customers can reach a population of 70 million people within a 900-kilometer radius. This provides an advantage to our customers when time to market is a concern.</p><h4>Can you speak about collaboration between public and private institutions?</h4><p>Interpuerto Monterrey was conceived in response to the need for a fully integrated manufacturing and logistics hub for Northeast Mexico and as an integral part of the State of Nuevo León's infrastructure platform. The government undertook the responsibility to build and develop new road and highway infrastructure. Meanwhile, the private sector was tasked with finding land and developing the park. We are privately owned by a group of investors from Nuevo León, and we first set out to establish a grid for all infrastructure required for the project. We searched for roads, rail, power, fiber optics, water, sewage, and gas. The only place where all these elements converged was Interpuerto Monterrey. Usually, a development results from a parcel of land and then infrastructure is brought into it. At Interpuerto Monterrey, we did things the other way around. The slogan 'The New Crossroads,' references the crossing point of roads, and the other infrastructure required for a project of this size.</p><h4>What will the social impact of this investment be?</h4><p>A triple bottom-line principle is very much needed for this type of development, combining economic feasibility, environmental responsibility, and the addressing of social concerns. The matter goes beyond having a sound business model; it involves a business model that is sustained by the economics of the business, the social aspect of the project, and the environmental impact of the development. Once Interpuerto Monterrey is fully developed, it will create 35,000 to 45,000 jobs. One of the most important considerations of the development is that it is a 1,350-hectare master plan development that will provide new jobs in Monterrey's Metropolitan area, and of course for the country. Interpuerto Monterrey's location has a strong industrial base for jobs. Many people living there today spend a significant portion of their day traveling to and from work. Added to the fact that transportation costs must be factored into the equation. Therefore, bringing work to communities can improve their quality of life. With the additional benefit of reducing auto emissions as transportation time declines.</p><h4>What is the total investment for the project?</h4><p>There will be about 80 hectares of land absorbed annually, giving Interpuerto Monterrey a spread that ranges from 10 to 12 years. It is hard to gauge the total investment involved, but we have calculated an investment of $130 million for the first phase, which is 350 hectares, and you can extrapolate from this a total investment of $500 to $600 million, although we cannot foresee the future entirely at this point. Currently, we are catering to the requirements of 20 to 30 hectares.</p><h4>What were the benchmarks for Interpuerto Monterrey?</h4><p>Zaragoza is a benchmark for us, and is a model that we are aiming to mirror. CenterPoint and Alliance can also serve as good inspirations. We want to build a network of inland ports around the world that can improve connectivity, and we are also working on a customs pre-clearance process. This will require a considerable time to achieve as we are dealing with two countries, which involves policy amendments. We want goods to be cleared by the US customs officers at the site, our advantage for doing so is our location: 200 kilometers from the Mexico-US border with direct highway connection.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main services offered by Agrovant in Mexico?<br></h4><p>We are a consulting company that offers guidance regarding the regulation of pesticides and fertilizers in Mexico; pesticides not only in the agricultural area but also in the industrial, domestic, and urban areas. Agrovant provides guidance regarding all the procedures and documents that need to be handed to the state, and track the documents until the procedure is finished. We assist our clients throughout the whole procedure either alone as a company or with alliances with other participants of the process, such as universities that are authorized by the Secretariat of Agriculture to develop efficiency studies of the products in Mexico.</p><p>On the other hand, we need to be in contact with law firms to assist those foreign companies that want to establish an office in Mexico. Finally, we also need to be in contact with laboratories in both Mexico and abroad for they are the ones who make the studies of toxicology available for the companies. We, the three associates who created Agrovant, began in 2012, and now we have more than 10 years of experience of supporting and guiding companies in the regulation of pesticides, plant nutrients, toxic or hazardous substances and materials, and their establishments. These procedures take a long time, usually between two and three years.</p><h4>How would you describe your relationship with your clients?</h4><p>We have established a strong ethical policy in the company. The data of all our clients is secret, and we sign many confidential contracts. We never mention any names or data of our clients, not only because we sign these confidential contracts, but also for ethical reasons because they are competitors in the market. We have seen the birth of many companies that have reached a very size. Agrovant has clients from Belgium, Russia, India, China, and Spain, among others. In every country of the world, the regulatory authorities are complicated, but especially here in Mexico. Hence, we are here to facilitate this process to foreign or national companies to take their first steps in the market.</p><h4>What are the challenges of this market?</h4><p>Many people are against pesticides because they believe that we should go back to organic production. Nevertheless, due to the increasing world population we need a large volume of food, which cannot be grown without pesticides. Besides, no one likes to bite an apple and find a worm. Everyone prefers a shiny apple. To satisfy the high demands of the public, we need chemicals. Restrictions regarding the use of toxic products have increased all over the world, meaning we are looking for healthier and environmentally friendly alternatives, which is the trend today. In Mexico, national companies are not molecule producers, but they produce generics or plaster for international companies. The companies that produce generics need active ingredients that come from India or China, and then they mix the products here and register the final product in Mexico. Many international companies bring the mixed product and just plaster it here. Registration costs of chemical products in Mexico are established according the level of toxicology of the product; the more toxic the more expensive. The total administrative costs in Mexico for the registration of a product range from Ps18,000 to Ps60,000. Nevertheless those are the costs established by the government; if the company needs to make any field studies or tests then costs can increase.</p><h4>How will the new reforms taking place in the country impact your business?</h4><p>The tendency of the market is to produce products with a lower level of toxicity, not only because of the higher demand but also because in terms of regulations it is easier to register healthier and environmentally friendly products. In Mexico, there is a trend to produce organic products for export to Europe. Other countries, such as the US, are limiting the level of pesticide residues allowed in vegetables. People look for alternatives because the world is already too polluted; however, I see it more in the long term than in the short run. In terms of fertilizers, we saw a privatization of the market that led to an increasing number of companies producing fertilizers. As a company that gives consulting services, a more regulated market is a more complicated market that needs the services that we provide.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main goals and landmark achievements of the Strategic Health Plan 2013-2018?<br></h4><p>President Peña Nieto has identified the health sector as one of the government's five strategic pillars. His aim is to make Mexico a more inclusive country, with higher levels of security, global responsibility, and greater education, becoming a nation prepared for future challenges. One of the first reforms the President advanced was that of the education system, and today he has the health sector in sight. Back in 1983, Mexico had already determined healthcare to be the right of all Mexicans. Indeed, our constitution stipulates a right to protect health. Subsequently, a general health law followed. The law has seen numerous amendments over the past couple of decades, with an accompanying modernization of public health institutions to establish a strong national health system. The office of the Secretary of Health was created in 1943, but back then it had a stronger focus on providing assistance. Since then, we have also seen the establishment of the main national health institutions, and it was only in 1985 when the Secretariat of Health was established in the form it takes today. It has been restructured following Mexico's move to a decentralized health system, in which each state assumes health responsibilities. This process was strengthened during the 1990s, and today each of the 32 states has its own Health Secretary. In 2004, the government of Mexico established the social security system. Ever since then, we have been strengthening this system with the inclusion of a larger number of diseases, the treatment of which is covered by social security.</p><h4>How has the social security system taken shape since 2004?</h4><p>In 2014, we will celebrate its 10th anniversary; initially it started out with 5 million affiliated members, while today the number is at 55.6 million. In terms of diseases and surgical procedures, it initially covered around 90, but today encompasses over 300. We have an economic fund allocated to the treatment of rare and high-cost-related diseases; 10 years ago we only included leukemia for children, while today we include a pool of over 60 such diseases based on epidemiological data. Overall, the achievements over the past decade have been formidable; we have increased the coverage of social security, and the number of affiliates, while people are more aware of their entitlements. The allocation of funds among the states is done according to the number of affiliates each has, and we have an extensive portfolio of free medicines for the public. The social security system also allocates a budget to provide full-coverage insurance for children less than five years of age. Today, we are in the process of strengthening our control over the general allocation of funds and their administration in the different states.</p><h4>What segments of the health industry offer the greatest potential to attract foreign investment?</h4><p>I personally believe that the technological segment within the health industry, as well as infrastructure, offer the most attractive potential for investment. We will be witnessing interesting projects in the near future within the framework of public-private partnerships. We have already built six hospitals within this scheme in Mexico, and feedback has been positive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Mexico for your company?<br></h4><p>Mexico is one of the countries with the highest potential among the emerging markets. It offers huge potential due to its population of 120 million. In terms of medical and health coverage, specifically from the public sector, 97% of the population today has some form of medical coverage. The other 3% has private health insurance, adding up to 100% coverage of the population. One of Medtronic's global objectives is access: how can more patients access the technology and different products and therapies that Medtronic manufactures; Mexico is well positioned to achieve this objective.</p><h4>Why did you select Mexico?</h4><p>Latin America is a region of general interest. This is no surprise when you consider that mature markets are not growing at the same rate. Some of the largest opportunities appear to be in the emerging markets. In Latin America the two biggest countries by far are Brazil and Mexico. They offer a stable economic and political situation. And in the case of Mexico, all government reforms point to a bright future for the country, while investments are coming. Based on this, Medtronic is prepared to continue investing in its local manufacturing facilities. We have facilities in Tijuana and Empalme and currently employ over 3,700 people in the country. We intend to continue growing and are trying to partner with the government for further investments.</p><h4>What are your investment plans for the country?</h4><p>We have two different approaches to the Mexican market. One is the manufacturing facility and the commercial area, where we are selling the product to the public and private hospitals that Medtronic works with. We are also making some investments in terms of technical infrastructure that public hospitals require.</p><h4>What are some of the initiatives that you are investing in to address cardiac problems?</h4><p>Cardiovascular treatment is one of our focus areas. We also have another business focused on managing diabetes. We are the world leader in insulin pump therapy, and this is one of the areas where Mexico is the target. There are millions of people in Mexico suffering from diabetes. The rate at which this disease is presenting itself exceeds many other countries. There are other areas that we are focusing on like spinal injuries, orthopedics, and neurosurgery; we have 11 business units that cover these. That being said, the cardiovascular area remains the most important and largest segment for us.</p><h4>What is the outlook and strategy for your company?</h4><p>We continue to pursue three main strategies. The first is to make the company much more global. This is why we are investing in different countries rather than only in the leading markets. Latin America, Asia Pacific, China, the Middle East, and South Africa are the main areas of focus for the company. Second, Medtronic continues to work toward generating economic value. We are working together with governments creating therapies, products, and environments where the government can make a much more efficient health investment. The government has already registered progress in this, and is trying to centralize all medical supplies for the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), the Armed Forces, and the public sector in general, having invested around $5 billion or $6 billion toward this. We are working to build a cost-effective model for our therapies. If they use this therapy we can prove categorically that we are creating an effective scenario for the population. We have posted compound growth of 32% in Colombia and 27% in Mexico over the past five years. This year our target is also above 20%, which while challenging, is completely achievable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Mexico's regulatory framework for foreign investors?<br></h4><p>It is completely open and mostly user friendly. Now more than ever, Mexico has broken with decades-old taboos and opened up investment opportunities for private investors, Mexican and foreign alike, in areas that were previously off-limits. Most notably, the energy sector (oil, gas, and electricity) is now accessible, and no longer reserved for state-owned entities. At present, with very few exceptions, there are virtually no more restrictions on foreign investment in all economic areas. Moreover, foreign investors are afforded the same treatment as Mexican nationals in Mexican local and federal courts.</p><h4>How will the recent sector reforms impact the investment environment in the country?</h4><p>The number of legislative changes that have occurred in the past 18 months has surpassed even the most optimistic scenarios. There have been significant, game-changing amendments in labor laws, banking, securities, and around 30 other financial laws, antitrust laws, telecommunication legislation, energy-related laws, tax laws, and anti-money laundering legislation, including, notably, constitutional amendments where required. So the impact on investment, at least on paper, is expected to be enormous. These reforms are transforming the country in ways that had long been anticipated, but that seemed politically unattainable.</p><h4>How does Mijares, Angoitia, Cortes y Fuentes cater to foreign clients?</h4><p>More than 50% of our clientele is foreign. All our partners and associates are fully bilingual and are trained in US law firms and US or European universities. Assisting foreign clients is core to our nature and origin, and we represent them in both simple and complex transactions of various kinds. Our practice groups, including M&amp;A, banking and finance, securities, energy, antitrust, tax, environmental, and IP, are involved in the continued education of our attorneys, so that we can be better positioned to tend to our clients' needs with the ultimate goal of adding value to their Mexican endeavors.</p><h4>What are the main concerns of foreign investors operating in Mexico and what advice would you give to those considering investing in the country?</h4><p>Today's main concerns lie in avoiding corrupt practices. I would say this is a global trend that is not likely to go away soon. Mexico has enacted FCPA-type legislation, but the enforcement thereof has yet to be tested. Foreign investors are right in being concerned and should be diligent in obtaining the right advice. In addition to the technical aspects of the law, we sell something much more valuable, namely, our ethics, honesty, and trust. In this context, I believe investors should be careful in choosing the right law firm. It is one thing to be efficient and cost-effective in this economically strained environment, which has become a must for us as a firm; it is, however, a very different thing to choose counsel merely based on cost, as that may prove to be more expensive at the end of the day.</p><h4>What marks your firm out in the market as the place to go to?</h4><p>There are indeed dozens of firms in the Mexican market—not one of them overly large, and this is the result of a generalized lack of institutionalization. Unhappy lawyers at one firm leave to set up their own firm, but replicate exactly the same rules from which they were escaping, only to apply them until someone else leaves, and this is a never-ending story. We are different. Everything we do, large or small, is directed toward the ultimate goal of institutionalizing our firm, so that our lawyers know that this is a long-term place to commit to. This loyalty towards the firm translates into a more solid commitment to client service.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has influenced you the most in your career?<br></h4><p>My father has been my main source of inspiration in my career; another architect who has been instrumental is Luis Barragán. He has influenced me from the beginning in terms of simplicity. Today, my two sons are also a source of inspiration. They are in architecture now and are already working with me. It is always the younger generation that brings in new ideas, and so you are always learning. It is important to have them here also because they are the only ones that tell you the truth.</p><h4>How has the family business evolved in recent years?</h4><p>Overall, 2013 was one of the best years in the history of the company. Since 1937, there hasn't been a year where we have designed more projects than in 2013, while 2014 also looks outstanding. We have lined up some of the most interesting projects we've ever taken on. We are working extensively in Monterrey, Guadalajara, Playa del Carmen, Cozumel, and in other cities around the country. We feel that our situation has been exceptional. Although the economy is still not booming, everybody has high expectations for what is coming next.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the performance of these projects in the real estate area?</h4><p>We just opened the Antea Lifestyle Center in Queretaro. Antea is the largest shopping center in Latin America, and marks one of our best designs. It has around 78,000 sqm of retail space. To date, we have opened around 60% of the shopping center. What is fantastic news for us is that we currently have around 10,000 cars pulling in every day on average—and it is not yet fully open. This means we are turning every parking space that we have in the shopping center 2.5 times, with only 60% of the retail space opened. We estimate that we will receive around 12 million people a year when fully open. We are also opening a fantastic shopping center in Veracruz, on the coast with a beach front near the convention center in the city. Also, in Mexico City, we have started the construction of the Picacho Lifestyle Center, which is a project similar to Antara Polanco, but in the south of the city. We expect this project to revolutionize retail in Mexico; we have the most important brands and it has around 120,000 sqm of leasable area. There will also be four office towers at around 20,000 sqm each. We are truly proud of the design. At this point in time, we are finishing El Toreo, which is a shopping center located on the border of Mexico City and the state of Mexico. It is fantastic to work with some clients as designers, and we are proud to include some new concepts in this scheme. We have designed a park on top of the center of about 6,000 sqm. This will change the way people view greenery in shopping centers. It has a large-scale roof, which is set to be one of the biggest in Mexico.</p><h4>Are you thinking about going international?</h4><p>We are definitely looking to develop an idea in Spain. We are also looking at the US. The problem we have now is that we have so many projects here in Mexico that we haven't had time to look elsewhere. That being said, of course, we are always eager and we would like to advance and expand internationally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What types of project will you be undertaking over the coming years?<br></h4><p>We have set aggressive growth plans for the next five years, similar to those accomplished in past years. Essentially, we will continue to implement process management across our four key businesses, which are residential (units Above $200K), middle income housing (units below $200k), commercial developments (shopping centers and office complexes), and infrastructure (construction and operation of highways and bridges).</p><h4>What are a few of the your notable projects completed to date?</h4><p>The history of Grupo Copri features a number of significant projects, a few of which I will comment on by business line. In the residential category, I would mention Cumbres de Santa Fe, a high-scale residential complex set in over 170 acres of woods in the prestigious area of Santa Fe, Mexico City. This development featured over 400 housing lots averaging at 6,000 square feet and over 1,000 apartments averaging at 3,000 square feet. It also has a park and clubhouse with tennis courts, a soccer pitch, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, gym, and restaurant, among other amenities.</p><p>In terms of middle-income housing, we might consider Parque Jardin project, a mixed-use development at the heart of Mexico City, located 15 minutes from the corporate and commercial area of Polanco. This development features 2,000 apartments averaging at 700 square feet and a shopping center anchored with a supermarket, cinema and gym. Then turning to commercial developments I would highlight our Garden Santa Fe project, an underground mall at the heart of the city center of Santa Fe. The first project of its kind in Latin America, it offers a huge public parking structure highly demanded in the area, in addition to a lifestyle shopping center with high emphasis on food, entertainment, and services, as well as a three-acre park at street level. This multi-awarded architectural project takes the form of a naturally ventilated and illuminated building meeting numerous environmental standards, including the largest green roof in Latin America. And finally in terms of infrastructural schemes we might consider Supervia Poniente, an urban toll road with a 30-year concession of about 8 kilometers in length that connects the west and the south of Mexico City. The toll road is comprised of 1 kilometer of bridges, 2.5 kilometers of tunnels and 2 kilometers of elevated roads.</p><h4>What are the commercial prospects for the four business segments?</h4><p>Because our four businesses participate in key strategic growth industries in the country, we see great potential for them. Overall, we are positive regarding Mexico's growth prospects, and expect this to generate healthy demand across all business lines. Moreover, Grupo Copri is, and will remain, an important contributor to the broader economic development of the country. We will contribute to a better future by participating in the construction of infrastructure, housing, and commercial developments that enhance the lives of its population.</p><h4>To what extent has your company left its hallmark on the city?</h4><p>There is no doubt that Garden Santa Fe has already become an urban icon. Its greatest challenge was to reconcile the interests of the city government that sold the land with the specific demand the area had seen. The area was greatly in need of public parking, commercial services, and a well-designed and maintained green area. In terms of what the scheme has achieved we believe that Garden Santa Fe will become a role model to be replicated in other major urban areas of Mexico City, and throughout the country.</p><h4>What is your philosophy in terms of working with the public and private sectors?</h4><p>We believe that collaboration between the private and public sectors to strengthening public policy that promotes planned growth and development is key to success. We also believe that the recycling of urban land and the urbanization of areas in close proximity to areas of employment leads to more affordable housing prices.</p><h4>Finally, how do you assess the future of your sector?</h4><p>We are greatly optimistic regarding the potential of Mexico's construction sector. Moreover, the structural reforms implemented by the government to date should generate significant domestic and foreign investments. These investments in turn will translate into higher residential, commercial, and infrastructural demand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the core activities your company has been involved with in the construction sector?<br></h4><p>CCIPSA is a private company established by Mexican entrepreneurs, which is dedicated to general civil engineering and construction projects. The company was established in 2006, and from our first days we specialized in the development and construction of housing units. Between 2008 and 2014, we set up several strategic alliances that enabled us to broaden our portfolio of services and products. Today, we are specialized in the design and construction of roads, bridges, industrial buildings, and parks; we also work with social interest, medium-cost, and residential housing developments, as well as schools, amusement parks, rehabilitation centers, golf courses, and hotel design and construction. Furthermore, we work on wastewater treatment plants, drainage and sewage systems design, and on construction and carbon footprint and environmental impact studies. CCIPSA is devoted to serving clients from the private sector, multinational corporations, and governmental entities.</p><h4>Can you tell us a bit more about your strategic alliance with the Hilton hotel chain? What other international alliances is CCIPSA developing?</h4><p>In Mexico, we have developed a partnership with the internationally-renowned hotel chain The Hilton Garden Inn in Coatzacoalcos; the hotel will launch operations in 2016 in a special area, one dedicated to oil production. Over 35 companies operating there, most related to PEMEX. For that reason, we envisage the development of a hotel that will also become a business center. This hotel will host international businessmen as well as national guests. The arrival of Hilton will represent a turning point in the hospitality industry of Veracruz, and it will definitely become a leading player in the sector from the outset. CCIPSA is always looking for strategic alliances with partners that have a strong and solid market presence—Hilton is without a shadow of a doubt one of them. We also have strategic alliances in all the segments we operate in, with leading international companies from countries like Norway as well. Our company is divided into six divisions: engineering and construction, financial, real estate, chemical, telecommunications, and tourism.</p><h4>What are some of the main projects you are currently developing?</h4><p>We are developing as many as 936 high-end apartments in the same area as the Hilton Hotel. The area where the Hilton Hotel is located offers plenty of opportunities and future prospects, from both an industrial and commercial point of view. At the moment, we are holding talks with several store chains to open a commercial space there. We are also currently developing an extension of a maritime port and several other related projects such as maritime platforms. Currently, we are also constructing an industrial park. I could also mention our solid ties with the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE); we develop engineering, topographic, and other such projects for them. Luckily, CCIPSA has managed to build up a varied and diverse portfolio of partners, including leading companies in Mexico and throughout the world. PEMEX and Hilton are excellent examples. We have strategic alliances with most of them, but in several cases our relationship with them, and the projects we jointly develop, are through concessions.</p><h4>What are some of the competitive advantages of CCIPSA?</h4><p>We have been one of the most innovative companies in the industry; we are also one of the most technologically advanced companies in maritime construction projects. Also, in the last few years, we have launched the hotel design and construction division. CCIPSA is a company that uses certified human resources in both the services and products it offers, and state-of-the-art technology in all of its projects. Some of our collaborators have over 35 years of experience and training in the construction sector, and are always assisted by professional counselors in administrative, financial, and tax issues, ensuring proper and timely administration of the projects in which CCIPSA participates, thus allowing us to provide the best possible solutions. We count on work teams with the right experience and a reputation most appropriate for each project. CCIPSA has a staff 1,500 people, and human resources are one of our key competitive advantages as a company. Having said that, our projects are also unique from an innovation and technical perspective. The many projects we develop in Veracruz will definitely change the area's landscape.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[full-power]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background story to PowerCem?<br></h4><p>PowerCem has Dutch roots, and we started in Mexico some 14 years ago with a highly specialized technical team. Our activity involves products based on nanotechnology from Synthetic Zeolites and patent activators, specifically designed for application in the construction sector, and the immobilization of highly contaminated material. The company has gone through different development stages; for example, the first four years was a period where we were entering the market and getting used to Mexico's regulations, while simultaneously presenting the advantages of our products, which, among other things, make roads last longer, more uniform, and endurable. The company sells quality through its wide range of products. One of our main competitive advantages is the fact that we created our own concrete, which has unique characteristics. We can also build roads with any type of material, including maritime sand. Overall, we are a highly multi-faceted company that over the years has managed to diversify its portfolio. We build roads, logistic platforms, dams, and other types of hard infrastructure. I think one of our main achievements has been to manage a change in attitude from governments and clients toward our work; we are highly committed to protecting the environment and are extremely efficient in our operations.</p><h4>What are some of the main ways in which the company works to protect the environment?</h4><p>PowerCem has adhered to the main international protocols to protect the environment, such as the Kyoto Protocol, as well as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Our processes are 100% environmentally friendly, as is our logistics fleet. We understand the complexity of our business activity when it comes to environmental issues, which is why we understand that it is our duty to preserve the environment. For example, we can build streets from waste and garbage. Recycling is something we take seriously.</p><h4>What are the main projects that the company has been involved with here in Mexico?</h4><p>We are extremely proud of the entire road network of the State of Tabasco. This is one of our main projects, and after eight years, and despite the floods in some areas, the quality of those roads is still very high. We have also been part of the construction of the International Bridge Reynosa. We have roads in Lower California built with maritime salt and similar materials. Mexico is a country in which infrastructure developments have gathered pace over the past few years; previously, the country had suffered from a significant lack of road infrastructure. This enabled us to be highly innovative, which brings our European expertise to the country. I should also mention that we are part of the construction team working on Mexico's new international airport. We also foresee entering the US market in 2015.</p><h4>How can the Mexican National Infrastructure Plan impact the company's activities?</h4><p>The National Infrastructure Plan creates an entire world of opportunities for PowerCem. We are a company that finishes projects in half the time it takes for most of our competitors, and the cost of maintenance work once the project is completed is much lower. The combination of these two elements offers an unbeatable option for the different public administrations within the plan.</p><h4>What role does R&amp;D play in your business activity?</h4><p>It is an important factor, and we always conduct research to launch new products onto the market. Today in Mexico we have a strong focus on launching ImmoCem, a product focused on the containment of polluting waste. Ultimately, it is the most sustainable solution for the transformation and processing of highly-contaminated soil materials into materials suitable for the construction of flooring structures.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[sweet-smell-of-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Empresas Santos, today the third largest sugar producer in Mexico developed since its inception in 1991?<br></h4><p>The history of Empresas Santos began in 1991 through the sale of Gamesa. That had been the business of my grandfather, Alberto Santos de Hoyos, who was the President &amp; CEO of Gamesa until its sale. My father started Empresas Santos with the sugar mills business because the individuals who purchased Gamesa, today's Pepsico, were interested in the other components of the business chain besides the sugar mills themselves. In parallel with the creation of sugar mills, my father started a business in the agricultural sector with Vaquerí­as, an agricultural project aimed at increasing agricultural productivity and competitiveness. He also developed some business in the real state and telecoms sectors. He realized the opportunities for competing in the telecoms market following the privatization of Telmex, creating Axtel as the vehicle through which to do so. Additionally, he developed a number of golf courses in Queretaro and Acapulco. President Salinas was committed to widespread privatization, which created an interesting climate for commerce.</p><h4>On which projects is Empresas Santos focused today?</h4><p>Our core business remains sugar mills. In 2013, despite strong production we suffered from poor pricing. We have just made an investment in Interpuerto de Monterrey, and are ready for the first stage of the land port. This year is about watching and waiting, and ensuring that our previous investments are fully capitalized on.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Interpuerto de Monterrey?</h4><p>We initially considered the construction of an industrial park, but ultimately decided to build something more ambitious that did not exist in Mexico. We were impressed by Interpuerto de Zaragoza in Spain. While looking for partners, we realized that it is one of the only two points in the entire country where Ferromex and Kansas City met, and that we could provide a unique service. We also have the advantage of proximity to the US market. Currently, our first tenant is up and running and I have every confidence in what is the most ambitious project of its type in Mexico, if not Latin America today.</p><h4>What are the major strengths of Monterrey´s economy that make the region competitive in attracting FDI?</h4><p>We are unfortunately not as rich in fruit and vegetables as in the south of the country, meaning that our only option throughout history has been hard work. And neither do we have abundant natural resources, at least when compared to other parts of the country. We have become one of the most competitive regions, however, because our industry and manufacturing is specialized. Foreign companies that are investing in the region realize that there is no need to bring in their people as they can benefit from a competitive local workforce. We also have some of the best universities in the country, as well as hospitals with competitive technology.</p><h4>How do you envisage the future taking shape?</h4><p>Since my father passed away in 2013 we have been restructuring the company, which being a family business, has meant a transfer of responsibilities and new regulations. We have changed the company dynamic, and reached a consensus whereby we will be consolidating all of our business activities. Today, we must focus on projects such as Interpuerto and Axtel, rather than entering into new ventures.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[at-the-heart-of-it]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Centro has become the first higher institution in Mexico to focus on design. What makes Centro different from other universities?<br></h4><p>The university is based on two principles: believing in creativity and acting with audacity; this has been at the core of all we do. Believing in creativity means taking creativity seriously as a force that can foster sustainable economic growth. Formerly, when contemplating innovation, we have generally looked to science, and in particular technology, as its sources. People are more conscious nowadays, in an economy of abundance, that every choice we make is influenced by design and innovation, from our homes to our appearance. We prefer a balance of form and function, and the key question is who will deliver it in a meaningful way to the customer.</p><h4>What kind of programs is Centro offering its students?</h4><p>From the outset, we covered design comprehensively from digital media, industrial design, and architecture, to cinema and television, marketing, fashion, and textiles. Additionally, we provide specific programs to promote an innovative approach among our students, and to better prepare them to become future entrepreneurs. We have classes where we teach the students methodologies for problem solving that run through the stages of research and analysis to prototyping, in learning how to overcome a challenge. We also have an Entrepreneurship Center, which is responsible for all of our related programs. We organize startup weekends and other events there. We teach finance, organizational behavior, and marketing. When our students graduate, they are solid designers, but also have a sense of purpose and context. We teach our students that ultimately design is a means of solving problems, which explains their success.</p><h4>What social projects is Centro developing?</h4><p>Centro has developed a wide range of social projects. For example, recently we researched the problem of "ninis," young people who neither study nor work. We discovered first and foremost that the root problem they shared was an inability to envision a different future. In design there is a tool called future scenario planning, which is basically a way of designing such alternate futures. We came up with mini projects that they could undertake themselves, such as producing and selling products.</p><h4>Can you talk about Destination Mexico and MOMA?</h4><p>The Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) is a prestigious institution in terms of art and design, and therefore we were happy that it invited us to be its cultural partner. That involved helping it research the Mexican market. We were the link between the store and the Mexican designers, maximizing the number of designs that went to the store and solving problems from packaging, to pricing, and transportation. Destination México was one of the most successful projects for MOMA.</p><p>In 2013 the overall theme was whether to look abroad for examples, or design our own future. Now we are preparing a conference on the scope for Mexico to be innovative, and my task is to invite individuals who are both leading figures in their field or sector, and also inspirational speakers like visionary ideas.</p><h4>What has been Centro's contribution to the national educational system?</h4><p>Education is changing and our focus is on what it could ideally become. Whether you are in medical care or education, change is inevitable. For example, there are countries that have key cards for medical records. You do not have to start from scratch with a new doctor. The same can apply to education. You take the first semester, and then start the second semester, where a new professor will know about you. The creative use of data to better inform leaders that will transform education. To teach a good class today, it cannot be limited to transmitting knowledge. The teacher plays more of a curatorial and coaching role. One needs to differentiate between the essential and the ephemeral, which is why Centro's success relies on having been started by both educators and professionals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of this year's Mexico's Annual “Tianguis Turí­stico," which has been held in Cancún?<br></h4><p>Some 44 years ago, Cancún did not exist, yet today it is a brand that is well known worldwide. We have all succeeded in our efforts, and I think Cancún is one of the regions most entitled to host such an important touristic event for the country. This year's Tianguis Turí­stico edition exceeded expectations, with an economic impact of more than $15.5 million. For example, last year's Tianguis in Puebla brought together people and companies from 43 countries, while this year there were more than 60 countries represented at the event. In this context, we welcome countries such as Vietnam and Slovenia for the first time. In addition, we had above average hotel occupation rates and more than 35,000 business tables were set up during the event. Our main aim is to make this economic impact visible in the lives of Cancún's citizens.</p><h4>How do such events contribute to expanding the brands Mexico and Cancún worldwide?</h4><p>Mexico is the second largest recipient of tourists in North America and Latin America combined, just behind the US. We received almost 24 million visitors in 2013. Quintana Roo receives around 10 million visitors out of that number, while Cancún receives around 4 million. Our goal is to sustain the positive trend, and we focus all our efforts on achieving this. Tourism represents a significant share of Mexico's GDP, and plays a key role in national transformation. This is something that President Peña Nieto has understood well by incorporating tourism as one of the key drivers of his public policies, labeling the industry a strategic sector, and increasing investment in it by organizing events such as Tianguis Turí­stico. In fact, the current administration altogether with the federal and state government has already invested more than $46 million in paving roads over the past six months. President Peña Nieto also announced a $14 billion budget for the tourism industry, which will prioritize the recovery of beaches.</p><h4>How can tourism contribute to the further development of Cancún?</h4><p>The citizens of Cancún, regardless of their places of origin, are the region's main assets. Cancún is the dream destination for many recently graduated youth who want to work in the tourism industry, and once they arrive they perceive Cancún as a land of opportunities. Thanks to that commitment, and the character of these and many other people, Cancún today is one of the leading tourism destinations in the world.</p><h4>What are the strategic goals of the Cancún brand in the tourism industry?</h4><p>Over the years, Cancún has become a top destination for “Spring Breakers" from the US. Industry research reveals that many of these people return with children once married, thanks to their fond memories of the service they received and the quality of the resorts and beaches. Our goal is to achieve this kind of stability within other segments and guarantee an average occupation rate of above 80% throughout the year. All strategies are implemented alongside the government and the Mexican Tourism Confederation. For example, the success of this year's Tianguis Turismo was due to the perfect combination of these three institutions and their efforts.</p><h4>What business opportunities does Cancún offer to investors?</h4><p>The real estate industry is starting to show positive trends following four difficult years. We will finally complete the 2013-2030 territorial classification plan, setting up the guidelines for those interested in developing hotels, or similar projects. We have to boost the development of certain tourism projects away from the coastline, as it is already fully urbanized. These new projects we want to push forward will also help us to reach other segments of the economy; basically, the plan will involve the development of the city and its hospitality industry. Also, I should mention that the center of Cancun is undergoing a thorough renovation after 44 intense years of existence. It is a modernization process that involves a large investment of over $40 million in the construction of new buildings, and related infrastructure and services. In short, we are in the process of developing a city far beyond the hotel image it had many years ago.</p><h4>How is the nature of tourism changing in Cancún?</h4><p>We have two main focuses for the development of tourism; in sports tourism we organized the first international fishing tournament in the history of Cancún, with the participation of 64 boats from around Mexico. In addition, golf tourism could be a future element in our strategy. The other type of visit we would like to boost is cultural tourism linked to musical events. Recently we hosted Ricky Martin, Enrique Iglesias, and Bon Jovi, among others, and such events clearly bring guests. Our idea would be to create a widely appealing cultural calendar to attract further international interest. I should also mention that MICE tourism is one of the segments in which we see the greatest potential for Cancún. In my opinion, this component comes second in the ranking, just behind family tourism.</p><h4>How do you see the future of Cancún?</h4><p>Cancún never had a municipal president raised in the area, so this novelty has encouraged us in many ways. My cabinet is entirely composed of young people who were born and raised here, meaning that the level of commitment to what happens in Cancún is higher than ever. And again, the urban development plan is going to play a key role in the Cancún we all want to see in the future.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you sought to develop your business interests over the past decade?</h4><p>We were one of the leading companies in the sector for 14 years, and sold it to a British business group 12 years ago. Later, along with my previous business partners, we decided to incorporate this company. It has been a long road in which we have gone through all possible stages, until reaching the second spot in the Mexican logistics industry just behind DHL. However, we are the largest Mexican logistics company. The business model and the working structures are the same as we had in our previous company. Yet, we have learnt to explore new market segments that over a decade ago were irrelevant, like e-commerce. In this context, we have adapted the company to new market scenarios. Today, around 2,500 people work for Onest Logistics, from the 25 or so on the first day. Our operating surface is 320,000 sqm and we are set to open a new storage facility of 20,000 sqm. We are looking forward to opening two more storage facilities 30,000 sqm each in 2015. We are in the process of expanding our infrastructure and storage facilities; we will have an additional 100,000 sqm in about one year's time. This expansion in surface area means a growth in sales volumes and employee numbers. We expect over the next three years to become the leading logistics company in the  Mexican industry. Only then will we look into expanding abroad, such as in Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Brazil, or Argentina. One of our main advantages is the personalized service we offer to each one of our clients, putting quality and security at the top of our priorities. Today, I would say that 50% of our sales come from recommendations and word of mouth. In terms of growth, 2014 will be the fifth year in a row that we post a 20% growth rate, and we believe that for next year too, we will achieve growth of 22%-23%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Velsimex is one of the top six companies in the agrochemical sector, and your competitors are all major multinationals. How do you remain competitive in such a market?<br></h4><p>We started 25 years ago by importing just one technical product: chlordane. I had been working at Velsicol Chemical Corporation, which sold 80% of the company to Sandoz. Velsicol did not sell chlordane to Sandoz, and so we created Velsimex to distribute the product. It was a strong product used against termites, but as a technical product it faced opposition in the market and was withdrawn because as it was highly persistent. As Velsicol was the sole manufacturer in the world, we had been turning a good profit from the product and constantly reinvesting our profits to purchase new products, having observed independent companies from China and India. This enabled us to compete with the multinationals at that time, 25 years ago. Multinationals always have new products to launch on the market, which is their major weapon. Our major weapon has been my word, because everyone can sell a commodity, but if you honor your word you are standing by what your company promised.</p><h4>How did your company develop over subsequent years?</h4><p>In the past, Mexican companies were purchasing many of their products locally from multinational companies, or from a local government company called FertiMex, which manufactured about six insecticides. In the beginning, we were buying the technical product, passing it to another company that formulated it for us, and then marketing the product under our own label. Subsequently, we purchased our own plant and started to formulate the products ourselves. That was how we managed to compete with the multinationals; we imported technical-grade product, formulated it, and went to the market under our own label. We improved our market share by providing credit and offering conditions that customers welcomed. At the outset we tried to sell close to the price of the multinationals, while offering a much lower price to distributors. When a distributor sells a non-multinational product at the same public price, they enjoy the highest margins. My thinking when we began was that if I gave healthy profits to our distributors we would establish a distribution network for the future, which is precisely what happened. Today, Velsimex is the largest supplier to 60% of our 350 customers, which gives us the opportunity to create long-term relationships.</p><h4>Have you created jobs directly or indirectly as a result of your growth?</h4><p>We have grown rapidly as a result of importing technical products in our formative years.  However, these days many other companies are doing the same, particularly from India and China, and we face stiff competition. Our plan is to continue developing registrations and manufacturing technical support at such a rate that we become the first or second seller of every product we offer, thereby increasing our margins. Another plan is to synthesize certain technical insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. These are the two pillars on which we are planning to build the future of the company. Between our two plants, Agrí­cola Innovací­on, Velsimex, and Quimix we have more than 400 employees.</p><h4>To what extent do you think the agrochemical market can help increase the agriculture sector's contribution to the economy?</h4><p>In Mexico, agriculture is not treated with the importance it deserves, and accounts for only 4%-5% of our economy, although over 40% of the Mexican population lives in rural areas. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were 1.6 billion people in the world. There are now around 7 billion people and the acreage more or less than same. The real difference is agrochemicals, the use of which produces a much higher yield. Major developments stem from new agricultural practices that include the use of agrochemicals such as fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides. If more agrochemicals were used correctly in Mexico, the country's crop production could improve significantly. For example, in some areas one hectare produces more than 14 tons of corn, while in Chiapas there is land where the yield is only 800 kilograms per hectare.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main development strategies of the Secretariat of Tourism in 2013?<br></h4><p>In 2013, we focused on diversifying Mexico's tourism offering for the international community, targeting specific campaigns of certain touristic segments. We have increased financial resources in touristic promotion, given its strategic importance for the economy; it attracts investment, and boosts infrastructure, while generating employment. Therefore, our strategies emphasized the diversification of the offer, the reinforcement of the industry as a strategic sector for the economy and boosted growth. A globally intensified tourism industry means increased competition, whereby diversification is key to success. We have conducted extensive research into identifying the most competitive destinations of our country to better develop an international promotion strategy based on connectivity, product innovation, diversification, human capacity, and so forth. This study also enabled us to better target investment and the allocation of economic resources. For example, we developed a portfolio of future investments, and tourism was included for the first time in the National Infrastructure Plan, which comprises six different economic sectors. This plan foresees a total investment of Ps7.7 billion—Ps181 million for the tourism industry. The overall goal is to continue growing as an international tourism destination. For this reason, we want to boost the development of tourism infrastructure aimed at regionally connecting destinations and boosting regional development. In this context, we are the only economic sector in the National Infrastructure Plan that articulates the other five, and this plan will definitely make us more competitive, closing regional, economic, and social gaps in our country and among society. For example, the program has a strong focus on the southeast of Mexico, a region that lags behind most others, but one that also has great touristic potential. Also, we plan to develop archeological touristic destinations within our country with a common and joint strategy, which has never been done before. These efforts are aimed at identifying the real touristic potential of each region and entity, as well as the particular segment, and determining how we can better channel investment to ensure their development. For example, one of the segments of greater potential is MICE tourism, and we foresee the development of promotional campaigns and the construction of infrastructure aimed at strengthening Mexico's role in this tourism sector. Meanwhile, in 2013 we exceeded our historic best year of 2008 in terms of revenues and tourist arrivals. In 1Q2014 we had a 15% rise in foreign exchange, a 17% increase in the arrival of international tourists, an 11% increase in tourist arrivals by air, and a 7.5% increase in visitor expenditure.</p><h4>In which international markets is Mexico interested in promoting its tourism offering?</h4><p>Our key market, due to its sheer proximity, is the US, followed by Spain and the UK. However, we are making increasing efforts to promote Mexico in the emerging markets of Southeast Asia, an area of significance for Mexico from an economic and foreign affairs perspective. There are markets in Asia like Japan, in which we already have a consolidated position; last year's tourist figures exceeded 100,000. Therefore, we can mention two main strategic lines in our international strategy; to further growth in our consolidated markets and also to open new ones, especially in Asia, with China being one of the main countries. There we plan to implement a more aggressive promotional campaign, including our presence in the main events in the sector, and build up a stronger image of our country, including strategic partnerships with tourism agents. In addition, Russia and Australia are two other markets of considerable interest.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2013, the IFC tripled its average annual investments in Mexico. What factors prompted this increase in project funding?<br></h4><p>Before 2013, our average for new investments was between $250 million and $300 million a year. To some extent, the year ending in June 2013 was an outlier, and the result of a business plan that we put in place in 2010. It was a strategy of repositioning in the market, aiming for higher impact, and gaining greater relevance in Mexico's business community. Our approach was two-pronged: on the one hand, we wanted to increase the percentage of our portfolio in Mexico, because Mexico is a large country with developmental needs, a positive outlook in growth terms, and open to external investment, particularly with the reforms lining up. We also wanted to rebalance our investment portfolio, because it was relatively skewed to financial intermediaries, and we wanted to have more investments in the real sector. We started repositioning IFC in the marketplace, looking primarily to sectors of Mexico's greatest competitiveness, and in sectors where there was more content in terms of innovation and employment potential.</p><h4>Which sectors are you focusing on?</h4><p>We came across a study that was done at the end of 2009 by BCG and adapted the results of the study to understand what our best options were for positioning ourselves with respect to what IFC does. We looked at the sectors with comparative competitive advantage and developmental impact. We measured the results in one case vis-í -vis domestic demand, and in the other case via the relationship of the competitiveness of these sectors globally compared to Mexico. For instance, financial services provides a combination of domestic demand and developmental impact that we are looking for as in Mexico private credit penetration is 26% of GDP, one of the lowest in Latin America. Besides financial services we defined housing, food and beverage, health services, and education as competitive sectors were the IFC can play a role. Key sectors that are driven by external markets where Mexico competes globally and have a high developmental impact on the economy, included some sectors that we don't yet play a role, such as steel. Tourism, for example is important, but remains on the boundary. Other sectors we included were health services, business services, information technology, electronic and electric equipment, industries requiring heavy machinery, and innovative manufacturing.</p><h4>Why is Mexico important to the IFC investment strategy in Latin America?</h4><p>Mexico is now one of the 10 highest contributors in the IFC portfolio. However, this was not the case until quite recently, because it was perceived within the IFC that Mexico no longer required its support; however Mexico's income inequality and the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 hit the country severely, increasing poverty levels and confirming that the IFC still had a role to play. Following the crisis, the World Bank put in place very quickly a financial support program, and our reactivation was a little slower because unlike the World Bank, we are market driven, meaning we go where the market dictates. There are areas where we have played an important role, especially in renewable energy. We have invested a great deal in wind power in Oaxaca. We have European investors as well, and have invested in a solar-electricity power plant in Baja California. It is a 30MW plant and the first merchant solar-power plant, making it an important project.</p><h4>What is the importance of your investment plan in the petrochemical park that Braskem Idesa is building in Veracruz for Mexico's petrochemical industry, and what are your expectations regarding its impact for the economy of the region?</h4><p>We started working to develop the relationship with Idesa, the Mexican partner of this project, in 2009. After a year and a half of talks, it called us with an offer for a major, challenging project. We realized the project's importance, and agreed to support it. It has been awarded international recognition and the financial arrangers and backers have been arranged. We believed that the project was important because it was the largest petrochemical project in the country for 25 years. We had committed a relatively large amount of money to it as well, roughly $630 million, more or less half from our own balance sheet, and the other half from external banks. The project is only a kilometer away from the city of Veracruz. The impact on development fields have resulted in manufacturing jobs, plastic production, and various groups have been enticed by the success to move employment back to the area.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give an overview of DuPont's presence in Mexico?<br></h4><p>The world population reached 7 billion in 2012, and could reach 9 billion by 2050. That is an extra 2 billion people that will require food and services in a number of areas. I try to put these numbers in terms of the Mexican population, and have worked out that the population of our country is growing by about 2 million per year, which places increased demands on infrastructure and supplies. The capabilities and skill set we have as a company allows us to be well placed to become an important player in serving a growing society's needs. The area of energy, of course, will become increasingly important, and the government is trying to pass reforms aimed at boosting the potential of the energy sector that will address both today's and future energy needs of our country. We see ourselves as a science company that drives innovation through strong collaboration with customers and stakeholders along the value chains where we participate, with a particular focus on food, nutrition, energy, and protection.</p><h4>Which business units have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Several of them. We have an engineering polymers division that is very closely linked with the automotive industry. I expect a lot of growth in this division because of all the investments that have been announced here for the automotive industry. In the next four years, production capacity in Mexico will grow from the current 2.5 million vehicles to 3.5 million annually. DuPont Mexico has been in operation since 1925. Our competition is very strong, but we have a lot of experience and also have great people so I am confident that we will continue to succeed. We have another division that we refer to as Packaging &amp; Industrial Polymers, which is for developing new and creative packaging films to preserve the shelf life of products and to improve the printing techniques that enhance the value and power of brands before consumers. We also have a pigments division, where we produce titanium dioxide; we have a very large manufacturing site in Altamira, in the State of Tamaulipas. We are making a very significant investment of $580 million in this site to more than double the current capacity—this is a project that we hope will be complete by the end of 2015. We have five such plants in DuPont; three in the US, one in Taiwan, and one in Mexico. We decided to invest in Mexico because the productivity and competitiveness of that facility is second to none. DuPont is the largest producer of titanium dioxide in the world, and it manufactures it using a technology that we invented and patented back in the 1950s, which gives us a technological advantage. Mexico has a strong industrial base; its exports to the rest of the world are greater than the exports of all Latin American countries combined. Mexico exports $1 billion a day worth of products to the US on average, while, in comparison, Germany exports around $300 million.</p><h4>What successes has your innovation center recorded?</h4><p>The DuPont Mexico Innovation Center is a concept that came together about three years ago. Offering global access to our best scientists and engineers around the world has proven to be something customers value very greatly and have has allowed us to improve the speed at which we find and develop solutions. The Mexico Innovation Center was the first one in Latin America and our fifth in the world. It has been a major success, with 245 meetings with customers in our first year. We had a total of 1,100 customers visiting during the first year of operations, with a total of 53 projects identified for development. In its first year of operations, $25 million was generated for DuPont from these projects, and it is just as dynamic in the second year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[business-never-tires]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Goodyear evolved in the Mexican market since the 1940s?<br></h4><p>Goodyear has a relationship of over 70 years with Mexico, and this market has always been a vital one for our company. It was in fact one of the first markets that Goodyear arrived in beyond the US, and since then we have been leading it. Mexico is crucial due to its proximity to the US, but also boasts an interesting domestic market, which is the second largest in Latin America after Brazil, also in terms of tire volume. Mexico's replacement business represents more than 18 million tires, and being attractive, has numerous competitors. Ours is an open market that has in place free trade agreements (FTAs) with key regions around the world. This simplifies both the production of tires in Mexico, and importing. Even though our main competitors in the industry, the large players, are producing tires in Mexico, more that 60% of total domestic demands is imported. In the case of radial truck tires, 100% are imported. This underlines just how convenient it is to do business with different regions across the world.</p><h4>Do you have plans to invest in a new plant in Mexico?</h4><p>There is such a possibility, and in mid-2014 we announced that due to our solid momentum and cash flow, we would invest in a new plant in the Americas to produce high value-added tires. Demand is set to increase over the coming year, and so as a company, we need to increase our production capacity. The plant will service markets in North America and Latin America, and we are in the final process of selecting its location. Mexico is one of the final candidates, and is a strong one. In terms of technology, this will be the best plant that the company has anywhere in world. It will produce complex tires, which requires the latest technology. The plant is required to enter production by 2017, and the final selection of location will be made at the beginning of 2015.</p><h4>What recent changes have been made to your product portfolio?</h4><p>We have a comprehensive portfolio and one of the most competitive ranges in the market. Due to the number of competitors, Mexico is a multi-brand market. In order to support this demand, we are managing three major brands, having divided the market into the three segments of premium, mid-tier, and economy. The first brand  is Goodyear, and the second is Dunlop, which we launched at the beginning of June 2014 with three completely new product lines. It will give us about 80% coverage of the total market. Last but not least, we have Kelly, with which we compete in the third tier. Being more price-oriented we call it an economy model. We are leveraging these three brands to ensure a competitive portfolio that can lead each segment.</p><h4>Which areas have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Mexico is destined to become a still more attractive market for automotive and tire companies. And in terms of applications, the two segments that are growing the most are sports cars and SUVs. Goodyear will grow here much faster than in other segments. In terms of value, it will be active in the mid-tier and premium segments, as the latter is seeing pronounced growth that can only accelerate over time.</p><h4>What strategies will you need to remain competitive?</h4><p>Goodyear's strategy is based on three pillars. The first is the brand, as brand awareness in Mexico is crucial. The second is the quality of our portfolio, which is competitive in terms of quality, performance, and price. Price is also vital in Mexico, and we are competing aggressively on this variable. Lastly, we have a robust distribution channel through our dealer networks. Goodyear has a presence across the entire region. We are trying to have the right tire, at the right place, at the right time, and at the right price to ensure we are the consumer's first choice. We also have a clearly defined segmentation strategy, rather than considering the market as a whole. The market has 12 segments, seven of which we are focused on leading. We currently lead the mid-tier segment across the market's four applications. Meanwhile, Goodyear ranks among the top three in the premium segment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your contribution to the development of the financial sector in Mexico, and what is the significance of the Mexican market for your brand?<br></h4><p>Volkswagen Leasing has been in Mexico for over 40 years, and Volkswagen Bank for more than six. During that time our companies have significantly contributed to the expansion of the automobile financing sector, as well as to the sales of the Volkswagen Group in Mexico. Since we opened our doors, our main focus has been the satisfaction of our clients; this includes the brands of the group, the dealers, and the final customers. We have always cared about developing the best variety of products for our clients, namely products that are not only innovative, but also greatly customer oriented, and our performance in the Mexican market shows that we are succeeding; in 2013, we sold over 75,000 financing contracts, and in 2014 we are planning to sell around 80,000.</p><h4>What new products are you launching in this market?</h4><p>Innovation is central to our strategy. Volkswagen Bank, as the first direct bank constituted in Mexico, is a great example of this. It is in the same vein that for both, Volkswagen Bank and Volkswagen Leasing, the design and launch of innovative and customer-oriented products is essential; these products set a real difference in the market. For example, we recently launched a program that embodies our sense of responsibility toward the environment, “Think Blue Finance," and that has no equal in Mexico. This program considers complete financing packages with additional benefits for the customers that buy an environmental friendly car. This program was created in Mexico and is considered as a best practice for Volkswagen Financial Services worldwide.</p><h4>How do you develop local talent?</h4><p>Training and education are core issues for us, as the success of our companies relies on our human talent. In that line, we work in close cooperation with the best universities in Mexico; we approach these institutions to train our staff and, also, to connect with current students and offer them opportunities to enhance their knowledge of the sector and their professional development.</p><h4>What will be the focus of your growth strategy?</h4><p>We will continue strengthening our position in the Mexican market because of our unique focus on the client and the quality of service that we provide. We want to grow together with the Volkswagen Group's brands, and are creating the conditions to make this possible; we continue to increase our share in their growth. Currently, of every 100 cars from the VW Group that are sold, we finance 40, and although we are in quite a good position, we have to keep improving that number.</p><h4>How do you view the future of the automotive sector in Mexico?</h4><p>We see that many companies are establishing production plants here—Audi's will be opening soon, just 60 kilometers away from our facilities, for example. This speaks about the importance of Mexico for the global automotive industry. This country is no longer considered because of the possibility of finding cheap labor, but because of other differentiators, such as quality and logistics; they play an important role in the manufacturers' decisions to set up business here. Recently, Volkswagen celebrated 50 years of presence in Mexico, and our group CEO referred to the importance of the country for Volkswagen. And indeed, we still see a big growth potential in this market, and we trust in it. Puebla, for instance, has the second-largest Volkswagen production plant in the world; we are proud because we are contributing, even more, to the growth of the already great presence of Volkswagen in Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the Mexican market for BNP Paribas?<br></h4><p>This year we will celebrate our 10th anniversary here in Mexico. We initiated our activity in a shy way a few years back. In mid-2013, we decided to change the focus of the company. Our company was solely focused on the automotive finance business, and in response we have instituted a three-year development plan with our various subsidiaries. For the personal finance sector, 80% of growth for the next three years will come from the automotive business, so the focus in Mexico is on the automotive finance segment. The automotive industry has been growing steadily since the last crisis and hopes to continue on this path, aiming to reach 1.7 million units in a few years. In 2013, we closed with over 1 million units sold. We see a trend in the automotive finance market that is growing faster than the automotive industry. In 2013, our portfolio of auto units grew by 65%.</p><h4>What new products are you planning to launch in the automotive market?</h4><p>We have a great product for the automotive business through which we targeted the new and used vehicle market for SMEs and consumers. As well, we are focusing on the motorcycle segment. We enjoy strong collaboration with Harley-Davidson, Bombardier, and KTM. We aim to use KTM Finance as a brand to finance its motorcycle sales. We are also talking with Polaris to launch the same finance model, and have another agreement with Suzuki. We think that the motorcycle business has to grow; currently, the number is at 350,000 to 400,000 units a year, but the potential is huge. In Argentina, 800,000 motorcycles per year are sold, yet its population is just one-third that of Mexico.</p><h4>How are the company's services performing in the motorcycle market?</h4><p>I was with BNP in Argentina, where we are the leaders in motorcycle financing. We provide one out of every four loans for motorcycles in Argentina, meaning we have a strong knowledge of how to handle this credit. The performance of our finance services in the motorcycle market is the best in its class in Mexico. This market has a range of financing offers available, and BNP Paribas Personal Finance (BNPP PF) has the expertise to analyze and grant the necessary credit. Today, we are working with prestigious brands such as Harley Davison, KTM as KTM Finance, and we are about to launch Suzuki Financial Services Moto. The service is the same as auto, as in less than 20 minutes the customer can find out the result of a credit application, and all they need is their customer ID without any other documentation.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in automotive finance in Mexico?</h4><p>Financing in Mexico is showing an uptrend; finance is growing and will be a key player in reaching the volume expected for the automotive industry. Within the market, competitiveness is on the rise, with a strong presence of captive financing companies and banks fighting to increase their participation in the market. Credit will have to grow; currently, the average credit penetration for new cars is at around 50%, which is quite low for a mature market. We should be looking at 70% or 80% for finance penetration. If you combine all the factors, the potential for growth for the country and the automotive business and finance market is high; this is why we are investing.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the automotive financing sector in Mexico in the medium term?</h4><p>Our outlook is that the uptrend will continue, and that the financing share will be key for the automotive industry, while the dealers will need a finance partner with better services and competitive offers. In 2013, BNPP PF grew 65% in the auto segment compared to 2012. For 2014, we are planning to grow by more than 70%. As mentioned, Mexico is a focus of development for BNPP PF, and we are in an aggressive development process that should allow us to quadruple our auto loans portfolio by 2016.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Actinver developed in the Mexican market over the past 20 years, in terms of its key investment funds and landmarks?<br></h4><p>We launched the company in 1994, just ahead of the crisis, which meant that the first few years were slow. We started as a mutual fund company with three funds, one in equities and two in bonds. Upon growing we observed that it was difficult to distribute, sell, and promote our funds to diverse investors, we even tried to create synergies with other mutual funds, but at that time the market was extremely jealous of its clients and distribution networks. We, therefore, decided to create a network of nationwide branches. For the first eight years, our mutual fund operation was our sole business, although, again, with growth came the scope to cover other investor requirements. We purchased a number of competitors, including a small company called Finacorp, in 2001, we then developed our brokerage house in 2004 with the acquisition of Bursamex and later entered the Afore business, subsequently sold to Metlife. In 2006, we bought a major competitor at the time, Lloyd Guadalajara. We were then able to acquire a number of other major entities, including Prudential Bank, in 2009. The latter acquisition enabled us to do two things; firstly we purchased a mutual fund company, which is now a core business. We grew by MXN15 billion that day. Secondly, we acquired a banking license. For the past 20 years, we have built and created a business platform that has served as the cornerstone of our present and future organic growth.</p><h4>What is the significance of listing on the Mexican Stock Exchange?</h4><p>We went public in May 2010. By listing the company, we accomplished many things, and became more transparent to the public and more visible to our investors. As the SME that we were at the time, we were able to leverage financial markets to raise capital and finance. I, therefore, believe that SMEs should view the financial market as a vehicle to raise capital and gain a firmer foothold in the market.</p><h4>What is Actinver's role in bringing SMEs to the market?</h4><p>There are around 150 listed companies on the Mexican Stock Exchange. There are many SMEs in the Mexican economy, and there is much work to do in terms of bringing them to the market. These companies are ready, and we are seeing considerable consolidation and many companies attempting to raise capital. Our job consists of telling them that they are able to finance and raise capital through the markets. In the past, small companies were traditionally family-owned businesses, and did not typically approach the banks for money. We should be able to bring more companies to the market now, creating a more diverse and active market, making our stock exchange more appealing to local and international investors.</p><h4>What will the major opportunities in the Mexican market be for foreign investors?</h4><p>Everyone is looking to invest in energy, which should bring us not only welcome opportunities in that sector, but also new revenues and employment that in turn will generate wealth. We need to be ready to lend to these companies to facilitate their business. One field that I believe is an opportunity for investors in Mexico involves the Fibras (Real Estate Investment Funds). Fibra Uno, the largest in Mexico, has returns of around 7% to 8%.</p><h4>Regarding the latest financial sector regulations, how do you view the medium term and what will Actinver's role be?</h4><p>Since we are a new company, we have been able to adjust quickly, and since we were born with the new regulations we are well capitalized, and ready to take advantage of our circumstances. In terms of financial reforms, it was a welcome beginning although much could still change for the better to foster further improvement. Our strategy for the future is clear: we want to focus on private banking.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Mexico's fiscal dependence on oil revenue and the US market changed or improved over the past year?<br></h4><p>On those two points I would note some positive momentum. On the fiscal front the government has presented a reform package that explores alternative sources of revenue to limit the nation's oil dependence. The proposal that was approved by congress was more conservative, but I think it raised awareness nonetheless. Structural changes in the economy take time, and you will not see major changes from one year to the next. We observe policies, proposals, and signals that are going in the right direction. On the trade front, relations with the US are well established and long standing. One of the first signals that the administration was aware of the importance of this issue was when the Minister of Finance became the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the impact of the fiscal reform?</h4><p>Many areas need addressing for reforms to have effect. I think that the positive aspect of this administration is its recognition of the need and willingness to work in parallel on several fronts. They seem capable of going further than their predecessors on this occasion, although it's not fully within their power to do so as they require congressional approval.</p><h4>What are your most important projects in poverty alleviation and rural development in Mexico?</h4><p>The engagement model that we have with countries of the World Bank encompasses more than loans. We start with the national development plan and agree with the government on priority areas. Based on that we develop a program to establish the optimum instrument in support of the country. This is usually a combination of financial and knowledge products, and the dissemination of global experience. There are four areas on which we are focused and our strategy for Mexico for the next six years starts with productivity. We are working with the financial sector, competition, and innovation. The focus is on how to support smaller companies. The second area is related to increasing social prosperity. We are working with the government on offering second-generation social protection, and Mexico is known to be proactive on this issue. The third major area concerns strengthening public finances and government efficiency. This is closely related to enhancing service delivery, particularly at the local level, and to working with states.</p><div class="quote">“The World Bank projects growth of between 3% and 4% in Mexico for 2014"</div><h4>What are your expectations for education reform and its likely consequences for future generations?</h4><p>There are two main issues to address here: the quality of education and the links between the education system and the labor markets. Implementation will be very important, and highlights government recognition that education plays a major role in reducing poverty. We share the government's concern that national labor productivity has risen by just by 2% over the past 20 years, compared to more than 60% among its competitors. Up to 40% of Mexican employers say they have difficulties in filling job vacancies for want of qualified people. Most of these reforms will take some time to take effect, but it's important that this administration is willing to start the process.</p><h4>Your remit also includes Colombia. What are the main factors behind that nation's sustainable advance?</h4><p>Colombia's economy has been able to withstand external shocks thanks to four shock absorbers: the flexible exchange rate, a very manageable public debt, modest deficits, and a solid financial system. One of the main impacts of the crisis in many emerging countries has been a decrease in the credit extended to the private sector. Yet the robustness of Colombia's financial system has prevented a duplication of this. The high commodity prices have also helped.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Port of Liverpool grown since 1847?<br></h4><p>Puerto de Liverpool was founded by a French immigrant in Mexico named Jean Baptiste Ebrard, who sold clothing, garments, and fabrics imported from factories in France. Most of the merchandise would come from France through the port of Liverpool. The simplifying phrase “merchandise coming from the Port of Liverpool" entered the language, and is the origin of the company name. At the beginning of the 20th Century the decision was made to build a large department store one block from the main square in Mexico City. The building was later torn down, and on the same plot of land those who inherited the company opened another store in 1930, which continues to operate today. In the late 1940s the owners decided to concentrate on retail, in a defining moment for the company. A decade later, they opened their first store beyond downtown Mexico City, in the area of Insurgentes. Later, in 1964, the company went public, becoming listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange. This began a slow expansion, and in 1980, the fifth store project was opened in Perisur, which was an entire shopping center. The exploitation of commercial space and shopping centers offered new opportunities to the company, and today we have stores in almost every state of the country as we grow in step with Mexico's middle class. In fact, in 2014 we will open up our 100th store in the country.</p><h4>What have been the most significant acquisitions for Puerto de Liverpool?</h4><p>In the late 1980s, the company bought a significant stake in the Fábricas de Francia store chain. And in the early nineties, we secured 100% ownership of that company. Subsequently, we have purchased a few small regional chains such as Las Galas in the southeast of the country, which had nine stores back then. We then purchased the Salinas de Rocha department stores, which had been bought by Electra some months earlier. Those were significant acquisitions, and subsequently we experienced aggressive organic growth, opening stores nationwide. We have 22 Fábricas de Francia stores and 76 Liverpool stores today.</p><h4>Could you expand on your activity in the real estate and financial sectors?</h4><p>Following our success with the Perisur shopping center, we decided to build more establishments. This is an important business for the company, and we have 20 shopping centers that we own outright, or in part, but we manage them because we feel that this is the only way to sustain the desired level of maintenance. At the same time, we have always provided a credit card business, but it has grown consistently over the past 15 years, becoming an important contributor to Company profitability.</p><h4>What have been Puerto de Liverpool's most recent major investments?</h4><p>We have invested heavily in technology over recent years. Without this, we would not have been able to sustain the growth we have experienced over the past few years. We made the decision to operate integrated systems, and today we have a full suite of SAP systems that work together well. We made a significant investment in Queretaro, and opened a large store there with a sales area of about 260,000 square feet. It is still in its infancy, but so far has been a positive experience, and is a part of our nationwide expansion. We also have important investments this year in the cities of Toluca and Puebla, where we are set to open two large stores surrounded by two regional shopping centers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[strategically-speaking]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the strategic significance of Mexico for Deutsche Bank?<br></h4><p>Mexico represents a unique opportunity for Deutsche Bank. We focus on helping  corporates and the federal government meet their financial and strategic needs. We target the top clients in Mexico, with whom we work in capital raising, risk management, treasury services and M&amp;A activities. In 2013, we won the Euro Money Magazine Award for Best Investment Bank in Mexico in 2013.  We were leaders in most business lines in which we participate. Mexico is a country of stability and high growth potential with GDP of over $1.6 trillion, a diversified economy, excellent location, a young population and important natural resources.</p><h4>What has been the main focus of your growth strategy over the past five years?</h4><p>Our strategy is built on the strengths of Deutsche Bank globally, namely investment banking, market capabilities, and risk management. We are also building up local capabilities, cash management, and are funding loans locally. We are focused on developing the trade finance business, which is crucial for a country that exports and imports over $2 billion per day.</p><h4>What is your role in promoting VEMEX (foreign securities for Mexican markets)?</h4><p>That is actually a business we created in partnership with the authorities BMV and INDEVAL. It accounts for about 25% of the daily volume of the Mexican stock market. It provides strong opportunities for Mexican investors to invest in global financial instruments locally. As markets become more sophisticated and people want to have a true global asset allocation, they are going to invest in international securities as part of their portfolio strategies.</p><h4>What are your views on Mexico's financial reforms?</h4><p>I believe that financial reforms will be positive for the country. It has many positive aspects for example it establish clear processes for collecting guarantees and specialized courts to handle financial disputes. Reform will increase banking penetration in the country, both from the deposit side, and the use of credit. Importantly, the focus of development banks is changing toward the promotion of growth and development, rather than just protecting their capital.</p><h4>What of the role of the financial sector in limiting the informal economy?</h4><p>The informal sector has to see the benefits of being a part of the formal economy in terms of access to the social-safety net, availability of credit, and access to programs that help them gain higher productivity. In addition, education is critical to the development of the formal economy. It will take time, but we are developing the basic infrastructure to transform the informal economy into a formal one. Once you integrate productivity, greater tax collection and transparency result. The best route to achieving this is through incentivization. This has been the stated goal on the government, to push various reforms including welfare, education, and financial reform.</p><h4>What is your forecast growth rate for Deutsche Bank Mexico?</h4><p>I think we should expect double-digit revenue growth within the next couple of years. Between direct and indirect employees, we now have about 150 people, and that should have reached about 300 staff by 2016.</p><h4>What is the significance of your award for best investment bank in Mexico?</h4><p>We are proud of this achievement; because it is reassuring that other people also think that we are doing well. In 2013, we have participated in many critical deals for our clients. But it is more than an award for us; it is an award for our clients because we have been the leader in providing what they need in order to continue growing, to strengthen their financial positions, to have the resources they need, and to implement their strategies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes your company a leader in its sector?<br></h4><p>We have always had competitors, but our direct competitors are not commercial banks, but traditional entities. Our key difference is that we've been able to fund ourselves, both in the national and international markets. With this funding we have been able to outgrow the competition, and are able to offer a bigger and better range of products to our customers at their best convenience.</p><h4>What was the significance of listing on the Mexico Stock Exchange in 2012?</h4><p>It was a major accomplishment after 20 years in the market to be able to take the company public, as there are few such companies in Mexico. The sector in which we have long worked is just starting to develop. Our company is really not known by end consumers, even though it is a large company when you see the numbers.</p><h4>How has your product portfolio evolved over the past three years, and what will your growth strategy focus on going forward?</h4><p>We started our business with durable goods loans, leveraging our synergy with MABE. From there we moved into the payroll loans business in 2004. Then, in 2007, we started providing group loans. Since then, our portfolio has been evolving more toward payroll loans because of their maturity. Group loans have a very short maturity of about three months. In contrast, the maturity of durable goods loans is about a year and of payroll loans over three years. Around 57% of our loans are payroll loans and 43% are from the other business lines. Today, we are the leaders in the public sector payroll loans business. We want to remain at that level, and I forecast growth of between 15% and 20% per annum. Two years ago, we undertook an analysis of used car financing. We focus on the base of the pyramid and look at products that traditional banks have, but that are not doing hugely well at the base. At Crédito Real, we have built expertise in analyzing people and making fast credit decisions at the very low end of the pyramid where people don't have a credit history. We look at traditional products, such as auto financing, but we look at how we can do it differently to access low-income people. We discovered that the competition was not coming from traditional banks, but entities similar to ourselves. The largest contributor to growth over the coming years will definitely come from used car sales and SME loans. These are virgin markets with huge growth potential, and also because of the significant government support programs that will be made available.</p><h4>What is Crédito Real's role in supporting SMEs, and how important are they in terms of national growth?</h4><p>Two years ago, we also started financing SMEs, especially the smaller ones. They are established businesses that lack traditional finance. They exist between the informal and formal economies, and as such offer real opportunities. A year ago, when President Peña Nieto took office, he announced many programs to support companies willing to lend money to this sector of the economy. That's when we really concentrated on it. We already work with Nafinsa, and have enjoyed a relationship for around 15 years. Today, it is seeking to lend more to SMEs in the same way as Bancomext. Everybody targeting the SME sector is looking for intermediaries that know how to lend to this sector, such as ourselves. There are many players already in the market. Banks have had SME-oriented products for many years, and yet there are many niches within the SME segment that need to be addressed. We are focusing on the smaller of those that generate revenue of between Ps5 million and Ps50 million a year. You cannot really base a credit assessment on their own financials, which is why we focus on analyzing the owner of the company. If, for example, we are to lend money to a beauty salon, much of its income is in cash, so the only way to know its true financial capacity is to familiarize yourself with the business. We send people to observe the business, whereupon we can better assess what kind of loan we can provide. This is something the banks do not do today. We never wait for people to come to us; we approach customers on the street and directly at their businesses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you decide do place your Private Equity Fund through capital development certificates on the Mexican Stock Exchange?<br></h4><p>There are listed and unlisted private equity funds all around the world. We decided to list our Fund on the Mexican Stock Exchange because in Mexico we have a pension system with defined contributions pensions, which prevailing regulations only permit to invest in traded securities. These pension funds are called afores and are managed by the private sector. Ours was the first listed fund to be issued with capital calls. Initially Limited Partners invested 20% and we have been doing capital calls ever since.</p><h4>What have been the main products you financed with the initial $400 million fund?</h4><p>The fund is for infrastructure and energy, including highways, airports, ports, trains, water systems, electricity, and midstream and upstream oil &amp; gas. Once you have invested in the first fund, we raise the second fund in order to keep investing in the pipeline of opportunities that exist. Our infrastructure and energy fund can invest in both greenfield and brownfield projects. For example, we won the bidding process for the first Toll Road project of this administration. At the same time, we invested in the water system of Cancún which has been operated by the private sector for more than 20 years and it's a mature brownfield project.</p><h4>What are the defining criteria for choosing the projects in which you will invest?</h4><p>We invest in projects that have sufficient certainty in the incoming cash flows, such as an airport with assured long-term use. And by first considering a conservative scenario, we better understand the upsides and risks involved. The next step is to understand who our partners are, whether they are the right partners and whether they bring to the table what we really need for the project to be successful. The next stage involves aligning interests and ensuring proper corporate governance compliance. If we are to invest in a minority position then we need to have minority rights sufficient to protect our investors. The last consideration is a clear exit strategy, as our role is a temporary one.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Pacific ports for the transportation sector in Mexico?</h4><p>The most important port in the Pacific today is Manzanillo. A new terminal was established to the north of Manzanillo. Future growth will take place in the Laguna de Cuyutlan next to the LNG regasification plant. In addition, we expect that the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas will grow in the numbers of terminals it has.</p><h4>Why is Mexico a solid destination for investment?</h4><p>Mexico is a strong choice for investment because it has learned a lesson, namely the need to do things correctly. Mexico is today a country that implements conservative monetary and fiscal policies. We have worked on strengthening our institutions for the past 20 years. We have a judicial system that is independent. We have built on and worked on transparency. However, challenges remain. We still need to educate our children better, for example, and recently we have established a legal foundation to be able to implement educational reform. We are a country that has trade agreements with the most important nations in the world. And while we enjoy our proximity to the US, we also have a strong relationship with Asia and Europe. In terms of our competitiveness, what has happened with the automobile sector reflects our sheer potential. Today, Mexico is one of the most important producers of vehicles, confirming our ability to produce well and competitively.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The latest National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC) figures show that Mexico released 748 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2010, which represents 1.4% of the world's emissions. What specific programs is SEMARNAT implementing to reverse this trend?<br></h4><p>On April 28, 2014 the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) launched the Special Climate Change Program 2014-2018 (PECC). The PECC is one of the policy planning instruments derived from the General Climate Change Law (LGCC), and is aligned to the National Development Plan (PND), cross-sectional programs from the federal government, and the sectorial programs from 14 federal ministries that participate in the Inter-Ministerial Commission on Climate Change. The PECC lays out a diagnosis of the present situation of Mexico regarding climate change. It comprises five objectives, 26 strategies, and 199 lines of action, of which 77 focus on adaptation, 81 on mitigation, and 41 on the construction of public policies for tackling climate change. It also includes an annex with 31 complementary climate change-related activities and 10 performance indicators to monitor the results of the program during the 2014-2018 period using a 2013 baseline, a 2018 goal, and a calculation methodology. The PECC aims to reduce the vulnerability of the population, ecosystems, and productive sectors to climate change, as well as increase resilience in strategic infrastructure. This program presents the federal government's contribution to the greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reduction indicative goal prescribed by the LGCC for the 2014-2018 period, specifically 30% GHG emission reductions with respect to the business-as-usual scenario by 2020.</p><h4>What is going to be the impact of the pilot program for using natural gas in transport that SEMARNAT recently launched?</h4><p>The pilot program is considered a part of the National Development Plan 2013-2018, and aims to strengthen national climate change policy and environmental care for the transition to a competitive, sustainable, and low-carbon economy as well as to reduce risks to health and mitigate the emission of compounds and GHGs. As a starting point, a pilot program has been established in the city of Monterrey, which will equip the latter with the largest natural gas infrastructure for vehicular use in the country, both in number of compressor stations and transport units that use natural gas vehicles. The pilot project aims to be implemented in the metropolitan area of Monterrey, and pursues the goal of 8,000 vehicles using natural gas in the medium term, of which approximately 18% will be taxis, 38% heavy vehicles (including passenger and heavy duty trucks or light duty trucks), and 44% light vehicles. The environmental benefits of using natural gas, relative to gasoline and diesel, for example, are there. Decreases were recorded in the range of 25% for CO2 emissions compared to gasoline and 35% compared to diesel. For mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide, emissions are estimated at being 35% and 95% lower, respectively. In the case of sulfur dioxide, the reduction would be 100% using natural gas. Other benefits include not contaminating soil or groundwater, while combustion is practically odorless, and the noise level is much lower than  for conventional motors.</p><h4>You recently defined the energy reform as an environmental reform. What will be the contribution of the new regulation in attracting investment for renewable energy?</h4><p>The energy reform established obligations of clean compounds and reductions in GHGs and energy for participants in the electricity industry. The renewable resources are sufficient to double the installed capacity so far and to meet the goal by 2024 to generate electricity with 35% renewable energy capacity. The transition to renewables in terms of economic costs is not higher compared to conventional sources, especially when considering their co-benefits, including not depleting a non-renewable natural resource like natural gas, which can be made available for better uses in petrochemicals. The old fuel-oil plants will be gradually updated, operating with cleaner fuels such as natural gas, which is less harmful to the health of the communities living in the vicinity of old thermal power plants. In the long term, it will mean huge savings by avoiding energy losses in transmission and distribution, and this will be the true reduction in electricity rates for much of the population. It will also be positive for GDP, the generation of jobs and tax revenues, if 60,000 GWh of renewable technologies were to be developed by 2024. About 150,000 jobs would be created, similar to the current workforce of the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), considering retiring employees and assets, and the tax revenues would total $23 billion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of IEnova's pipeline project in Sonora?<br></h4><p>In 2012, the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) launched a call for tenders to build four pipeline segments that comprise the North — Northeast pipeline system. The entire system will supply natural gas to the states of Sonora, Chihuahua, and Sinaloa. We participated and won two of the four tenders (the Sásabe — Guaymas and Guaymas - El Oro segments). The construction of these two segments will represent a total investment of $1 billion. The importance of the entire system is twofold. First, the natural gas supplied will allow the CFE to convert its fuel oil based generation plants to natural gas based generation plants. Savings to the CFE from these conversions will be significant. And second, the fact that the entire region will now have access to natural gas at competitive costs, will increase the region's competitiveness and attract new industries looking to bring their operations to Mexico's Pacific coast.</p><h4>In March 2013 IEnova was listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange. What is the significance of this milestone for your company?</h4><p>As you correctly mention, our public debt and stock placements were a milestone for both the company and for Mexico's energy sector.  We brought to the Mexican market the first energy investment vehicle. The debt and stock offerings had three main purposes: to create a healthier capital structure in order to be in a better position to finance growth,  to build the capacity to finance our projects as a stand-alone entity, and thirdly to build a Mexican identity and become a company with Mexican investors. The operation was successful and generated a great deal of interest. We placed around $600 million, and the demand was around 12 or 13 times what was offered for subscription. That showed the market interest in the company, as well as in Mexico's energy sector.</p><h4>How do you feel about the energy reforms, and how do you think they will impact your operations?</h4><p>We are encouraged by the energy reform recently enacted by Congress and signed into law by the President.  The final version of the bill came out better than anyone had expected. We believe that this bill will provide the Mexican government with the tools it needs to create a stronger and more profitable PEMEX and CFE, and a more competitive and dynamic energy sector. The provisions in the bill will definitely have a positive impact in our operations. Conditions in Mexico are no longer business as usual, but rather, business in a more competitive and healthy environment. Even though it is still too early to tell how the new dynamics will play out, we are confident that this reform will create a solid foundation for the long-term economic growth of Mexico.</p><h4>You employ around 300 to 400 people in Mexico. What can you tell us about your efforts to train and qualify the local workforce?</h4><p>This is a very important question. Appropriately prepared and sufficient people are needed to implement the reform and undertake the projects that derive from it. I think that one of the main assets of this company is the quality of the people that work here, and many of them have grown with the company. Most of our employees are Mexicans, and we have continued training our workforce. However, what really qualifies us is having many experts in each field. We operate large infrastructure projects that are built over time and need to be very efficient, and we will continue to do the same in the future.</p><h4>Once the reforms pass, do you have your eye on new projects?</h4><p>We believe that this reform will provide significant new opportunities for IEnova in liquids transportation and storage, natural gas gathering and processing, and in power generation, transmission, and distribution.  We look forward to seeing the details that will be included in the secondary legislation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the contract that Shell has with the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) for your operations in the country?<br></h4><p>The contract supplies LNG into Mexico through the CFE. This contract became operational in 2006 and is part of a joint venture with Total in which Shell holds a 75% stake, with the remaining 25% belonging to Total. Shell's aim is to expand the use of LNG in both industry and transport. Indeed, this is an area where Shell has made significant headway in the US and Canada, and I believe that as this evolves and develops in these aforementioned countries, it will also develop and expand in Mexico. There has now been an historic energy reform law put into place. However, there is still a long road ahead with definitions to be made of secondary laws, how they will be implemented, and what the country's growth model will be. This new law could potentially open up different areas of the Mexican oil and gas industry for companies to participate in and develop the energy sector. It is still early days, but we are hopeful that companies like Shell will help contribute to the growth and development of Mexico's energy sector.</p><h4>How far will these new energy reforms impact your operations in Mexico?</h4><p>I think we have to remain observant. What Mexico has achieved with these reforms is something that has not occurred in the past 75 years; however, we need to understand what the government has in mind for companies in terms of participation, and only then will the major brands and contracts follow. Then will we see the real impact of the energy reforms. Still, we are as committed as we have always been to contributing to the development of the energy sector in Mexico with our expertise, knowledge, and technology. We see ourselves as partnering with Mexico in this phase, just as we have been doing for the past 60 years.</p><h4>How can Mexico take advantage of its resources and make the most of its strategic position as a supplier for the US market?</h4><p>That is something we are already addressing in Mexico. We like to work with local suppliers and international companies that are based in Mexico to provide goods and services for our operations in the US and Canada, as well as all around the world. There is a very well-trained workforce here, one that is competitive and well integrated into the international arena, and Mexico is already known as an important supplier.</p><h4>You are operating a refinery in the US with PEMEX. How is that operation performing?</h4><p>It is a successful joint venture, which in 2013 celebrated its 20th anniversary. I congratulate those who foresaw the need for this operation 20 years ago and created the right framework in which such a project could succeed. We are looking at how we can make it last another 20 years and beyond. It is a partnership that has worked well for both PEMEX and Shell.</p><h4>What future investment plans do you have in Mexico?</h4><p>We expect the energy sector to implement this opening, but are waiting to see the details of the entire energy reform law, along with its implementation, to ascertain how far companies like ours can compete in Mexico not only upstream, but also throughout the full value chain. We will need to wait until later in 2014 when the secondary laws are in place, and in the meantime we will be closely monitoring the process.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you describe your new facility in Santa Catarina, Nuevo Leon?<br></h4><p>The facility is a wind farm, a result of a joint effort made by Comexhidro Viento, Next Energy de México, and Conduit Capital, which, by using GE's latest technology, will benefit several municipalities surrounding Nuevo Leon. It will allow the districts to reduce the cost of electricity, while reducing pollution levels in the area. We have eight wind turbines of 2.75 MW, totaling 22 MW overall. The wind farm opened in June 2013, and the performance to date has been impressive. However, its main impact will be seen in the reduction of the rates and tariffs that municipalities pay for public electricity.</p><h4>Was it a challenge to develop talented local players for your Queretaro engineering center?</h4><p>We are proud of this center, where most of the engineers are working on turbines used in aviation and energy generation. They produce very high-quality work, and some extremely advanced aircraft components are being designed there, enabling us now to look into avionics. We are also looking to support the development of local engineering solutions for the oil and gas industry. Our cadre of around 1,700 engineers is expanding, possibly to over 2,200 people. Developing talent is key to the center's operations, and we have been fortunate in attracting local talent. We have teamed up with institutions to ensure we continue to do so. We enjoy a fruitful relationship with all the major technical universities in support of future talent and create further scholarships and programs for individual development. In fact, the first master class of aeronautical engineers graduated in 2012. Certain other companies undertake similar efforts in Queretaro, where the transformation observed has been amazing. This has already had an effect on the automotive industry, the supply chain for appliances, and the aerospace industry, and, as you know, there is a full cluster of aeronautical companies.</p><h4>What are the reasons behind your impressive growth?</h4><p>A major factor is innovation and our continued investment in R&amp;D, which has been central to all GE operations. Therefore, even in tougher times, we have an unflagging commitment to continued investment in all areas of our business. We continue to evolve our projects in the process making them more energy efficient. GE positions its portfolio of businesses by responding to global demands for infrastructure. We consistently invest in talent, regardless of the economic climate. And where necessary we export some of this talent, and there are certain leadership programs where you can observe the practice.</p><h4>What percentage of your income do you allocate to innovation and what is your attitude towards energy-efficiency programs?</h4><p>We allocate a huge 6% of our revenues to innovation, and spend over $1 billion on leadership programs in pursuit of excellence. Moreover, every product we produce aims for greater energy efficiency. For example, the new aircraft engines that we are looking at are 20%-30% more fuel efficient than previous models. We also focus heavily on the efficient use of data storage, and bear in mind that in the aeronautics industry an increase in fuel efficiency of just 1% could yield more than $30 billion in savings. Right now we are launching a new wind turbine of 2.2 MW, instead of the 1.7 MW design traditionally used, which proves that you can get more from the same coverage.</p><h4>What is the contribution of Mexico to your turnover for 2013?</h4><p>We measure ourselves more on orders and revenue than on net income figures by country. Latin America is a growth region for GE, and we hope to build on this. In Mexico we should achieve double-digit growth for 2013, and I expect 2014 to be the same. The target for growth regions is usually two to three times that of the overall economy, and we certainly expect this from Mexico going forward. Depending on how national reforms shape up, we view this positively, and if we are able to generate a further 1.5% GDP growth from those reforms, we should see it in our own numbers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>NR Finance México is the leading company in the financial segment of the automotive sector in Mexico with a 26.4% market share. What is the secret behind your success?<br></h4><p>NR Finance México's success came with the growth of Nissan in Mexico; we are the captive company for Nissan, Renault, and Infinity. We have been growing together with the OEMs during a period in which many new opportunities emerged within the automotive sector. In the finance segment of the Mexican automotive industry, three main types of player can be identified: banks, consortiums, and captive companies. After the financial crisis, we saw many banks exit the sector, creating opportunities for companies such as ours. We focused on the dealer network to increase both volume and penetration. All in all, that strategy led us to a hugely successful period, whereby we increased our customer base in Mexico. In this regard, over the past few years we have also created loyalty programs to reward our long-term clients and create a sense of uniqueness.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your partnership with Nacional Financiera (Nafinsa)?</h4><p>A large proportion of our clients are SMEs, a segment of the market in which we work closely with Nafinsa, the governmental bank of Mexico. It provides us with very valuable support to have a stronger position in this particular segment. For example, we offer a special loan for SMEs to help them purchase a fleet of vehicles to carry out their business activity. Thanks to Nafinsa's support, we are able to offer reduced interest rates on our loans as well as smaller initial down-payments, as well as other types of facility. In fact, we have gained more than 55,000 such SME contracts since working with Nafinsa, a partnership that has lasted over two years.</p><h4>What is your growth strategy for 2014?</h4><p>We have signed more than 324,600 active contracts over the past 10 years. As a very large captive company for Nissan, Renault, and Infinity, we want to further increase our presence in the market, as we have products that appeal to all types of people. In this context, we have a special interest to become a stronger player in the fleet segment of the market. Additionally, we believe that there are some interesting opportunities in the subprime segment of the sector, one in which very few financial companies currently operate. Finally, we will also continue working in the further specialization of the company in certain regions of the country.</p><h4>Mexico has the potential to produce 4 million cars per year. What are your views on that, and what are your future goals in this scenario?</h4><p>We are very much linked to the development of the automotive sector and our strategy should focus on how we would like to support vehicle sales in Mexico. Our loans are focused on creating an additional customer base for the market and supporting the sale of vehicles. We expect to see an increased volume of both production and sales in Mexico over the next few years. Currently, our penetration with Nissan is 46% and 57% with Renault. Nowadays, one in every four vehicles sold in Mexico is a Nissan, and in the financial segment of the sector, one in every four Nissan vehicles sold in Mexico is purchased through our company. Regarding Infinity, we currently account for 68% of the brand's total sales in Mexico, of which 80% are made through leasing, a segment we also want to expand in the near future. I believe the used-car segment is set to bring us very interesting growth opportunities. All in all, I think we have the capability to increase our market share to 28%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the Mexican market for Airbus Group?</h4><p>Mexico is a particularly important and interesting market. Over the past 10 years, we have sold 186 aircraft in this market to three airlines: Interjet, Volaris, and VivaAerobus. Our forecast for Mexico is also impressive. According to the global market forecast published annually by Airbus, over the next 20 years Mexico will require 634 aircraft of more than 100-seat capacity. That is a huge market for us, and also in terms of homeland security, civil defense, and defense. On top of that, what is interesting about Mexico is that it has a growing industry; its aerospace sector has grown at an average of 15% per annum over the past decade, and 20% over the past five years.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming years?</h4><p>If we look at our presence here directly, we generate about 380 direct jobs and about 5,000 indirect jobs with suppliers. The employment potential of the aeronautics industry is particularly compelling, especially for qualified technicians. The target is to develop this over the next few years, and we aim to be employing around 10,000 people indirectly by 2020.</p><h4>How does this plant contribute to regional development?</h4><p>When we invest in a country, many of our suppliers are keen to invest as well; in that sense, we are in a position to boost the sector broadly. This is crucial for the future of aerospace in Mexico. In fact, we work in an industry of very few major players. For aircraft of over 100-seat capacity there are only two. If we look at the financial figures of 2013, the total backlog of our group was ‚¬686.7 billion on December 31, 2013. This means that our Group, in terms of backlog, represents more or less half of Mexican GDP. For a country like Mexico, having a strong relationship with a Group like ours is therefore key to the future development of its aeronautic industry. We contribute investment and push our supply chain to be part of Mexico, and also invite others to participate here. We enjoy a very good relationship with ProMéxico. We are working closely with the Mexican authorities to promote the Mexico of today, and the opportunities to invest here for tomorrow.</p><h4>How do you feel about the energy reform?</h4><p>I would say that our Group was highly impressed by the efforts of the current administration and the congress in 2013. Being able to achieve labor, telecoms, education, fiscal, financial, and energy reforms in just one year requires a highly mature political environment. We see the energy reforms as the best tool to increase national competitiveness by reducing domestic energy prices. I believe that the real challenge for Mexico is to not be competitive against China or India, but to remain competitive with the US. In my opinion, the energy reforms will contribute to this. Due to the low cost of energy in the US, it is booming again. It is a manufacturing economy, and Mexico has to be part of that and remain a key player for the US. This will be the direct impact of the energy reforms. Without doubt, if the energy reforms can increase GDP by 2% per annum, it would enhance economic performance notably. We are enthusiastic about what is happening in Mexico, and I am personally convinced that this is Mexico's moment.</p><h4>How will Mexico's trade relationship with the US develop?</h4><p>The two economies are connected to such an extent that this will surely follow, and Mexico is also extending bridges with other continents, such as Europe. Our company is proof that links with Europe are growing. Don't forget that the Airbus Group is really a European company with French, German, and Spanish participations, as well as UK interests. The success of Airbus in Mexico confirms the many bonds between Mexico and Europe.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Nissan become the largest automotive exporter and investor in Mexico's automotive sector?<br></h4><p>Mexico was the first country where Nissan established manufacturing operations and facilities outside of Japan in 1966. Today, Nissan Mexicana is the operating global benchmark for the corporation when we look at some of the key metrics:  sales volume, market share, manufacturing, financial arm (Credi Nissan) and investment, among others. Nissan became the sales leader in the market, for 61 consecutive months, as of June 2014, when we established a 26% share. We firmly believe that Nissan has maintained its leadership in the Mexican automotive industry due to various key elements: the first being our talented team, as well as a winning mindset, and our product portfolio that reflects our passion for innovation, quality, durability, and reliability. We also have top satisfaction indexes in both sales and customer services. Meanwhile, our network of dealers has more than 230 modern and efficient facilities in optimal locations, with solid geographical coverage. We also have a strong financial arm through Credi Nissan, the leading financial institution in the country. We also constitute the leading manufacturing operation in the country with our three plants. Nissan has been established as the top investor in the country of the decade through two particular projects: the investment of a second plant in Aguascalientes, at which we started production for the new Sentra last November, incorporating a first phase of a $2 billion investment. Most recently, as of June 27, we ratified, in partnership with Daimler, an additional investment for another plant in Aguascalientes, incorporating a $1.4 billion investment, for the production of Infiniti and Mercedes-Benz vehicles.</p><h4>What will the third production plant in the country, located in Aguascalientes bring for Nissan Mexico in terms of job creation and production?</h4><p>In November 2013, Nissan inaugurated its third plant in Mexico, involving the first phase of a $2 billion manufacturing complex in Aguascalientes. Nissan Aguascalientes' 2nd plant resulted in 3,000 direct jobs, with an annual capacity of 175,000 units; taking Nissan's total Mexican manufacturing capacity to 850,000 vehicles. The Sentra produced at the new plant is mostly being exported to the US and Brazil, as well as satisfying the local demand for this vehicle, which is among the top-10 selling vehicles in the country. Most recently, the Renault-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn and Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche announced that both companies had agreed to establish a 50:50 joint venture, the business entity that will oversee construction and operation of the new plant in Aguascalientes, the third one in the state and fourth in the country. The new plant will be built in the immediate vicinity of the existing Nissan facility and will have an annual capacity of 300,000 vehicles when fully ramped up. The start of production is planned for 2017 with Infiniti models. The production of Mercedes-Benz brand vehicles will follow in 2018. Daimler and Nissan will share the total investment cost for Aguascalientes of approximately $1.4 billion. The companies will add almost 5,700 jobs (including engineering, line workers, and support staff) by the time the plant reaches full capacity, expected in 2021. In addition, a high localization rate will significantly increase the Mexican supply base, while also incorporating more than 10,000 indirect jobs. These two investments confirm, in this decade alone, a total figure of over $3.4 billion, while also generating almost 9,000 direct jobs, along with more than 20,000 indirect jobs.</p><h4>The automotive industry employs 500,000 people in Mexico and represents approximately 4% of GDP. What will 2014 bring for Nissan Mexico?</h4><p>In 2013, Nissan established a new sales milestone in the country with over 267,000 units sold. In 2014 we are looking forward to surpassing this figure, even with an industry that contracted in the first semester. Along with that our manufacturing strategy is considering a new milestone of 800,000 units for this year. The base to continue with this growth is well established in the top talent we have in our team of more than 14,500 employees, our leadership mentality, a solid financial arm, customer satisfaction and preference for our vehicles, along with the introduction of products with cutting-edge innovation in our line-up such as the Nissan LEAF and Nissan Xtrail. To that can be added stronger sales of products of higher growth potential like the Nissan Versa (the second best selling vehicle in the country), Sentra and Altima (integrating new technologies and connectivity), Pathfinder (the new favorite crossover of the Mexican public), and the Nissan NOTE, among others. Through the recent investment announcement in partnership with Daimler, we look forward to the day when Nissan will produce over 1 million vehicles in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company performed in the Mexican market?<br></h4><p>Mazda launched commercial operations in Mexico in 2005, when we started selling cars through four distributors, two in Mexico DF, one in Guadalajara, and another in Monterrey. In our first year of operations we sold over 7,000 vehicles, and in 2013 we sold 33,000 vehicles, confirming sustainable growth. In this context, our market share has grown too, and we closed 2013 on 3.1% of the domestic market.</p><h4>What are the company's expectations for the new production plant in Salamanca?</h4><p>The production plant is a project that dates back to 2010, when a commercial visit by our Japanese directors culminated a year later with the beginning of construction work on an investment budget of $770 million. After two years of construction, the plant started manufacturing cars in January of 2014. The first manufactured vehicles were destined for the US and Canada. However, the plant was officially inaugurated in February 2014, with President Peña Nieto attending the ceremony. In terms of expectations, we hope to close 2014 production on 140,000 vehicles, with the Mazda3 at the beginning of the year and toward the end of the year the Mazda2 model, as well. We expect the plant to produce around 230,000 vehicles per year when fully operational. At that point, it will have 4,600 direct employees—today, we have a staff of 3,800. These plans are envisaged to take place within the next 18 months. Salamanca is a rather small city, and we believe that the plant will bring a significant boost that will eventually change the face of the city, boosting employment among local people and serving as the key economic engine. Finally, there are other projects related to the plant, such as assembling and machining production, which will boost the national component of our cars, generate greater added value for the final product, increase investment, and create further employment.</p><h4>What competitive advantages led Mazda to establish a production base in Mexico?</h4><p>One of the main advantages is the free trade agreements (FTAs) that the country has signed with large and attractive markets; Mexico has access to 45 countries, including the US, Canada, Japan, and the EU, which means a potential market of around 40 million vehicles. At the same time, Mexico has a highly favorable geographical location for access to large markets such as the US. Mexico also enjoys an excellent logistics infrastructure, and labor costs are highly competitive. Meanwhile, the workforce is particularly qualified and skilled. Finally, the automotive industry in Mexico is among the most competitive in Latin America. To top it off, Mexico's domestic market is large and growing, and over the past few years has become highly stable. All in all, I believe Mexico has become the main destination for automotive investment in the region.</p><h4>How does Mazda contribute to the development of Mexico?</h4><p>We have close ties with the local government of Guanajuato and the city's university, with which we have developed several projects. In addition, we send some of our staff to Japan for training. For example, in 2013 we sent 160 technicians and engineers to Hiroshima; they were there for several periods during the year. Such initiatives boost technology and knowledge transfers to Mexico. Moreover, our new production plant incorporates state-of-the-art technology. We also implement projects to protect the environment; for example, we transplanted all the trees from the area where the production plant stands today.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Mazda in Mexico?</h4><p>We ride the growing trend in both the commercialization and manufacturing segments. For example, by the end of 2014, we will have expanded our distribution network to 53 centers. We also expect to end the year with sales figures of around 38,500 units. Thanks to the new production plant, we will be able to reach more cities in Mexico and better meet the demand of the domestic market. All in all, we follow the growth of Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Following your visit to Mexico in October, you stated the importance of deepening Ireland's business ties with Mexico. What aspects of bilateral relations will both nations focus on?</h4><p>Ireland and Mexico enjoy strong links of history, culture, business, and education. My visit to Mexico focused strongly on the potential to enhance the already excellent links between our countries. Ireland and Mexico share common values and interests in areas of global concern, including combating climate change, promoting disarmament and non-proliferation, encouraging sustainable development, addressing global hunger and under nutrition, and advancing gender equality. President Peña Nieto and I agreed that Mexico and Ireland would work more closely together to advance these key priorities at the UN, OECD, and other global fora. We see enormous potential in the economic relationship between us. Mexico is Ireland's 17th largest global trade partner, and we have seen significant investment by Irish companies in Mexico in a wide variety of sectors. We are pleased that Ireland has a presence in the important and vibrant market of Mexico, but we can do more. During my visit, President Peña Nieto and I agreed that there are significant additional opportunities for trade and investment between Mexico and Ireland. We want to support Irish companies in developing further their partnerships in Mexico and to encourage more companies to explore the Mexican market. Ireland has become a world leader in financial and ICT services, in agribusiness, and in biotech and life sciences. There are enormous opportunities for Mexican and Irish companies to collaborate more in each of these sectors. We also see great potential in deeper cooperation in the educational and academic sphere.</p><h4>Mexico is Ireland's largest market in Latin America with commercial ties reaching $1.24 billion in 2012. What areas of bilateral trade have the greatest potential for growth?</h4><p>Both Ireland and Mexico have young populations. During my visit to Mexico, I spoke of how our young people are beginning their working lives in an economy that is very different than five years ago, let alone 10. The lives of our young people have been shaped by technology in a way unimaginable to previous generations. Sometimes it seems that technology changes so fast that we have barely time to assess the implications of one development before it has been overtaken by another. But this rate of change, while daunting, should be embraced as a vista of opportunity. During my visit to Mexico, our governments signed a joint declaration highlighting the strong economic cooperation between Ireland and Mexico in areas such as agribusiness, the airline and aircraft leasing sector, pharmaceuticals, and ICT. These are examples of areas in which we already have a strong commercial presence in Mexico but there are many more that can be developed over time, including software, digital and online learning, engineering, and project management services, not to mention the food and drink sector and renewable energy—there are so many possibilities. I would also hope to see further cooperation in the science and technology area.</p><h4>What are Mexico's advantages as a destination for the Irish investment?</h4><p>During my visit to Mexico, I had the honor of being the first serving European Head of State or Government to address the prestigious Cumbre de Negocios in Guadalajara. My key message to the audience there was that Mexico is a valued partner for Ireland, and that Ireland should also be a valued partner of choice for Mexican business. Mexico has significant advantages as a destination for investment by Irish business. It is the 14th largest economy in the world with a population of 112 million, with a young and dynamic workforce, and over 44 free trade agreements (FTAs) with partners across the world, including the EU. Some of Ireland's most innovative and successful companies have already invested in Mexico in the agribusiness, paper and packaging, airline, engineering, and pharmaceuticals sectors. Dynamic Irish companies including the Kerry Group, SmurfitKappa, Irelandia, Kentech, Bimeda, H&amp;K, and Randox are contributing to the Mexican economy and are creating high-quality jobs in Mexico.</p><h4>Regarding the new regulations, particularly the energy and the financial reform, what is your outlook for the future?</h4><p>During my visit to Mexico I wished President Peña Nieto well in the ambitious reform agenda he is undertaking, in areas including education, energy, finance, and telecommunications. It is vital that all public policy reform is aimed at improving the day-to-day lives of citizens, improving access to quality education, communications infrastructure, efficient financial services for families and small businesses, health and nutrition, and affordable and clean energy. President Peña Nieto has spoken often about the necessity of ensuring that the rights outlined in the Mexican constitution are reflected in the day-to-day reality of the lives of all Mexicans. I wish the government and people of Mexico well in achieving this vital goal and building a peaceful, prosperous, and just society.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Three years ago, the Rt. Hon. William Hague MP discussed the importance of re-launching British-Latin American ties on a modern footing during his Canning Lecture. What has been the progress in this area?</h4><p>In the three years since the Foreign Secretary gave the Canning Lecture we have seen a complete reinvigoration of our relationships in Latin America. Not only have we had twenty visits to the region from UK Ministers so far this year (and 70 since this government came to office in 2010), but we have also opened a series of new Embassies and Consulates. We are working closely with all our Latin American partners to improve relationships, and have seen a steady growth in trade and investment. UK exports to Mexico grew 26% in the first half of 2013 compared to last year for example, and goods and services exports to Brazil are up £1.3 billion in the first half of 2013. UK firms have also won over sixty contracts worth over £100 million for the World Cup and Olympics being held in Brazil.</p><h4>Mexico is Latin America's second largest economy. How do you evaluate its importance for the UK's overall relations with and strategy towards the region?</h4><p>The relationship between Mexico and the UK is in excellent shape, and we consider Mexico an attractive business market, full of opportunities. By 2050 analysts actually predict its economy will be the fifth largest in the world with predictable and stable growth.  I think it is also important that Ministers in both Governments have established genuine friendships and good working relationships from the President and Prime Minister down. Many international companies are already choosing Mexico as a base, which has created significant opportunities for smaller companies, particularly in the northern industrial zones. This, complemented by a well-educated workforce, has meant that Mexico is now moving up the value chain—away from the traditional maquiladoras (assembly plants) and textile industries into engineering, IT, research and development, and the creative industries. In recent years the maquiladoras have also focused on more sophisticated manufacturing operations, in line with the modernization of the Mexican economy.</p><p>The UK is Mexico's fifth largest investor, and total bilateral trade in goods and services has increased by 23.4% since 2009. And we know there are opportunities for UK firms in more areas, including automotive and aerospace, retail, education, the environment, and energy.</p><p>Over the past five years Mexico has attracted an enormous amount of foreign direct investment from countries impressed by a friendly investment climate, competitive labor costs, a fully convertible currency, low taxation and duty free access to the US and Canada.</p><h4>UK-Mexico trade is set to reach £4.2 billion by 2015. How are initiatives such as the founding of the UK-Mexico Chamber of Commerce and the UK Mexico Business Forum helping to expand these exchanges?</h4><p>Lord Green, UK Minister of State for Trade and Investment, has visited Mexico twice in the last fifteen months with a very important objective: to increase the number of British companies that export to Mexico.</p><p>One of the best ways to do this is to enhance the support that is available, especially to companies setting up overseas for the first time so that those that are new to the market can get advice from other companies already active there. So at the end of 2012, we launched an initiative to do exactly that in 20 priority countries, including Mexico.</p><p>The British Business Centre is a program that by 2017 will provide expanded business-led support to UK SMEs in Mexico. Run by the British Chamber of Commerce, it will provide a range of services to UK SMEs and other UK companies, with the support of UKTI. It will give a lifeline to those who are unsure of their new market, with crucial advice for surviving and thriving.</p><p>The UK Mexico Business Forum is a small, high-level body consisting of CEOs or chairmen from the UK and Mexico. More strategic than the British Business Centre, it has been set up to identify both opportunities and obstacles for British and Mexican businesses, consider ways of encouraging trade in both directions and recommend actions for improvement to both governments.</p><p>Together these initiatives offer expanded and improved services for British companies in Mexico, and this will help our target of doubling bilateral trade to £4.2 billion by 2015. We will continue to look to boost the UK's presence in Mexico by promoting the establishment and development of our companies in the Mexican economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since its foundation, how has Bancomext helped to promote Mexico's foreign trade network?<br></h4><p>Bancomext was established in 1937 to promote Mexican exports worldwide. Among development banks, Bancomext has a clear mission, which is to assist Mexico in strengthening its position in the global arena. We constantly work to develop exports, but also to finance imports, predominantly of machinery and equipment, as Mexico needs to increase its productivity through modernization. We are also helping to see a stronger internationalization of Mexican firms. And we need to see the Mexican content of our exports grow, which today is at a ratio of between 30% and 35%. Our goal as a development bank is to strengthen the growth of the country and boost employment. In 2013, our net growth in loans was around 34%. We basically grew at twice the average of other development banks. Bancomext is very much committed to the government's goal of providing additional financing at lower rates.</p><h4>How are the investment flows between Spain and Mexico developing, and how is Bancomext contributing to this?</h4><p>We have around 16 firms that are either Spanish firms investing in Mexico or Mexican firms investing abroad. Of those 16 firms, around six are related to tourism, another six are related to sustainable energy, and two are from the auto industry. In the tourism sector, Spanish firms have already been present in Mexico for many years. The economic situation has been difficult in Spain over the past five or six years. Not only in Spain, but also in Europe as a whole, the possibility for these Spanish companies to grow in the local or regional market is not ideal. Mexico needs further investment in tourism, energy, and the automotive sector, and meanwhile there are large Spanish companies with world-class management, cutting-edge technology, and capacity that are keen to explore new markets.</p><h4>How would you assess your work among SMEs, and how important are they for national growth?</h4><p>As is the case in most economies, SMEs are the biggest providers of employment, and play a significant role in GDP generation. At Bancomext we are trying to do two things. On the one hand, we need to continue supporting the major exporters, while on the other, we want to see a greater participation of SMEs in global supply chains. For example, the number of SMEs we support grew by 135% over 2013. Last year we increased our agreements and our programs with the private sector from five to 11 banks. What we do is provide them with financing and guarantees, where the latter can represent up to 70%-75% of a loan. What really happens is that these banks are then willing to take on a much higher level of risk. Overall, the SME sector has the most potential for productivity growth. We don't only want to increase the number of firms, we also want to establish a national content target. We really want to participate in an effort that goes well beyond Bancomext's traditional role. This is an initiative that we will be working on with the Ministry of Economy and with ProMéxico.</p><h4>How will financial sector reform affect the banking sector, and what are your expectations?</h4><p>The effects of the reforms will manifest themselves gradually but consistently. What will happen at the end of the day is that the volume of loans in the economy will grow. Today private sector loans account for 26% of GDP; the expectation is to arrive at something close to 50% within the next 10 years. If this occurs, it is estimated that GDP growth will rise by at least half a percentage point. If you add to that what is happening in the energy and telecommunications sectors, as well as in other areas, Mexico will be able to grow by at least 4% or 5% per annum. We are working toward an erosion of all obstacles to lending in Mexico. These are good years for development banks because the reforms entail more flexibility and autonomy. Significant reforms took place over 2013, but President Peña Nieto's administration and the political parties are wise enough to recognize that through participation they were helping to advance their own ideas on how to create a better Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the strategic priorities of the Special Science, Technology, and Innovation Program 2014-2018 (PECITI)?<br></h4><p>The PECITI has five objectives. The first of them is to gradually raise the monetary resources for R&amp;D until they reach 1% of GDP. There is empirical evidence that demonstrates that the countries that invest at least 1% of their GDP on R&amp;D have achieved better economic performance and social welfare. The second objective is to contribute to the investment on human capital. The third goal is to promote the development of the vocations and capabilities of local STI, to strengthen sustainable and inclusive regional development. The fourth purpose is to promote the generation and utilization of knowledge, connecting Higher Education Institutions and Public Research Centers with enterprises. Finally, the fifth objective is to strengthen the scientific and technological infrastructure of Mexico. The economic resources assigned for infrastructure have increased an average of 115% per year during the last two years.</p><h4>How has investment in science and technology evolved in Mexico over recent years? How do you expect this amount to evolve in the next decade?</h4><p>On the present administration, the support given to science and technology during the first two years has had an unprecedented increase, 28% more compared to the support given in 2012. Nowadays, the main investor of the “Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&amp;D (GERD)" is the government, with 66% of the total. I will expect that this public funding along with the implementation of consistent public policies, as well as direct and indirect incentives to the enterprises causes a leverage effect on sector activity. This will favor the interest and commitment of the entrepreneurs to invest in these subjects. The idea is that within 10 years, the actual investment at least triples and the value of the indicator GERD/GDP grows to 1.6% so the corporate sector becomes the main investor, reversing the actual tendency.</p><h4>What are your strategies to mobilize investments and funds towards the R&amp;D (research and development) in science and technology?</h4><p>The Science and Technology Law considers the creation of trust funds to promote scientific research and experimental development. The strategy to mobilize investments towards scientific research and experimental development is done mainly through the Sectoral Funds, Mixed Funds and the Institutional Fund of Regional Promotion to Scientific and Technological Development and Innovation (FORDECYT). The Sectoral Funds were created with the purpose of handling the requests of the different branches of the Federal Government and of the states. Nowadays, there are 22 active sectoral funds with an equal number of government branches, their characteristic is that for every peso (MXN) that the branch or state gives to the trust fund, Conacyt gives an equal amount. The Mixed Funds are an instrument that supports technological and scientific development in the states and municipalities, through a trust fund formed with monetary contributions from the state or municipality along with the Federal Government through the Conacyt. We also have the FORDECYT to promote the technological and scientific progress, to educate highly qualified human resources, to support the establishment of scientific and technological ecosystems and to increase the regional and state STI investment based on its economic vocations and local capabilities that are in favor of the development of the states. In order to improve the functioning of the fund, actions that lead to scientific and technological activities of high impact and high strategic value were implemented in various regions of the country.</p><h4>Conacyt supports students to continue their PhD and Masters studies and manages the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (SNI), how would you describe the interest of the Mexican population on the study of natural sciences?</h4><p>Engineering and the study of Natural Sciences are by tradition, two of the areas of science that attract more people in Mexico. In the past seven years, 45% of the members of the SNI conducted research in several disciplines such as Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, and Earth Sciences. In addition, the average growth of the SNI members specialized on Natural Sciences was 6.7% from 2007 up until now. This number shows the dynamics of research in this area.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In a time of important political reforms in Mexico, how does lobbying ensure that all actors of the various sectors benefit from them?</h4><p>It's not so much about benefiting from the reforms as it is being a part of those reforms and having a voice and the possibility to express your point of view. The final decision is always in the hands of the authorities and the legislature. As lobbyists we have to be very respectful of that. The most important aspect of the lobbying process is to provide the right information for those key actors. When a country is in transition, it may not be possible to have a say in some of the decisions. If you do, you have the possibility of helping to change or shift policy. That is why lobbying is so important, and such a good instrument, and if an industry understands this, it has a timely say with the correct information. Otherwise, is too late for the company to have that discussion, and is unable to make proper use of the tool.</p><h4>What are the parameters of lobbying in Mexico? When should foreign investors resort to a lobbying firm, and what can they expect?</h4><p>We recommend being proactive. Always lobby pro-actively, and lobby broadly over a long period of time. Reactive lobbying is insufficient, as you're always late to the table and unable to effectively deliver your message. It's best not to convey your message in a crisis situation. I always tell my clients that in-house lobbying in your firm is always as important as your lawyer, your accountant, or your marketing or finance chief. You have to have that assessment all the time when you're making a decision or an investment. If you don't understand the politics, laws, and fiscal scheme of the place you're investing in, then you're in trouble.</p><h4>What is PROCAB's role in promoting lobbying in Mexico?</h4><p>The National Association of Professional Lobbying (PROCAB) is an association with different committees in which we discuss the way we work and the way we should work, as well as our code of ethics, how to transmit our messages regarding lobbying in Mexico, how to be an efficient interlocutor, and how to propose good regulations that work.</p><div class="quote">“The National Association of Lobbying Professionals (PROCAB) is formed of 18 consulting firms and government relations areas representing private industry"</div><h4>Corruption remains an important challenge for Mexico, but at the same time there are increasing efforts aimed at formalizing activities like lobbying. In such a context, how is lobbying perceived and how do you think you can improve the public awareness and perceptions of lobbying?</h4><p>Perception is everything in this sector, and we have to do things correctly. My company was investigated for over a year to see if we had any ties to corruption. Only after that yearlong investigation were the government, politicians, and statesmen ready to work with me. In this line of work it takes just one mistake to end your business. It's a thin line often, but you have to determine where that line is and never cross it. Once you have the reputation of stability in that regard, nobody will ever propose anything irregular again; it will never come up again in conversation. I've been doing this for many years, and I've never been offered any illegal incentives to vote a certain way. The good thing about the Mexican Congress today is that there are so many parties that nobody can guarantee a successful vote. It makes Congress incorrigible in a way.</p><h4>You represent a large portfolio of clients from many different sectors. Which sectors do you think have the greatest need for lobbying?</h4><p>Insurance companies are always on the minds of policy makers, and so are always important clients. Being highly regulated they always have to keep abreast of legislative developments concerning their sector. The food industry is also on the minds of policy makers, not only due to the obesity issue, but also from a taxation perspective. The wine and liquor industry is another in need of lobbying worldwide. Overall, every industry and every sector is subject to rules and regulations that affect its constituent companies and players. Lobbying is an important resource for all these industries and sectors. Taking part in the making of national laws is rewarding. Through lobbying, we are looking out for an entire industry's interests, and having our efforts come to fruition for the benefit of the people we represent makes it all worthwhile.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What role can science and technology play in promoting the economic growth of Mexico?<br></h4><p>The support of scientific and technological activities, as well as of innovation, is essential in boosting economic development. President Peña Nieto realizes this and has shown his commitment to reaching a total expenditure in innovation, science, and technology of 1% of GDP. In 2012, expenditure in these areas reached 0.43% of GDP, whereas in 2013 it was already at 0.5%. It is important to create synergies between diverse economic players; government efforts should be supported by private initiatives and also by the academic sector. This cooperation should contribute to incorporating technological developments and scientific research for Mexico's productive matrix.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the study from Public Policy Laboratory Ethos, which suggests that Mexico needs a better distribution of public resources in order to achieve successful tax reform?</h4><p>The government should streamline spending and allocate it to those sectors of the economy that have a real impact in terms of productivity and competitiveness. This approach is fully in line with the vision of President Peña Nieto, in the sense of promoting the efficient use and allocation of factors of production in the economy, including government spending. According to our National Development Plan, today, 46% of our population lives in poverty. For this administration, this is an urgent call to action, not only with financial discipline, but also responsible and efficient public spending, with a clear sense of social justice. The tax reform aims to promote a progressive and simpler tax system that raises the financial capacity of the Mexican state to meet its obligations through more efficient infrastructure spending, social security, and the fight against poverty. In Mexico, tax revenues represent 13.7% of GDP, while the average in Latin America and the OECD is 18.4% and 26.3%, respectively. Our public spending accounts for 19.5% of GDP, while in Latin America the figure is 27.1% and at 46.5% in the OECD. This data shows us that low tax revenues have been one of the factors curbing our spending and, consequently, the possibility of redistributing income in this way to reduce social gaps. The tax reform is to compensate for these differences and generate greater benefits, especially for those who have less.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the impact of the recent economic reforms over the medium term?</h4><p>There are two key elements in assessing the benefits of the economic reforms implemented by this administration; the first is time, meaning how long it will take to see the constitutional reforms translated into laws and secondary regulations, and actually impacting the economy. The second element is the actual depth of the reform. Educational reform needs several years to show results fully reflected in the economic and the social productivity of the workforce. Instead, tax reform could offer more expeditious results in consolidating public finances. The labor, financial, and energy reforms have different thresholds and complexity levels. It is estimated that once the complete package of structural reforms is implemented, it will increase the potential growth of the Mexican economy from about 3.5% to 5.3% by 2018. The proper implementation of these reforms is a key element in increasing the attractiveness of Mexico as a destination for domestic and foreign investment, which will result in more formal and better-paid jobs, thereby accelerating national productivity and benefiting many Mexican families. In 2013, Mexico received a record amount of FDI at $38.3 billion, although it should be noted that a portion of this amount was due to the acquisition of Grupo Modelo by AB Inbev, which was a $13.2 billion operation. Even subtracting this transaction, the total net amount of FDI in 2013 was $25.1 billion, an increase of $7.5 billion on the $17.6 billion of 2012. This amount exceeds the average for the past five years ($20 billion). For 2014, we expect a minimum of $25 billion, and depending on the speed of implementation of structural reforms, we could be aiming for $30 billion.</p><div class="quote">“It is important to create synergies between diverse economic players; government efforts should be supported by private initiatives and also by the academic sector. This cooperation should contribute to incorporating technological developments and scientific research for Mexico's productive matrix."</div><h4>Could you comment on measures being implemented to curb Mexico's informal economy?</h4><p>According to the National Survey on Financial Inclusion, in 2012, 44% of the adult population (18-70 years), almost 31 million people, had purchased items through the formal financial system. This survey also revealed that approximately 43% of adults save via different mechanisms to those offered by financial institutions; they prefer saving in cash (64.8%), or participating in pools of collective savings known as “tandas" (31.7%). Also, the survey found that 33% of adults prefer informal financing through loans from the family (57.4%), or friends (40.3%). The financial reform is based on four pillars: promoting credit through the Development Bank; increased competition in the financial sector; extending credit from private financial institutions; and ensuring the development of the financial sector as a whole. The common goal of these four actions is to strengthen and increase financial inclusion among those often neglected or marginalized by commercial banks, to expand the range of financial products and services available, to reduce financial transaction costs and increase affordability of credit via competition, and to improve the quality of financial products and services by ensuring the soundness of banks.</p><h4>What are your predictions for Mexico's economy in 2014?</h4><p>In 2013, we experienced growth that was below the potential of our economy; however, the cyclical indicators that INEGI published recently confirmed that we are in the final stage of the slowdown and our economy is heading toward recovery. As a demonstration, the main economic indicators are beginning to show positive signs; industrial activity grew 3.4% in March 2014 and reported an annual growth of 6.8%. For the month of May, the IMSS reported an annual increase of 3.2% in employment. There has been an 80.5% (427,029 positions) growth of permanent-type jobs and 19.5% (103,289) in other types of jobs. In terms of retail, an important indicator of the state of our domestic market, April data for the National Association of Supermarkets and Department Stores (ANTAD), suggests that for stores with more than a year in operation, there was annual nominal growth of 2.4%, while total sales experienced annual nominal growth of 6.8%. By the second half of 2014, we expect to see a start in the recovery of the growth rate, which according to some organizations and economic analysts will be between 2.5% and 3% in 2014, and at least 4% by 2015.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your overall strategy to strengthen your services and increase the number of trade offices abroad?<br></h4><p>The strategy we follow at ProMéxico aligns with the goals set by the National Development Plan and the Innovative Development Program 2013-2018, and responds to the cross-cutting themes of the current government: democratization of productivity, gender equality, and the government's closeness to the people. Hence, ProMéxico contributes to the creation of an inclusive, prosperous, and globally responsible Mexico. Our role is to drive Mexico into the business arena as a leading global player.</p><p>One of ProMéxico's key tasks is to capture productive projects from abroad; projects that create jobs and encourage national development. In addition, we have designed and implemented different business models and services aimed at attracting investment both from foreign companies looking to venture into the country and from companies already established here seeking to invest in new projects. ProMéxico is recognized worldwide as a government entity dedicated to the promotion of international business, the Mexican agency that supports the effective realization of global economic projects. Through 45 overseas offices we have been able to position Mexico as an attractive investment destination. We have a portfolio of support programs and services that enable national and foreign investors to participate in business summits to promote Mexico or realize commercial delegations to countries with whom there is interest and opportunities, through travel grants, receive specialized information about Mexico or specific sectors, and connect with companies and government entities abroad. ProMéxico is an agency that generates meetings and encourages successful business between Mexican business owners and entrepreneurs from any country in the world.</p><h4>How would you assess the current level of FDI in Mexico? What countries are showing an increasing interest in Mexico?</h4><p>In 2013, FDI rose to $38.2857 billion—according to figures from the Ministry of Economy and the UNCTAD—which was a historic record that placed us among the major recipients of FDI. Furthermore, between January and March 2014, we have received around  $5.821 billion in FDI. This figure is 17% higher than the preliminary amount reported for the same period in the previous year of $4.988 billion. In these two years, investment from Germany, Japan and Netherlands has remained steady; last year, investment from Belgium was higher than from the United States, while this year investment from Spain has grown significantly. Some countries are strengthening their presence in the country, such as Luxembourg, have now begun to appear with representative percentages. In recent months we have received interest from China, India, Italy, Korea, Norway, Portugal Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, and United Kingdom, among others.</p><div class="quote">“There is no doubt we are experiencing Mexico's moment. The country has seized a key historic opportunity based on the recently adopted structural reforms."</div><h4>What are the main investment incentives to attract capital flows to the country?</h4><p>Some of the main competitive advantages that Mexico presents to foreign investors are: a young talented and skilled workforce, favorable business environment, competitive costs in North America, and modern, world-class infrastructure. We are a leading exporter of high technology and advanced manufacturing; thus, industries that require greater capacity and precision are beginning to locate in Mexico.</p><p>Mexico is one of the most competitive countries for productive investment in the world due to its macroeconomic and political stability, low inflation, size and strength of the domestic market, and economic growth rate.</p><h4>How would you describe the importance of the energy and telecommunication reforms as a tool to promote Mexico as an investment destination?</h4><p>It is important to highlight that the recent structural reforms implemented by President Enrique Peña Nieto's government, among which are the two you mention, respond primarily to an urgent need to modernize the legislation relative to a number of national sectors, so that they become more competitive, and as a result, more productive. This, in turn, will translate into greater prosperity for the Mexican society. The reforms were designed and will be implemented, beyond promoting Mexico as an investment destination, to modernize certain sectors in order to continue to respond to the country's growing needs.</p><h4>What are the main sectors of the economy that hold particular potential and opportunities for international investments?</h4><p>Although the first transformative reforms concern certain production sectors, all sectors are a priority for our current government. Some have a prominent history, as is the case with manufacturing in general, and others are just coming into their stride, such as the aerospace sector and the creative industries. The sectors that have recently drawn the greatest attention from foreign investors are agriculture, energy and environmental technologies, health, creative information and communication technologies, knowledge technologies, transport and heavy manufacturing, and infrastructure.</p><h4>What are the advantages of Mexico as a manufacturing country, but also as a center of innovation and creativity?</h4><p>Mexico is the foremost Latin American destination for establishing information technologies (IT) service companies. It excels in areas that include government support, costs, cultural affinity, and human resources. Furthermore, Mexico has firmly established its global position in this sector and currently occupies fourth place as a global IT provider.</p><p>Over the past decade, the average annual growth rate of engineering graduates in Mexico was 7%. According to National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) estimates, 111 thousand engineering and technology students graduated in 2012.</p><p>In addition, Mexican creativity is renowned the world over. Aware of its potential and the strategic role of the creative industries, Mexico is determined to position itself as one of the world's major players and become Latin America's hub of excellence for the production of audiovisual and interactive content. Mexico has world-class audiovisual production facilities, such as Baja Film Studios, which has the biggest water set in the world, and Estudios Churubusco, whose trajectory is renowned throughout the national and international film world.</p><p>Audiovisual production and development costs are very competitive; according to KPMG, Mexico is 37.7% and 38.9% more cost-competitive compared to the US for software development and digital entertainment, respectively.</p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of Mexico as a logistics hub?</h4><p>Mexico is a major, global, high value-added logistics center due to its network of free trade agreements; our country has a strategic geographic location, close to the world's major ports. We have the lowest average of port-to-port days and are connected to Asia, Europe, and South America thanks to our Atlantic and Pacific coastal ports. Our infrastructure and strategic location translate into better overall costs and greater competitiveness for companies. We have 117 sea ports, 64 international airports, more than 26,000 kilometers of railroad, and around 372,000 kilometers of road.</p><p>Mexico is a business partner for those companies whose aim is to serve the North American market. We are part of the biggest economic bloc in the world (NAFTA), which represents $18 trillion dollars. We have more than 50 overland border crossings with the United States and logistics corridors that allow us to connect rapidly with the western and eastern parts of the United States and Canada. Mexico is a great option for those companies planning to establish production centers beyond their own territory: in addition to its logistics infrastructure, Mexico has a highly trained workforce with advanced manufacturing expertise and one of the most competitive cost structures in the world.</p><p>Our country's platform of international treaties enables not only the attraction of investment for production, but makes it possible to export from Mexico to anywhere in the world.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2014?</h4><p>Mexico is on an excellent path. During the first half of the year, it received FDI inflows of $5.8 billion, a figure 17% higher than the preliminary amount reported for the same period in 2013. This is evidence of the growing confidence of investors in the economic future of our country.</p><p>The most important factor of the investments is not only their amount, but their impact on job creation and their repercussions on national economic development. In this context, it should be emphasized that the country receives investment mainly in advanced manufacturing sectors, which creates better-paid jobs and generates a greater capacity for knowledge transfer. ProMéxico undoubtedly encourages foreign direct investment with a high-technology and innovation content.</p><p>We know that Mexico has many strengths. We want to further promote them in the world's business community. An example of this is Mexico's leadership in medium- and high-technology production, as well as in the agrifood industry.</p><p>There is no doubt we are experiencing Mexico's moment. The country has seized a key historic opportunity based on the recently adopted structural reforms. These changes and political agreements will trigger unprecedented progress to boost the integrated development of the country in the short and medium term. These structural reforms will allow a more promising future in terms of attracting FDI. ProMéxico will continue to promote the export of products and services to contribute to the country's economic and social development and the strengthening of Mexico's image, and to push Mexico's recognition as one of the best business destinations in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you introduce Instituto para a Promoçío das Pequenas e Médias Empresas (IPEME) to our readers?</h4><p>IPEME was created in 2008 by the government with a mandate to undertake three core activities. The first is to develop, propose, and implement policies that support SMEs in Mozambique. The second is to provide services to support SMEs, and thirdly to implement and establish SME platforms, such as our business development centers and business incubators. Since 2008, we have created four business development centers: one in Maputo, one in Tete, one in Manica, and another in Cabo Delgado. We are receiving EU and United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) support for our business incubation pilot program, which will focus on the carpentry and woodworking sector. We are still also being supported by USAID on building and implementing the SME Complex in Machava. From 2010 to 2014 we provided around 11,800 services to SMEs. We are investigating improving our business assistance by acting as an intermediary and facilitating links between SMEs and the larger projects. For example, IPEME signed an MoU with Anadarko in 2014. The goal is to ensure that Mozambican SMEs can be linked with and benefit from the activities of Anadarko. Our role is to act as an intermediary and facilitate SME access to commercial finance as well manage the SME database. IPEME helps SMEs apply for credit loans, gain financial literacy, and negotiate with the banks. The Portuguese and Mozambique governments signed, in March 2014, a deal to reactivate the Fundo Empresarial de Cooperaçío Portugues (FECOP), which is focused on SMEs and business cooperatives and provides special financial services such as credit warranties and bona fide interest rates at a national level. IPEME is also a member of a steering committee that approves and supervises credit applications. The FECOP will be implemented by selected commercial banks, namely BIM, BCI, MozaBanco, and Banco íšnico.</p><h4>Aside from financing, what other challenges do Mozambican SMEs face?</h4><p>Access to information is limited, such as being able to identify business opportunities, or where to apply for the proper licensing. Many SMEs are not well structured in terms of quality standards and efficient business plans. We are addressing this by implementing a program called One District One Product (CADUP) sponsored by the Japanese government and its development agency, JICA, to the agribusiness sector. This program focuses on developing the products that have the highest potential demand at both the local and export level. We selected five provinces and 200 products from rural associations of producers, micro businesses, and small companies, and have started structuring output in line with international standards. Regarding exports, we are partnering with the Mozambique Institute for Export Promotion (IPEX) to identify the right markets into the SME Export program.</p><div class="quote">“SMEs are a rapidly emerging sector, and these companies are the primary employers in Mozambique."</div><h4>How would you characterize the evolution of the SME sector?</h4><p>A recent report found that SMEs in Mozambique comprise 98.7% of the market, but they only contribute 28% to GDP. The right financial solutions will empower these businesses to reverse that statistic. Most SMEs are in the informal sector. We are addressing this problem by working with the taxation authorities to implement a system that integrates these businesses into the formal economy, also supported by the German government, ensuring that bigger projects are a market opportunity for these SMEs. In 2010, the government approved a new procurement law that provides two modalities of contracts exclusively to SMEs, namely small dimension and limited tender bids. The law mandates that public institutional bids must account for SMEs.</p><h4>What incentives should be provided for SMEs to move into the formal market?</h4><p>Taxation is an important consideration. In light of this, the government is currently reviewing the second phase of its business development strategy, which is focused on taxation. Most SMEs remain informal in order to avoid taxation. This is in large part due to the structuring of the tax system in Mozambique, which fails to distinguish micro or small enterprises; all businesses are treated the same. The new taxation regime must take into account the classification of these companies,  as well as tax, registration, and licensing incentives or exemptions.</p><h4>What are your next strategies to expand and reach rural areas?</h4><p>The Dutch government is funding the establishment of business development centers, which will open in 2015. These centers will be located in Chiúta, Catandica, Caia, and Mocuba. Another regional branch will open in Tete province. IPEME is also partnering with the Ministry of State, running a program that will be operational in 2015. The program entails nine business development centers in Gaza province, Cabo Delgado, and Nampula. The centers will assist and coach with business planning, industry networking, training, and business incubation. The government hopes to empower and develop SMEs by rolling out more of these integrated services.</p><h4>In which sectors are SMEs developing the fastest here in Mozambique?</h4><p>In 2014 the government approved a development strategy that prioritized some specific areas: industry, agribusiness, and agriculture, as well as others. However, tourism is also important and of course logistics services, which tend to large projects further upstream. These areas are of strategic importance to us. These areas will help our country develop its export market, create new jobs, and expand our taxation base.</p><h4>How would you describe the degree of collaboration between foreign companies and the SME network in Mozambique?</h4><p>SMEs are a rapidly emerging sector, and these companies are the primary employers in Mozambique. This translates into more Mozambicans using entrepreneurships and innovation as a tool to deliver services to the market, as well as develop partnerships with foreign companies. Mozambique also still needs to push for diversification in the financial sector, which can be partly addressed through the entry of more SMEs. We have an opportunity to empower the financial capability of SMEs so that they can contribute a significantly larger percentage to GDP.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Jaidah Group is a family company that is more than 100 years old and which has deep roots in Qatari society. What are the core principles that have made this company such an ongoing success?</h4><p>Jaidah Group has been in business for over 100 years and it's a traditional family business in the GCC sense of family businesses, whereby we are active in a lot of fields, from automotive to heavy equipment, and from safety and tools to lubricants and electrical goods. The business has evolved through the years based on the core principles of family, as we are a family in a small community where it's not only the company's reputation, but also the family's reputation. We seek to be fully honest and transparent in order to maintain both the company and the family image. It's important for us to be a company that people trust and want to do business with. Being around for a long time, we greatly value the trust of our employees and our customers. Currently, we are very much in a period of natural evolution. Qatar has been a major center of international attention since winning the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, with a lot of international businesses wanting to set up shop here. Now we have companies from all over the world, from Asia, the US, Europe, and more. Everyone wants a piece of the pie. Therefore, in Qatar you no longer compete locally, but you compete on an international basis. This means that we also have to focus very much on service excellence and customer satisfaction. At the end of the day, Jaidah is mainly a B2B business, apart from the retail automotive side, so it's all about how we can increase our customers' productivity so as to help them perform better. Our major aim today is to become the main go-to company that provides products and services to our clients that enable them to be more productive.</p><h4>The company operates under three separate divisions. How did this structure come about?</h4><p>It is a case of how the business evolved, and you'll find a similar mix of sectors in other GCC family businesses. In our case it's automotive, industrial supplies, and electrical goods. At the heart of the Group is automotive and heavy equipment, which falls into industrial supplies. That is from where we set out from back in the day and we have gradually expanded, although not into any radically different fields. Safety equipment, tools, and lubricants are natural accompaniments to what we do, and outside of automotive we mainly focus on the construction business.</p><div class="quote">“We have a very exciting future ahead of us."</div><h4>What is the importance for Jaidah of having such a diversified portfolio?</h4><p>I think it's important to stress that we are only in businesses where we're able to be market leaders and provide customers with services or products that answer their news. That said, being diversified brings two benefits to the Group, both of which make us very durable and sustainable. Traditionally, it was important to have a diversified portfolio due to the size of the market. Qatar had a small population with a small market, no matter what field you were in. In that respect, it was very important for companies to have a diversification strategy. Today, diversification is important because of the business cycles that we see in the economy and the country. As you know, we just came out of a tough three-year period in which the economy did not perform well outside of oil and gas. The economy did not grow significantly and there was not a lot of business activity. But now it's very interesting to see a new cycle starting with the construction boom that Qatar is witnessing, and our heavy equipment division has been very active in the past few months as a result. Now we are also starting to see some renewed activity in the automotive sector. New projects have been awarded, which need equipment and employees. New employees are coming in, both white collar and blue collar, and they will need cars, then in a few years time they will need electrical components. So when you are diversified, if one sector is slow, you can be doing well in a different sector, and this keeps the cash flow going and the business running. It also minimizes risk in the long term, allowing us to hedge our risks by not being active in just one field.</p><h4>What is it that makes Jaidah the preferred partner for global companies to enter the Qatari market?</h4><p>It comes back to the fact that Jaidah has been around for such a long time and has built successful partnerships. It is a recognized and successful name, it has a good reputation, and a good network with good people who are professional, knowledgeable, and experienced. Whenever we sit with new customers, they are always reassured by the level of knowledge and experience we bring to the table. We know the sectors that we operate in, we know the market, and we have the professionalism to offer what our clients need. This is where our added advantage lies at the end of the day.</p><h4>How does Jaidah aim to contribute to the Qatar's National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030)?</h4><p>The QNV 2030 and the corporate vision of the Jaidah Group are very much in sync, as you might expect from a business that has grown alongside the rise of Qatar. The QNV 2030 has four pillars, with one that relates to economy. It calls for diversification and the introduction of the knowledge economy businesses. For us at Jaidah, that means Qatar wants to be more sophisticated and attract more knowledgeable people. Today, our major focus at Jaidah is on how to move from being just a dealer, an agent, or a middleman that imports a product and sells it in the market, to a company that offers additional value, providing integrated solutions and satisfying an ever more complex business environment. So we see the Group playing a supporting role and being a private sector leader. We will do this by focusing on our strengths, such as our great supply chain backbone. We need to take that and increase its productivity to help our divisions and also help our customers become more productive, getting our products out there faster and more efficiently, and evolving into something beyond being just a trader. That's our target, and it's a target fully in line with the QNV 2030.</p><h4>What is the future strategy of the Jaidah Group?</h4><p>We have a very exciting future ahead of us. We will keep evolving and expanding to meet the needs of both our customers and the country. On a day-to-day level that means continuing to improve the service we provide to our existing clients, and identifying new business activities that will be important to Qatar's economic growth. We will be launching an entirely new brand and service in the automotive sector this year. This goes hand in hand with the QNV 2030. We have another 16 years to go, and I'm optimistic about what we'll achieve during this period. There are major milestones ahead; we will have hosted the World Cup in 2022, and what I am sure of is that we will stay true to our vision and values.  It all starts with understanding what it is that our customers need and require to make their lives better and easier to achieve their targets.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your perception of the market in Abu Dhabi? Specifically, what sectors and industries do you see having the greatest potential for investment from the Swedish business community?</h4><p>Sweden is an open economy and welcomes business, interactions, and investment in both directions. The UAE is one of Sweden's largest trading partners in the Middle East. Exports during 2014 amounted to around $620 million, with steady YoY growth being seen. More than 200 Swedish companies are based in the UAE, and more than 4,000 Swedes reside there, an illustration of the interest shown in the UAE. We see a lot of growth potential in a range of sectors. In particular, I would mention life sciences and healthcare, clean-tech, sustainable solutions including in IT, ICT, research and higher education, corporate social responsibility, as well as many others. Many Swedish companies are at the forefront in these areas and can provide innovative and environmentally sustainable technology for these sectors. Taking into account life-cycle costs and the environmental aspects of an investment, their solutions are strongly competitive. We also want the UAE to discover the creative and artistic side of Sweden. Accordingly, Sweden participated in the European Film Festival both in Abu Dhabi and in Dubai in September 2014. Sweden was also guest of honor at the Abu Dhabi Book Fair in May 2014. Leading Swedish designers, together with their Danish counterparts, will highlight their creations in a back-to-back event with Dubai Fashion Week, “The Style Gallery." This event at the Dubai IFC will introduce designers and their fashion collections to Emirati partners, buyers, the media, and trendsetters. The fact that the Volvo Ocean Race will make a stopover in Abu Dhabi from December 2014 is another important platform to show all that Sweden can offer. We see a number of both large and small businesses from Sweden active in the UAE and benefiting from the business climate there. Having direct flights between Stockholm and Dubai has also had a positive impact.</p><h4>In light of the Abu Dhabi Businesswomen Council's successful participation in the Women's Forum held in Stockholm in May 2014, how would you characterize the role of Emirati women leaders, businesswomen, and women entrepreneurs in boosting investment cooperation?</h4><p>We are happy to encourage networks for bridge building. Ideas, business and trade evolve from people and people meeting people. The strong participation of Emirati women leaders at the conference in Stockholm should be seen in this light. Women stand for so much of innovation and creativity in our respective societies. The joint forum is an important interface between Sweden and the UAE, as I can personally testify after meeting participants at this Emirati-Swedish event.</p><div class="quote">“Despite instability in parts of the Middle East over the past few years, the UAE stands out as being stable."</div><h4>The UAE is known for its economic liberalization and business-friendly environment. How does the UAE contribute to facilitating Sweden's national and economic influence in the surrounding Gulf region?</h4><p>Despite instability in parts of the Middle East over the past few years, the UAE stands out as being stable and is developing in many areas. We see a steady growth in trade with the UAE and in our Swedish presence in the country. Many Swedish companies perceive it as a regional hub, from where they can operate more widely with excellent access to services, skills, and direct flights.</p><h4>How do you see the bilateral relations of Sweden and the UAE developing in the public sector in the near future?</h4><p>Although our relations are excellent, we see further potential for development. There is scope for cooperation in areas such as healthcare and life sciences, infrastructure, future energy solutions, connectivity, traffic, and transportation. We wish to open doors for closer cooperation in domains offering long-term sustainable solutions for our societies. Areas where both private actors and the public sector play important roles are, for example, healthcare, higher education, and research. These are also areas where we see substantial potential.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>In exercise of the powers vested in me by the Constitution of Mexico, I have enacted the Constitutional Energy Reform, approved by Congress and most state legislatures.</p><p>I acknowledge the Senators and Federal Representatives of the 62nd Legislature, together with the members of state legislatures, for saying yes to an historical Reform that is fundamental to the future of all Mexicans.</p><p>It is a reform that will allow the country to embark on a new stage of development.</p><p>I also congratulate you for having proven that Mexico can be transformed under the democratic system, and that profound changes can be achieved by institutional means.</p><div class="quote">“President Peña Nieto's ongoing attention to matters, domestic and foreign, has kept him on the road."</div><p>With responsibility and political civility, and thorough legislative work, you succeeded in creating an advanced legal framework that will convert our energy sector into a real source of economic growth.</p><p>This is one of the most significant reforms of the past five decades, and one that means Mexico is better placed to face the challenges of the twenty-first century.</p><p>It is a reform that maintains and secures national ownership of PEMEX, CFE, hydrocarbons and oil revenues, while opening up new opportunities for the country.</p><p>With this reform, PEMEX and CFE are strengthened and modernized.</p><p>They will be efficient, productive state companies with the capacity and flexibility they require to fulfill their mission for the benefit of Mexican society as a whole.</p><p>The workers of these two pillars of the national economy may be reassured that their labor rights have been safeguarded and will be fully respected.</p><p>For those working in the energy sector, the reform will lead to more and better options for career and professional development.</p><p>It is a transformative reform tha modernizes the constitutional framework to open up the energy sector to investment, technology and competition, leading to more energy for the country at a lower cost.</p><p>This reform will strengthen national sovereignty and increase Mexico's energy security.</p><p>With this decision we can exploit, for the benefit of all Mexicans, the abundant hydrocarbon deposits that so far have been inaccessible, or not profitable, for PEMEX, such as those in deep water deposits, or shale gas.</p><p>With the reform, the country will obtain more financial resources from the private sector, along with cutting-edge technologies, in order to exploit its vast energy resources without falling into debt.</p><p>Thanks to the reform, we will increase production of oil and gas, and achieve rates of replacement of proven reserves of over 100 percent.</p><p>But most importantly, the reform will allow Mexico to grow faster, creating development opportunities and employment for hundreds of thousands of Mexicans.</p><p>The Energy Reform will raise the productivity and competitiveness of the entire national economy. Businesses,especially small and medium enterprises, which are those that generate the most jobs, will enjoy more and cheaper energy; as a result they will be more profitable, and will be able to expand and hire more people.</p><p>The reform will thus provide a particular boost to local and national business. Mexican companies will be a crucial part of the energy sector's production and industrial chain.</p><p>The supply of skilled labor will grow and there will be more job opportunities for engineers and technicians trained in our country's universities.</p><p>Another aspect of the great significance of the Energy Reform is that it will support the economy of Mexican families by reducing the cost of electricity and gas. This means it will have a direct benefit for households across the nation.</p><p>How will this be achieved? With more investment.</p><p>It will be possible to extract more gas, making it cheaper for Mexicans. At the same time, this gas can be used to generate electricity at a lower cost, thereby lowering utility bills.</p><p>The reform will also lead to better food prices. With a greater supply of petrochemicals, more fertilizer can be produced in Mexico, reactivating farmers' fields and food production.</p><p>Another key point is that the reform will help us to produce cleaner energy and be more environmentally responsible.</p><p>In the same vein, it establishes mechanisms to facilitate the deployment of renewable energy and cogeneration.</p><p>Thus, the Energy Reform will help us to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases, in line with the objectives of the General Law on Climate Change.</p><p>The reform incorporates a long-term perspective in establishing the Mexican Petroleum Fund for stabilization and development. This purpose of this financial instrument is to receive, manage and distribute oil revenues, with both the present and the future of Mexico in mind.</p><p>Its priority will be to accumulate resources for future generations and to enable the country to cope with difficult situations.</p><p>At the same time, the fund will promote national development through the financing of projects in science, technology and innovation, infrastructure, scholarships, renewable energy, and a universal pension system.</p><p>This means that the wealth and heritage of Mexicans will be protected and nurtured.</p><p>The income derived from oil, which is a non-renewable resource, will be invested in new sources of wealth generation, namely education, science and technology, infrastructure and public savings.</p><p>In the energy sector there will be greater transparency and accountability. For example, any contract issued by the state for the exploration and extraction of oil and natural gas may be consulted by the public and be subject to audit.</p><p>The reform strengthens state regulatory bodies such as the National Hydrocarbons Commission and the Energy Regulatory Commission, providing them with a legal personality, technical and managerial autonomy, and their own budget.</p><p>In short, thanks to all these benefits the Energy Reform is a decisive step towards a better life for all Mexicans.</p><p>When I assumed office as President, I said that, at some point in their history, the most developed nations decided to take a big step forward.</p><p>This year, we Mexicans have decided to overcome myths and taboos to take a big step forward. Through its democratic institutions, Mexico has declared itself in favor of change and transformation.</p><p>With this reform we send a clear and decisive signal that in the twenty-first century Mexico is changing for the good of all Mexicans. This is already the view from abroad.</p><p>For example, yesterday a leading institution providing information on financial markets, Standard &amp; Poor's, raised the rating of Mexico's sovereign debt. One of their leading considerations was the watershed represented by our country's Energy Reform, which raises expectations of growth in Mexico over the medium term.</p><p>This analysis confirms the confidence there is in the prospects for the Mexican economy and the positive impact of these transformative reforms.</p><p>Thus begins a new story for our country. We have opened the doors to a better future for all.</p><p>The Energy Reform will benefit households, create jobs and strengthen national sovereignty.</p><p>It is time for the country's energy resources to be a real factor for growth, one that is felt and observed in the daily lives of our people.</p><p>I firmly believe that all the reforms approved by the country's legislators will mark a new chapter in the history of Mexico. A chapter of changes and transformations for the benefit of all Mexicans.</p><p>Extracted from a speech on Mexico's energy reform given in December, 2013.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<url><![CDATA[solid-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which of CEMEX's products and services have been driving company growth?</h4><p>The key purpose of the company is to produce cement, ready mix, and aggregates, but in addition we have established a new group of businesses—for example, infrastructure, housing, and retail, among others to support our core business. In terms of our three main products, the one that is the simplest to track is cement. Since the second half of last year, cement demand has seen double-digit growth rates almost every month, despite a small demand contribution from infrastructure projects. Construction activity has been driven by the housing, commercial, and industrial sectors. As you know, cement is not used alone, but in conjunction with aggregates, as ready-mix. In this context, ready-mix is growing at a much faster pace than cement, as it is used by the formal sector for major housing, industrial, and commercial projects. In light of this, we have developed our housing and infrastructure solutions initiatives. We want to promote new projects in these sectors and participate in the entire process —the financing, technical aspects, design, engineering, and even the construction itself. In 2013 we built around 6,000 homes in Colombia, mostly related to social housing. We have already been awarded the construction of a further 12,000 homes. In terms of infrastructure, we have focused on highways, roads, and airports under the public-private partnership (PPP) law approved a while ago. Our other business initiative is focused on the retail sector, where we have created a franchise retail network called Construrama. So far 300 distributors have agreed to join the program, and there are about 170 stores already in operation. We aim to expand the network by a further 200 stores in 2015, and Construrama is already the largest hardware store retailer in Colombia. Construrama is now offering around 5,000 different products. We have pursued such an undertaking based on our conviction that Colombia is prepared for consistent growth over the medium term. There are several reasons leading to this conclusion, including the country's investment-grade status, which has attracted foreign investment, and the fact that Colombians today are also investing significantly in the country. In addition, Colombia enjoys fiscal discipline and a solid banking system. We also enjoy a positive macroeconomic environment. Meanwhile, the political arena is supported by social cohesion, forward mobility, and security, which could only be improved by signing a peace agreement. The other factor to highlight is infrastructure, particularly its current limited condition. In terms of landmass, Colombia is equivalent to the area of France and Spain together. Yet, we only have 1,300 kilometers of two-way double-lane highways and around 3,000 kilometers of railroads, whereas Argentina, for example, has 25,000 kilometers. In the competitive index, in terms of overall infrastructure, Colombia ranks 117 out of 148 countries. When you add up these factors together, it is difficult not to believe that Colombia will grow consistently over the medium term.</p><h4>Are there any regional dynamics that explain your growth?</h4><p>Over the past three years, we have doubled our business. Regionally, the Caribbean Coast is the most dynamic market, largely due to the free trade agreements (FTAs) and the condition of its infrastructure. It's clearly an advantage for exporters to be located on the coast. Three years ago, we had limited participation in the Caribbean Coast, but we have tripled our market share. The Caribbean coast is experiencing strong growth. In terms of sectors, housing has been the main driver for demand of our products, but going forward we expect a higher contribution from the infrastructure sector. To provide some context, the fourth generation of concessions, which represents an investment of about $26 billion, is expected to be deployed over a period of five years, starting around 2016. If we assume an average of $5 billion dollars per year and given that cement intensity for large-scale infrastructure projects stands at around 10%, this translates into about $500 million dollars per year invested in cement. At current cement prices this results in more than 2 million tons per year in a market that consumes around 12 million tons of cement. Even with conservative assumptions, this program could have a significant impact on consumption. And in addition, we would need to consider demand from the housing sector, PPPs projects, and regional infrastructure works, among others.</p><div class="quote">“Over the past three years, we have doubled our business."</div><h4>How much of an impact will your newly announced plant in Antioquia have on revenues and volume growth?</h4><p>This facility is expected to increase our current capacity in the country from 4.5 million to close to 5.5 million tons of cement per year. Given that we are currently operating at a capacity utilization rate of about 80% to 85%, we certainly need additional capacity. We expect Phase I of the construction process to be completed during 2Q2015, and the second phase by 2H2016. Antioquia is a region in which we already participate, but have no production, and it is one of the largest markets in Colombia. This new plant is going to be very well connected, in close proximity to new highway projects, railroad concessions and, is just 60 kilometers away from the Magdalena River.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind the creation of CEMEX Energy in June?</h4><p>To clarify, we incorporated this business unit not to produce and sell energy to the third parties. The cement industry is very intensive in terms of electricity consumption. We already generate about 62% of our own electricity needs, but we see an opportunity for this new company to participate in the system and get better rates on electricity. At the same time, we have plans to increase our own production of electricity. Our goal is to reach 80% of our own needs by 2017 through different initiatives. Through this strategy we expect to benefit from our participation in the system, although, as I just explained, we are not planning on selling electricity to third-parties.</p><h4>Are there are any infrastructure projects of specific interest to you?</h4><p>We are working mainly on two initiatives: social housing and roads. We are helping municipalities improve their road network, with a focus on tertiary road systems connecting small towns. This is a very attractive business case for the country and it creates new demand for us as well. This approach has been received with a lot of enthusiasm throughout Colombia. We have plenty of projects in the pipeline, but the execution process presents several challenges. There is significant potential in Colombia in terms of projects under a PPP-scheme and, if we could open that door, we would create new demand and continue participating in the development of the country.</p><h4>How are you trying to open that door?</h4><p>It requires active dialogue at different levels. For example, we are developing a project to improve the road system in Pereira, and we are working with different political authorities in the region. In other markets, we have significant experience in promoting projects like this.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your opinion of the education sector here in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The education sector is, like many other sectors here in Kazakhstan, rapidly developing and evolving. In general terms, the government has overseen what is called the Roadmap Project, which takes a comprehensive view of the overall education system from early childhood, pre-school, and primary school, through to higher education, and the research sector. This gives a holistic picture that was run through our university, and our Graduate Center for Education Policy. This policy research program is extremely ambitious, and it will definitely attempt to push forward the overall reform theme of modernizing the education sector. It is commendable that the authorities are putting an emphasis on early childhood, and not just building new kindergartens, but really focusing on the quality. This is, in many ways, a theme of the education sector. Access to higher education, overall, if we are speaking about the number of institutions, is not an issue. At the moment there are 132 institutions, and for a country of 17 million, in my view, this number is still too high, and you worry about the standards and quality of some of them. Having said that, with regards to access overall, about two-thirds of the universities are public, and the tuition fees are low.</p><h4>What are the main achievements of Nazarbayev University thus far, especially in regards to the expansion of its programs?</h4><p>Objectively speaking, we have come a long way. At the end of June 2014 we celebrated our fourth year, and May 30, 2015 will be our first big graduation of our bachelor cohort. Before that we were just trying to build up 300 undergraduate students, which we now have. Furthermore, we are adding Master's and graduate programs, especially on the engineering and sciences side, as well as in political science. This is a significant step forward. In 2013, as planned, we opened graduate schools for business, public policy, education, leadership, and management. In 2015 we will also open our medical school, and that corresponds to our five mandates. The first was to contribute to educational reforms by building a new model and paradigm of higher education, not only for our institution, but to share it with others as well. We operate under a particular governmental and legal framework that gives us privileges, academic freedom, and autonomy, as well as considerable responsibility, and we must share the outcomes. Hence, we conduct a number of training programs for the leaders of other universities. The second and third mandates are the core tasks of academic excellence, and research excellence. The fourth is moving interest to the research side, and building toward a medical program that is integrated, and brings the teaching, research, and clinical sides all together. In our case that means putting our life science research activity center together with our future school of medicine, as well as the hospitals that are under the national healthcare system. One of the main developments under the national healthcare system is to rename and refocus a former emergency hospital as a national research oncology and cancer research center. We are making it a totally brand new facility, which should open in 2016. The fifth mandate is to build and develop an innovation cluster around the university, which is one of two national projects on this subject. One already exists in Almaty, and this one here now is not just a science park, it is a whole ecosystem of entrepreneurship and start-ups that we want to build. There will be a whole start-up corner, and we are also keen to attract established firms into our future park to set up research and development. The future park will have three or four clusters, with one area focusing more on geology, where we will most likely set up a joint venture with Kazgeology. It will help provide up to date mapping of geological resources, and also provide laboratory analysis, and core sampling. We will also have a general engineering center. We recently entered into a broad agreement with Samruk-Kazyna, which will be a win-win situation. We have committed to doing substantial contract research for its firms in a variety of areas including chemicals, infrastructure, transport, and materials. In return, Samruk-Kazyna will support our general research, and we will hopefully be able to contribute to its management and staff through leadership training, amongst other things. If there are any other joint possibilities, we will certainly pursue them.</p><h4>What are some other iconic firms you are partnering with to develop and enhance the university's network?</h4><p>Some of the other firms we have signed agreements which include General Electric, and more recently Zeiss, the German imagery and optics firm. Philips is another firm we have reached an agreement with. Then, as with everybody else, we will pursue IT data related areas. We have agreements with Samsung and Huawei. Then there are Intel, Microsoft, and HP. The reason why there is this interest in the cluster in terms of entrepreneurship, research and development, and applied research is because President Nursultan Nazarbayev launched the Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy. That strategy is one of the platforms that should hopefully drive future growth. As you know, the goal is for Kazakhstan to join the 30 most developed nations in the world, not just based on per capita income, but also in quality of life terms. This is extremely important, and can only be achieved if Kazakhstan moves away from being a commodity-based economy. It needs to focus on higher valued-added and knowledge-based activities. This activity is meant to foster that growth, and our university was also involved in the 2050 Strategy planning.</p><h4>What is the importance of knowledge transfers, and collaborating with other multinational firms?</h4><p>We have a nice name for it: it is going to be called Astana Business Campus, or ABC. We hope that firms will find it to be an intellectual and academic environment, with all the human resources they need, and a business environment which will make it attractive for the firms to set up shop and move some of their new R&amp;D facilities over here for more of the general Russian-speaking markets. Most firms have typically developed their facilities in Russia or Ukraine, and given recent turbulence, I think Kazakhstan will actually be an attractive new destination. We believe that our role is to help create this environment, and also provide the resources for our intellectual and academic activities. This can lead to knowledge transfers, but we also want to generate knowledge.</p><h4>How do you position Nazarbayev University in the international arena, and what is your relationship with other international universities?</h4><p>We started off establishing ourselves by entering into strategic partnerships with top-class international universities. Our partners include Duke's Fuqua School of Business, and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. We are also working with the University of Pennsylvania in higher education management; Cambridge University in education, leadership, and management; University College London in engineering; and University of Wisconsin-Madison in humanities and social sciences. Therefore, for each of our schools we have one strategic partner, and for the medical center we are working closely with the University of Pittsburgh. Further, we will be setting up a school of mining and environmental engineering. Our approach has been to identify good, strong partners, without becoming a branch campus. We need to have our own identity, culture, and coherent approach. Having said that, our partners have been great, and they have been supporting us. I look forward to further close collaboration with them, and more student exchange and research.</p><div class="quote">“We started off establishing ourselves by entering into strategic partnerships with top-class international universities."</div><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) and how does it function within the current context of the Nigerian economy?</h4><p>The government realized that there was no single agency responsible for the industrialization of the country, so it was decided that NEPZA would have the additional mandate to be the agency responsible for it. Several things must happen to ensure this. First, the enabling act that set up NEPZA needs to be reviewed. That process has begun by order of the National Assembly. We need to restructure the way the agency works. One key thing that we noticed is that many of the jobs were done by too many people, so there was no ownership of the process. So you had too many departments that were doing the same sorts of jobs, or fragments of each other's jobs. But when it came to taking responsibility, nobody took it. So we restructured and pruned down the departments. We created the compliance and enforcement department that will be fully responsible for the end-to-end compliance and enforcement of various policies, aligned to the various incentives we have given. Then we separated the free zones into public and private ones. The idea is that you have one director responsible in each area who sees things end-to-end from the beginning with marketing to bringing those people on board, to registering them, to giving them incentives, to ensuring that they are complying with various incentives, and paying all relevant dues and fees. They are responsible for the training as well. Also, NEPZA will be called the Nigeria Industrialization and Free Zone Agency (NIDZA) when all approvals have been made. There are two key policies that will drive industrialization. One is the Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan, and the second is the National Enterprises and Development Program (NEDEP). Those two government policies are anchored in the President's transformation agenda. In addition to these programs are the Sugar Policy and the Automotive Policy. Our mandate has been expanded, so we are not solely focusing on free zones anymore. We are now focusing on industrial cities and industrial parks. This means the whole appraisal process of the old free zone has to be amended, more checklists have to be put in, and it has to be more robust. I came in January 2013 and the transformation has been ongoing ever since. Prior to this time, the President had stopped approving free zones since he was not seeing their benefit. So for the first nine months I had to do a complete appraisal of why the free zones were not working.</p><h4>What did you find out?</h4><p>A lot. I had to meet with the Chief Economic Advisor to the President and other people to make sure that we were all on the same page. I came up with a checklist that I gave to them and we discussed it together. The idea in getting them to agree to the checklist was so that they could not later renege on what they had already agreed to. Within a few months of coming on board with the new checklist and the new structure, we have had about three approvals from the President. It has been a lot of work, but when you look back you can see the good it has done. It has lead to the birth of the first industrial city approval, called the Gas Revolution Industrial Park in Ogidigben.</p><div class="quote">“My strategy is based on facts, not on hope."</div><h4>You identified some key sectors that are particularly promising for future development. Why are these sectors important and what will be the role of NEPZA in these sectors?</h4><p>The US is our largest buyer. Soon it will not need our oil because of the shale gas fracturing, and the discovery of crude in Ghana. Ghana will offer a discount or tell buyers they can pay in five years or 10 years. It will hurt Nigeria because we depend so much on oil. Therefore, Nigeria has started looking at different sectors of the economy where we have comparative and competitive advantages. Agriculture is another area we need to focus on. We need to look at the oil and gas sector in a very constructive manner. We should not be exporting crude. We are exporting it to countries where they set up their own refineries and create jobs for their own people. We need to do it all end to end, and take the byproducts of the crude. You can see that everything is under the umbrella of a NEPZA operated zone. A NEPZA operated zone will have industry, skills workshops, and SMEs. NEPZA will become the hub that everyone has to connect to. I want my zones to be in the top-50 zones in the world. I want a line that shows that 15% percent of manufacturing is coming from these zones.</p><h4>What will be your strategies and priorities? What will you do to achieve all of this? What kind of projects and incentives do you plan?</h4><p>I believe in numbers. My strategy is based on facts, not on hope. We restructured and plugged the loopholes, looked at the free zone, and we have seen what is working and what is not. Of the 25 free zones, 10 are functional, nine are under construction, and six are dormant. The six that are dormant are state run. Obviously, government people are not good businessmen. So you should go to the state and tell them that they're not doing well. I told my staff from those states that it's a shame that their state does not properly use its free zone license. Tell them there is a new man who will revoke your license if things don't start working. I wrote personally to all of them. As a result, the governments of the dormant zones are currently talking to me regarding investments. Years ago industrial parks and industrial cities were created in this country, but they died with the government. They still exist and some manufacturing is happening. We did research around the country on the viability of these industrial parks. In partnership with the government, we are identifying the old industrial parks and industrial cities to see if we can jumpstart them. We have a new vision we are trying to bring into reality. It is very innovative. We have come up with the concept of the Nigeria International Financial Center, based on the Dubai International Finance Centre, that will be located within our free zones. The objective is to motivate Nigerians to transfer their funds back to Nigeria to set up industries, because currently 80% to 90% of total Nigerian funds are located outside of the country. The New Financial Policy will increase development and industrialization.</p><h4>Where do you see Nigeria in the next five years and how do you make this happen?</h4><p>I am a Nigerian. I love Nigeria. This country has done so much for me. I need to give something important back. The President has four years to showcase something. One quick way to jumpstart the economy is to use the free zones, industrial parks, and industrial cities. Since I have that responsibility, I see myself as the President's number one ally in this. I will make him succeed. For me to succeed, I have to come up with a very clear strategy and make sure it's executed. The problem with Nigeria has never been strategy. We have the best strategies in the world, but they do not get executed. That is what I am doing. Nobody comes into my office without a pen and paper. Fortunately, the things I am doing are not new. The only thing that is different is that for the first time you have somebody who is coming from the private sector and knows how to make money and is running the agency as a business that needs to make profit while running effectively.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

However, a number of challenges remain, particularly the monetary policy shift in the developed countries, especially in the US, from an unconventional approach to stimulate the economy to a traditional one. This shift represents a challenge, particularly for the economies of emerging markets and developing countries.</p><p>The discussions at the G20 meetings and the IMF/World Bank meetings held recently in Washington, DC highlight the need to continue adopting supportive economic policies that promote a balanced, sustainable recovery. The G20 countries have committed to adopting strategies to promote growth by focusing on reforms in employment, investment, competition, and trade to boost global growth rates by 2% in the next five years, underscoring the international community's commitment to act in concert to preserve the gains achieved in recent years. The Kingdom, as a member of the G20, presented its strategy for growth at the meetings of the G20 working group tasked with this work. The Kingdom's strategy is based on the orientations of its development plan. It provides for continued action to promote investment in infrastructure, education, and health and to promote the role of the private sector and public-private partnerships (PPPs) in further diversifying the economy, creating job opportunities, and improving economic productivity and competitiveness in a stable financial and monetary environment.</p><div class="quote">“Government spending has supported growth in the non-oil economy."</div><p>As regards our national economy, it has clearly enjoyed positive conditions over the past years. This is due to the economic policies and reforms launched by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. On the occasion of the Ninth Anniversary of the Pledge of Allegiance of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, I congratulate His Majesty the King and the Saudi people.</p><p>His Majesty's reign has been filled with initiatives aimed at the country's prosperity and growth with a focus on reform, integrity, combating corruption, enhancing government performance, empowering women, and adopting programs and policies, which have helped the economy grow at unprecedented rates.</p><p>During the past year, the Saudi economy achieved real growth of 3.8%, despite the decline in oil sector growth. Government spending has supported growth in the non-oil economy, and the private sector has performed well, growing at a rate of 5.5%. Saudi Arabia's economic policies are designed to achieve financial and monetary stability and to improve the business environment. These policies are reflected in the solidity and strength of the Kingdom's economy and solvency, with Fitch Ratings recently raising the Kingdom's sovereign rating from AA- to AA with a stable outlook.</p><p>In reference to these efforts, the report of the Article IV Consultations of the IMF for 2013 emphasizes the superior economic performance of Saudi Arabia among the G20 countries in recent years and the favorable outlook for the Saudi economy. The Fund's Executive Directors have welcomed the measures adopted by the Saudi government to strengthen public financial management and the government's ongoing steps to support fiscal development and strengthen financial regulation and supervision. They have also commended the large expenditure on education and training. The Fund expects the Saudi economy to grow at a rate of 4.1% this year, and 4.2% in 2015.</p><p>Key developments in the Saudi economy during the past year include the approval of the Code of Procedures and the organization of the Public Transportation Authority. Progress was achieved in the implementation of public transport projects (including the signing of the largest contract of its type for public transportation in Riyadh as a single integrated project), the Promise-of-the-North Mining Project, and the General Education Evaluation Commission. The Saudi Arabia Monetary Agency (SAMA) issued licenses to engage in real estate finance and finance lease activities. The Civil Aviation Authority successfully closed its second issue of instruments—exceeding SAR15 billion—for financing the King Abdulaziz International Airport Project in Jeddah and King Khalid International Airport Project in Riyadh.</p><p>The 2014 budget focuses on development projects in the areas of education, health, security, social services, water, roads, electronic services, and support for scientific research. A total of 2,330 contracts worth SAR157 billion were tendered last year. The specialized government funds have continued to provide credit for the implementation of PPPs, which we hope will further promote the private sector's role, particularly in creating job opportunities for citizens.</p><p>Due to the importance of housing in improving the population's standard of living, government policy has given it the priority it deserves. The implementing regulation for the Real Estate Finance Law is expected to promote sustainable real estate financing by creating the necessary institutional framework for encouraging banks and financing companies to provide financing to citizens and real estate development companies.</p><p>SMEs enjoy major support. The Saudi Credit and Savings Bank is making major efforts to coordinate and provide financing for this vital sector, which is an important source of employment. The Kafalah program, which is managed by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, plays an important financing role in cooperation with the commercial banks. On this occasion, I would like to express my gratitude to the commercial banks for their cooperation and involvement with the program and my hope for more of the same.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Dubai offer as a location for SKA Group's headquarters?</h4><p>First and foremost, Dubai is a great place from which to do business. The banking system and the free zone system are unique and make it very convenient for us to operate our business. The main attraction for us here in Dubai is that, geographically, we are at the center of all our regional operations. We can support our businesses in Iraq, Afghanistan, the UAE, and Africa. Most international companies are located here, meaning many of the people we deal with are also in Dubai. It is a good networking place. Dubai is a fast-growing location. It is safe and secure, and the financial system here is easy to work with. It makes it very attractive to do business. We see a lot of potential in the UAE as well, not only in the other countries we are investing in.</p><h4>What makes SKA so keen on working in challenging environments such as Iraq and Afghanistan?</h4><p>We operate in high-risk environments because we feel that a lot of those environments have the biggest opportunities. In places like Iraq, there are huge opportunities, although the risks are very high. Not every company can work in these kinds of places, but we developed our niche by successfully working in difficult environments since 2005. We can't change anything in politics, but I believe that all the projects we are involved with help to develop the countries that we operate. SKA aims to work as a good corporate citizen, helping to develop business, people and communities, and we are also focused on a lot of charity work and social welfare programs. All of this is positive.</p><div class="quote">“We operate in high-risk environments because we feel that a lot of those environments have the biggest opportunities."</div><h4>How has the partnership with the Iraqi government helped in developing SKA in its overall operations?</h4><p>Over the last decade, we have developed a very positive working relationship with the Ministry of Oil in Iraq. We have developed an excellent relationship in quality control and in doing our business professionally. More recently, we now have supply contracts with the Ministry of Electricity to supply all the power stations with imported gas oil. We are developing a great track record of being able to get the job done. This has been the key to our success in Iraq—developing good relationships with the government of Iraq and its different ministries. Everything in the Middle East is dependent on good relationships; therefore, you have to spend the time on the ground understanding the problems and working with the people if you want to achieve success.</p><h4>What is your strategy to manage risk in your operations?</h4><p>We have a very good saying; knowledge dispels fear. I believe that in order to get the right knowledge and understand the problems, you have to be on the ground. You cannot run a business in Somalia or Iraq or Afghanistan sitting in your office in Dubai. That is why I have to travel all the time; I have to be there to understand what the problems are and manage the risk. I have to make decisions that will affect all of my staff and potentially, I'll need to protect them as well. We take risks, but we don't take unnecessary risks. We don't put our people unnecessarily in harm's way. We are proud of the fact that we have a good safety record.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your personal background in Nigeria's oil and gas sector?</h4><p>I grew up in this industry having studied petroleum engineering as a passion. I started my career with Shell at Port Harcourt. I later moved from Shell to a Nigerian independent oil and gas company, Pan Ocean, in 1993. That was where I began to see things from a local, indigenous perspective. Pan Ocean is the only Nigerian independent joint venture with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), operating an oil mining lease (OML) in Delta State before venturing into marginal fields. By the time I left Pan Ocean in 2008, the company was producing 15,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) from its existing OML, with another marginal field asset with Newcross Petroleum, and a second oil block under a production sharing contract (PSC) fiscal regime.</p><h4>How has Energia Limited become a pioneer for indigenous companies in the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>Energia started as an idea by some key Petroleum Technology Association of Nigeria (PETAN) members to utilize indigenous capacity and local content to manage an exploration and production (E&amp;P) company. The founding companies include Oildata, Weltek, Sowsco, Ciscon, Skangix, and Ariboil. Others included Pemec, IDD, Ashbert, and ISK, which is a law firm owned by renowned security officer Chief A.K. Horsfall, who is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Energia. The company was awarded the Ebendo and Obodoeti marginal fields in the 2003 bidding rounds in a joint venture with Oando by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR)/Federal Government, with Energia Limited as the designated Operator in a 55/45 split in favor of Energia. Operations started in 2008, leading to the first oil in December 2009 after revamping an already abandoned Total well by Energia's in-house technology group in collaboration with other local contractors. The company has since carried out further field development with the drilling and completion of four wells back to back between 2012 and 1Q2014 to bring field production capacity to around 10,000 bbl/d, with a technical allowable of 8,000 bbl/d by the DPR. We are presently embarking on an alternate crude evacuation route through a new 53-kilometer, 12-inch pipeline to the Forcados terminal with a member of our cluster company in Delta State. This will free all locked-in crude potential due to restrictions through Agip's Brass Oil Export Terminal. As a company, we are locking in about 5,000-6,000 bbl/d, while the entire cluster of Midwestern, Pillar Oil, and Platform Petroleum with Energia is locking in around 15,000 bbl/d. Besides the export and production restrictions, we also suffer high crude theft ca. 20%-25% of daily injection, which in the past two years has amounted to a huge $200 million loss for the four companies in the cluster. It is as a result of these restrictions and theft, plus the anticipation of a possible global crude glut due to growth in shale oil, that propelled our move for a mini 10,000 bbl/d refinery within our area of operation.</p><h4>What is Energia's main goal?</h4><p>Our target is to be the first indigenous company to build a standard crude oil refinery plant. Studies are already underway in Houston with one of the top refining companies. Energia is a success story that was hardly known before. Now, we are becoming a household name in the indigenous E&amp;P industry in Nigeria. We are creating a brand with integrity. We want to set up a local company with an international outlook in terms of transparency in our processes. In terms of success, I think we are one of the most successful because we were able to drill four wells back to back, which is unique for an indigenous company. We have lined up a work program for 2015 and 2016. Our target by 2016-2017 is to post 20,000 bbl/d in production. Our only current limitation is the pipeline export restriction. We can only inject 3,000 bbl/d, and, frankly, this is the major challenge we have since we invested $150 million in drilling and completing the wells and tying the flow lines to the flowstation. And so, we created a joint venture with another independent company, Midwestern, to construct an alternate pipeline to another export terminal. This pipe will soon have the first oil put through it, and it will give Energia, Midwestern, and a cluster of other companies the ability to pump 66,000 bbl/d; of this 21,000 bbl/d will pass through Agip's Brass Terminal, and 45,000 bbl/d through this line to Shell's Forcados Terminal. Between Energia and Midwestern alone we are locking in somewhere between 15,000 bbl/d and 17,000 bbl/d because of the pipeline restriction.</p><div class="quote">“The Nigerian oil and gas industry will drive the economy in terms of the opportunities we can create."</div><h4>What is your assessment of the Nigerian Local Content Act?</h4><p>It is fantastic for the oil and gas industry because Nigeria is growing. There are about 175 million Nigerians, with a projection to reach about 450 million by 2050. With such a population explosion, unemployment will be a major issue, which must be a priority for any government. Oil and gas are non-renewable, and Nigeria must take full advantage of this industry to diversify the economy. Nigerian content is for those who are present now and those who are yet to be born. If Nigeria has 250 million or 400 million people, we'll need to employ all of them, otherwise we will have trouble. In the next 20 or 30 years we need to move the economy out of this developing state and into a developed one. We need to engage the entire population and this is the vision for Nigerian content. So much success has been achieved by the board in this regard. The good news, also, is that other sectors and ministries in the country are adopting the Oil and Gas Nigerian Content Act model. Such growth in Nigerian content in other sectors will bring rapid industrialization of the economy.  Nigeria is the country that can do this for Africa. Presently, we have an infrastructure deficit, but there is pressure from around globe for Nigeria to make it, as Africa and West Africa look at Nigeria for leadership in this direction.</p><h4>You want to industrialize, yet not at the expense of the local communities, because Energia values giving back to the local communities that are impacted by local oil and gas operations. Could you tell us more about that?</h4><p>Energia's model is, I think, unique and second to none in the industry. I found that if you can share the resources, you will win over the people. They want attention. We dedicate about 4% of our gross production and provide 3% to sustainable projects, and I can assure you we are doing everything above board. We are well liked by everybody. The communities have come to us to say we are sincere. When they have a problem, we share it. Our model has moved away from the benefactor-beneficiary model to the stakeholder and partnership model. We have created a trust fund with our proceeds to superintend the development of these communities. We have also set up a company/community parliament system that engages a wider group of the communities in an interactive setting to discuss any and all issues concerning the environment. We also encourage young people to incorporate limited liability companies that can be mentored into growth, and this we have been doing since 2009.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of the Nigerian oil and gas sector?</h4><p>The Nigerian oil and gas industry will drive the economy in terms of the opportunities we can create. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), when passed, will provide transparency and accountability, and, frankly, we do not have a choice if we are to compete globally. As part of this vision, the government is privatizing the power sector, and we are also opening up the midstream and downstream so that rather than sell crude natural resources, which are hallmarks of developing economies, we will refine and process our natural resources and export finished products. I see Nigeria, if we hold out and I know we will, in 20 years becoming relevant in every global engagement. That is my vision for Nigeria. In every area of trade, technology, industry, and education, the Nigerian opinion will be sought after.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what sectors are Schad's services most required and what customers are you targeting?</h4><p>Schad mainly serves the consumer goods, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, technology, and telecommunications industries. Our motto is “get there first." So, for example, pharmaceuticals is an important sector for us because of the time-sensitive focus. We are also very active in the free zone manufacturing sector, which has a large component of medical device firms. In term of clients, we focus on multinationals and large national companies, mainly because these are the organizations that are more advanced in their logistics planning and are willing to outsource, understanding that they need to focus on their core business, and partner with logistics experts to handle the movement of inventory. The smaller companies still want to have their own warehouses, inventory, people, and operations.</p><h4>What is the importance of your partnership with Deutsche Post DHL, and its role in the overall development of Schad?</h4><p>DHL Global Forwarding has been our partner for more than 40 years. Branding-wise, it is important for us because DHL is the number-one logistics company in the world. However, more important than this is the network that DHL has. While Schad's presence is in the Dominican Republic, we have access to the offices of DHL everywhere in the world, permitting us to serve customers along the entire global supply chain, from origin all the way to the end consumer.</p><div class="quote">“DHL Global Forwarding has been our partner for more than 40 years."</div><h4>What innovations and technologies is Schad using for its operations?</h4><p>We are implementing automated warehouse management systems that are controlled by radio frequency, which gives us immediate data and inventory visibility. Within the transport sector, we have an in-house Transportation Management System that controls our 250 trucks while being monitored by GPS. This year we are also implementing a business process management system as well as an electronic document storage and retrieval system, which aims to improve our overall process efficiencies. Technology alone does not go very far without the accompanying procedural best practices. Our integrated management system certified in ISO 9000 and BASC guarantees that we implement correctly, while continually improving operations.</p><h4>What have been the major milestones for Schad in 2014?</h4><p>During 2014 we have consolidated our trucking network to provide daily coverage to all the municipalities of the Dominican Republic. Our logistics operation in the eastern part of the island was consolidated, now offering customs brokerage, warehousing, and distribution from our center in Punta Cana, mainly to serve the tourism sector. These services guarantee our customers same-day deliveries with over 99% accuracy. Looking to reduce risks, several projects were successfully completed ending with our Business Alliance for Secure Commerce certification.</p><h4>In August 2013, SOFOS unveiled the Dominican Republic's biggest rooftop solar panel array, located at your logistics complex. What is the importance of this investment for the development of the energy sector in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>First of all, we feel very good that our green energy production is equivalent to the consumption of over 100 homes. It is also a sound economic decision earning a positive return on investment. The Dominican Republic has had a big problem for many years regarding electricity, with high costs, irregular production, and blackouts. We are heading in the right direction to improve that. We applaud the government decision to provide incentives to ensure more green energy is produced. Schad actually moved forward on a second such facility, which came online in July. The new project is in our truck terminal, and is about half the size of the first one.</p><h4>What is Schad's growth strategy in the medium term?</h4><p>Schad will continue growing together with its customers, who see value in outsourcing logistics processes to a trusted and experienced operator. We will continue consolidating all our existing offerings, providing more depth and geographic coverage. The objective is that consumers always find their preferred products on the store shelves and other points of sale, which is mainly a supply chain undertaking. Our company is building a large new warehouse complex along the main North-South cargo corridor, the Duarte Highway, at the intersection with a new perimeter road that is going to encircle the city of Santo Domingo, the first section of which should be ready by November 2014. The new road will enhance cargo transport and tourism as it will circumvent the traffic congestion and connect the two main cargo ports of Haina and Caucedo, as well as the Las Americas and Higuero Airport, without entering the city.</p><h4>How would you assess the current condition of the logistics sector in the Dominican Republic and what is your view on the country's potential to become a future regional hub in the Caribbean?</h4><p>I think, as a country, we have adequate and comparatively modern infrastructure, namely ports, airports, and roads. Established service providers such as airlines, ocean cargo liners, land transport companies, logistics operators, and warehousing companies offer multiple competitive services. The Dominican Republic just needs two more things, the first being the legal framework that will enable the country to become a hub. Under the current framework, it is too expensive and the process is too time consuming to import and export products as a transshipment hub. We are already working with the presidency and the customs authority on a new regulatory framework, which will enable us as a nation to become a competitive logistics hub, with multiple connections and capabilities, utilizing the full spectrum of logistics assets in all geographies of the country, rather than at just one port or airport. The opportunity is tremendous, with vast implications in transport cost reductions, foreign and local investments, connectivity, and so on. According to one study, it would create at least 3,000 direct jobs and 2,500 indirect jobs in the first two years. Secondly, regarding education, we still need quite a bit more development. There is a need for more in-depth specialized training in our industry. Currently, almost everyone in this sector learns on the job. The academic sector offering is a necessary ingredient for the competitiveness of the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>The Dominican Association of Air and Maritime Cargo Agents (Adacam) and the Shipping Association of the Dominican Republic (ANRD) are considering the formation of a transportation logistics cluster as an international competitiveness tool. What is your view on that idea?</h4><p>The logistics sector is currently not regulated under any one specific public ministry or authority. The responsibility is dispersed amongst the ministries of Public Works, Finance, Economy, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, and Public Health, amongst others. There is the ensuing lack of coordination and nobody really understands the global picture well. The cluster is aiming to promote the creation of a national high-level private-public body where all the ministers get together with the main private sector association representatives every few months to develop strategy. At the meso and micro level, other committees would be formed to handle more operational issues. The aim is to make the import and export procedures more lean—the whole process, not just the government process.</p><h4>Looking forward to 2015, what goals would you like to achieve?</h4><p>In 2015 we would like to have the regional logistics center ready for the country and for our company. This is very important. Our customers are demanding this service. It fits our overall strategy to provide end-to-end global supply chain solutions. We started with only ocean transport over 90 years ago, then we added air, customs clearance, warehousing, and then trucking four years ago. And now we are going one step further; directly to the end customer, such as serving people ordering online on the internet. As a company, we plan to grow 20% every year for the next five years.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you provide a snapshot of your current thinking on the Tete Project?</h4><p>The Tete Project is strategically positioned at the confluence of all steel making raw materials. Baobab is looking at a long term commitment: the company's iron ore resources are sufficient to underpin a multi-generational steel making industry spanning 100 years or more. Over time, the steel mill would become the nucleus of a large Industrial Zone, supporting secondary and tertiary enterprises. We are looking to leverage our unique access to captive iron ore (our global resource inventory stands at three-quarters of a billion tons) and the locally-produced thermal coal to establish a vertically integrated, mine-mouth smelting operation producing iron and steel products. By-products of vanadium and possibly titanium will also be produced. Our Pre-Feasibility Study limited itself to the production of pig iron. Moving forward into the Definitive Feasibility Study, the Company has been assessing the viability of full vertical integration beyond pig iron and into the production of high demand steel products to support the rapid growth domestic and regional markets. This would involve the addition of a basic oxygen furnace, a ladle furnace, continuous casting machine and rolling mill to the current pig iron flow sheet. Against a backdrop of slowing global economies and the flattening of Chinese development, Mozambique and the SADC region continue to enjoy strong growth rates of more than 7%. Demand for construction steel in Mozambique is growing rapidly, driven by the commissioning of large-scale infrastructure, mining, LNG and power projects and relentless urbanization. However, the Country is entirely dependent on imports, with prices and availability a significant barrier to consumption.</p><h4>How have the shifting global commodity and capital markets affected project viability and how has the Company's strategy evolved to tackle the challenges faced?</h4><p>It has been made clear during our discussions with potential strategic and industrial partners that their risk appetite is low and that they want to see a highly definitive level of work, with permit-related, logistics, power and metallurgical risks eliminated and a clear plan for execution and financing. Turmoil in the global raw materials market last year, particularly with bulk commodities, coupled with revised growth expectations have also impacted our thinking about the project. While it is impossible to accurately forecast future demand and pricing patterns, the current softening of iron ore and coal prices will affect our cost competitiveness. Global steel demand is decreasing, which will have a knock-on effect on the merchant pig iron market. So the onus on Baobab has been to confirm a project concept, execution strategy and financing plan that will attract strategic partners, access lower development capital expenditure and export finance guarantees, and address commodity market trends. We believe we have found the solution. Baobab recognizes that the key to project success is not simply defining a de-risked technical solution, but also a commercially viable one. In order to reduce the up-front capital burden, the Company has focused on smaller production scenarios, technology options that may open up additional revenue streams and competitive pricing through Chinese sourced equipment, procurement and construction ('EPC'). By adopting Chinese procurement, a more technically and commercially favorable path to production may now be pursued.</p><div class="quote">“Infrastructure corridors are fundamental, without which the resource sector in Tete cannot expand."</div><h4>When do you expect to begin production?</h4><p>Although full integration to steel will push out our time frame for completion of the Definitive Feasibility study, it should enable us to reduce project risk significantly and shorten the ultimate route to execution. We have been awarded our Mining Concession and are in the final stages of negotiating a mining contract. Industrial license applications are underway and we have made solid progress on the environmental impact assessment, resettlement action plan and social development action plan. A project of this scale would take 24 to 30 months to construct, so we would be looking at 2018 for first production.</p><h4>What can the public and private sectors do to bring substance to mining industry development?</h4><p>Infrastructure corridors are fundamental, without which the resource sector in Tete cannot expand. Power is also key, and we need a much more capacity at competitive prices. There is also a global shift towards in-country channeling of raw materials and we expect to see many value adding industries being established in the medium term.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have grown at a rapid rate since your establishment. What makes your aircraft services offering unique in this region?</h4><p>What we have is diversity and specialization. For example, I was recently talking with one of our VIP clients as we were in a bid to get his aircraft under management. He called me and said that he was signing with NEXUS. When I asked why he said that, it was because in every area we had a specialist member of staff, which gave him comfort. We are not a one-man-show; NEXUS Flight Operations Services is a team with specific roles. This is what has made us successful with our customers. As far as airlines outsourcing management, our organization is a significant player as well. Airlines save by outsourcing to specialized organizations. That is how we can be cost effective for airlines and government customers.</p><h4>Who are your main clients?</h4><p>We had corporate clients, and then we went into low-cost carriers. We do a lot of projects with the government because it has a massive fleet, especially in the Middle East. Most of the governments now use subcontractors, because it is more efficient and allows for higher quality control. The government gets a better quality of service, the service delivery is higher, and the cost is lower. The final thing that we are doing is the cargo business. When we started NEXUS, we said we needed to be diversified, and this has made us unique. We went into the training business, and we recently finished a flight dispatcher class. NEXUS is authorized by the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) to become a dispatch-training center, and it is the only company in Saudi Arabia to currently offer this service. In order to get a flight dispatch license, you have to go to the UAE, Jordan, Europe, or the US. Today, we are doing it here with FlightSafety International (FSI) as our partner, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway, a Warren Buffet company. We deliver training up to flight safety standards. FSI has been in the business of flight safety for almost 50 years, and it creates flight simulators. When aircraft manufacturers sell you an airplane, they provide you with a training slot at FSI due to its credibility. The program has been running for more than two years and has been extremely successful. The last service that we provide is the Safety and Quality Audit through our internationally well-respected provider Wyvern Consulting.</p><div class="quote">“We want to make sure that we are a connected global company, and that in every country there is a NEXUS representative."</div><h4>What global certifications distinguish you in this market?</h4><p>Wyvern Consulting is a US company that provides top-level certification to personnel, and is considered the gold standard by operators. We have also become involved with aviation audits through our partners and strategic alliances. We are targeting three markets: China, India, and Africa. We did not target Europe or the US because they are service-oriented markets. We went to places like India because it needs and values our services. India is a very challenging market—the economy is great, growth is high, but it is one of the toughest countries in terms of bureaucracy. We partnered with a local company there that understood the language, culture, and how to deliver services. We decided to be behind the partner, controlling safety, standards, and quality. We established operations in Mumbai, and today we have almost 30 aircraft under support there. India has been very successful and NEXUS was profitable from day one. We started at the end of December 2012, and in 2013 we had done more than 1,100 VIP private flights. The next thing was to go to Africa. Through our contacts, we established a relationship with a partner there, an investment group, and established NEXUS Africa in Kigali, Rwanda. Rwanda is one of the fastest developing countries in Africa, and it is also a hub for the UN. As a country, it has excellent investment rules.</p><h4>Can you put any numbers on your growth?</h4><p>We grew from 25 employees in 2012 to 250 by 2013. As a whole group, we now have 1,100 employees. In terms of aircraft, in 2012 we had three under management, and today we have about 23. This is only in the private sector, of course, not including the other aircraft that we support and manage in terms of commercial operations. We also have customers who want to just buy all of their fuel from us, or just get their flight planning from us. We call these ad hoc customers.</p><h4>What need do you feel that you are meeting in the world, and what trends are you capitalizing on?</h4><p>There are three things. Number one: I give credit to my Chairman. He owns the whole group's vision, which is to take the local and make it global. I believe in this vision and have executed it. Number two: everyone complains about the financial crisis in 2008-2009, but I think it was a good thing for us in the end. Only authorities, customers, and suppliers can appreciate how it has cleaned up the market. There are good companies in the region with the right infrastructure, foundations, and support for shareholders, and they stood up and were successful. Number three: The economy in the Middle East, especially when it comes to aviation, has improved. The government of Saudi Arabia, with the all of the investment that the government has put into building new cities and infrastructure, has helped to keep the economy healthy and attractive to investors. When the economy is healthy, it is a good sign. Developments such as the railways, the new cities, the new roads, and the expansion of the two holy mosques have all made a visible impact.</p><h4>Where do hope to see NEXUS in five years, when many of these new airports are complete?</h4><p>By 2015, we have to be in China, and the year after in South America. We have already established operations in North America. We want to make sure that we are a connected global company, and that in every country there is a NEXUS representative. We would like to take the company global. At the same time, we have to also keep our standards constant. I lose sleep over this. We do not want to become a massive, heavy elephant whose customers are only numbers. So that is why we sometimes slow down our expansion, to make sure that our team grasps exactly what we need.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your role as Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) is to steer the world toward a more secure, sustainable energy future. What role does Abu Dhabi play in the global energy landscape?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is of course a major producer and exporter of crude oil, and the UAE plays a very important role in OPEC. In recent years UAE production has been pushed up close to 3 million barrels per day (bbl/d) to help compensate for some of the recent disruptions in supply. This has allowed prices to remain relatively stable. Abu Dhabi is also very active in the gas trade. LNG has been exported to Japan for nearly 40 years, while Abu Dhabi and Dubai have been importing surplus gas from Qatar since 2004, and transiting part of that supply to Oman. So Abu Dhabi sees all sides of the trade in gas. Longer term, the extensive use of renewable energies will also contribute to energy security, in the Gulf area as everywhere else. There is great scope for solar power in the region, as Abu Dhabi's pioneering solar thermal plant, Shams I, has recently demonstrated.</p><h4>According to the IEA's World Energy Outlook 2014, meeting long-term oil demand growth toward 2020 depends increasingly on the Middle East. As Abu Dhabi is ranked among the top five exporters of crude oil, how do you expect the Emirate to contribute to future oil supply?</h4><p>In fact, our outlooks since 2012 have highlighted the fact that, despite the recent rapid development of oil and gas production in places like the US, Brazil, and Canada, in the longer term, and we are speaking here about the period from 2020 onward, the world indeed seems likely to be drawing more and more on supplies from the Middle East region. In our central scenario we see global demand rising to about 101 million bbl/d by 2035 (from 89 million bbl/d today), with about 6 million bbl/d of that additional supply coming from the Middle East. Abu Dhabi is certainly investing heavily to be able to provide some of that. Both on and off-shore and in the gas sector you are working with international partners to pioneer some ambitious new production systems. As we point out in our recent study of investment, these projects mean sustaining a high level of investment over many years. This is an area where we have come to have confidence in Abu Dhabi's long-term approach.</p><div class="quote">“Abu Dhabi certainly seems well integrated into the global gas market."</div><h4>As the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) works to increase natural gas production via the development of sour gas reserves and carbon-dioxide injection technology, how do you see Abu Dhabi's natural gas influence reaching beyond the borders of the UAE?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi certainly seems well integrated into the global gas market, as an exporter, an importer, and a transit country. Gas is becoming a popular fuel; it is relatively clean and quite widely available. But once Abu Dhabi's associated gas is spoken for and the easily available non-associated gas begins to decline, developing more challenging reserves gets expensive. It is important to find ways to make the projects more attractive through offsetting benefits. Wet gas-fields deliver NGLs and condensates; a sour gas field can deliver quantities of sulphur for export (and I think Abu Dhabi is building a special railway to transport this); and with CO2 injection you can enhance production while disposing of unwanted green house gases. Our team working on carbon capture and storage have been very interested in the technical and legal challenges of this approach. This is an area where international collaboration yields real dividends; and, as for solar power, successful projects will tell their own story.</p><h4>Part of Abu Dhabi's investment strategy toward energy diversification includes four nuclear power plants, which are intended to allow the city to be 25% powered by nuclear energy by 2020—the year when all four plants will come online. What is your take on Abu Dhabi's nuclear ambitions as countries such as Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland phase out of nuclear?</h4><p>Every country has a sovereign right to decide on the role of nuclear power in its energy mix. Nuclear is one of the world's largest sources of low-carbon energy, and as such, has made and should continue to make an important contribution to energy security and sustainability. The IEA's World Energy Outlook has examined the effect of low nuclear investment in detail. The analysis has shown that low nuclear investment is likely to lead to higher demand for gas and coal, higher electricity prices, increased import dependency on fossil fuels and electricity, and a more difficult path to decarbonisation, although such a trend could also open up new opportunities for renewable energy sources. Such a scenario would therefore make it much more difficult for the world to meet the 2 °C climate stabilisation goal, and have potentially negative impacts on energy security.</p><h4>With the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the first intergovernmental organization located in the Middle East, headquartered in Abu Dhabi, the UAE is recognized as the region's renewable energy pioneer. How is Abu Dhabi's diversification toward renewables contributing to accelerating the pace of renewable energy adoption worldwide?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi's offer to host IRENA in 2009 was both imaginative and generous. Since then the organisation has become very well settled. Many of our staff at the IEA have gone to work at IRENA and we are proud of this informal collaboration. We also work together with IRENA on a more formal basis, in particular maintaining jointly a worldwide data base of renewable energy policies and projects. The power of example counts for a lot in promoting new technologies, and Abu Dhabi's pioneering work, particularly through Madsar City and the Masdar Institute, has been most impressive. The fact that Abu Dhabi with so much oil and gas reserves is also developing solar power sends a very strong message.</p><h4>In light of the upcoming 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference in Paris, where a global, binding climate agreement will be signed, what is your assessment of the efforts the UAE is making to address the global climate agenda?</h4><p>Climate change is a global challenge that requires a global response, and an international climate agreement to be negotiated by COP21 in Paris 2015 will be critical in defining this response at the global level. We recognize the UAE's efforts in driving political and public momentum in this regard, specifically with respect to its organization of the Abu Dhabi Ascent, organized this year preceding the Climate Leaders' Summit in New York City. This was a successful meeting in engaging political leaders on the global climate change agenda, a momentum that we hope to continue onto Paris next year.</p><h4>Having a truly global view of the world's energy system, how would you characterize the energy policies in Abu Dhabi in relation to the wider global energy economy?</h4><p>Sir Winston Churchill once observed that the only real security comes from diversity of supply. IEA members' overall objective is to maintain energy supplies that are affordable, sustainable, and secure. Abu Dhabi, which has developed a wide range of oil and gas production and is now advancing in the direction of solar power and nuclear, has certainly moved firmly to diversify its energy regime. These developments should enhance both security of supply and environmental sustainability, and act as an example for others. I would only add that we should not forget the “hidden fuel," which is energy efficiency. I remember Dr Sultan Jaber once commenting that the cheapest kilowatt is the one you do not use. In fact, global progess in energy productivity has been accelerating. A recent study has shown that in 11 IEA countries over the long term, savings from energy efficiency were greater than the output of any single fuel source. The hidden fuel has become the “first fuel." In countries where fuel is plentiful (and sometimes very cheap), there are huge gains still to be made. I know that the Masdar Institute has this firmly on its radar and I am sure we will see significant progress in Abu Dhabi and in the Gulf area in the next few years.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Council of Shopping Centers (AYD) in Turkey supported retailers, and how has the retail sector changed locally since 2008?</h4><p>When we encountered the financial crisis in 2008, there was a big clash between tenants and shopping center investors. Unfortunately, it was a crisis for everybody because the euro exchange rate shot up a lot, while the economic situation of Turkey collapsed for a short period. However, the situation soon recovered. When you look at recent years, Turkey was the least affected country in the region by the global financial crisis. Everything is still growing. Only in 2008 did we experience negative growth. When we had the economic crash, we tried to find common ground to help our tenants. You cannot close your eyes and demand them to pay the rent. Somehow, you should support them and help them to survive. Right now—and this is a common practice—we are following the effort index, which is the turnover versus the rent levels per square meter. This gives you an idea of how much it should be. In a shopping center with below 15% rent versus turnover, there is no problem at all. Over 15% and there may be some problems. Of course, you should consider what kinds of products the retailers are selling. It might not be just the result of an economic crisis; it might be a case of brand mismanagement. We have supported our tenants and retailers a lot in this aspect. With good management, we have given discounts to some of the good retailers, even up to 40%, and they survived. After 2008, we started to return to our normal rent levels. However, this is still the practice used in new shopping centers. Usually in the first three years of a new shopping center, retailers don't perform very well. You need people to know the shopping center, then they will come later on and spend money. If you look at this index now, you will see that there is continuous growth in each sector every year. If you compare the numbers of the SC Sales Index, you can see how the retail industry has changed from 2008 to 1H2014. For example, in 2011 we started at 100 and now the sales index is at 163, indicating 63% growth.</p><h4>What motivated the changes in the shopping center industry in Istanbul?</h4><p>In the shopping center industry, 30%-35% of investors are foreign. We have lots of multinationals in Turkey, and Turkey is continuing to attract great interest amongst international investors. For example, Blackstone has just purchased Multi Development, simply because of its Turkish operations. Turkey is the biggest part of Multi. These foreign investors are also a part of AYD, and of course we are encouraging foreign investors to come and invest locally. The total foreign investment in shopping centers is around $12 billion right now. As AYD, we are supporting conferences and are actively attending meetings to show and explain the attraction of the retail business in Turkey.</p><div class="quote">“One of our main goals is to attract visitors from neighboring countries like Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, and Greece."</div><h4>How significant are events like the Istanbul Shopping Festival?</h4><p>One of our main goals is to attract visitors from neighboring countries like Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, and Greece. We also have very good relations with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. For Russians, Turkey is a very popular country to visit, so we want as many tourists as possible to come here and embark on shopping sprees. It will definitely help to expand our business and grow the Turkish economy. This year was the fifth year we have done the Istanbul Shopping Fest. Three associations founded this festival: the United Brands Association (BMD), the Trade Council of Shopping Centers and Retailers (AMPD), and AYD. In 2014 the scope changed and the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce is involved. Now it is not just the shopping centers organizing the event, but also the retail shops on the streets. We have the city and the municipality helping us a lot. I think it will continue to grow in the coming years because if you only had retail industry organizations supporting this event, it would grow slowly.</p><h4>Can you talk about some of the challenges in the sector?</h4><p>Unfortunately, there has been no proper planning up until now, and not enough regulations have been created. The city was not designed like a European one. Unfortunately, the regulations were weaker than in European cities. However, the new municipality and the government is now trying to fix this situation, but it will take time. There is one thing missing in Turkey; we don't have that many piazzas, like in Italy, the UK, or France. Because of poor urban planning, we don't have that many open spaces in Turkey. In a way, shopping centers are taking the place of these piazzas and squares. People are getting together in shopping centers to fill that need. In Turkey, there is a demand and need for people to gather together within the city. Because of that, you see many shopping centers in the city, and this can create traffic problems. But, at the same time, this is a need. Because of the bravery and speed of Turkish entrepreneurs, you can find six or seven shopping centers right next to each other. It is very interesting, but all of them are working! They are differentiating themselves through their brands. Some of them specialize in high-end brands, like Kanyon, and some like MetroCity feature brands for the C or D class customers. For example, Forum Istanbul has 2.5 million people visiting a month, and they are spending money. They are not even C class, but D or E customers. It has very high footfall, meaning you don't have to just aim at the high-end brands. If you differentiate your shopping center accordingly, you can still survive. However, there is a need for good planning from now on, so as not to make these mistakes anymore.</p><h4>Is the retail sector saturated yet?</h4><p>No. For example, Istanbul is still receiving a significant amount of migrants from the provinces. There are new, growing areas. And in these places, there will be new shopping centers. However, there are some locations in Istanbul that are saturated, like Büyükdere Caddesi. It would be crazy to have another shopping center there, but the investors are still trying. We have problems in Ankara and Denizli, where the saturation level is much higher. Still there may be a way to sort out. By all manner of means, the new shopping centers that are likely to be in those areas should carry an artistic architectural identity besides hosting a hearty, filling brand mix. The thing is, to have a good shopping center, the location is very important. You have to have a good location and good planning. The other thing is the brands and the architecture, which are also very important. Right now, Turkey is overcoming these architectural issues. As well, you need to have good management. To achieve this, you need to have well-trained people, and we are trying to help our members train their employees to increase sales effectively.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Western Union has offices in Dubai and in Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific?</h4><p>In terms of the infrastructure, opportunities, and talent you can hire and recruit to serve your interests as a company, Dubai makes sense for Western Union. A more difficult question to answer would be, “why not Dubai?" Given all that Dubai has to offer, it was tough to choose any other city. I would like to thank Dubai as a city and a leader as it has always given us the opportunity to do business and we have always had its support. I must commend the authorities here on how business friendly it is in Dubai.</p><h4>How do you see the growth of the remittance business in the UAE, and how can your company boost it?</h4><p>You cannot talk about remittances without talking about migration and migration influx. I have lived in Dubai for 14 years and I have seen the city move through so many phases, but always moving forward in terms of population, number of migrants, and variety of ethnicities and communities. It is mindboggling when you look around and you see how many nationalities have been attracted by Dubai to make this their home. All of these people are going to be in need of a money transfer at one point and will be part of the remittance industry. When you think about remittances, you need to think about the people who leave their home countries to come and work to build up the infrastructure and services of a host country while also helping their loved ones back at home. We have seen a lot of migration occurring between Africa and Europe and between South Asia and the US, but what you see in Dubai are migrants who are attracted to the lifestyle that Dubai offers, and the scope is very wide-ranging from blue collar to white collar employees. Most of us are migrants here today and we will have the need to conduct a money transfer at one point in time, whether that means sending money back to your family, your loved ones, or to help a friend. I can tell you that the remittance industry is here to stay and here to grow.</p><div class="quote">“You cannot talk about remittances without talking about migration and migration influx."</div><h4>What are the new areas that you will be targeting in the region in the coming years?</h4><p>What HH Sheikh Mohammed, the rulers of the UAE, and the rulers of Dubai have begun to do is take everything into the “e" for “electronic," through programs such as e-gate and e-government. The remittance business is moving into the digital space as well. This does not mean that tomorrow we are going to stop sending money in cash, but we are giving customers the opportunity to decide which channels they wish to use. Today, from behind your desk, you can access your bank account, debit a certain amount, and send it through Western Union. In the past you were not able to do that. Suddenly, your bank account is connected to 500,000 Western Union agent locations around the world in 200 different countries and territories—in just minutes. With government initiatives, Dubai as a leader and pioneer is at the forefront of technology. Remittances are no exception. The UAE government is putting effort and investment behind the remittance industry to provide customers with more choice and control. Western Union will be on that train before it even leaves the station.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the core reasons behind LAN's impressive growth in the Colombian market over the past few years?</h4><p>We have been growing at a rate of 15% for the past three years alongside the Colombian economy. Two of the main features of the current state of development of the Colombian air transportation market are increasing competition and growing demand. We also observe a considerable drop in the price of tickets. LAN has definitely benefited from the expansion of the local economy, and the current trends are the key drivers of the growth in our sector—in 2013, the sector grew 12%, and we expect to close 2014 with a 10% growth rate. The main driver of such sector expansion has been tourism, rather than the business segment. Business travelers grow at a rate similar to that of the national economy, at around 4%, whereas the tourism segment grows at a much faster pace. This is also due to the prices in the latter segment, which are proportionally comparable to those of bus transportation. I expect a 20% growth rate for 2014, whereas in capacity terms the number is at 15%.</p><h4>What is the potential to grow the business segment?</h4><p>MICE tourism has been growing at a 70% rate more or less in the past few years. However, we should keep in mind that these travelers tend to come from abroad. Increasing levels of security, economic stability, and the improvement of the country's image at the international level have been key economic drivers that justify such impressive growth.</p><div class="quote">“High operating costs represent a challenge for the country and its domestic market."</div><h4>As you expand economic activities in Colombia, how is LAN working in terms of partnerships with tour operators and public administrations?</h4><p>We have an alliance with ProExport and Marca Paí­s here in Colombia. These are two institutions we closely and regularly work with in order to increase the number of visitors to Colombia. For example, LAN operates in 150 countries and we have an initiative with those two organizations to bring around 100 international tour operators to Colombia, where we travel with them for an entire week. This is how we try to sell the country abroad in order to increase tourism figures. We do this once a year.</p><h4>How do LAN's passengers benefit from the company joining the oneworld Alliance?</h4><p>That was a move we implemented in 2013 that gives our passenger greater connectivity. We travel to over 150 destinations, and thanks to oneworld our passengers can now reach more than twice that number. On top of that, there are other additional benefits such as VIP areas around the world, exclusive services, redeem miles, and so on. For us, being part of the oneworld Alliance is a massive plus in terms of increased passenger numbers, alliances, and strategic partnership in order to offer more comprehensive and better services to passengers. And also it has already had an impact on our income—I would say that thanks to LAN joining this alliance we had a 4% boost in our income, more or less. It is a win-win situation for us, our passengers, and the rest of partners in the alliance.</p><h4>What are the main business lines LAN Colombia invests in at the moment?</h4><p>Facilities, equipment, and technology are our three main investment focuses. For example, over the past few years we have renovated our entire fleet, as a result of which LAN today operates one of the youngest fleets in Colombia. We completed the entire fleet renovation as recently as March 2014. We have invested over $1 billion since we arrived in Colombia, 70% of which has been in our fleet, and the remaining 30% in infrastructure and technology.</p><h4>Who are your main competitors?</h4><p>Despite what many think, VivaColombia is not our competitor because it works to a completely different business model. We are not a local carrier, but to an extent we target the same audience as Avianca and Copa. Over the past few years, competition has increased, but the challenges that presents foster more robust company development. One of our main competitive advantages is our prices. We also have a well-structured business model that differentiates us from the competition; we do not offer business class within Colombia as Avianca does, for example, as it is not as profitable as many might think. That service is reserved for our international flights only, and we try to get the maximum number of average passengers within our planes. Finally, punctual flights are another of our main competitive advantages, and we have back-up planes to keep our passengers moving as scheduled.</p><h4>How many domestic destinations do you serve?</h4><p>We fly to 20 Colombian destinations, this market accounts for the highest number of domestic flights for LAN in Latin America. This has been at the heart of our business strategy from the very outset, as we have some five or six competitors in Colombia, whereas in other regional markets the competition falls to two or three players. At the moment, we hold a market share of 40% and only Avianca's market share is higher.</p><h4>Do you believe that lower operating costs in the Colombian air transport sector will lead to a greater foreign investment presence?</h4><p>High operating costs represent a challenge for the country and its domestic market. Our main challenge as a local market is to be as competitive as other regional markets due to the high operating costs at El Dorado Airport, the main airport hub for both the country and the region. We have considered the possibility of setting up a hub in other Latin American cities to reduce costs, but unfortunately the sector lacks infrastructure. All in all, I would say that the lack of infrastructure is the main challenge the sector faces, followed by local and regional competitiveness, and regulation. We still have issues concerning Colombia's regulatory framework that need addressing. For example, Colombia has three institutions—Civil Aeronautic, the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce, and the Superintendence of Transport—that oversee sector regulation, which is excessive and some times they don't have the local industry's needs in mind to be competitive.</p><h4>What are LAN's plans to expand its international routes?</h4><p>We are set to commence operations in Cancún at the end of 2014 and will thereafter expand flights in the US, Latin America, and Europe. We are set to aggressively expand our international profile within the next few years. Regarding the Colombian domestic market, we expect to grow at over 10% and increase passenger numbers to around 4 million a year. Meanwhile, at the international level, our expectations are much higher.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[critical-roles]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can indigenous participation in the oil and gas industry be increased?</h4><p>This is actually already happening. In the past, the extent of participation was limited, yet upon the implementation of the Local Content Act, more Nigerians have become participants. We now have many new areas of focus, and can measure the number of Nigerians working in the oil and gas industry. We can measure the number of man hours of engineering completed in Nigeria and the number of vessels maintained. More Nigerians are playing critical roles in the leadership of the industry. For example, all the major operating companies have a top hierarchy of Nigerians, and many service companies have Nigerian CEOs. The expatriate management system is such that Nigerians have a say in who comes to work here. The Board has to certify that we don't have a Nigerian suitable for a job before an expatriate can occupy that position. The number of loans that Nigerian banks are issuing is also growing. In short, we are confident of increasing the level of indigenous participation. Now, we have to get back to grassroots. Our focus is to translate what is being done by Nigerian companies to more directly and positively impact the Nigerian people.</p><h4>In which way have you partnered with other governmental bodies to extend the benefits of the oil and gas industries to other sectors of the economy?</h4><p>We want to create more synergy around what we are doing. We want to reach out to other sectors of the economy and show them the progress that we have made by relying on the Nigerian local content policy. This works in two ways. First, they can benefit by applying the same principles to their own activities. Secondly, the oil and gas industry drives a large market. We are trying to convince other agencies that we can implement this same model to achieve economies of scale and gradually reduce price. Regarding funding, we believe that the Bank of Industry is experienced in supporting entrepreneurial activity, and we want to work with it to use our funds and its funds to support SMEs that manufacture. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are now required to manufacture certain components in Nigeria. Among the challenges will be how to fund these new ventures. It is important to give these new players adequate financial support. We want SMEs to show their potential to OEMs, which can subsequently create companies that supply SMEs with components produced in Nigeria. Meanwhile, the Presidential Task Force on Power is the driving force behind cooperation between government agencies and the private sector in the power sector. We want to bring them closer to the Nigerian local content philosophy, which many people now understand is essential in developing the national economy.</p><div class="quote">“We want to reach out to other sectors of the economy and show them the progress that we have made."</div><h4>How is the Nigerian local content development board working to build local capacity?</h4><p>The first dimension involves understanding the gaps. There is sufficient capacity, but it is not organized or certified. We need to determine what is needed today, and what will be needed in five years' time. With that in mind you need to figure out the optimum technology to use. The other aspect is practical training. We have many training programs for Nigerians in technology and science. As the industry continues to mature and new projects arise, we see that the reluctance of companies to employ local Nigerian workers is waning. What we normally do is use our training as pilot schemes where we show a model that the industry should use while working with the international operating companies and agencies like the Petroleum Technology Development Fund. Over the past few years, we have trained more than 1,000 people. For every project that is completed in the oil and gas industry today, we train a significant number of people and attach them to projects. Anybody who wants to work in Nigeria can do so; however, this requires a certain degree of upgrades and additional facilities. We have certified that over $7 billion has been invested in the acquisition of assets, upgrades, and setting up of requisite infrastructure across numerous locations. For example, GE has a $1 billion investment.</p><h4>Many indigenous companies are pursuing the same contracts. How do you see everyone getting a slice of the cake in the future?</h4><p>Ultimately, we are talking about competition. Not everyone is going to get that slice of the cake and that was part of my message in the beginning. Some companies will have to start doing other things. Before, everyone wanted to do business in pipes. If Shell wanted pipes, 50 companies would try to supply them; however, only one or two would actually get to do it. We are trying to put an emphasis on manufacturing. We have four pipe mills in Nigeria. Shell would use a procurement system to buy pipes from four companies using specifications. Were we to do that in many locations, it would reduce the amount of people who are looking to supply services such as welding, roads, or equipment. Instead of having 50 contractors, there will be four supplying through their vendors. The other suppliers will be supplying these manufacturers, meaning you build a supply chain. The industry will be streamlined once we get companies that have assets and certain knowledge in the industry. As we start moving along the trajectory, we are going to start seeing Nigerian companies that boast assets, knowledge, and specialization. This is a new phase where you have to give everyone a chance. After time you will be able to separate the weak from the strong. You need many companies to change their business strategy to own certain equipment. And every participant in the industry must have a Nigerian local content certificate. The way you obtain an equipment certificate is to show evidence of a strategy to build manufacturing capacity. What we want to do for job creation is to expand the shop floors in Nigeria, where people can work 24/7 to supply products to the common market. The moment we create platforms for people to innovate, we will be able to move away from a system in which everyone is pursuing the same contracts.</p><h4>Education is a challenge, as not everyone has had the necessary training. What do you think about foreign companies that bring international expertise and partner with local companies that possess local expertise?</h4><p>That is natural progression. We have had foreign partnerships for decades; however, the emphasis has often been on having a local partner who helps you run some errands. This process is changing. If a drilling company has a local partner, that local partner should be engaged in drilling as well, allowing the partnership to become a technical one. The law is quite prescriptive about things like that. We have to see that assets are registered and owned in the Nigerian economy, and bring value to the Nigerian economy.</p><h4>Over the past 10 years, people have started returning to Nigeria to reinvest their money. What accounts for this development?</h4><p>The government is creating an enabling environment. We are trying to overcome challenges, such as a deficient power supply. The power situation today is much better than it was three or four years ago. Infrastructure is being built as we speak. Telecommunications have also dramatically improved, and roads are being built. That is what most serious investors are concerned with.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Abu Dhabi play in developing Slovenia's interests and relations with the UAE?</h4><p>As the capital of the UAE, Abu Dhabi represents the framework for our relations that have been developing very successfully. Having rapidly become the second largest economy in the Arab world and ranking among the 25 most competitive economies globally, the UAE is a partner of special interest to Slovenia. Its political importance and well-developed international relations make it a country with which we wish to enhance cooperation even further.</p><h4>How will the agreement on the avoidance of double taxation signed between Slovenia and the UAE in 2013 affect mutual economic and trade relations between the two countries?</h4><p>The agreement on the avoidance of double taxation between Slovenia and the UAE has been ratified, and will shortly enter into force. Furthermore, negotiations on the economic cooperation agreement and the bilateral investment agreement will be launched in October and December 2014, respectively. This will establish the foundations for the safe operation of Slovenian and Emirati businesses in the Emirates and Slovenia, respectively. On this basis, we can definitely expect significant growth in trade and especially in investment flows.</p><div class="quote">“The agreement on the avoidance of double taxation between Slovenia and the UAE has been ratified."</div><h4>As of March 2014, Slovenian citizens have been exempted from the need for pre-entry visas to the UAE. What effect do you see this policy having on enhancing the political and economic relations between the two countries?</h4><p>Our political relations are extremely positive and constructive, in accordance with our common objectives. We understand the decision of the Emirati authorities to unilaterally liberalize their visa regime ahead of full bilateral liberalization by the UAE and the EU as a step that not only corroborates the existing interest, but also effectively strengthens the totality of relations between the two countries and their people. This opens the way for enhanced political dialogue, offers new opportunities for economic and cultural cooperation, and simplifies people-to-people contacts on both sides. It also provides the possibility of an increased tourist flow from Slovenia to the UAE. Regular high-level political dialogue was confirmed by the visit of the Emirati Minister of Economy HE Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansouri at the 2014 Bled Strategic Forum. Further, I am planning a visit to the UAE together with a delegation of Slovenian high-tech industry representatives in the first half of 2015.</p><h4>Many foreign companies and corporations have set up regional offices and headquarters in Abu Dhabi. How would you characterize the tax regulations and policies of the UAE government in regard to promoting investment from Slovenian businesses in the country?</h4><p>The considerable success of key Emirati businesses in the global markets does not come as a surprise, and cannot be attributed only to the favorable geographical position of the country. The UAE's openness policy has substantially contributed to the establishment of companies that are today not only important regional, but also global, suppliers. In addition to Emirati private companies, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) also plays a prominent role in foreign investment. Slovenia hopes for the greater investment involvement of both leading Emirati private entities and ADIA in the ongoing privatization of some major Slovenian state-owned companies. Another reason for the desired stronger UAE presence in Slovenia is the fact that the geographical and sectorial diversification achieved by its companies has significantly contributed to the creation of new jobs in relevant environments. Furthermore, the openness policy has been attracting foreign investment and leading global corporations to the UAE. Slovenian businesses are no exception. It is in the UAE that Slovenian companies have the highest number of representations and production facilities in the Arab world—not the least because of the favorable tax policy.</p><h4>What importance does Slovenia place on the UAE in regards to its geographic position in the Middle East?</h4><p>For Slovenia, the UAE is not only one of its most important economic partners, but also a financial, economic, and transport hub for its cooperation with other Gulf and Asian countries. In these sectors, the UAE excels regionally and globally; whilst on the other hand, Slovenia offers the services of its best high-tech companies in the further development of the country.</p><h4>What are some of the key areas of joint cooperation underway between the governments of Slovenia and the UAE in terms of economic diversification?</h4><p>The economic diversification of the UAE opens up ample opportunities for the development of various forms of cooperation. With its rich industrial tradition and successful niche high-tech providers, Slovenia can offer numerous interesting solutions to the UAE. There is also further potential in increased tourist flows. Finally, given its natural features, Slovenia can be of interest to the UAE in its production of high-quality food and in its advanced agro-alimentary industry.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>FDI in the Dominican Republic has increased exponentially over the last decade. What factors drove that expansion and what are the sectors with the greatest potential?</h4><p>FDI stock, over the last decade, went from $7.684 billion in 2004 to $26.5 billion at the end of 2013, an increase of $18.9 billion, or 245.5%, in 10 years. This significant increase represents an average annual flow of around $2 billion. The main factors that have influenced this increase in FDI are the country's macroeconomic stability characterized by sustained economic growth, low inflation, and relative stability in the exchange rate and a healthy financial, liquid, solvent, and well-capitalized system. The FDI Act provides facilities and guarantees to foreign investors that are equal to those of Dominicans, which provides legal security with clear rules and regulations with incentives for investors in different sectors. In addition, we have political stability and social peace, marked by a rule of law that prevails in free enterprise and democratic rule of long standing. The geographical location the country enjoys is also key, and its central proximity to the US is a feature that makes it an excellent destination for FDI. Another important aspect is the country's participation in major trade agreements like DR-CAFTA and the Economic Partnership Agreement with the European Union (EPA), among others, which make us an investment destination that can take advantage of these agreements. The existence of an excellent road, port, and airport infrastructure network, the latter with eight international airports, is also important, as is our world-class telecommunications system. Diversification in target sectors of FDI is another factor that has contributed to the increase in investment flows. In 2000, four sectors, namely electricity, telecommunications, trade, and tourism, accounted for 82% of FDI. Just 13 years later, in 2013, the spectrum of sectors expanded, with additional areas including real estate, construction, and finance. The sectors that have great potential for future growth in foreign investment are mining, agriculture, energy, and tourism.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the normalization of US monetary policy in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Undoubtedly, the process of normalization of US monetary policy will influence an increase of interest rates internationally, affecting capital flows and changing the liquidity conditions that have existed in the international financial markets over the years. The Dominican Republic is no exception to this international reality. However, we understand that the country is better prepared to face any effect arising from this situation, given the early stage of development of our capital markets and strong fundamentals of our economy, as evidenced in 2013 with the first indications of the US Federal Reserve withdrawing its monetary stimulus. The behavior of the markets at that time showed that, internationally, the Dominican economy is linked to the group of emerging economies with sound macroeconomic fundamentals, as is the case for Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and Peru in Latin America. In addition, several studies in international organizations like the IMF and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) suggest that the effects of this normalization would be different in two groups of countries in Latin America. For example, countries that, in addition to having the US as their main trading partner, have an incipient development of their financial markets, among which are the Dominican Republic, tend to benefit more from the real effects of monetary normalization, given the highest economic growth in the US, which could be affected by the tightening of international financial conditions. However, the Central Bank remains aware of these events and reacts in time when the balance of risks points to possible deviations from its inflation target, and thus takes the necessary measures to ensure the maintenance of macroeconomic stability in our country.</p><div class="quote">“The Central Bank's policies to encourage investment are aimed at ensuring macroeconomic stability."</div><h4>What is your evaluation of the level of assets and deposits of Dominican banks in 2014?</h4><p>As of August 2014, the total assets of financial intermediation institutions totaled Ps1.14 billion, a nominal growth rate of 8.6% relative to the amount recorded on the same date the year before. If you compare this from August to December 2013, assets totaled Ps54.074 million, i.e. 5%. This growth is mainly explained by the behavior of the loan portfolio, which in August this year totaled Ps667.9 million, a variation of 12.5%. Significantly, of the total loans in the financial sector, commercial banks represented 86.9%. Indeed, the loan portfolio of multiple banks totaled Ps586.69 million in August 2014, a variation of 12.8%. Meanwhile, public deposits in the financial sector in August 2014 reached a total of Ps935.7 million, an annual increase of 10.4%, equivalent to Ps87.8 million. Domestic currency deposits grew faster compared to the same period of the previous year, at 12.9%, while foreign currency deposits increased by only 3.6%. In August 2014, the share of domestic currency deposits in total deposits in the financial system was 74.6%, reflecting a decline in the share of foreign currency deposits, which went from 27.1% to 25.4% during the period. An important element worth noting is the fact that during the period from August 2013 to August 2014, financial intermediaries decreased their exposure to credit risk by maintaining the downward trend in the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio, which went from 2.9% to 2.2%, driven by lower coefficients shown in commercial banks and savings and loans. In particular, multiple banking delinquency rates fell from 2.9% to 1.9% and provision coverage of NPLs increased from 117% to 164.3%. Overall, the Dominican financial system has adequate liquidity, profitability, and capital strengthening. The solvency ratio remained above the 10% minimum required, reaching 18.18% in July 2014, the last available figure, while the return on assets (ROA) and average equity (ROE) for August was 2.02% and 18.33%, respectively, in the same month. Commercial banks showed levels of 2.05% for ROA and an ROE of 21.45%. This behavior of the entities of the Dominican financial system is mainly due to the implementation of bylaws and regulations by the Monetary Board, in line with the Basel core principles and international best practices.</p><h4>In the recently celebrated Invest in DR Summit, the Central Bank estimated that the national economy would grow between 5.5% and 6% in 2014, quadrupling Latin American growth. What are the main growth drivers?</h4><p>During the January-June 2014 period, the performance of the Dominican economy as measured by GDP in real terms (reference year 2007), recorded an annual increase of 7.2%. This trend allows forecasting growth for the year 2014 at between 5.5% and 6%, higher than originally envisaged in the macroeconomic framework of a real GDP growth of 4.5%. The driving forces of economic growth expected for 2014 are agriculture, mining, construction, trade and hotels, and bars and restaurants, due to the dynamism exhibited since late last year. In the case of Latin America, consensus forecasts predict an average growth rate of 1.4% for 2014, a figure that has been revised downwards during the year due to decreases in the growth estimates in several of the largest economies the region, such as Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Venezuela. For the last two years changes in real GDP at end-2014 of -1.6% and -2.6%, respectively, are forecast, reducing the average growth in the region.</p><h4>What are the main policies of the Central Bank in 2015?</h4><p>The Central Bank's policies to encourage investment are aimed at ensuring macroeconomic stability, which the country enjoys. In this sense, from January 2012, the Central Bank adopted an inflation targeting scheme as a transparent and modern way to develop monetary policy, consistent with the mandate of maintaining price stability established in the Constitution of the Republic and the Monetary and Financial Law 183-02. Under this scheme, the Central Bank will continue its pro-active and vigilant monetary policy of external and internal shocks that may affect its inflation target, maintaining proper coordination with fiscal policy, in order to promote certainty for economic operators and a climate favorable investment. Another important aspect is to ensure relative exchange rate stability under the managed floating exchange rate regime that the country possesses. For this, the Central Bank will continue to monitor fluctuations in the exchange rate, to ensure that the real exchange rate stays aligned with the macro fundamentals of the Dominican economy.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the economy of the Dominican Republic in 2015?</h4><p>According to estimates of the macroeconomic framework, the Dominican economy would grow at around 5% in 2015, with an inflation rate that points to the center of the Central Bank's target range of 4.0% ± 1%. This is accompanied by a relative stability of the exchange rate, since the strengthening of international reserves that are expected to hold a minimum of three months of imports of goods and services associated with larger flows of foreign exchange by the improved performance of the external sector. Indeed, in a preliminary way, the projections indicate that, by 2015, the current account deficit is expected to be around 4% of GDP, with future estimates trending downward in line with the historical average of 3.5%.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-strategy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the history and evolution of the group, in particular how Verny Capital was able to turn itself into one of the largest groups in Kazakhstan specializing in making direct equity investments in private companies?</h4><p>Verny Capital was established in 2006, and has developed substantial expertise and valuable relationships across core industries through our private equity investment activities. The company was founded by three partners, namely Timur Issatayev, Garik Mikaelyan, and I. Later on our fourth partner, Fedor Popandopulo, joined us. We are the four management partners in Verny Capital Group. There are investment funds under us, and most of these started in Kazakhstan due to Kazakh legislation. We manage the assets of private individuals in these funds, and we have a cornerstone investor, Bulat Utemuratov, who is the main shareholder in the funds. He owns all the assets, and we as a team manage these funds and assets. We follow the private equity philosophy, and we try to do this as much as possible here in Kazakhstan. Investment periods are from three, five, to seven years, and we are looking for high yields of 15%-20% a year. We always think about the exit strategy when we acquire any new acquisition, and unlike typical equity philosophy, we do business with strategic partners. Partnerships are an important part of our business model. We are a diversified group, and we have our own expertise and experience. At Verny Capital, many of us come from a banking background; however, together we do business in gold mining, metallurgy, telecoms, hotels, commercial real estate and property development, cement production, infrastructure, and security.</p><h4>You are involved in many key sectors of the national economy, but which sector are you interested in exploring?</h4><p>One of the major industries we are not represented in is the oil and gas industry, and we also do not have a presence in railroads or transportation. Since Verny Capital was established in 2006, our assets have grown to $4 billion. We became a diversified group, we have expertise and experience, and, for our strategic partners, we offer expertise on how to do business here in Kazakhstan and other CIS countries. I can say that all of our partners are happy to do business with us here. Verny Capital is an active partner, and not just an investment partner. We participate intensely in the strategic management of each of our investments.</p><div class="quote">“Since Verny Capital was established in 2006, our assets have grown to $4 billion."</div><h4>Can you elaborate on the most recent iconic project you have been involved in?</h4><p>Currently, it is the Talan Towers, which is a mixed-use building with two towers of 30 stories with offices and a hotel plus luxury apartments in the second tower. The hotel is the Ritz-Carlton. In between will be a three-level luxury retail gallery, two levels of underground parking, and a large ballroom. The project is running well, the first phase (offices) should be finished by 2015, and the hotel and retail gallery should be completed by the end of 2016. The launching and start-up operations will commence at the beginning of 2017. Between the commissioning of the building and the opening, there is the so-called pre-opening period for the hotel. The real estate development business is not purely a private equity business. Most private equity companies are looking for opportunities to acquire distressed and undervalued companies, in order to bring in value and increase their capitalization.</p><h4>What has to be done to enhance the attractiveness of Kazakhstan for international investors?</h4><p>I think that attractive conditions should be declared for investors, such as low income and property taxes. For other prospects, Kazakhstan is a mineral-rich country; one of the competitive advantages to using mineral resources is that you can process and combine them locally with an attractive local tax regime. Just recently, a new package of attractive conditions was also declared. This is a special tax regime, and in some cases could even be zero tax for property, income, and some reimbursement of capital expenditures. In the pipeline we have plans to build some factories, and these conditions are attractive to us.</p><h4>What is your commitment to bridging the gap between corporate policy and social responsibility? How are you positioned to support the country, not only economically, but also socially speaking?</h4><p>A good example is Verny Capital's investments in Kazakh Economic University. This is purely a manifestation of our corporate social responsibility. For us, as an investor, it is non-profit—philosophically and logistically it is because we do not distribute any dividends. We do not take any withdrawals from this company. All earnings are reinvested into the institution's infrastructure. We are constantly changing the old Soviet-style institute and continue to convert it into a modern local economic and business university because we believe that education and knowledge can make the world a better place for all. We see the lack of quality, local professional knowledge in many industries in Kazakhstan—from hotel management to fast food—and we think we can contribute to improving this situation. Since 2006, we have wholly improved the financial governance, and financial management and performance, and recently we started to do in-depth research. We invited the University of Michigan to be involved, and in 2014 we created a Foreign Academic Counsel. This consists of famous academics such as Robert Blackwell, John Deutch of MIT, and Sergey Karaganov from Moscow. At the beginning of 2014 we started in-depth reforms in the educational process, which is complicated and challenging. We have already changed 20% of the teaching staff and continue to bring in new people. Our goal is to change dramatically within five years. We have a new brand concept, and have spent a great deal of time on this.</p><h4>What is the importance of human capital here?</h4><p>This is an important issue in Kazakhstan; the history of conducting business here is short, as it is only 20 years since we obtained independence, and this is the story for all CIS countries. There is a lack of experienced people here, such as business administrators. There is also the obstacle of having a post-Soviet country. In Soviet schools we had very specific subjects to learn; however, now, in a global economy, other professions have to be learnt. For example, there are only a few schools that prepare people to work in real estate, property allocation, and facility management. Most property managers here are self-educated. For that reason in our university, the Kazakh Economic University, we just established a new faculty teaching hospitality and restaurant management. We also have plans to establish a real estate department.</p><h4>Do you have any specific targets set for the end of 2015? What is your strategy to achieve your goals?</h4><p>We have a number of strategic goals in each particular company that we own. I have already mentioned Talan Towers, and we also have goals for our gold mining company, Raygorodok. We are planning to finish 70% of the exploration work. In telecoms, we take a part in the management of Beeline, which is part of VympelCom Group, in Kazakhstan and Kyrgystan, where there is strong competition, and we wish to raise our market share with a goal of increased capitalization. By the end of 2015, we have to achieve substantial changes in our economic university as well. Our goal is to execute some exits and restructure our new portfolio because there is a cycle to our work. We are thinking about new partnerships. We have some plans to build grain and wheat processing plants in the pipeline, and we are also working on other mineral resource opportunities. We are considering food industries as well. In the short term, we are interested in finding partners in the wheat and grain segment. In addition, we are looking to get into transportation. We are hoping to extend our partnerships. We are open to new partnerships with global players in different industries. We know how to do business here, and we know which opportunities are present. We can brief and guide potential partners through all of the prospects in Kazakhstan, and we consider Verny Capital to be an experienced and reliable partner.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Last year marked a significant growth period for Zambia National Commercial Bank (Zanaco) in terms of number of customers, loan portfolio, and bricks and mortar development. To what do you attribute this performance?</h4><p>Our performance in 2013 was marked by a couple of events. Business growth was strong, at approximately 20% across both business lines and, as you rightly pointed out, the number of customers increased. It is an ambition of the group to have a million customers by 2015. We have around 820,000 customers at present, meaning we are on track for achieving that. In 2013, we also completed a major IT upgrade for the bank, which took time and effort, but will generate positive results in the long term. Many of our customers want to bank with us because of their expectations of what we can provide, which creates a few headaches for us in terms of our branch network and distribution platforms. However, this is a good problem to have, because we are dealing with the challenges that this demand creates, but focusing heavily on customer service.</p><h4>Does this level of demand signal branch-network growth?</h4><p>Going forward, we realize that our strategy is not about more bricks and mortar, it is more about trying to develop better distribution channels. We approach this challenge through agents, and we always try to link up with agents that are within walking distance of a branch. This means that even if you cannot get served at a branch because it is too busy, clients can take a short walk to an agent's office and complete simple banking transactions there. They cannot process a loan, but they can do pretty much everything else in terms of transactions. We have improved on our transactional banking facilities through products such as Xapit, which is a mobile banking product that provides basic functionality for sending money to accounts and paying bills. That basically means that you do not need more branches, but you do need to grow the agent network. We will continue to build branches; however, this will likely take two or three more years.</p><div class="quote">“It is an ambition of the group to have a million customers by 2015. We have around 820,000 customers at present."</div><h4>How would you assess the maturity of mobile banking in Zambia, and how significant is it for Zanaco?</h4><p>It is generally known that Xapit was the first mobile banking-based application. It took off rapidly and has grown robustly ever since. In terms of penetration, you can still do more, and we have a financial inclusion goal, which means trying to reach out and bank the unbanked. By unbanked I do not mean unbankable; I am referring to the people who should have bank accounts but do not. We are not just taking anyone on board, but it does mean reaching out into rural areas. Urban banking is quite well catered for, as there are 19 registered banks in Zambia, of which four or five control about 80% of the market, and the rest compete over the remainder. If you live in a city or a major town you have pretty good access to banking, which is why our goal is in rural areas.</p><h4>In 2007, Rabobank purchased 49% of Zanaco's shares. What potential does Rabobank see in this purchase, and how does the situation of today compare?</h4><p>In the late 1990s, there was a push from the World Bank to make governments, which they were previously funding, transform their commercial sector and get out of banking and sell off some assets that should be in private hands. When it came into the 2000s, Zambia and other countries started to reassess how they privatized these assets. They started off by selling a 49% offering, meaning the government still wanted to retain 51%. They were looking for partners that made a social offering as well as pushing the development agenda. In particular, they looked favorably on institutions that could positively support the rural sector and farming. Rabobank's international activities were strongly linked to food and agriculture; it looked at countries where there was the potential to do more in the food and agriculture space. When it looked at Africa, it was clear that most of the continent can grow crops; yet, some places can grow more than others and have more suitable climates, better access to water, and more available land. From a food security point of view, to feed a population that is predicted to reach 9 billion by 2050, we basically have to double production. Sub-Saharan Africa has the available land; it is just under utilized. It is arable, and it can be used for agriculture in a productive manner to produce high yields.</p><h4>Since that time, what would you say has been Zanaco's impact on the agri-food space?</h4><p>It has been significant because it came from virtually nothing when it started in 2007, but it now represents about 25% of our portfolio. We have an advantage partly because of the government shareholding, as we take a long-term perspective when it comes to agriculture. Agriculture is traditionally something that banks accommodate when conditions are good, and avoid during the hard times. We view it as a business of considerable volatility, but equally we think we have a unique knowledge and experience, and we are committed to the long term. Zambia is dominated by around 700 corporate farmers or commercial farmers, typically part of major enterprises from Australia or Europe. The next level is what we call “emerging farmers," which is an interesting sector. After that, there are the small-scale farmers that are still businesses that produce a profit. Some of these need to be better organized, which we do through farmer cooperatives and associations. We access these farmer groups through the Zambia National Farmers Union, which is also a shareholder in Zanaco. We lend to the cooperative/association, which select beneficiary farmers for these loans.</p><h4>What comprises the remaining 75% of your portfolio?</h4><p>The bulk of it comes from two other areas. We deal with many of the flagship companies, but this is still a relatively small market in this country. The other area is personal loans for salaried workers, which is a common product that you see in Africa. It is basically an unsecured advance against a commitment from the salary of the individual. Typically, we enter into schemes with employers and divert a portion of the salary for loan repayment.</p><h4>What is your medium-term vision for the future of Zanaco?</h4><p>We want to continue making profits as we are a publicly listed company and need to recognize our responsibilities to shareholders. The ultimate game is to continue growing the business. The country is not overbanked, despite the high number of banks, although a major part of the population remains unbanked, whereby it appears as though there is no market. I am optimistic about the potential. It is also important to balance our portfolio more to achieve a better spread of our business. I would like to see us continue to grow in agriculture, and to develop more of a balance between the retail and wholesale markets in order to mirror the economy as much as possible. Improving customer service remains the greatest challenge for Zanaco.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Zamtel's number of mobile subscribers went from less than 100,000 in 2010 to over 1 million in 2013. What have been the main drivers of this success?</h4><p>I think it is a combination of factors. There was a measure of investment that had never before taken place in the company. Despite being established in the country for a 100 years, Zamtel was slow off the mark when it came to developments in GSM with other players, such as Airtel and MTN, getting in there first. Zamtel was the third company to come to the party, and I don't think that sufficient investment was made in terms of infrastructure. This is a numbers game, which means you have to have the capacity and the coverage. You need both to win. If you are slow in the market that invariably constrains how many people can come onto your network. Being the third provider to arrive cost us dearly. Having said that, the numbers have grown quite phenomenally over this period to where we are today.</p><h4>How important has innovation been to this growth?</h4><p>It has been quite fundamental, since without technology you cannot compete. For example, we are in the final phase of a rollout of over 400 base stations. All of these are 3G high-capacity base stations and are also LTE-ready. As we roll those out to Lusaka, the Copperbelt, and Livingstone, we will decommission the smaller capacity 3G-only base stations and deploy those in rural areas. That allows us to leapfrog our competitors and have a network that is almost entirely LTE ready.</p><div class="quote">“The farmer in the field can get paid with mobile money without having to travel long distances."</div><h4>Is this aggressive expansion plan only taking place in the rural areas?</h4><p>No, it is in both rural and urban areas. A number of the sites we have been putting up replace what exists currently in the urban areas with high technology, high capacity LTE-ready cell sites and also fill in any gaps. If you don't have enough sites, you might find you don't have enough coverage. You need to plug in all those holes to have a more-or-less continuous or ubiquitous coverage over the whole area. Lusaka should have excellent 3G coverage everywhere, and Kitwe, Ndola, and Livingstone should have seamless coverage. You have got to ensure that those are sound in terms of coverage and capacity. Having done that, if the technology you are deploying is also LTE ready, that allows you to leapfrog and start deploying LTE technology quickly, which in turn means extremely fast data.</p><h4>Zamtel is carrying out a huge investment to improve its network. What opportunities do you see for foreign investors in building the telecoms network?</h4><p>That is always there, certainly. Zamtel will have quite a lot of capital expenditure over the next two years. These tenders are normally open to international companies; hence, the opportunities are there for large, medium, and small companies to participate, whether in the supply of equipment or the provision of consultancy services. We certainly need good suppliers from all over the world. We try to get the best technology at the best price. For example, we have equipment from Japan, China, and Europe. It is an open tender process provided you meet the specifications technically and commercially, which is good because it makes it competitive.</p><h4>How would you assess the competition in the telecom sector in Zambia, and how does Zamtel stand out from its competitors?</h4><p>The competition is fierce and aggressive, and tends to go in phases. For example, when we first launched GSM in Zambia, we had big handsets costing almost $1,000 and the rate was around $1 a minute. That was Phase I. We have now have affordable cell phones that an ordinary person can buy for $10. As you roll out your network, the capacity is there and the coverage is there. The cost of the handset has been brought down to a reasonable level; however, there is no point in having a phone if you cannot afford the tariff to use it. Therefore, Zamtel did something that was quite disruptive in the market and had never been done before—we launched a product called the “Real Mahala," which colloquially means “freebee." This product allowed you to have 90 minutes of on-net calls during the day, and from 10.00 pm to 6.00 am you could talk for free to any Zamtel user. We also had a spinoff of that which gave you a 50% discount on off-net calls. As a result, in July and August 2013, we had an excess of 200,000 subscribers per month. These subscribers were ordinary people who had the $10 handsets, but could not afford the usual talk time rates. Our price was only about 50 cents to talk as much as you wanted, and that really was a game changer. People loved that product.</p><h4>Do Zambians move easily from one mobile operator to another?</h4><p>It is not so much a case of customers changing from one company to another, it is more that they double or triple the number of their SIM card. Sometimes the penetration levels are a bit skewed because one person might have three SIM cards. They tend to have a primary SIM, then a secondary one. In that regard, I think Zamtel has been quite effective in the marketplace, and we have seen the benefits accrue. Nevertheless, what is important for us is to have good coverage, good capacity, and make the products and services affordable. The next trend that should happen is that now people have affordable handsets, we want data usage—people on the internet. We need smartphones that are affordable. Instead of smartphones costing $500, if that cost together with the cost of the internet came down, it would bring about a second revolution. The first revolution was carried out quite effectively. Now, the second revolution is to make smartphones and data affordable for even schoolchildren in villages. The whole world will open up if we do that.</p><h4>What is the potential for smartphones in Zambia?</h4><p>There is a huge potential. Even when we look at our traffic statistics at the moment and how our data traffic is growing, it is phenomenal. Similar to the Real Mahala for talk time, we had another product that we just stopped running, which was called Yagemuka Mahala. This product gave the customer 1GB of data free everyday if you enrolled in the Real Mahala. The aim was to encourage people who had never used data before to try it for the first time. We ran this for a period of time and it was extremely successful.</p><h4>Mobile money has been a revolution in some African countries, and Zamtel is about to launch its services. What opportunities do you see for mobile money services in Zambia?</h4><p>We are going to launch something in 4Q2014. The hardware has not been delivered yet, and we are still in the final processes of the contract. I think there are many opportunities, for example in Kenya where m-pesa has been a huge success. The number of people who are unbanked in Zambia is huge, too. If those people can be given products that are affordable and easy to use, such as on a simple phone, we can see the unbanked becoming banked much quicker than would normally be the case. That would be the smart way to go. The traditional way of bricks and mortar branches of the banks in every single place just doesn't make economic sense anymore. This also absolutely helps the national goal of financial inclusion. The farmer in the field can get paid with mobile money without having to travel long distances to the nearest bank and queue up for days.</p><h4>Do you expect the internet penetration levels to grow in the next five years?</h4><p>Yes. If you look at the current figures for data growth, it is exponential, at least on our network. It is very high and I expect that to increase. As we roll out fiber to homes and premises, it will make sure that homes and businesses have internet access. For example, we recently commissioned a government-wide area network, which has put all the ministries together and made a closed network for them on fiber optic. We are providing them with a pipe of 200 MB of internet capacity, which is then distributed to all the ministries. That is growing as the government and ministries use the internet more. Also, what is important is the optic submarine cables that we have on the west and east coasts. It's always been a challenge for us to land that, though, because we are inland. It is a challenge to bring that capacity in from the coast to here. It can be quite expensive. If you are on the coast it is okay, but if you have to pass through two or three countries to bring it here, it starts to become expensive. We are hoping that those prices will also be driven down. Generally, internet prices are going down every year, but they need to go down on the cable and on the inland link.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given Kazakhstan's experience of the hydrocarbon sector, how is it set to strengthen its position as one of the global leaders in the market?</h4><p>The oil and gas industry is not just one of the main sectors of the economy, it has been active for 50 years in Kazakhstan, which aims to become a world leader in hydrocarbons exploration, extraction, and transportation. KazMunayGas (KMG) is, therefore, particularly prominent in this sector. KMG Group is a national Kazakhstani operator representing government interests in the oil and gas industry. It is a vertically integrated oil and gas holding operating in line with international safety standards, and comprehensively oversees production processes from the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons, to refining, processing, shipping, and special services. The company aims to rank in the top-30 oil and gas companies in the world in terms of oil reserves and production. We plan to increase liquid hydrocarbon deposits to 1.413 million tons and oil extraction to 35.4 million tons per annum by 2022.</p><h4>What is the current KMG production status, and how are you planning to increase production in the future?</h4><p>In 2013, KMG Group achieved most of its key targets. For example, oil and gas condensate extraction grew by 6% on the previous year to 22.6 million tons. Gas extraction has grown by 12% to 2.93 billion cubic meters. Approximately 67.2 million tons of oil were transported through the KazTransOil system over the period. In 2014, we plan to reach the 72.1 million ton mark. The major changes in the oil transportation sector resulted from the Caspian Pipeline Consortium's decision to increase transportation capacity. The first stage of this project in Kazakhstan is expected to be completed in 2014. A project to increase the transportation capacity of the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline to 20 million tons per year will allow the transportation of both Kazakhstani and Russian oil to China across Kazakhstani territory. The construction of a third Asian pipeline has also begun, and will allow the supply of an additional 25 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas through Kazakhstan to China. The construction of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent (BBS) gas mainline started in September 2013, and is scheduled for completion by 2015. The estimated capacity of the BBS pipeline is 10 bcm a year. Currently, the volume of gas transported has reached 110,135 bcm (109,189 billion in 2012). There has been some growth in oil refining, too. KMG plants refined 16 million tons of oil in 2013, and this year the number will grow to 17.4 million tons. We have commenced the reconstruction of the Shymkent and Pavlodar refineries. We are also building an aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) production complex at the Atyrau oil refinery, and a bitumen production facility in the Mangistau region. Profits from core business activities have grown by 10% to KZT3.257 trillion. Overall, KMG's net gain rose by 24% to KZT456.8 billion in 2013. KMG paid KZT622 billion in taxes and fees for the year (KZT599.4 billion in 2012). Production growth was underpinned by increased hydrocarbon reserves resulting from successful geological exploration. In 2013, the company concluded a four-year geological analysis of 15 sedimentary basins located in Kazakhstan. Recoverable reserves of liquid hydrocarbons were proven (in 2013) at 811.6 million tons. Production was 50% compensated for by the increase of commercial reserves to 11.5 million tons. In 2013, an exploration well was drilled in Zhambyl, and there is a deep-well being drilled in Urihtau. KMG links the further development of the hydrocarbons resource base with geologic exploration on the Caspian shelf and deep land sediments. In early 2013, after tentatively launching Kashagan, KMG and its partners announced recoverable commercial reserves discovered in two oil deposits in the Kazakhstani sector of the Caspian Sea. The growth of recoverable reserves reached 98.6 million tons, yielding a full 67.6 million tons in terms of the Kalamkas sea reserve and 31 million tons of oil at the Hazar reserve.</p><div class="quote">“Kazakhstan... aims to become a world leader in hydrocarbons exploration, extraction, and transportation."</div><h4>President Nazarbayev set a goal for Kazakhstan to become one of the world's leading economies by 2050. What is the role of KMG in this strategy?</h4><p>The President has set long-term priorities for the development of the oil and gas industry. In particular, increasing production efficiency through the use of innovative technologies and the expansion of the geological exploration of hydrocarbon reserves are focus areas. Through KMG's status as a national gas and oil operator, the company will participate in these activities and set up a technological center named the Drilling and Production Institute, which will become a technological center. The institute will monitor geological and geophysical data and carry out laboratory research in geology, geophysics, and production technologies. Another priority is to increase hydrocarbon reserves through further geological exploration. The results of these studies were summarized in 2013 in an atlas of the potential oil and gas regions of Kazakhstan. The President has also set a goal of building a new (fourth) oil refinery. Meanwhile, the application of regulations will allow for a rebalancing of the remuneration system and ensure a stable workforce. Employees and their families are granted access to a social security benefits system that comprises financial assistance, social allowances, and other guarantees. In line with regulations, KMG employees are granted medical treatment in the event of a work accident, as well as maternity allowance, and other services.</p><h4>Considering KMG's leading position in the national energy sector, how will the company participate in World Expo 2017?</h4><p>It is commonly acknowledged that energy-saving technologies are the future of the sector. All affiliated KMG Group companies apply eco-friendly, waste-reduction, and energy-saving technologies. For example, the implementation of the automatic electricity monitor and control system at the KazTransOil company has resulted in savings of 4 million kWh a year. The use of energy-saving technologies at the Pavlodar Oil Refinery has also allowed for a reduction of electricity consumption by 30.7 million kWh and thermal energy by 39,400 Gcal. Accordingly, specific energy consumption requirements to produce 1 ton of oil have declined by 7.7% and 6.7% for electricity and thermal energy, respectively. There is a gas turbine power plant under commission at the MangistauMunayGas Kalamkas deposit, the capacity of which is 2.45 MW. This natural gas fuelled plant will wholly compensate for increased electricity demand, resulting in cost reductions. Energy-saving practices have resulted in a continued declining trend in energy consumption.</p><h4>What are your international ambitions for Kazakhstan's oil and gas sector?</h4><p>To date, the largest overseas asset of KMG is Rompetrol, operating in a number of European countries. Rompetrol utilizes the most innovative refinery in the Black Sea region and operates a network of over 1,000 gas stations. Through the purchase of a 75% stake in Rompetrol in 2007 and the remainder in 2009, KMG is following a strategy aimed at expanding key European markets with a potential 300 million customers. Simultaneously, Rompetrol has allowed for the creation of an integral well-to-customer cycle, involving the trading and shipping companies of the KMG Group. Our affiliated company, KazMorTransFlot, entered the oil transportation market through the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea in 2012. Unfortunately, Europe's oil refining and distribution sector is facing a crisis, as a result of which we have shifted our focus to the Romanian market.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since 2009, you've been making selective investments according to a set of goals. What results are you looking to achieve?</h4><p>Sanabil was established as a commercial entity, and we are a for-profit company fully owned by the government. At the same time, we aim to play a role in introducing new industries and transferring technologies to the Kingdom, which is one of the company's added values. Today, Sanabil's activities include asset management, which is focused on liquid investments, a private equity program focused on investments in private equity funds globally, and a direct investment program.</p><h4>In terms of your direct investments within the Kingdom, what is on the horizon?</h4><p>So far, we have closed one deal in the Kingdom, and a further one or two are scheduled for this year. All sectors are potentially open for direct investment, but we do prioritize some over others, such as energy, education, and healthcare. We have made one investment in the energy sector, and are considering other investments in the education and healthcare sectors. Sanabil can hold up to 49% of the equity capital of a private company, while ensuring adequate minority protection rights. We also seek international companies to invest in Saudi Arabia. We believe that Sanabil represents a perfect partner, or partner of choice, for foreign companies keen to invest in Saudi Arabia. We can invest up to SAR1 billion in a company or project, and are typically long-term investors, which provides comfort to our investment partners.</p><div class="quote">“I expect 90% of what I'd like to see Sanabil achieve by 2020 is already done."</div><h4>How do you respond to regulatory changes in regard to healthcare and mortgages?</h4><p>There had been a gap in legislation in both sectors you've mentioned. Our shareholder, the Public Investment Fund, is considering investing in mortgage financing companies and has also been tasked with the setting up of the country's real estate refinancing company. I can't go into details, but I can say that we see  great potential in the mortgage sector, and we believe that strategic partnerships with foreign investors are essential in terms of adding value. In the healthcare sector, we are evaluating  two potential investments in Saudi Arabia, and we believe that recent health regulations will make the sector more attractive for investors. In general, we believe that in both sectors the demand is there but that an investor's strategic positioning within the sector and differentiation are the key factors for a successful investment.</p><h4>How will the solar power agreement with SunEdison complement your investments in renewable energy in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>ACWA Power is a project developer and operator of both conventional as well as solar power, while the agreement we signed with SunEdison is to jointly fund a feasibility study to assess the viability of a solar materials project in the Kingdom, and, hence, we believe the two are complementary, although it is as yet too early to discuss the project with SunEdison in detail. In terms of solar radiation, Saudi Arabia enjoys one of the best locations in the world, and, therefore, it seems logical to embark on this project especially given the continuously declining cost of solar power and the improvements in solar power technologies. Therefore, we believe that there is great potential for the renewable energy sector in Saudi Arabia, and for solar power in particular.</p><h4>Where would you like to see Sanabil in 2020 in terms of return on investment?</h4><p>I expect 90% of what I'd like to see Sanabil achieve by 2020 is already done, particularly in terms of HR and the business structure. I would also like Sanabil to be able to conduct all operations in-house, and also increase its assets under management. To date, we deployed a large part of our capital; hopefully, by 2020 the profits we will generate from the existing investments will allow us to expand our investments further and bolster management to enable complete in-house operations.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As of today, 55% of the population lacks access to a regular electricity supply. How is the electricity privatization process going to benefit Nigerians?</h4><p>The capital required to finance the development of the electricity sector is so huge that the government felt obliged to invite significant private sector participation. Indeed, private sector players have been particularly keen to increase generation capacity, in large numbers. We have also seen investors from all over the world seeking to invest in Nigeria. The results have met government expectations, and a much larger capacity to generate, transmit, distribute, and supply electricity throughout the length and breadth of Nigeria is now being installed. Transmission remains the only aspect to be retained by the government for now, and huge sums of money have been set aside to expand transmission infrastructure so that all power generated is distributed to end users. Additionally, the distribution leg has been privatized. Private sector companies know that the best way to increase profits is to ensure that they have more satisfied customers demanding electricity. The fact is that the suppressed demand for electricity in Nigeria today virtually quadruples supply. There will be an expansion of the distribution facilities and infrastructure to reach every corner of Nigeria, whereby all Nigerians will benefit.</p><h4>You have recently signed agreements with General Electric (GE) and the Export-Import Bank of China on power plant projects for small communities.  How do you plan to attract more investors to bring in capital and value-added?</h4><p>Nigeria is one of the top four investment destinations in the world, and the number one in Africa. In terms of return on investment (ROI), Nigeria ranks fourth in the world, providing an average ROI of over 35%, having maintained that level over the last couple of years. POWERCHINA has an MoU with the Federal Ministry of Power to fund and provide financing for 20,000 MW at plants in Nigeria, and GE has committed to installing 10,000 MW, while Siemens has committed to a further 10,000 MW. Meanwhile, Daewoo from Korea is another involved party. All these companies are committed to producing 1,000 MW every year for at least the next decade. When you consider the sum total of these initiatives, all things being equal, we will get to our destination.</p><div class="quote">“Nigeria has the desire to diversify its generation mix. "</div><h4>From a regulatory standpoint, will a specific policy or law be required to incentivize further deals?</h4><p>The government has introduced a policy framework that makes Nigeria an investors' haven. Within the power sector, the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET) company was set up for one primary purpose: to buy power from all the independent power producers (IPPs) that may not feel comfortable about direct sales to distribution companies or to the Transmission Company of Nigeria out of concerns of not receiving payment. However, the NBET will buy this power from the IPPs on behalf of the transmission and distribution companies. Therefore, investors now know that regardless of the amount of power you produce, once you have a power purchase agreement from the NBET, you can't lose your investment. The tariffs have been adjusted and solid profitability is built in without making electricity too excessive for consumers and customers. In addition to the NBET being capitalized, there is also a partial World Bank risk guarantee to support the NBET in the event of its default. Even the African Development Bank is working on doing the same measure, in terms of a partial risk guarantee for the NBET, which confirms that incentives are in place.</p><h4>What is the role of renewable energy in rural areas of less developed infrastructure?</h4><p>Nigeria has the desire to diversify its generation mix. For example, 70% of all power stations are gas-fired, while the remaining 30% comes from hydro-power. If you were to realize production exclusively using gas, then you can't call yourself an energy-secure country. So we are compelled by necessity to seek alternatives, with renewable energy being just such an alternative. Be it solar, wind, or biomass, we are working to incorporate this technology into the network. In fact, for rural areas, the President has personally flagged off what we termed “Operation Light Up Rural Nigeria," where we are using 100% solar sources to power entire communities. Each household and street will benefit from a 100% solar integrated solution. We are also set to add wind to the mix and are working on biomass solutions, although these are more geared at the major cities where a mix of waste elements is available. Then, of course, we are working on small-scale hydro projects. Work has been completed on a national renewable energy and energy efficiency policy, which should see imminent approval by the Federal Executive Council. Meanwhile, solar installations are increasingly cheaper due to technological advances. In rural areas that are not connected to the national grid, and that lack gas pipelines to fire turbines, or lack sufficient wind velocity, we can make particular use of solar power. Nigeria sits on substantial coal deposits, and we are also looking to this fuel as an energy source, although clearly it is not a part of the renewable landscape. In fact, we have signed agreements with companies that are interested in developing coal-fired power plants. The idea is to ensure that in the future 10% of our energy needs derive from coal, at least 5% from solar and wind, perhaps 15% from hydro, and the remainder from gas, as Nigeria currently boasts the eighth largest gas deposits in the world.</p><h4>What are you doing to assure the population that there is a plan at work regarding energy provision?</h4><p>The Transformation Agenda arose at a particularly low point for Nigeria. A key goal of the program, therefore, is ensuring that a larger proportion of the population benefits from electricity supply, and not just in quantitative, but also qualitative terms. Part of the accountability of government involves taking each citizen into consideration and making sure that resources meant for the entire country are spread equitably. That's what the President is now doing, and this will ultimately lead to the success of “Operation Light Up Rural Nigeria." Meanwhile, we are stemming corruption by benchmarking procurements, service delivery, and project execution to global best practices. We are accountable to the country, and the people know it. The Transformation Agenda is working, and more people are getting a regular power supply, with improvements continuously being registered. Our firm hope is that the success of the Transformation Agenda in the power sector can serve as a catalyst for the industrial sector, as without power, industries cannot thrive and develop. Nigeria's power sector has a very bright future. For the first time, the government is focusing on power as a priority. It is now addressing the entire sector from a holistic perspective and working toward the future instead of reacting to a decaying infrastructure. A glance at the country's demographics reveals that industries can begin to thrive on the back of a market hungry to consume, which is all underpinned by the power sector. As we mature and make more power available to our people, we believe that the economy will not be talking 6.5%, but double-digit GDP growth, which is something we are looking forward to.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The IMF's 2009 conference on Africa was held in the context of a global economic crisis. Since then, how does a country such as Tanzania feature in the “Africa Rising" story?</h4><p>When we got together five years ago in Tanzania, Africa's economies were facing adversity as the global economy was enduring its most severe crisis since the Great Depression. When we met in May 2014 in Maputo for the follow-up conference, the narrative had indeed changed to “Africa Rising." Obviously, difficulties encountered by countries such as Ghana and Zambia, or the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, are strong reminders that African economies continue to face many challenges and should continue to build their defenses against all sorts of shocks. But the changes over these five years have been dramatic. Africa's achievements have been remarkable, and the overall outlook for the continent is optimistic. Growth is expected to average about 5.5% in 2014, and to remain strong in 2015 in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Together with other countries in the East African Community (EAC), Tanzania has been very much part of this story: in the past decade, GDP per capita has increased by more than 50% (which is significantly more than the average for SSA); inflation has been kept in check; spending on social programs has increased markedly; macroeconomic stability has been preserved; structural reforms have been advanced; the standard of living has increased; and poverty has declined. Tanzania is an example of ongoing economic transformation for the region. Its exports now include the fruits of great progress in the area of manufacturing, including processed foods, beverages, cement, and textiles, just to name a few. That said, the fact that manufacturing still makes up only a relatively modest share of GDP, employment and exports in Tanzania also show that economic transformation requires the sustained implementation of reforms over the long haul. Tanzania needs to broaden economic reforms to make the economy even more resilient and to ensure that the benefits of growth can be even more widely shared among all Tanzanian people. The fact is that, like other countries in the region, poverty is still high and progress toward the Millennium Development Goals remains too slow.</p><h4>What is your medium- and long-term macroeconomic outlook for Tanzania?</h4><p>Tanzania's economic progress over the past decade has been commendable. The country grew by almost 7% over the past five years, and it is expected to remain at the same level next year and in the medium term. The authorities have pushed for economic policies that have laid the groundwork for the country to transition from low-income status to become a middle-income country. Inflation has been controlled and is in line with the 5% medium-term objective. That is positive, given that the rate stood at almost 20% at the end of 2011. Having said that, there are some issues that need to be addressed. The key challenge is to meet both the government's fiscal policy objectives of preserving space for increased investment and social spending, while gradually bringing the deficit closer to its debt-stabilizing level. This was further complicated in the last fiscal year when revenue fell short of the ambitious targets set in the budget, which led the government to contain spending to meet the deficit target of 5% of GDP. Tanzania now has a major opportunity. If the recent discoveries of offshore natural gas are commercially viable, they could generate significant exports and revenues during the next decade. Of course, further exploration is still ongoing, and none of the potential investors has yet made a final decision on the project viability. But if managed well, these resources can be used to address pressing social problems, provide jobs for the young and growing population, and also to build-up the country's infrastructure. Of course, these are big “ifs." We have recommended that the government establish a transparent framework for natural gas taxation and wealth management, because the idea is to foster long-term inclusive growth and ensure inter-generational equity.</p><div class="quote">“If the recent discoveries of offshore natural gas are commercially viable, they could generate significant exports."</div><h4>What is your assessment of Tanzania's current macroeconomic policies?</h4><p>The progress made by Tanzania so far is in many ways due to the government's prudent policies. The five-year poverty reduction strategy (what Tanzanians know as MKUKUTA II), and the national development plan emphasize support for growth that will reduce poverty—agriculture and infrastructure—while preserving recent gains in social outcomes. We welcome the effort to spur the economy through dedicated plans such as the “Big Results, Now" initiative by accelerating the development of much-needed social and physical infrastructure. During the global financial crisis, monetary and fiscal easing supported by the government's economic rescue plan helped mitigate the impact of the crisis. The Bank of Tanzania's planned transition to an interest rate-based monetary policy framework should help keep inflation expectations in check. Looking ahead, the challenge now is to step up efforts to improve the policy framework, rebuild fiscal buffers, and push ahead with structural reforms in a variety of areas.</p><h4>The IMF's Executive Board recently approved a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Tanzania aimed at supporting the country's efforts to maintain economic stability and to reduce the country's current account deficit. What actions must be taken by Tanzania to achieve these objectives?</h4><p>Over the years, we have worked hard with governments in Africa to reform our lending instruments, and we have also tailored our policy advice to better address the very specific challenges facing the region. The PSI is designed for low-income countries that may not need financial support from the IMF, but seek to maintain a close policy dialogue with the IMF, including Fund endorsement and assessment of their economic and financial policies. The PSI signals the strength of a country's policies to donors, multilateral development banks, and markets. Tanzania's PSI, approved by the IMF Executive Board in July 2014, aims to support the government's medium-term objectives. These include the two issues that you have mentioned; the maintenance of macroeconomic stability and the preservation of debt sustainability. Other objectives include the promotion of more equitable growth and job creation, two areas that are crucial to Tanzania's future development and prosperity. With regard to macroeconomic stability, priority actions include strengthening public finance management in order to improve the efficiency and transparency of public spending, and the further broadening of the tax base to mobilize revenues and reduce aid dependence. In addition, the PSI is intended to strengthen the framework for monitoring and managing fiscal risks. Through these efforts, the program aims to provide the fiscal space to allow for spending on infrastructure and priority social programs. The government has identified infrastructure, education, health, and essential social services as priority spending areas for creating jobs and fostering inclusive growth. The program will also support efforts to ensure that potential revenues from offshore natural gas, which may start accruing in the 2020s if a large-scale gas project goes ahead, benefit all Tanzanians.</p><h4>The growth rates of emerging economies that have been very active in the EAC region, such as China, are slowing down. What is the likely impact on countries in the region?</h4><p>Weaker demand in emerging market economies, which has helped boost African growth since the global crisis, is a matter of concern, as it is for the rest of the world. It could adversely affect Africa's commodity exports, capital inflows, and investment and growth prospects. The impact of slower growth in emerging markets and China in the coming years will be felt differently across countries. Those that are highly dependent on commodity exports and capital flows will likely be negatively affected. On the other hand, those countries with closer linkages to advanced economies may benefit from the change in sources of growth at the global level. To guard against the risks from an emerging markets slowdown, it is important that African countries tackle emerging vulnerabilities and implement policies that build up resilience to external shocks. This includes mobilizing domestic resources and strengthening fiscal positions in some countries, and seeking political inclusion and security in others.</p><h4>Despite more than 5% average growth over 10 years, countries in SSA do not seem to be making progress in terms of creating jobs for their youth or reducing poverty and inequality. Why is this the case?</h4><p>Let's be clear. There has been progress. For example, the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day in Africa has fallen significantly since 1990. That is the result of the robust growth that so many countries have experienced. But extreme poverty remains unacceptably high. And you are correct that high levels of inequality persist. There are various reasons as to why there has not been more progress. Some countries are still facing internal conflict and are struggling to exit fragility. In the medium term, sustained strong and inclusive growth can make a difference. For most African countries, this entails higher investment levels, economic diversification, the removal of constraints to the business environment, and urgent reforms to support job creation. Looking ahead, there are a number of longer-term demographic, technological, and environmental challenges that need to be addressed. For instance, how can we tap into the productive capacity of Africa's youth? How about the evident potential of technological innovations? And, how can we address the implications of climate change for our natural resources? In response, three policy priorities are crucial. These include: building infrastructure, building institutions, and building people. Good infrastructure—energy, roads, and technology grids—is a key foundation to any sustainable economy. Africa must also strengthen its institutional and governance frameworks in order to better manage its vast resources. And of course, the focus should also be put on building the capacity of Africa's greatest resources—its people—with programs aimed at boosting health and education and other essential social services, particularly for the poorest in each country.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the last financial year for Bank Audi?</h4><p>Last year was a good financial year for Bank Audi. Within a challenging operating environment, consolidated assets reached $36.2 billion at end-December 2013, registering a growth of 15.6% relative to 2012. As a result, Bank Audi continues to have an undisputed leadership position in the Lebanese banking sector in terms of all business criteria and to reinforce its position among the top 20 Arab banks, whereby it reported the third highest activity growth rate among top Arab banks in 2013. The growth in the bank's activity was not realized at the detriment of its financial standing. Primary liquidity placed with central banks and foreign banks reached $12.6 billion, representing 40.4% of customers' deposits, an elevated level when compared to regional and global averages. At the loan quality level, gross doubtful loans accounted for only 2.8% of gross loans, with the coverage of those loans by specific and collective loan loss provisions reaching 95% at end-December 2013. In parallel, the Bank's Basel III capital adequacy ratio stood at 12.1% at end-2013, against a 10.5% minimum regulatory requirement. At the profitability level, Bank Audi's net earnings reached $305 million in 2013. The Bank's recent results reflect faithfully the strategic orientations set by management so that the Group remains ready to seize opportunities for the development of activities and expansion in better rated new countries, ensuring added value to all stakeholders within its customers' and shareholders' base. On the back of the bank's recent financial and business achievements, Bank Audi looks at the future optimistically. The Bank is steadily growing towards its objective to shortly become among the most diversified regional banks by both business lines and countries of presence in a regional landscape that still lacks full-fledged, well-diversified regional banks at large.</p><h4>What do you think the ratio of activity abroad to total activity change says about the dynamics of the Lebanese and regional finance sector?</h4><p>You can see in 2014 that 55% of our assets are in Lebanon, down from 71% in 2010 and 88% in 2005, which highlights the success of our cross border expansion strategy despite the overall tough regional operating conditions of the past few years. This means we have 45% of our assets abroad, of which half are tied to our operations in Turkey. Those ratios are much lower in terms of loans, whereby you have 40% of our consolidated loan portfolio only in Lebanon, and the remaining 60% abroad. We would have over 40% of our profits coming outside Lebanon when we normalize the contribution from Turkey from a current negative contribution tied to the acceptable time lag between operating expenses and expected revenues in greenfield operations. As such, the first results of our strategy were quite enticing and encouraging despite the adverse environment of the past three years. We have been able, in less than three years of average activity, to build close to $6.3 billion of regional assets that almost stabilized during the Arab Spring years. Despite the tough conditions that some countries are currently witnessing, the Bank remains dedicated to its regional expansion policy anchored over continuing to grow the customer and account franchise in new markets with potential for high growth in financial services over the medium term. We also entered Turkey at the right time. It was triggered by our view that a presence in Turkey is complementary to our regional presence. The license was provided after the outbreak of the Arab Spring, so it came at an excellent time to compensate for any delay in the revamped business plan. Due to the size of the Turkish market and the fact that our operating model in Turkey is proving to be successful, we will be more than offsetting the relative delay, the end result being considerably to the Group's advantage in terms of assets and earnings growth.</p><div class="quote">“Turkey, Egypt, and Lebanon will represent 90% of the forecasted growth for the Group for the coming three years."</div><h4>What ongoing steps are you taking to build up and maintain your captive market share, and how does this strategy differ between markets?</h4><p>Turkey, Egypt, and Lebanon will represent 90% of the forecasted growth for the Group for the coming three years. In parallel, we have a high-quality operation in Jordan. We would be interested to do commercial banking in Saudi Arabia; however, it has not opened up to players from outside of the GCC, meaning the market would have to free up competition. We have a bank in Qatar that is regulated by the Qatar Financial Centre and not by the Qatar Central Bank. Currently, there are talks that they might merge shortly, which will mean greater flexibility for us. With the outbreak of the Arab Spring, there was a major re-adjustment to our strategy; before the Arab Spring, our aim was to expand in the region to become one of the main regional players—I defined it at the time as cross-selling markets and business lines to capture the market share—but this was before 2011. Up till 2011, we had achieved probably 50% of the set targets; we were halfway to becoming a regional player. We had succeeded in Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. But then there was the Arab Spring, which affected the whole Middle East. To adjust our strategy, we completely deleveraged in Syria, whereby our assets there today represent less than 1% of our consolidated assets reaching $350 million, reduced from $2 billion in 2010. We have adopted a consolidation mode in Jordan. We have also revisited our business plan in Egypt to adjust to the current political environment. Therefore, you cannot consider that the Arab Spring had a zero impact on our previously announced regional expansion strategy. Today, we have shifted toward a much more southeast Mediterranean profile rather than being a deep Middle Eastern bank, focusing on our three main regional pillars: our home market, Lebanon, Egypt, and Turkey, with a fourth pillar which is our private banking business. As such, Bank Audi's development over the coming years hinges around the following drivers: first, consolidating and strengthening its leadership in Lebanon with a particular focus on pursuing asset utilization optimization while reinforcing operational efficiency to enhance a greater generation of productivity gains. The second driver is strengthening our market background and positioning in Egypt, which, despite the persisting uncertainties, remains a core growth market by virtue of scale and abundant resources triggering self-sustained economic and financial growth prospects. And thirdly, we need to secure over the medium term an established positioning in the Turkish market, which still enjoys a large size and high levels of growth in spite of short-term volatility, building a franchise ranking second to Lebanon in term of size and earnings. Fourth, leveraging cooperation and synergies across the private banking entities in Europe, the Levant, and the GCC, while transforming the wealth management operating model, enlarging its geographical footprint, and reinforcing the range of products and services to shore up private banking development at large is important.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the specific reasons for taking on the Qatar Rail project?</h4><p>The main reason is to serve our future generations in the State of Qatar. This is strongly linked to the State's vision for 2030, which is to provide an infrastructure network capable of serving the needs of the people. If you look at the situation in Qatar now, in terms of population and congestion, and compare that to the expected population of 2030, it is clear that, without a robust transportation system, the quality of life in Qatar would be severely impacted. Although we are a small country, most of our population is concentrated in a small and congested area We have an additional 100,000 cars coming onto our roads every year. If you consider that growth rate continuing to 2030, any person looking at this population forecast will agree that, though the State of Qatar is small, it will need a public transportation system to serve the needs of the people. It is not only a rail system. It is an integrated system with rail, bus, and other modes of transport. In addition to that, it is our vision to be the hub for big events. The availability of a public transportation system will help Qatar to serve as a top destination for big events. It will make for a smooth and easy experience for visitors.</p><h4>Were there any specific examples in the world that Qatar looked at for inspiration?</h4><p>Qatar Rail is a greenfield project; a project without the obstacles of existing rail infrastructure. This is one of the biggest advantages we have. That has enabled us to borrow from the best technologies in the transport, rail, and metro sectors. We have borrowed good ideas from Hong Kong, Berlin, Paris, London, and worldwide. We did not copy any one entity or system. We tried to take the best from each example and incorporate it into a model in order to make Qatar's public transportation network world class.</p><div class="quote">“Qatar Rail is a greenfield project; a project without the obstacles of existing rail infrastructure."</div><h4>Besides the Doha metro and long-distance rail, Qatar Rail also operates a light rail transit route to Lusail. How do the concepts differ from each other?</h4><p>We believe that the three projects should be integrated together and that they must complement each other. Metro stations will be connected to the light rail system. It is a very integrated model that will help the people living in, for example, Lusail to utilize the light rail system and the metro together. There is also a station for long-distance and freight. Freight routes will mainly connect Saudi Arabia with Qatar for Phase I. These are all integrated. The light rail and metro will have the same operational concept. Long-distance and freight will have a different operation. We have already brought in expert operators to help us manage the networks efficiently.</p><h4>The tunnel boring machines for the metro arrived in April 2014. Where do you expect the construction of the Doha Metro to be at the end of 2014?</h4><p>We have a plan and we are on schedule. We received eight tunnel-boring machines and have already delivered them to each site. We expect to finalize the main foundation for around 15 stations by the end of this year. By the end of 2014 we will award all the technical-related tenders for the metro. By the end of this year we will have all of the components of the metro. In addition to that, civil progress, which is one of the critical parts for the underground, has moved in line with the plan. According to the plan, the first metro can start its engine in October 2019. As of now there is no indication that we will not be able to achieve this.</p><h4>What are the main challenges in realizing the metro project?</h4><p>For me, the metro is a thousand projects merged into one. The main challenge is that normally around the world you are making an extension for a network that is about 4 or 5 kilometers. Here, we are starting with Phase I, which is around 83 kilometers and spans from North to South and East to West. It is a big challenge to coordinate with all the stakeholders involved. Coordinating this is one of the main challenges. In addition to that, it is a new experience for us since we have never done this before. Interfacing the metro with the civil and systems infrastructure is also a primary challenge. However, we were prepared for that in our plan and we have been pro-active about it rather than reactive. We completed all the land acquisition within two years and we succeeded in mobilizing contractors directly. To be honest with you, this only happened because of the coordination between all the stakeholders. Sometimes, when a high state authority has a vision, you will find that the main stakeholders will work together to deliver this vision. I think the rail project provided a clear example of the main stakeholders and the main management in the State of Qatar working together to deliver the vision.</p><h4>Doha is a rapidly developing city and it is getting larger and larger. How does Qatar Rail take this continued expansion into account?</h4><p>First of all, we have a master plan for what we expect Qatar to be in 2030. Based on this plan, we identified where we should build the stations. At Qatar Rail we focus on moving people from one end to the other. We will move them from office to home and from home to office. That is our main objective. We identify the areas where the demand will be strongest, we find a location for the station, and we figure out how the station will be connected to the larger transportation system in the State of Qatar. We serve all the concentrated locations, including the hospitals, educational facilities, malls, and stadiums.</p><h4>In which specific elements of the Qatar Rail project are you still inviting foreign companies to come in and offer their expertise on?</h4><p>For Phase I, all of the projects will be awarded by the end of 2014. We have a master plan that is split into three phases. So once there is a need for further expansion, we will launch Phase II. Now it is only in the planning stage. That is normal with any rail or metro project. You set up your network, and you will see that the network needs to be expanded every two to five years depending on the demand. In the coming years, the main focus will be on the operation companies and architectural companies to come and fit out the stations.</p><h4>The Qatar National Vision 2030 is pushing the country forward, and Qatar Rail is a very important element of that. How does it personally inspire you in managing this project?</h4><p>To be honest with you, people have asked why we need a metro. Qatar is small. But to have a vision, and know where you want to go helps you to keep the path clear. You know what you want and understand what is required. This provides a clear motivation for any Qatari to do his best to achieve this vision. You should not look at what you need today. You need to think about the future and how you need to serve the future generations, so that the old people can do something good for the state. This is one of the main elements of the 2030 plan. It has shifted the mindset of the people, especially for the management, from operations to strategy. This is one of the main elements of the vision. Before, we did not announce our vision. But once you announce your vision, even the management starts to think more strategically. Now any organization you will find will have a master plan for short-term, mid-term, and long-term planning. This is a key element to improve all of the management in the state of Qatar.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the core focus of your growth strategy at Generali?</h4><p>Generali has been a prominent multinational since 1831. It is one of the oldest insurance companies in the world, with a presence in over 60 countries, including Panama, where operating our own branch we are a 100% Generali entity. The company only has five branches in the world, and Panama is the only one located in Latin America. Our other branches are in Hong Kong, the UAE, Portugal, and Japan. We entered the Panamanian market back in 1970, at first predominantly servicing Italian clients. One of them was Impregilo, a construction firm that had worked on the Panama Canal, as well as other Italian companies with a presence in Panama. Generali established a branch here to provide service to these companies. For the first 20 or 25 years we pursued very low-profile operations. Thereafter, however, we began to develop the company into a renowned entity in Panama. I began my tenure at the company in 1992, when we began to develop the marketing and technical departments, and to conduct a PR drive.</p><h4>What have been your main achievements since you have been here?</h4><p>I would say that Generali's two main strengths are branding and people. And when I say people, I mean that this is a service-oriented business. We sell an intangible product, so everything comes across as a service. We try to have people with a different personal makeup that enables us to differentiate ourselves in the market from the 31 other insurance companies. We also established a sales network composed of 13 agencies and 250 exclusive agents. Our main distribution channel is insurance brokers, and so we operate with both brokers and agents.</p><div class="quote">“Panama is a service-oriented rather than an industry-oriented economy."</div><h4>How would you evaluate the new legal framework in Panama?</h4><p>I think we have made important steps toward the new legislation. Before the latest law came into being we were lagging in terms of where the sector should have been. Now we are more in line, but still have more to improve. This law is primarily introducing greater supervision by the authorities.</p><h4>How do local people perceive the insurance sector in Panama?</h4><p>Not just in Panama, but generally speaking, people don't think too highly of insurance companies, in the belief that whenever you need them they read you the small print. There is an urgent need to erase that image. For example, banks have a much better image than insurance companies, and command greater trust. I think the same is the case in Panama. That said, insurance penetration in Panama is much higher than the Latin American average. In fact, Panama ranks second in insurance penetration after Chile. The Panamanian insurance sector is worth $1.3 billion, a truly impressive figure for a small country. Latin America has very low figures compared to Europe and the US, which spells considerable potential for sector growth.</p><h4>Apart from Europe, which other markets does Generali consider significant?</h4><p>Generali is the third largest insurance company in the world with its main operations in Italy, Eastern Europe, and today is increasingly strong in Asia, especially in China and India. In China, Generali is already the largest multinational insurance company. Other key markets include Germany, France, Spain, and Austria. Our new CEO is placing significant emphasis on our growth in Asia and Latin America.</p><h4>In which sectors are insurance services more required?</h4><p>Panama is a service-oriented rather than an industry-oriented economy. And with no significant manufacturing, imports are substantial. You certainly won't find significant risk in search of insurance coverage here. We tend to insure SMEs in Panama, though there is room for growth in personal lines. Additionally, Panama is witnessing a construction boom of high-rise buildings, and there is some movement in the mining sector.</p><h4>What is Generali's position in the Panamanian market?</h4><p>In terms of premium volume we rank fourth. The two largest companies are local, and are followed by Mapfre, which purchased a local company, placing it third in the running. The top-four companies hold a combined 60% of the market. Our real figures as a whole are much higher, but in compliance with local laws we are required to be compared to local companies. Our results go directly to the balance sheet of the home office, and in those terms we are by far the largest insurance company in Panama.</p><h4>What are your profit expectations for 2014?</h4><p>We expect to generate a profit of close to $10 million with premiums of around $110 million-$114 million this year. I forecast growth of around 7%, which is somewhat down on recent years.</p><h4>How important is diversification in implanting an insurance culture in Panama?</h4><p>It's absolutely crucial. Panama needs to foster a better insurance culture where faith in the merits of coverage leads to a wider uptake. That will depend on the insurance companies themselves, as well as the regulators and brokers. We are all in the same business, and cooperation wouldn't hurt.</p><h4>What are the advantages for an insurance company to establish itself in Panama?</h4><p>The sector has grown to the point where today's 32 companies are to be joined by a further two that have recently been approved. Not surprisingly then, margins have become squeezed, with technical margins virtually at zero. A glance at the figures reveals an industry in growth with a healthy balance between diverse business lines. Yet the bottom gives a less than glowing account of sector performance. I would recommend potential entrants take a good look at the publicly available financials. I expect this to change to a degree because of the cyclicality factor. And yet I foresee sector consolidation over the next five to 10 years through mergers and acquisitions as the pool becomes too small for the fish. We intend to play a role in these developments as the national leader. There is quite clearly an opportunity to make a serious advance in Panama within the next few years.</p><h4>What is your 2014 forecast for Panama for insurance sector and the broader economy?</h4><p>We will experience a general economic slowdown, but nonetheless register important growth when compared to other regional nations. And in terms of the insurance sector Panama will face a major challenge, as coverage of large-scale projects is not renewed. Bonds and construction policies are not renewable, with policies being written at the start of a project. The other challenges to be faced are fundamentals, such as inflation. Rising costs inevitably pressure financial results. And, meanwhile, premiums and rates are static in a climate of stiff competition. We are also facing a lack of skilled employees, which in an environment of full employment is a common problem throughout Panama's commercial universe.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>
