		<url><![CDATA[a-clear-cut-plan]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess 2018 compared to your expectations?</h4><p>In 2017, Montego Bay and St. James had serious challenges with crime, and I had to address that matter upfront. Since January 2018, the parish and city have been under a state of public emergency, and since then we have seen close to a 70% reduction in homicide, which is a positive indicator for Montego Bay and St. James. The men and women of our security forces continue to be relentless in the pursuit of having a safe city and parish. Our citizens have been cooperating with members of the security forces, and without the citizens' input we would not have reached this far. I hope the necessary measures will be maintained in the foreseeable future because our city and country cannot reach its full potential with a high crime rate hanging over our heads. The move by the government is commendable; as Mayor of this great city, the St. James Municipal Corporation will continue to give full support to the government and security forces.</p><h4>What makes Montego Bay unique?</h4><p>There are only two cities in Jamaica, and Montego Bay is extremely unique because of its capacity to embrace visitors and reach out to its people. Montego Bay is like an extended family, as everyone seems to know each other. People of Montego Bay are known to be focused on the hospitality, industry, and tourism sectors.</p><h4>How do you work to promote the city as a strategic business destination?</h4><p>Montego Bay is extremely accommodating of businesses. As a municipality, when investors come in to develop their plans, we do not hesitate to expedite them through the system so that they can start their project. Investors in Montego Bay feel more relaxed in doing business, and as a city we are taking the right steps to give our investors' confidence. For example, we are installing CCTVs across the city. We are in the process of signing an MoU with the owners of the Jamaica Public Service Company, the National Works Agency, and the Ministry of National Security for upgrading aspects of our infrastructure which will bring us closer to becoming a smart city, enabling our police to assess the movement of traffic or the buildup of pedestrian traffic and respond in a timely manner. The security of our investors is paramount, regardless of whether they are local or foreign. There are a number of plans being worked on currently, for example, Closed Harbor property, which covers 26 acres of land, will be built up into a world-class beach park with all the necessary facilities such as a jogging trail, an amphitheater, and a cycling track. In turn, it will become the heart of Montego Bay for both citizens and visitors. In four to five years' time, there will be a complete transformation of our waterfront as we now know it. There are more projects in the pipeline, including more houses and an expansion of the airport in order to accommodate larger planes. In 2017 alone, we saw over 4.5 million arrivals at the airport. Furthermore, climate change is something that we cannot ignore; all the coastal cities will require a fair amount of investments in building sea walls.</p><h4>What are your targets and expectations for 2019?</h4><p>Our target is to continue to grow the industry, educate our people, and make citizens aware that we need their full cooperation to truly reach the stage where we can have prosperity for all. Equally important, we need to create employment, both direct and indirect, and prepare our people for the jobs that will emerge, for example, in the BPO sector. Moreover, we have to continue focusing on preparing our human resources, as that is the only way forward. In one year's time, we hope to complete the construction of the park and the Hard Rock Hotel. As a city, we are doing extremely well under the circumstances, and I expect to continue on the same trajectory in years to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[expanding-now]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the highlights of the Hard Rock Cafe in Montego Bay?</h4><p>Our company manages three Hard Rock locations in Nassau, Grand Cayman, and Montego Bay. We opened the Montego Bay branch because it is a place of interest for Hard Rock International. The city of Montego Bay is becoming a big player internationally, and a Hard Rock Cafe location would be an attractive draw for the city. Since our chosen location had a pool and a beach, we knew it would be the most unique offering in the market. Our location appeals to more than just tourists, and we are in between two great resort hotels, Secrets St. James and Wild Orchid and Breathless Hotels, allowing us to attract a large audience. Another factor is that it is in the midst of the BPO community, which has thousands of employees.</p><h4>What differentiates Hard Rock Cafe from other experiences?</h4><p>Hard Rock Cafe offers great food, outstanding entertainment, and other forms of eco-tourism-based activity under one roof. In general, we offer a number of different activities in several different environments and spaces on the property. For example, we shuffle between live music and DJs and arrange themed activities as well as food- and drink-based activities throughout the week. We have the most extensive menu in Jamaica, which is filled with 24 pages of signature drinks, unique appetizers and salads, world-famous hamburgers and sandwiches, and a solid selection of mouth-watering desserts. We want people to have access to our legendary Angus Beef burger, an item that is available in all Hard Rock Cafes. Equally important, we were able to get permission from the corporate office to add some outstanding local items, such as seafood fritters, oxtail, and curried shrimp, among others. There are over 75 Hard Rock Cafes around the world, but the one in Montego Bay is the only one with a pool and a beach, allowing us to call it the Hard Rock Beach Club. </p><h4>What have been your main achievements in the hospitality sector?</h4><p>Interestingly enough, when we first opened here, I optimistically made a projection that 65-70% of our business would be from tourism or tourism-based activities, and the remainder from locals. However, 45% of our business has actually been from the local community, and we responded by tailoring more events and menu offerings to the local community. We have done several specialized programs that have attracted large local audiences, such as hosting the Miss Jamaica Universe competition and a couple of live concerts featuring major artists.  This can be a perfect venue for hosting concerts outside, as we can accommodate more than 3,000 people. </p><h4>What is the strategy behind Viking Productions?</h4><p>Viking Productions has been around for more than 12 years but most people are not familiar with it because it doesn't operate as a brand of its own. The company only promotes and operates the brands and licenses that it owns. The heartbeat of the company is the Harley-Davidson brand, and at present, it has 24 Harley Davidson outlets in nine different countries in the Caribbean. We also have the license for the Bob Marley brand and operate the retail store at the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>We have been growing aggressively over the past four years, doubling the number of locations from 25 to 54. Moving forward, we will spend more time on increasing same-store sales in 2019. We have spent a lot of time acquiring and building locations in some of the best ports in the Caribbean and are now focusing on maximizing revenue opportunities. We are committed to sending our personnel all over the world to establish personal relationships with our potential business partners. We intend to take the world by storm with great products and great service, so this is only the beginning. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[eyes-on-the-prize]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does HMF help various businesses to soft land in Jamaica?</h4><p>We cover all areas of law, specializing in commercial work and various aspects of law that are part and parcel of a developing economy. Companies need people who can properly advise on the local law and how it works between the different jurisdictions, which is becoming more important as the world becomes more globalized. Modern technology has increased the ease of communication and bolstered Caribbean's status as a great regional destination. Jamaica is well poised for that, with a government looking for growth, progress, and investment. We want to be at the forefront of our profession by facilitating businesses to come here and providing them guidance, understanding, and confidence. This is not only locally, but also with the intercommunication of their own jurisdiction, economic and tax requirements, and their own financial movement. It is our duty, therefore, to protect them and make them feel at home. </p><h4>Which sector is in most need of foreign direct investment?</h4><p>Tourism is an extremely important sector for us, and it is doing fairly well on its own. Jamaica needs to dramatically develop its agriculture sector so we can retain more of the dollars that we earn. This translates into fewer imports of food and services. Additionally, we have a large and capable labor force, which we should be able to use to venture further into light industry, such as assembling parts for televisions. Nevertheless, we have the benefits of exporting to the US as well as to the Caribbean islands with CARICOM. One thing leads to another, and as we develop agriculture, tourism will create more value, at the same time generating more employment and spreading across other industries, which will contribute to a stronger economy. In addition, the mining and energy sectors have tremendous capacity for more investments. </p><h4>How important is diversifying the portfolio throughout Jamaica?</h4><p>It is vital that we create an economic and social atmosphere in the country to attract overseas capital. As for diversification, first we start with the concept of being competitive by thriving on tourism and agriculture. In the past, we used to produce 0.5million tons of bananas and sugar, but at present, we produce around 200,000tons, leaving all the previously occupied lands idle. The country has the ability to produce more but diversification is needed, as putting all eggs in one basket is not a good strategy. With our current labor force and our geographical location, we are in perfectly located to import goods from the south and assemble white goods for export onward to the eastern seaboard of the US. Jamaica has a long way to go; however, we are starting a GDP growth line, which was previously stagnant for 20 years. I like the way the future looks at the moment.</p><h4>What are HMF's goals for 2019?</h4><p>We want to continue to provide the professional, insightful, efficient, and quality legal services in Jamaica that add value to our clients and their mandates. People put their trust in us, and we have to reciprocate that. Furthermore, there has to be growth and production to utilize them to our benefit. Excellence is the key word; we want to continue to be a reputable and experienced law firm in Jamaica. Our team is also poised to guide clients in new sectors and initiatives in Jamaica such as Special Economic Zones, cannabis licensing, privatization, complex mergers and acquisitions, securities and financing, infrastructural development, blockchain technology, mobile banking, cryptocurrency, yacht registration, business process outsourcing, resort development, and dealing with modern regulatory and licensing regimes in all sectors of business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2019, Texaco will celebrate its 100th anniversary in Jamaica, what have been some of the company's biggest achievements?</h4><p>GB Energy Texaco has brought a different dimension to the business by adding new and modern service stations, strengthening the relation with its retailers and customers, and providing a great working platform for its employees. We are focused on retaining our number one position in the market. Additionally, we have more than 70 service stations across the island and we incorporate digitalization and high-tech services to make the customer experience unique. Furthermore, we have been able to the number one supplier of Avjet fuel to airlines coming to Jamaica</p><h4>What have become of the company's plans regarding entering the LPG business and selling asphalt to Chinese companies?</h4><p>LPG and asphalt sales have grown significantly. As the government is investing heavily in infrastructure, we have more opportunities for the asphalt business. In the LPG business, tremendous progress has been achieved and our Yaadman cylinders can be found in almost every Jamaican home. In fact, we are also supplying LPG in bulk to several industries. Most importantly, we launched LPG Auto, providing an economic and environment friendly fuel for automobiles.<br>Jamaica has a great potential to becoming a logistics hub, how is GB planning to take advantage of this opportunity?<br>Jamaica has a strategic location in relation to the movement of cargo coming from Panama to the US and other territories, and because of this, we foresee a potential business opportunity in the bunkering side. We have excellent business relations with the main port and we are looking at opportunities to contribute to the growth of this side of the business by being a powerful and reliable supplier of fuels, which is a key component of the logistics sector.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the local initiatives that you are supporting? </h4><p>Throughout 2018, we have been working with the Tourism Linkages Network to provide connections between producers and buyers to increase the income of tourism dollars for local communities. In addition, we have developed a program where each of our service stations selects a school nearby and helps them with basic needs. Such initiatives show communities that we are supporting and contributing to their growth.</p><h4>In May, 2018, GB Energy Texaco Jamaica hosted its annual retailers conference to discuss about the issues and future of the group. Which were the main outcomes of the conference?</h4><p>The conference was a great success, as it involved presentations of public and private sectors, giving our retailers the chance to have a clear picture on how we are bringing first world service stations to Jamaica. Our retailers, as entrepreneurs, are now seeking for great locations around the island to expand our presence and provide an excellent customer experience to all Jamaicans.</p><h4>Are you planning to expand your operations?</h4><p>Definitely, as a group we have been recognized as a Caribbean company that is reliable and has the capacity to work with all segments of society. This has opened the doors for us to participate in the expansion of energy consumption in the region. In fact, we believe that there are many opportunities as the markets are evolving and we are expanding our reach to enter new markets.</p><h4>What targets or expectations do you have for the 2019?</h4><p>2019 will mark Texaco's 100 anniversary in Jamaica. With this in mind, we are working on improving our network in terms of size and image as well as our participation in many new energy businesses. 2019 will be full of celebrations as we will show gratitude for the loyalty of the Jamaican people and we will be there by their side in promoting growth and prosperity. What's more, we will recognize everyone that has worked with Texaco in Jamaica and we will have several activities to embrace our appreciation for their work and efforts. 2019 is the year of consolidation of our market position, as we prepare for the next 100 years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights in 2018?</h4><p>Our main highlights were the forging of new partnerships and the development of new key products. We are focusing on several main areas, including software development, and as we are a geospatial company, we do a great deal of work in environmental sciences, software development, and human and social sciences. We are focused on issues such as social justice, crime, violence, and health. This results in analyzing the correlation on the issues approached. Furthermore, we organize certain security activities in specific areas for determined lengths of time, as well as human behavior and human activities. </p><h4>Which initiatives captained by MGI are you particularly proud of?</h4><p>I am particularly proud of the staff we have developed. We have seen the development of a cadre of young Jamaican geoscientists who are able to see the world differently. At MGI, the staff is able to see the world not just as maps, as would traditional cartographers, but where maps are a tool, similar to a technological application. We want maps to be as important as words in the public space. In terms of tangible products, we are pleased about the JAMNAV product that we developed. It was originally built on the Garmin platform, a worldwide leader in personal navigation devices. We own the data and every single road and point of interest, allowing us to build an independent, private database that is accessible to outside stakeholders. This allows us to manipulate, model, project, remove or add, and cluster anything on demand. By controlling the database, we are not dependent on any third party permissions.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about MGI's expansion strategies?</h4><p>We have already expanded into several different Caribbean territories in two main areas. One is the environment, especially on issues such as climate change. So far, we have done work in more than six territories, and that figure is growing. Also, we have been working with governments and multilateral partners on developing tools to assess their own products and determine the viability of a particular project. Since a small island can be affected by climate change, we have to look at the impact on roads and better design them based on what to expect. Another element is crime, and we have been working with the Belize police on this issue. This will likely expand into road safety, mapping crime incidents, and other elements. We have the ability to translate a system into data-poor environments, harvestable data, and standardized and non-standardized data. We want to make a plan without ignoring the facts in front of us: mindset is exportable to any data-poor country or non-standardized system in the world.</p><h4>Who are your main partners to reach these expansion goals?</h4><p>We recently signed an MoU with a large global engineering firm out of the Netherlands. It wants to enter the Caribbean and has partnered with us, mostly related to climate change, focusing on, but not restricted to, the coastal zone. It brings the experience as well as capacity and reputation. We have also partnered with a major Canadian firm that is also doing work in the Caribbean as well as a British firm, IMC Worldwide. Furthermore, we have had excellent multilateral and bilateral relationships with the World Bank, IDRC, and IDB. There have also been more projects on traditional, academic-type work associated with Oxford University, my alma mater, as well as with Tulane University in Louisiana and the Eisenhower Fellowships Network, a global leadership program. All these partnerships and collaborations give us a global reach in terms of best practices and networking.</p><h4>What is next for MIG?</h4><p>We will grow the regional contributions of this organization in 2019. At present, we are focusing on the environmental sphere, looking at threats such as hurricanes and droughts. Other than that, our flagship local project for 2019 is about solid waste. It is an ambitious project aimed at cleaning up Kingston Harbor to help the mangroves and ecosystem. In short, 2019 is about the environment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights of 360 Recycle Manufacturing so far?</h4><p>Undoubtedly, one of the main highlights for us is introducing the five stages of recycling to Jamaica. Jamaica used to collect and export waste rather than use the waste locally to create goods and services. We pioneered a zero-waste approach to waste management. We are most recognized for the fact that we have created an economy out of recycling that puts recycling in the hands of normal citizens; one does not have to be a large-scale recycler with funding to purchase large properties and big equipment. Now, communities can do their own recycling as well, and the common man can earn a living from in it in a value-added way.</p><h4>How does the company manage to be predominantly self funded?</h4><p>With the circular approach, we are able to create products that can compete with regular and conventional products on the market by using a composite material. It is a combination of waste products such as plastics, paper, styrofoam, sawdust, and glass used to create a composite that has a lighter weight than regular concrete. We add an esthetic value to our product to help them stand out in the marketplace. As people become more aware and companies become more focused on becoming green partners, projects like playgrounds, school facilities, and parks will be funded. Recycling is a five-stage process that begins with collecting, then sorting, processing, manufacturing, and selling. If products are not being sold, the cycle ends. Therefore, the fact that the products are being sold by us, we can show the loop taking place.</p><h4>How would you describe your client profile in Jamaica?</h4><p>Our clients include corporate sponsors, foundations, schools, and regular end users. We consider all of our customers as partners, because they close the loop in the circular economy; we advocate that they recycle with us. We ask them to partner with us in protecting the environment and local youth by purchasing from us. Our partners also sponsor projects, such as providing a community or school with playgrounds, bins, or street side planters. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[competitive-energy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights for Neoen in the Caribbean and worldwide?</h4><p>The last half of 2018 was rather exciting for us. In summer 2018, we surpassed the 1GW threshold of capacity in operation and under construction in Australia, where we reassessed our number-one position as an IPP. In October, Neoen successfully raised EUR697 million through its IPO on the French market. In November, we started the operation of a 189-MWp in Australia and closed the financing of a 140-MWp solar project with 3-MW battery storage in El Salvador. Neoen targets 5GW capacity in operation and under construction by 2021. In Jamaica, Neoen is currently working on the construction of a 51-MWp solar project. Based in Westmoreland, this PV farm called Paradise Park is mainly owned by Neoen, alongside Rekamniar Frontier Venture and MPC Capital. Once in operation, Paradise Park will deliver to Jamaica the cheapest electrical energy ever made available in the Caribbean region.</p><h4>What are your ambitions in Jamaica?</h4><p>Jamaica was one of the first countries Neoen started its overseas activities. We are enthusiastic about the market here, as it enjoys outstanding resources in terms of renewable energy, notably sun and wind, and appears to have a strong potential for electricity cost reduction with a direct impact on the final consumer. There is a great deal of room to improve the renewable energy share integrated into the grid. We intend to remain one of the leading green IPPs in Jamaica. We are one of the leading experts in terms of storage integration. We are the developer and owner of the world's largest battery currently in operation, which is 100MW/129MWh and is based in Australia with equipment provided by Tesla. The electricity we sell is green and competitive, but also reliable. It is a key differentiating asset for the energy security of the countries we are based in.</p><h4>How do you produce cost-competitive renewable energy?</h4><p>Our Paradise Park project was the winning project of 19 bids in a competitive tender launched by the Jamaican Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR). It will deliver to Jamaica the cheapest electrical energy ever made available here or in the Caribbean: USD0.085 per kWh. In each and every tender, we can never be certain we can produce the most competitive energy because it depends on many features, though Neoen, for many reasons, enjoys a sound track record. Among others we can highlight our develop-to-own business model, our strong expertise, and our environmental and social commitments to local communities. For example, in our latest Mexican tender, Neoen won the biggest project with a 375-MW PV farm.</p><h4>What are your expansion prospects related to the goal of operating and building a 5GW capacity by 2021?</h4><p>Neoen is active in more than 11 countries and equally balanced across Europe, Australia, and the Americas, the last currently having more projects in the pipeline than in operation or under construction. We expect to keep roughly the same breakdown of activity in the coming years, with more projects in the Americas. Hence, we will launch the construction of our 375-MW PV farm in Mexico in 2019, as well as the first of our two 101MW-each PV projects in Argentina. In El Salvador, we launched the construction of a 140-MW solar project, with a total of 244MW in service and under construction there.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>In Jamaica, we plan on starting our Paradise Park project in 2019. On a broader basis, we will pursue strong growth in all the countries we currently are active in. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the award you received for environmentally friendly exhibit product during Expo Jamaica 2018?</h4><p>Solar Buzz felt extremely proud of this achievement. We enjoy being a part of the Jamaica Manufacturer and Exporters Association's expo because its members are the largest users of energy on the island, so we work with many of them to help reduce energy costs. Being nominated and subsequently winning that award at the expo was a great achievement because it put us on the map with other manufacturers. We truly want to have an impact, not only on solar energy, but also on a company's bottom line to help them—and thus Jamaica—be more competitive in the region and worldwide.</p><h4>Are there any partners that help the company achieve these international standards?</h4><p>When we started out, I formed a strategic partnership with a company in Florida, which played a great role in guiding us early on, especially with training. I would lean on it for design advice on some of our initial larger jobs, and it would come down and train our staff two to three times a year. It was extremely important to have a larger company that was willing to come and do projects with us, and still does. It introduced us to technology, skills, and real expertise that we may not have necessarily learned so early on. I am never afraid to ask for advice and partner with other companies to make sure our clients are satisfied. The better our reputation, the better the range of clients we are able to work with in the future. We don't seek to rush and grow the company; instead, we execute each job properly from start to finish in line with international and local regulations, so our reputation has grown through word of mouth.</p><h4>Do you have any other strategies to increase the market share?</h4><p>We have partnerships that will increase our sales. We are in talks with more developers, which are now becoming attracted to the idea of including solar when they build. We want to get them to the point where they not only design a roof that is solar friendly but also install solar in the project from the beginning. This way, clients can buy a house with pre-installed solar energy solutions. </p><h4>How would you assess the performance of solar energy companies in Jamaica so far?</h4><p>There are a few companies that have done well. The majority does not focus on high quality. It is always more expensive, and the culture here is such that people always seek to pay less for something. In order to stand out, we have produced a high-quality product and let people know that they are putting in a system that is guaranteed for 25 years. Therefore, it is usually not worth the risk to just choose your solar company on cheapest price. The focus needs to be that you are guaranteed to recover your investment in the time frame promised, which means having a system that works. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights for Yaadman in Jamaica?</h4><p>Yaadman is GB Energy/Texaco's partner in Jamaica's cooking gas market. GB has not been in the LPG business in the past but is making a big push for LPG in Jamaica, including auto LPG and power generation. Additionally, we are entering the market with larger-sized cylinders and selling them for the same price as their smaller counterparts. Instead of an 11-kg cylinder, we are introducing a 12.5-kg cylinder that will provide the consumer with approximately three additional pounds of LPG. Another differentiator is that we are experimenting with the blend of propane/butane that we are using. For us, bringing that differentiator to the market will give people more value and cooking time with the same amount of gas.</p><h4>Is using LPG fuel for vehicles a way to embrace environmental changes in Jamaica?</h4><p>Absolutely; it is a cleaner fuel so the resulting emissions from one's vehicle are reduced. Economically, it is also great for the people of Jamaica as the cost to fill up your tank with LPG is approximately half the cost of traditional auto fuels. Based on the current cost of the LPG conversion kits, consumers will likely realize a payback period of less than one year. Jamaica should continue to look at all environment friendly technologies, such as electric cars.</p><h4>How is the partnership with GB Energy increasing the market share in Jamaica?</h4><p>GB Energy/Texaco brings a brand recognition and level of experience that is second to none. We will leverage the long-standing credibility it has established while also building loyalty for a local, Jamaican-owned LPG distributor. We are also introducing more technology and analytics into an industry that has traditionally been very low-tech. To that end, we are partnering with GB's partner Amber Connect to tag all our cooking gas cylinders with special RFID tags. There are many advantages to this, such as inventory control and maintenance. If we can see when a customer started using the cylinder, we can analyze the history of the customer and make fairly accurate predictions for when a new cylinder will be needed. As a result, this will add a great deal of credibility to us as a company. The use of analytics and technology is exciting, and GB's leadership is highly motivated in deploying this technology across all its markets.</p><h4>Are there any priorities to go to more parishes and territories?</h4><p>We plan to serve the entire country, starting with the western and northern parishes. We want to be strategic and not follow all of the traditional distribution and deployment models that have been used by our competitors in the past. Moving forward, we will look for innovative and cost-effective ways to distribute gas around the island. We may be looking for miniature filling plants or even depots where there is a high population density to justify the investment. In the end, we are counting on using local distributors and dealers and leveraging the loyalty they have built in their distribution networks over the years.</p><h4>What are your targets and expectations for 2019?</h4><p>Over the next two to three years, we are looking at capturing 20% market share of the entire domestic cooking gas market. From there on, we will work on increasing our market share incrementally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[success-through-efficiency]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main focuses for JPS in 2018?</h4><p>Our number-one focus has always been safety. Safety is paramount in our sector, and we have been working to ensure safety in all areas of operations. Some of the safest companies in the world also have some of the highest efficiency levels. There is a great correlation between these factors. This leads to our second focus, which is to be the most efficient organization possible. For JPS to be successful, it needs to deliver energy at the lowest possible cost to its customers so they can be competitive locally, regionally, and internationally. That is why in 2018 we invested approximately USD116 million to improve Jamaica's electrical infrastructure, providing better service to our customers. To date, this is the highest level of investment in Jamaica's energy sector in a single year. We have also focused on technical and non-technical losses. Power losses in Jamaica stand at about 27%, which includes both technical and non-technical losses. In the technical area, we have implemented a number of projects, including voltage standardization on our distribution feeders on the north coast. On the non-technical side, almost 20% of all the power we produce is stolen, which is a major challenge. Our anti-theft strategy is multifaceted and includes the use of technology and analytics to identify the more sophisticated cases of electricity abstraction; account audits and investigations; removal of illegal throw-up lines; partnership with the security forces for the arrest of perpetrators; and the implementation of community intervention programs. Moreover, we installed 100,000 smart meters in 2018 to improve our efficiency.</p><h4>Do you plan to expand throughout Jamaica?</h4><p>We are currently constructing our 190-MW power plant at Old Harbor, which will operate on natural gas as its primary fuel. This plant is being built, at a cost of USD330 million, to replace older generation capacity that burns heavy fuel oil and is not as environmentally friendly as natural gas. The new plant will also be almost twice as efficient. This will help improve the economy, as well as the environment and the overall performance of JPS.</p><h4>What are JPS' strategies to continue to increase its market share?</h4><p>As other power plants come to the end of their lives, we will replace them with modern plants. We are also looking at where we need to go with renewables to capitalize on Jamaica's water, wind, and solar resources. At present, 11% of Jamaica's energy comes from renewables, and the long-term goal is increase that to 50%. We are currently looking at a few projects that could take us to the 20-25% range. On the non-renewables side, it is about maintaining the fossil fuel fleet and converting from oil to natural gas, which is much cleaner.</p><h4>How is JPS using technology to bring new and better services?</h4><p>Technology is a big part of our present and future. We are putting in smart meters that will automatically send us data if the power goes off at a particular location and enable customers to check their electricity consumption online. We are also putting in smart street lighting, so we will know immediately when streetlights have gone off, and we will also have the ability to dim them to save energy. In the last few years, we have significantly expanded our customer service contact points, primarily as a result of feedback from our customers, who want more options and greater convenience in doing business. As a result, we have an expanded online customer service team that serves our customers via Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter 24/7. Additionally, we are working to improve our mobile app, which currently has nearly 20,000 subscribers. In terms of billing, we have introduced a pre-paid option for electricity, which has enabled users to save up to 30% on their bills. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights of the current year?</h4><p>One of the highlights is our further expansion into the market. The renewable energies market has picked up significantly, and the government of Jamaica has been organizing more tenders. The market has never been this prosperous over the last 15 years, as far as renewable and alternative energy is concerned. In 4Q2018, we focused on completing most of our contracts, although a few of them will still be in progress in 1Q2019. In the past, people were not certain or confident about renewable energies, though public awareness is growing. The government is determined to produce 50% of the nation's energy from renewable sources by 2030.</p><h4>Where is the market is heading in terms of solar energy?</h4><p>Solar energy will continue to grow not only because it is a technology that has proven itself, but also because it is financially viable. The government has also facilitated solar energy's growth by issuing licenses for feed-in tariffs. In the past, the bureaucracy surrounding the issue was complicated, and no one knew much about it, while the public utility company was simultaneously trying to slow things down. At present, however, everyone is embracing solar energy—including the public utility company.</p><h4>What has been the key to moving forward in the industry?</h4><p>The private sector has played a great role in driving the industry forward. APS is considered as the pioneer because 15 years ago, there was no interest in this business, as solar panels were costly. We stayed committed to the technology through thick and thin and are here to stay and see the market grow even further. There will continue to be a rise in similar companies as well, and there is no doubt that the market will continue to grow.</p><h4>Are there any incentives to continue spending in other parishes?</h4><p>If energy costs and entry requirements for the industry are lowered, this industry can transform the economy in the long run. Economic growth is what Jamaica needs right now, and our industry is pushing to positively contribute to national growth. What is more, interest rates are now lower than they were three years ago, which means there are lower rates available for the installation of solar panels. As the economy improves, the government can spend more on youth development activities and programs to improve the welfare of its citizens.</p><h4>How would you assess the performance of solar energy companies in Jamaica so far?</h4><p>We are doing well. One of the most outstanding achievements of Jamaica's Renewable Energy Association was lobbying with the government to increase the involvement of local companies. The problem we currently have is that the entry requirements for tenders that are funded by overseas agencies are so difficult that no local company can ever meet them. As such, the Jamaica Renewable Energy Association has entered into discussions with the government to increase the involvement of local companies, especially when the tender is held by international agencies such as the IDB or grant-funded by the World Bank.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>Our intention is to increase the company's sales by 40%, which is an achievable target. We will be diversifying our product line in 2019 to surpass this goal. In fact, we have already embarked upon working with a new energy efficiency product line called SmartCool that will assist in improving cooling and refrigeration systems. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which sector is most in need of FDI in Jamaica?</h4><p>Medicinal marijuana with the support of the Cannabis Licensing Authority (CLA) is a sector with an enormous potential in the export market. Two additional sectors which have been growing as well are business process outsourcing (BPO) and the trans-shipment sector. With the widening of the Panama Canal, there are several opportunities for Jamaica to act as a sorter or assembler of goods for the North American market.</p><h4>What are the most promising sectors for growth?</h4><p>Infrastructure is extremely important, especially the road network, sewage, and water systems. These are mainly in the corporate area and are called our heritage project, as they are supposed to last for the next 40 years. This goes along with solving the traffic situation and improving the services, which would result in an increased density in housing. These improvements will allow city planners to be able to approve high-rise buildings, something that was not the case in the past. In the case of tourism, which in percentage terms may not grow as much as the other sectors, the potential remains to create the greatest increase in the number of jobs. Now, there are also expansion plans for Jamaica's two major highways, north-south and east-west, and the proposed improvement in the highway to St Thomas. These improvements would result in a highway ring around the island. A likely benefit from the improvement could be the greater utilization of our land for agriculture.</p><h4>How important is it to invest and diversify your portfolio in Jamaica?</h4><p>The macro developments have been vital when it comes to reducing debt to GDP ratio and ensuring low interest rates and a stable currency. It is to be noted that in the last five years, the Jamaican Stock Exchange has been the highest performing stock exchange in the world. For years, banks, pension schemes, and a number of financial institutions depended on a high interest rate regime to guarantee returns on their investments. At present, returns on deposits are low, in some instances less than 2%. It cannot be overemphasized how important it is to diversify into stocks, manufacturing, tourism, and other areas of investment. It is important to mention that we also have a strong and reliable court system, as Jamaica has been increasing the number of judges and introducing new technologies to the system. Also, arbitration is a growing area, and we have trained arbitrators in recent years, with an increasing number of arbitrators entering the job market.</p><h4>What is the role of DunnCox to help companies succeed in Jamaica's business environment?</h4><p>Every country is unique in its requirements for doing business. Jamaica has been trying for a number of years to reduce the red tape in doing business and improve its ranking in the global index of doing business. What we do at DunnCox is explain the difficulties that clients will encounter and guide them in the most efficient way to their objective. In a number of instances this involves interfacing with and intervening on behalf of clients with representatives of the government on a timely basis. In all instances, the objective is to achieve what is best for the client in the shortest possible time.</p><h4>How is DunnCox prepared for new digital companies?</h4><p>DunnCox recently embarked on a multi-million-dollar project to change to fiber optic cables and move all emails to the cloud. We are introducing new and improved technologies to be able to offer our clients greater transparency in the billing process and in our recording systems. There are many software and hardware upgrades going on at enormous costs that will push us ahead of the competition by five to 10 years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main priorities as a minister with responsibility for land, the environment, climate change, and investment?</h4><p>The intention with this super ministry was to bring all the major agencies under one scope in order to make decisions and execute projects and policies faster and with greater ease. In terms of my portfolio, I walk a fine line between climate change and the environment together with sustainable development. This is challenging because economic growth and job creation drive the economy, though we have to be mindful about the environment. For example, there was a USD6-billion investment proposed for an environmentally sensitive area for bauxite to build a coal power plant. We refused to allow that project to go ahead on that basis, and it was able to find an alternative fuel, LNG, and the project is ongoing. We are extremely serious about the environment. It is not about job creation and economic growth at all costs.</p><h4>What major land projects does the government have lined up?</h4><p>We currently have about 840,000 land parcels, and of those about 60% are titled while the rest are not. This is a key part of our growth agenda because unlocking those titles has major value in terms of being able to use land for collateral and development. Our target is titling 20,000 parcels of land over the coming three years, with 4,000 in 2019 and 8,000 each in 2020 and 2021. We expect this to cost JMD2.6 billion (USD20.4 million).</p><h4>Can you provide more details on the government's climate change campaign?</h4><p>In 2018, we launched a campaign with the slogan Smart and Steady, Climate Ready to raise greater awareness of climate change among the population and its effects, not only on the country but on the people, while also educating them about what they can do to help themselves. There are three components to the campaign: prepare for change, protect your assets, and preserve the future. In terms of climate change and the provision of water, we have been experiencing significant droughts in too many areas that we did not before. For example, Portland, the parish I represent, has the most rainfall not only in Jamaica, but also in this part of the world. We experienced droughts in 2018, which are unheard of.</p><h4>Will the ban on plastic and polystyrene foam encourage new businesses in Jamaica?</h4><p>Jamaica is pleased to be a leader in this area, and the initiative has substantial support, both locally and internationally. The ban starts in January 2019, and we are in the phase of public education and advertising to prepare people. This will also allow for more environmentally friendly businesses to emerge. We are creating avenues for financing and investing in more environmentally friendly businesses and products through the Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ) and the National Export-Import Bank of Jamaica (EXIM Bank). The prime minister has also announced his intention to make provisions for 100 more garbage trucks in the coming year, which are perhaps more trucks than have ever been purchased over the last 20 years. We are also in the process of finalizing with the private sector a deposit-refund scheme for PET bottles. All the manufacturers and distributors are fully on board, and we should be able to implement the scheme in 1Q2019. Also, we are negotiating to have old tires in landfills and surrounding areas shredded.</p><h4>What are the ministry's goals for 2019?</h4><p>The goal is to continue with growth. Business confidence is at an all-time high; crime is a challenge, though we are finally moving in the right direction. The Prime Minister's strategy and how he has identified certain critical areas, such as infrastructure, crime reduction, and economic growth all allow for a greater ability to spend public money on delivering services and infrastructure. They also create confidence in the private sector to invest, make money, and pay taxes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main highlights of Business Access TV and Wealth magazine in 2018?</h4><p>In 2017, we were on the verge of entering the Caribbean. One of the main highlights for Business Access TV is that it is currently distributing the platform to the 13 territories it currently operates in. With our magazine, we landed a big victory with the product. For the 35th edition of the magazine, we partnered with the Private Sector Organization of Jamaica (PSOJ) to do a special on the last set of inductees to the PSOJ Hall of Fame over the past 25 years. We will be the first to incorporate all 25 inductees in one publication, and it will become a keepsake.</p><h4>Who are the main sponsors and partners that have played a part in your success?</h4><p>For Business Access TV, Gary Butch Hendrickson, the chairman of National, was instrumental. I had asked him if he would be willing to give the channel more support and told him about On Point; it was expensive to launch it at that time. He immediately said yes, picked up the phone, and called the marketing department. From that conversation until the end of the sponsorship, he provided all the support he had committed. That helped us launch a program and prepare a channel and kept us going when business was slow.</p><h4>What are your main strategies for social media?</h4><p>We want to cut up content to put some of the more interesting or exciting news on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram. We also do live streaming so that people can watch developments on our channel from anywhere in the world. We also want to develop an app that can keep users connected to the content from anywhere. We currently stream three programs: our news, On Point, and Wealth magazine; however, we want to reach the point where we are streaming the channel live.</p><h4>What other activities do you engage in?</h4><p>Early in 2018, my partner Ryan Reed and I launched a company called Growth Tech. That company won the contract to provide Wi-Fi services on Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC) buses. We also provide Wi-Fi for different tour companies across the island, as well as hospitals, courthouses, and fast food chains. We want Wi-Fi to achieve the same status as oxygen: free for everyone and available everywhere. On that note, we have launched a digital agency, Bumblebee, to support Growth Tech. Anyone who wants to do business with Growth Tech must first handle it through Bumblebee. It offers various social media services and products, including the management of social media accounts and Wi-Fi advertising. These are the two latest ventures I have been involved in aside from the TV and the magazine. In addition, I also own the second-largest spa in Jamaica, Adam and Eve Day Spa. At present, we are planning a massive investment to expand that brand. The hospitality business is big in Kingston, dominated 70% by women. In 2019, we will have large plans in that area.</p><h4>Do you have any potential partners in mind to strengthen your digital operations?</h4><p>The two major players in terms of telecommunications in Jamaica are Digicel and Flow. We partner with both of them in different ways to ensure the quality and sustainability of Wi-Fi in both the mobile and fixed spaces. In order to connect to Wi-Fi, people will have to watch an ad. The plan is to grow our services to other countries in the Caribbean, and we plan to roll out these services throughout the Caribbean. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main benefits of being a member of the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce?</h4><p>From its formation in 1779, the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce has been a strong advocate for the country's business community. Today, it continues on that path, as a network of like-minded firms and individuals who share the common objective of advancing the country's growth. As an institution, it functions as an effective lobbyist and advocate for sustainable and business-supportive legislation and regulations and for the simplification of business processes through the removal of disincentives; it supports the facilitation of trade and commerce both in the domestic market and in cross-border transactions; and it champions the establishment and growth of businesses of all sizes and across the widest spectrum of industries. As a proud member of the International Chamber of Commerce, our members benefit directly from an ease in developing potentially rewarding linkages with a worldwide network of businesses as well having access to the ICC's outstanding thought leadership in such areas as arbitration, training, corporate governance, and on many others.</p><h4>What can be done to bring more investment to Jamaica?</h4><p>We need to move more quickly to improve our ease of doing business. We still have some way to go—even though useful interventions have been made in recent years—to create an efficient and business-friendly environment. Access to capital is also important. The stock market has done well, though small businesses, which are an engine of growth, need better access to capital.</p><h4>What are the most promising sectors?</h4><p>Growth has been pronounced in recent years in both tourism and BPO. However, the objective indicators suggest that there is considerable room for growth in agro-processing (including marijuana-based products) and ICT, to name a few. I would also suggest that the stock market, which has been one of the world's best performing in recent years, should also be seriously considered.</p><h4>What about traditional investors looking at Africa and Latin America?</h4><p>We have seen some interest in both directions, vis-í -vis a number of the entities that, when they think developing markets, are now realizing that perhaps the Caribbean should be in their investment mix. This is one of the reasons why there has been so much focus here on positioning ourselves as a logistics hub and are now developing Special Economic Zones, as we are well-placed to be just such a processing and distribution center. At the same time, we are also encouraging our Jamaican firms to reach further afield, beyond our traditional comfort zones of the North America and the UK, to strengthen trade with Latin America and Africa. At present such trade is small, but we think there is enormous scope for growth.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>We will continue to work alongside the government in a number of different private-public partnerships to address trade facilitation, taxation, exports, and greater participation of the MSMEs in infrastructure development and the re-vitalization of downtown Kingston. The chamber has always been focused on growth and will continue to prioritize working with the government and private entities to spur growth, whether that export- or infrastructure-led growth. We are also focused on revamping the income tax structure for Jamaica, so it encourages increasing investment towards growth. The development of downtown Kingston is also important to the JCC. We consider Downtown Kingston one of those rare gems that the government and the private sector should be investing in.</p><h4>What are the two top benefits and two top challenges of investing Jamaica?</h4><p>The two main benefits would be our advantageous location vis-í -vis the north-south and east-west—via the Panama Canal—shipping routes followed by the significant investment that we've made in our infrastructure. Which respect to challenges, we still have too unwieldy a bureaucracy that impacts the ease of doing business and an uncompetitive corporate tax structure. JCC has prioritized both of these in our lobbying and advocacy agenda. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main trends in the health industry impacting Olympus America de México's business at the moment?</h4><p>The challenge has always been improving the preventive side of diseases. But there are successes. In the US, for example, the number of people who have survived colon cancer is now at 1 million. We can aim for such prevention in Mexico. Now in its 100th year, Olympus has built its business on imaging and now is branching out into therapeutics, so that with the good visualization our scopes offer, doctors can now also insert devices—from snares to balloons to valves and more—for new and exciting minimally invasive procedures.</p><h4>What is Olympus America de México's star product?</h4><p>At present, our 4KUHD System—an endoscopy visualization and display system that provides four times more information than conventional Full HD imaging systems—has had the biggest impact. The difference between our and other 4K products in the market is our imaging technology. Starting from the endoscope and going all the way to the screen, we have 4K resolution. Other products in the market do not have 4K resolution. Olympus Corporation established a joint venture with Sony, and this venture has helped us continue to develop better products. Our 4K imaging product uses a 55-inch screen, so one truly feels like one is looking into the body. This means one has a better chance at viewing even the tiniest lesions, which is extremely important for specialists in these fields. It is truly a great tool for doctors, and they are extremely enthusiastic about the detail they can see in the images our product produces.</p><h4>What other areas would Olympus America de México like to expand into?</h4><p>We need to reach every single doctor. We started with major private and public hospitals; however, our goal is to reach every doctor and even the smallest hospitals, because there are needs in other regions outside the main cities that we need to cover. We are working to increase our participation and knowledge around the country and our installed base. At the moment we are looking at how to group smaller regions together to create a market that is more attractive to enter. Our go-to-market strategy is key in such a situation, and we must also decide whether we want to sell directly or have a presence in an area through a partner, such as a distributor. The challenge is having the right people who can have the technical discussions with the doctors about the benefits of our products and be supportive with all the added value we provide as a company.</p><h4>How will the new administration's plans for healthcare in Mexico impact your business?</h4><p>The beauty of the products we promote at Olympus America de México is that they can be used for prevention as well as the treatment of existing medical conditions. We keep hearing that the new government will focus on primary care, which is important for detecting and identifying diseases early. We also hear the new administration will focus on the level of the general hospital rather than on higher level specialties. This administration has been vocal in terms of finding savings, so the business models governments have used in the past need to be adapted. Recent models have focused on more cash flow in the healthcare system to treat more patients. That is a great model, and we do not know how it will be improved or modified by the new government. In regards to our public-sector customers, integrated services were an important part of our business alignment, and we have to wait and see how this system changes. Another consideration is budget allocation.</p><h4>What factors brought Olympus to establish an alliance with Sony?</h4><p>The excellence of Sony displays combined with Olympus' superior ability to capture images made the alliance very natural. We have projects with Sony in the medical field that have been extremely successful. Olympus Corporation has also made some acquisitions, such as Image Stream and Spiration. There are also changes happening across the company that reflect its global nature, including people from different disciplines and nationalities being promoted to the leadership team at the executive level. This is an interesting time for the company. We have frequent visits from our colleagues in other regions, as Mexico is an important market for Olympus. Our responsibility is to present the opportunities available in Mexico and the benefits of being so close to the US. Mexico is a great strategic location globally and is moving toward being a stronger democracy. I am hopeful that we as a corporation can support this new government to improve the economy and the country's credibility. This is part of our responsibility as well.</p><h4>What is Olympus America de México's current market share, and what are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>Globally, in the endoscopy business Olympus has around 70% of the market because we are pioneers in this field. In Mexico, unfortunately, we do not have reliable hard data on our share of the market. Olympus had to retreat from the market for a while because of the tough economic situation in 2012. The situation is improving, though. We recently renewed our strategy with a focus to re-enter the market directly and to leverage our position. We are well recognized in the market and have truly re-positioned ourselves. In addition to introducing new products, being close to our customers and end users is extremely important. We want them to understand the safe and effective uses of our technology and related procedures. At Olympus, we are committed to contributing to society by making people's lives healthier, safer, and more fulfilling. That is our story.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Operating Since 1971]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[fernando-salazar-chairman-ceo-cesce]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are CESCE's main activities, and how have these changed over the years?</h4><p>CESCE was founded by a law published on July 7, 1970. We began operating in 1971. The main objective of the company remains the same, which is to cover the risks of Spanish companies exporting or investing overseas. However, CESCE has become over the years bigger and more complex. Originally, we only subscribed insurance policies on behalf of the state. We later started to also work as a private insurer covering domestic and export credit risk and, in this private part of our business, we compete like any other private company. As part of this private business, we acquired INFORMA, the leading commercial information company in Spain, Portugal and Colombia, integrating it into the CESCE Group and into the Dun &amp; Bradstreet network. We expanded our geographical presence throughout Latin America, where we have now seven subsidiaries and we also opened subsidaries in France and Portugal. Additionally, CESCE has been on a digital transformation plan, which is to optimize through digital capacities its operating model and achieve a high level of automatization through the intensive use of advanced analytics. Through this we have achieved more than 95% of our credit risk decisions and 80% of the claims decisions to be fully automated. We have also developed new digital products and services based on a flexible subscription model. Finally, we are working on creating a more digital culture, which is agile, lean and innovative, developing an open innovation ecosystem in collaboration with startups and high tech companies.</p><h4>Who are your public and private clients?</h4><p>CESCE operates through two accounts: the state account and the private account. CESCE is the Spanish Export Credit Agency (ECA), we manage on behalf of the state its credit insurance activity. With regards to this activity, CESCE it is well known in the market for being the insurer of large Spanish engineering projects abroad, such as the Panama Canal, the AVE high speed train which covers Medina to Mecca, and other major projects. Those who use CESCE the most in terms of risk volume are large global Spanish companies, especially in the industrial and construction sector. But keep in mind that we subscribe 1,800 policies per year on behalf of the state, and 1,700 correspond to small operations. Our main clients with regards to the number of operations are Spanish exporting SMEs, for which we insure tens of thousands of euros in short-term credit. Within the private sector account, we insure the payment of commercial credits, for Spanish business; our clients are mainly SMES: 57% of these commercial credits are for debtors located in Spain, and 43% are located overseas. Our private insurance business is highly competitive: for this business we cover up to 95% of the commercial credit, which is the highest rate in the sector, and we normally indemnify in 60 day, which is the fastest in the sector. </p><h4>Against what risks do you protect SMEs, and what is your advice to those seeking to export?</h4><p>CESCE is not a general insurer; it only insures the commercial credit risk for non-payment of invoices, we do this for both the state and private business. In the case of the state account, we insure political and extraordinary risks, insuring non-payment due to acts of Gods, for example, earthquakes, floods and also we cover catastrophic risks like revolution, war or other risks that the client cannot control and finally commercial risks that are non-marketable, normally in emerging markets. Our main recommendation for SMEs is that they need to manage correctly their commercial risk, be it on their own utilizing professionals with the right skills and company information of their debtors or they can transfer this risk to a specialist which is a credit insurance company like CESCE. For us our competitors are not the other credit insurance companies in the market, but the use of self-insurance by the companies. Only 30-35% of commercial invoices are insured. The rest is not insured, which is not advisable unless the companies have the necessary resources, which is not usually the case especially for SMEs. Therefore, our recommendation is to transfer the risks to a specialized company, even more nowadays that risks are growing, making insurance costs affordable. One of the challenges we have in CESCE is for our brand and production services to be better known in the market, for both areas of our business, the state and the private sector.</p><h4>Do you have a strategy to overcome this and make yourselves known?</h4><p>We are developing a strong marketing plan to make known our value proposition to the market. With the current economic slowdown the risk of non-payment increases, hence the need to transfer to a specialist at a competitive cost. What makes our value proposition unique is its flexibility, we offer several layers of service. The first layer is information, through our risk management service. Companies tell us what risks they want to monitor and we connect them to all of CESCE risk management assets, information, analytics and risk specialists. Our statistical risk models are updated more than 13,000 times a day. CESCE has access not only to the best information in Spain and Portugal through INFORMA, we also have access to company information for more than two hundred and fifty million companies through our partnership with Dun &amp; Bradstreet. All of this company information together with all the information CESCE has of its client's payments behavior is processed by CESCE statistical algorithms and offered to our clients as a service. The second layer is insurance, where clients can transfer all of their risks either globally, at a fixed price, which is our Full Cover product, or they can transfer their risk on a one by one basis, depending on their risk appetite, this is our Pay Per Cover Product, the only flexible credit policy in the market worldwide. The third layer is our collection services: in the case that our client decides not to transfer a specific risk of one of his debtors and a non-payment occurs, we offer him all of our capacity worldwide to try to recuperate this nonpayment. The fourth and final layer is financing: here we offer invoice discount services to our clients, either by offering guarantees to banks so they may finance these invoices having CESCE as the guarantor if a nonpayment occurs or directly with CESCE, through a Fund that we created five years ago. This fund has become the second largest source of short-term, non-bank finance in Spain. I believe that CESCE offers a comprehensive, flexible and adaptable service. But irrespective of whether or not an SMEs uses our products he should manage professionally its credit risks.</p><h4>What is the main objective of CESCE for 2020?</h4><p>Our strategic plan lays down several objectives for 2020. We want to be a client-driven company. We do not want to impose a certain solution to our clients; we want to listen to their problems and find the right solution for every situation. We also have to become a highly technological company. Insurance is nowadays a digital business and it is going to be even more so in the future.  We must also be a multinational company, with branches and subsidiaries in the main markets for which Spanish companies export or have activity. We must offer global solutions to our clients. We must also be an employee center company. We want to retain talent and we want our talent to be happy and proud to work in CESCE. We must be a family-responsible company. We have an unblemished policy of equality. We are a mainly a female company, with 60% of the workforce being female. And finally we also have to be a socially responsible company, with sensible policies regarding ecology and social responsibility. In fact, we are, and want to be even more, a leading company in the sector, not in terms of profitability, but in terms of products, policies and services. CESCE is highly innovative. No one has flexible insurance policies, no one does financing like we do, and no one does recovery services to unsecured bills. Summing up, we want CESCE to lead the way in satisfying globally our clients, employees and stakeholders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Progressive Growth]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[progressive-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights of 2018?</h4><p>We have seen entrenched macroeconomic stability and continued reduction in our public debt. Traditionally, high indebtedness has been one of the main challenges of the Jamaican economy. Public debt was probably the highest at 145% of GDP in 2013, but is expected to be around 98% by the end of the fiscal year 2018/19. This continued downward trajectory is good. We have also seen tremendous improvements in fiscal balances, driven by our relatively high primary surpluses in addition to continued downward trends in interest rates. Overall, growth has been increasing over time. In 2Q2018, we saw our highest quarterly growth since 2Q2007, at 2.2%. This positive outcome has been driven largely by certain sectors, such as mining and quarrying. Activities have resumed at one of our main alumina refineries, JISCO Alpart, which has been increasing its capacity utilization rate. In tourism, we are also seeing new hotel rooms, increased flight frequencies, and new routes: new markets are being explored and developed across the board. The agriculture sector has been susceptible to adverse weather impacts, but we have still seen excellent growth. In construction, we are seeing a fair bit of infrastructure development in terms of road works and residential and nonresidential buildings, which can be accredited to broader macroeconomic indicators pointing in the right direction. Many reforms have been undertaken, which has led to progress, especially as it relates to macroeconomic stability. Public financial management strengthening and Central Bank modernization have also been significant features.</p><h4>What have been the latest impacts on Jamaica's growth?</h4><p>We have seen robust growth in the mining and quarrying industry; however, weather-related shocks and a drought in Q32018 have led to a downward revision in agriculture. However, we still expect growth to continue to improve, with those industries being the key drivers. In the labor market, unemployment stood at 9.7% in April 2018 and approximately 1.22 million people employed, the highest level ever recorded. This is against the background of the 2008 Global economic and financial crisis, during which we lost 90,000 jobs up to July 2011. Since then, we have added more than 133,000 jobs, a tremendous achievement. Additionally, in April 2018, 11 out of 16 sectors showed increases relative to April 2017. From a planning standpoint, we are looking at how to build on these successes.</p><h4>How would you highlight the economic prospects for the upcoming year?</h4><p>There is a positive outlook for the country, and the international community has improved our ratings from stable to positive. Anyone looking at the same indicators will share this level of optimism. Our baseline projection for economic growth is between 2% and 3% through to 2022. We continue to build resilience to climate impacts, through appropriate building codes, adapting climate-smart agricultural practices, and adhering to overall areas of readiness and preparation. Our program with the IMF ends in 2019, before which time we want to be in a position of self-sufficiency. In addition to developing a fiscal council, we are also modernizing the Central Bank to be more independent. With that comes increased transparency and predictability in the monetary sector. The capacity of the economy is growing from an overall macroeconomic standpoint, of which the increased investment, particularly in transportation infrastructure, energy infrastructure, telecommunication infrastructure, build out office spaces for businesses, and new and refurbished hotels are critical.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>We want stronger and more inclusive growth, for which the government has established a Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation. For inclusivity, we need to ensure that jobs are created, and that the economy's linkages are strengthened. There are many ongoing developments, the benefits of which we have clearly seen. The build out of infrastructure, especially our road network is also a priority for 2019, in addition to building resilience in the built and natural environment, as well as continued debt reduction. All these remain key to continued macroeconomic stability. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What type of investor interest has the new SEZ regime generated?</h4><p>It has generated considerable interest from investors around the world. When we were putting together the SEZ regime, we studied other jurisdictions to come up with an attractive set of incentives that would entice investors to locate in Jamaica. One of the constraints we found was a shortage of world-class industrial and commercial space. To change that, there is now zero income tax on rental income for developers who seek to build, which is highly encouraging for developers as it inspires them to create the world-class commercial space that we need.</p><h4>How does this system compare to other incentives in the region?</h4><p>When we looked at the different tax regimes offered across the region, there were many different models: some countries offer zero tax policy or tax holidays. What separates Jamaica from the rest of the competition are its transparent policies and the fact that there are no hidden taxes.</p><h4>What are the main challenges you face in forming PPPs in Jamaica for this purpose?<br></h4><p>We have to create the financial structure and appetite to encourage private players to pursue viable means of investing. However, as identified in the Logistics Hub Initiative Market Analysis and Master Plan, there are USD28 billion worth of projects to be completed, including SEZs, ports, airports, utilities, and logistics. Each one represents opportunities that can be PPPs. It is not just any typical public or private investment, but rather an opportunity to forge partnerships.<br>How would you assess the current role that JSEZA is playing in attracting FDI?<br>JSEZA plays a critical role in Jamaica's growth strategy. In terms of attracting FDI, we see it as a critical component. Traditionally, and over the last 10 years, we have averaged between USD400 million and USD600 million in annual FDI. Moving forward, we are looking at FDI between USD1 billion and USD2 billion, or even more. The USD28 billion in future projects falls under one framework of the logistics hub. In addition to that, the tourism and agriculture sectors will play their role in solidifying the economy, registering substantial economic growth and FDI triggered by what we call a logistics-centered economy, which the master plan outlines the road map for.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the significance of Jamaica-Gansu International Industrial Park project?</h4><p>In 2016, the Alumina Partners of Jamaica (ALPART) refinery, which was owned by Rusal, the largest bauxite alumina company in the world, was sold to Chinese industrial giant JISCO. In looking at the opportunities brought on by the rising price of alumina and Jamaica's stated position of becoming a logistics hub, the two countries saw huge potential beyond bauxite and alumina. It focused on a comprehensive industrial development platform and the Jamaica-Gansu International Industrial Park, intended for the Americas and the Caribbean market related to processing and manufacturing of exported goods. With our diversification of energy sources to LNG and Jamaica's geostrategic position, it became an increasingly viable project. With low-cost energy, a great deal of resources in terms of raw materials, an influx of technology, and industrial capabilities that investors bring to the table, this  will have a transformative effect, especially for the western part of Jamaica. </p><h4>What are your ambitions for the future of JSEZA, and Jamaica at large?</h4><p>Our dream is to see Jamaica's economy grow; our vision has always been for Jamaica to become as well known as Singapore, Dubai, or Rotterdam in terms of using logistics as a major part of their economic strategy. As relatively smaller places, they play vital roles in global trade. In comparison, Jamaica sits right in the middle of the Americas, and boasts an extremely strategic position—one that we want to use to grow and benefit not just Jamaica, but the entire region. JSEZA has a critical role in achieving that. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some major highlights of your company's development?</h4><p>In 2018, we marked 55 years of partnership between Jamaica and the World Bank. It has been a long and productive partnership, during which time we have financed more than 140 projects totaling about USD3 billion and provided policy advice and technical assistance on issues that have been priority for the country for years. The World Bank has made a contribution to the progress made in gaining access to education, improving health services and outcomes, putting in place a safety net for people in poverty, extending infrastructure, addressing the impact of climate change, and promoting private sector development and employment. In recent years, we have been supporting Jamaica's efforts to stabilize the economy, reduce debt, and create the conditions for strong and sustainable private sector led growth. Trends are positive: debt has gone down, and Jamaica is following a sound debt management strategy, growth is picking up—although still lower than we would like—and employment is picking up. Jamaica has been improving its business environment. In 2015 and 2016, it was in the top 10 performers in the world for making the biggest number of policy changes, and in 2018 Jamaica moved closer to the international best practice, although more needs to be done. To strengthen competitiveness and promote growth, Jamaica aims to implement reforms to become one of the top 10 countries for doing business by 2030.</p><h4>How is the World Bank committed to making the country more natural disaster-resilient?</h4><p>In the World Bank Caribbean department, we have a 360-degree vision of resilience: resilience includes fiscal and financial, physical, and social resilience. We have been working on all these with Jamaica. Improving physical resilience means having a modern building code and enforcing it—we have been helping Jamaica to develop a modern building code that has already been passed by parliament and needs to be implemented. We have started working with the government to develop adaptable social safety net—a system to swiftly provide assistance to populations that are somewhat above the poverty line but fall into poverty when disaster hits. Jamaica is also among the two countries in the Caribbean that are developing comprehensive disaster risk financing strategies aimed at ensuring fiscal resilience by putting in place the institutional and financial architecture to address the impact of disaster effectively, without jeopardizing fiscal stability and incurring debt. This may include a multi-layered approach to financing disaster risk starting with fiscal buffers, disaster response funds, contingency financing, as well using market transfer mechanisms such as insurance and catastrophic bonds.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>Things are looking up. Jamaica continues to maintain macro-stability through fiscal responsibility, which, coupled with reforms aimed at fostering growth, is likely to produce great results. There are risks: external shock risks have to be managed, and resilience needs to be built to tackle external climate and economic shocks. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main highlights and accomplishments for Portland Holdings in Jamaica in 2018?</h4><p>Portland Holdings' largest asset in Jamaica is NCB, which made an offer in 2017 to increase our share of Guardian Holdings, the largest insurance company in the Caribbean, from 29.99% to 62%. That will diversify our business outside Jamaica and strengthen our Pan-Caribbean platform. In addition, NCB's holding company, NCB FG, acquired an additional 51% of Clarien Bank in Bermuda, taking our ownership to 75%. In 2018, NCB continued to break records in terms of its profits and awards. When I took the role of Chairman of Jamaica's Economic Growth Council on in 2016, Jamaica had an average GDP growth of 0.2% for the prior 10 years and an average of 0.5% for the prior 20 years. In my 2016 inaugural speech, I said that over the coming four years we would have 5% GDP growth. Achieving 5% GDP growth would be transformational for the country. The country is experiencing historically low interest rates and historically high confidence, and we have stability in the currency. Jamaica's 3Q2018 report measured the country's GDP growth as 2.2%, which is halfway to 5%, and we still have a year and a half to achieve our target.</p><h4>What role has Portland Holdings played in developing Jamaica's economy as a whole?</h4><p>Our mantra at Portland Holdings is that businesses must 'not only do well but also do good.' When we took over NCB, it was inefficient and bureaucratic, and the citizens of the country had no confidence in the bank. As a result, we changed the mantra of the bank to “Building a Better Jamaica." This is important because it gives staff members a purpose; they know they are creating a direct nexus between their efforts today and their children's future by building a better Jamaica. Our NCB Foundation is extremely involved in education; 0.5% of the bank's after-tax profits and sales of its key cards, respectively, go to the NCB Foundation. We support all types of educational endeavors through the foundation. We also give scholarships from that fund to hundreds of students every year to help them complete their university education.</p><h4>How did NCB become one of the most important banks in Jamaica?</h4><p>When we first took over the bank in 2002, NCB had a 24% market share in Jamaica compared to its largest competitor, which had 54%. Today, NCB has 44% market share, and its closest competitor has a 30% share; we are by far the largest bank in terms of profits, which are twice as much as our next competitor. In terms of profits, NCB is the number-one financial institution in the English-speaking Caribbean and number two in the Caribbean generally. The strategy behind this success is first building a bank that truly caters to the needs of Jamaicans and is sales oriented. Second, we had to build not just a bank, but also subsidiaries in wealth management, insurance, and capital markets that are world class. Not many businesses have been able to increase their after-tax profits from USD6 million to USD220 million in 16 years, as NCB has. Our strategy was to build up a bank and financial services institution, starting with Jamaica, and from that platform launch to the next concentric circle, which is our Caribbean expansion. We are doing this through Clarien Bank in Bermuda and Guardian, which gives us an immediate footprint in 22 countries.</p><h4>What are your goals in 2019 for both Portland Holdings and NCB?</h4><p>We want to stay healthy and continue with what we have been doing for the last 40 years. We want to remain passionate, stay lean, and not get complacent. We also want to lead by example. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main highlights of 2018 for EGC?</h4><p>In 2016, when the council led by Michael Lee-Chin was established by Prime Minister Andrew Holness, the conversation in the country for the previous four years under the under administration was fiscal consolidation and getting our fiscal house in order to bring down debt. We had a debt of 147% of the GDP at the time, and it was a major concern. The people of Jamaica had to carry a significant burden of an additional JMD60 billion in new taxes over that four-year period. For the new government, the focus was maintaining fiscal consolidation to bring prosperity to the people, which has continued to date, where we identified what we call the enablers and the implementers. They represent the public and private sectors, respectively, and it is mandatory that they create synergies to contribute to growth.</p><h4>What were the main macroeconomic trends that allowed the country to perform outstandingly?</h4><p>We are on the road to recovery; however, there is still a great deal to accomplish. Our last quarter growth was 2.2%, debt reduction is going well, and interest rates have trended downward significantly. In addition, mortgages are down to single digits, and companies can borrow at much lower rates compared to two years ago. Inflation is also low. The government has stayed out of the debt market and has not been borrowing money. In previous years, when we were adding up that debt and pushing it up, the government was always borrowing money, squeezing out the private sector. Now, the private sector has a great deal of money in the local economy, and investors are coming in because interest rates are low, which encourages investment.</p><h4>What is needed to achieve 5% growth in Jamaica?</h4><p>One of the main inhibitors of growth is government red tape, which is why a major goal of the council is to cut it down. Legislation and new regulations are needed, though interference needs to be run underground between enablers. On the other hand, agriculture in 2Q2016 grew by 28% while economic growth was 2.4%, because of drought and then heavy rains that both affected the sector—and growth—in different ways. A key focus of EGC is working closely with the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries (MICAF) to ensure the sector is stable, and more land is given to people who want to grow crops, which is important to reduce imports. Also, we are working with MICAF to collaborate with Israel and Spain as well as to get private businesses to use the mother farm concept, where big investors put in investment and encourage local farmers to feed into that mother farm concept. We also work with academic institutions such as the University of the West Indies, Mico University, the Caribbean Maritime University, Utech, and others to ensure we have more skilled graduates, especially in science and engineering. The council is working closely with the Heart Institute to make sure economic growth happens more rapidly and in a sustained manner.</p><h4>What are your goals for EGC in 2019?</h4><p>We want to boost the amount of people focused on agriculture to increase annual growth, which is why we are looking at Israel and Spain in terms of efficiency. Furthermore, we are looking at agricultural storage as well to produce and deliver a more sustained set of products to the tourism industry and the local market. This is why we need to increase investment locally, which will translate to a reduction in imports. On the human capital side, we will continue to assist and encourage training institutions and the knowledge industry in the country to ramp itself up to train many more Jamaicans; as we hit 2.5, 3, or 4% growth, we will need many more trained Jamaicans. EGC is presently focusing its efforts on the knowledge industry to make sure more Jamaicans receive the training they need to take on higher-level jobs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your perspective on Spanish investment in Jamaica?</h4><p>Spain is the second-largest foreign investor in Jamaica, and the perspective is promising and favorable. We have strong bilateral relations, mainly in the economic field due to the significant investment that has taken place in the tourism sector. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the five largest Spanish hotel chains—RIU, Bahí­a Prí­ncipe, Iberostar, Palladium, and Meliá—established themselves in the north of the island. Secrets and Breathless came afterwards. In 2019, H10 hotel group will open a new hotel with 1,000 new rooms. In the coming years, we expect new and substantial Spanish investments in the tourism sector. Currently, Spanish hotels offer 49% of the rooms in Jamaica in the three- to five-star range, with more than 8,000 rooms amounting to 25% of the total hotel capacity of the island. Additionally, there has been a second wave of Spanish investment in the last two years focused on the energy sector. Spanish engineering firm TSK is building a 190-MW new power plant in Old Harbour, helping to diversify Jamaica's energy mix.</p><h4>How can the dynamism in tourism impact additional businesses?</h4><p>Hotel investment attracts other investments and complementary activities. A clear example of this is in the Dominican Republic, where significant investment in the hotel sector attracted other service companies and increased the arrival of Spanish merchandise and encouraged bilateral trade. In the case of Jamaica, some service companies have been established, such as Grupo ACS and Hospiten. These groups have made investments to complement the hotel sector, and this would not have been the case without the previous significant investments by the hotel chains.</p><h4>What are the initiatives to promote more trade?</h4><p>According to the World Economic Forum, Spain is the most competitive economy in the world in the tourism sector, and there is a great deal to offer. Furthermore, Jamaica will see that leading companies in other sectors such as infrastructure, logistics, and energy can come to the country to invest. We can even think of a closer relationship in the field of agriculture as we have maintained contact with JAMPRO and the Economic Growth Council; it would be highly desirable for Spanish companies to participate in the growth of the agricultural sector through partnerships with Jamaican companies with technology in genetics, irrigation, and greenhouses.</p><h4>In commercial terms, how important is the Caribbean region?</h4><p>For a long time, we concentrated our efforts on the mainland. A year and a half ago, the Secretary of State for Latin America changed the name of his department to Secretary of State for Iberoamerica and the Caribbean, because it is impossible to understand Latin America without the Caribbean. It is important to bear in mind that 70% of the population of the Caribbean islands are Spanish speaking and only 19% of the people of the Caribbean are English speaking. Nonetheless, the Caribbean will play an increasingly important role in Spanish foreign policy due to the growing economic relationship between Spain and the region.</p><h4>What are your perspectives on 2019 regarding collaboration between Spain and Jamaica?</h4><p>We want to continue strengthening the links, as we foresee Spanish investment continuing to increase. As a consequence, some projects have already started, and others are about to begin, such as that of the Princess Group and the Excellence Group hotel chain that is expanding its hotels in Oyster Bay Falmouth. Additionally, there are many companies already established that are studying other investment opportunities such as Palladium Group, Iberostar, and Bahia Principe. In addition, Spanish investments in other sectors, such as energy, will most likely continue. The economic relationship between Spain and Jamaica is growing and becoming stronger while the political relationship has been consolidated through a strategic partnership and high-level visits, such as the visit of Minister Kamina Johnson Smith to Madrid in 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the Mexico-Jamaica relationship?</h4><p>Over the years, Mexico and Jamaica have joined forces in sectors of mutual interest, creating strong partnerships in areas that range from agricultural development and science and technology, to tourism, education, and the arts. Mexico's new government has renewed its will to deepen political ties and economic relations with the greater Caribbean. In this regard, the embassy is preparing for the Binational Commission, a high-level meeting that will outline the way forward in terms of political dialogue, cooperation, and many others.</p><h4>What are the main areas that the embassy works on?</h4><p>Along with the consolidation of its political dialog and economic relations with Jamaica, Mexico has a longstanding tradition of providing technical and scientific cooperation to a wide range of agencies and institutions in Jamaica. Mexico has long provided cooperation for infrastructure projects that have benefited Jamaican communities. For more than half a century, Mexican teams have stood side by side to support their Jamaican counterparts in the most required areas. Mexico is a proud partner in Jamaica's development. Another strategic area in this 52-year partnership is trade and investment. Mexico's economic presence in Jamaica dates back to when CEMEX purchased Trinidad Cement Ltd., the parent company of CaribCement. That was the starting point of what are now large investments by many companies that surpass USD1.3 billion. One of the most interesting things is that we are partners with Jamaica in key industries, such as CaribCement, in the developing of new infrastructure; GAP in air transportation; and the many Mexican hotels and entertainment businesses in Ocho Rí­os, Montego Bay, and Negril.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the numerous Mexican Investments in Jamaica?</h4><p>The unique and warm spirit of Jamaica has attracted major Mexican investments over the last few years. A good example is Grupo Aeroportuario del Pací­fico. More than 10 years ago, GAP was awarded the operation of Montego Bay's Sangster International Airport with its Canadian partner, Vantage. A few months ago, the same Mexican consortium was awarded the tender to operate Kingston's Norman Manley International Airport, and it will start operations in 2019. This influx of capitals marks only the beginning of an increased bilateral exchange between Mexico and Jamaica. In November, Mexico will host a regional B2B Forum in the Dominican Republic. This event is designed to foster regional competitiveness and explore new areas of business within the Caribbean Basin, where Jamaican entrepreneurs can take advantage of the many opportunities this event offers.</p><h4>What are some opportunities that you would like to highlight?</h4><p>On many occasions, our relationship goes beyond our natural borders, where in forums like the UN and OAS, both governments, as partners and neighbors in the Caribbean, actively address regional and global challenges such as climate change, migration, the struggle against organized crime, and the aim to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. These collaborative partnerships only confirm the clear aspirations of Mexico and Jamaica to create a future of prosperity for both countries. In 2019, we will embark on additional collaborative efforts on matters relating to climate change, resilience, and social development policies with local government agencies like PIOJ, CONVEAL as their Mexican counterpart, and UNICEF as an international partner. Aside from political dialogue, economic integration, and scientific and technical cooperation, I want to highlight the importance of cultural exchanges as a key part of our efforts towards mutual prosperity. Initiatives like the Mexican Chair at the University of the West Indies, Mexico's scholarship program, and the Diploma Program in Teaching of Spanish as a Foreign Language provide a framework for increased educational and cultural knowledge and work towards development in areas of common interest. The recent appointment of Jason Hall, an experienced professional in the tourism sector, as Ambassador to Mexico will further advance these initiatives toward a great partnership.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are MICAF's short- and medium-term strategies to increase production and reduce costs in Jamaica's agriculture sector?</h4><p>We are undertaking the largest farm road rehabilitation program in the history of this country, including upgrading and installing irrigation facilities over the next five years. We are increasing our support for small farmers, including access to technological innovations, marketing contracts, and pre-financing. Similarly, we are boosting new investment in the agricultural sector through the packaging of 3,000ha of arable land—previously sugarcane lands—into alternative industrial production for value chain and export production. In addition, our farmers, as MSMEs, will have access to our financial inclusion initiatives, including capital at affordable interest rates. There is strong positive correlation between increase in agricultural output and growth in the economy. Hence, emphasis is being placed on boosting the agricultural sector.</p><h4>How will the national farm road rehabilitation program impact local producers?</h4><p>Approximately JMD450 million has been set aside for the repair of 234.3km of farm roads across the island. The project, being implemented by the Rural Agricultural Development Authority (RADA), aims to, over time, rehabilitate approximately 420km of rural roads across 98 extension areas in 13 parishes. The objective is to provide an estimated 20,000 farmers island wide with direct access to markets, while improving commuting for residents in the surrounding communities. The road improvement works are expected to result in a 3% increase in production, provide employment for rural farm families, benefit registered farmers, as well as attract new entrants to the agricultural sector. In addition, USD100 million has been set aside to assist farmers with basic production-enhancing information, equipment, facilities, tools, livestock, and planting materials under a broader RADA Production Incentive Project. The objectives include strengthening farmers' resilience to climate change, enabling farmers to reduce production costs, diversifying and strengthening the livelihoods of targeted farmers, and developing an effective agricultural database. The targets for 2018/19 include providing assistance to more than 10,000 farmers through rehabilitation of rainwater ponds, procurement and delivery of additional water tanks to farmers, acquisition of agricultural and farming supplies, rehabilitation of greenhouses, and training farmers in excellent land-husbandry practices.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on Jamaica becoming the main logistics hub of the Americas?</h4><p>History has exemplified how strategically we are located. Jamaica is the third-largest English-speaking country in the western hemisphere, and we are the largest English-speaking country in the Caribbean. Our physical location, with the expansion of the Panama Canal, makes us the first port of call for large super vessels. There are many ports in the eastern Caribbean as well as the US eastern seaboard that cannot accommodate those super vessels. We have entered into an agreement with CMA/CGM of France, which now operates our ports. As well, we have enhanced our location as a transshipment port. Jamaica will soon become the pioneer that further connects the Caribbean with South America.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the evolution of fisheries in Jamaica?</h4><p>We have to protect the environment, especially certain species. The alternative is deep sea fishing, the value for which is estimated at USD400 billion in the western hemisphere alone. Moreover, we are opening new markets and looking at new possibilities, such as sea urchins, black eels, and tuna. One new market that we recently opened is exporting live lobsters to China.</p><h4>What are the ministry's goals for 2019?</h4><p>The ministry has three overarching goals: competitive, diversified, and market-oriented agriculture, manufacturing, and services sectors that proactively manage risk; an enhanced local business environment including strengthened national quality infrastructure and reduced bureaucracy, sustainable agricultural health, food safety systems, and food and nutrition security; and protected consumers, competitive economic spaces, and high-quality management systems. In 2019, the ministry will focus on increased domestic production for agro-processing and export production through strategic investment options; affordable financing; production incentives; infrastructure development such as farm road rehabilitation, irrigation systems and agro-processing hubs across the island; and R&amp;D support. Second, we want to implement national trade facilitation and national quality infrastructure programs and increase factory space for MSME production to strengthen the ministry's incubator programs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you recommend Jamaica in terms of developing its cannabis industry and attracting FDI?</h4><p>FDI is an important asset for the cannabis industry, and Jamaica has invaluable experience, now that medical use is regulated and approved. The Cannabis Licensing Authority has done a good job, and Jamaica should be congratulated for the dynamism that the government has instilled in this industry. Jamaica needs to continue to strengthen the value chain with a professional, honest, transparent, and accountable industry, and I am certain the country will have a solid market and, most of all, reach many more markets.</p><h4>What can be done between Jamaica and Mexico in terms of commerce?</h4><p>Jamaica is betting on the right industries; these are the industries of the future; however, there is a great deal to do, not only with Jamaica but also with the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries have been always close to Mexico and vice versa. As well, this is also the case with Colombia, Peru, and Central America, so I am confident the countries in the Caribbean and broader region, especially Jamaica, will work closely to build a robust market. Thankfully, this is starting to happen.</p><h4>What can a robust medical cannabis industry in Mexico do for the country, and what is the biggest obstacle currently holding Mexico back from reaching this potential?</h4><p>What I have seen from other markets is that this is moving fast, and Mexico needs to be on the front, as Jamaica is starting to do. Still, there is a great deal to do, and the Mexican government needs an authority that regulates properly and takes quick decisions to stand in favor of the industry and, most importantly, the interests of the country. This is the reason why the general director of the Mexico's Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risk (COFEPRIS) came to CanEx Jamaica, and I am glad that he brought great news in terms of developing the industry and making it modern by setting high and reachable standards. Things are going well in Mexico, and the General Director of COFEDRIS has made it clear. We need to continue to take away this promising plant from criminals and drugs cartels, taking it away from the illegality and putting it into the hands of responsible entrepreneurs, processors, and the authorities. Drug cartels and their wars kill over 80,000 youth every year, leaving streets full of blood, and the criminals around are grooming new generations with this mentality. This is also related to corruption at all levels. It is therefore a must to rescue this industry. This is the way for Mexico to build a new successful industry, generate wealth, create jobs, and benefit everyone. We need to break paradigms, which is why we have been doing similar events as the CanaMex sponsored by the CentroFox.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the current relationship between the three NAFTA countries and your outlook regarding the long-term viability of the trade agreement?</h4><p>We need to continue to promote NAFTA corporations to produce in each one of the countries so they are competitive with the big enterprises worldwide. We need to bring back the corporations to produce, as the industries need to be international, which will make countries and companies successful, improving people's lives. In terms of the cannabis industry, this needs to be a component of the new NAFTA in order to break boarders and walls and increase understanding. Canada has already approved everything, Mexico has to approve all, and now the US has a great deal to do in the industry, bearing in mind it has approvals at the local and state levels, and there is still more to do in terms of federal and national approvals. So, in order to get the NAFTA fully involved, the US must get up to date. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[together-as-one]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe JAMPRO's new global strategy, in light of the reopening of the New York office?</h4><p>The reopening of the New York office is significant to our global strategy, as we had no presence in the US, which is our number-one global market for investments and for exports. New York is the best place for us to expand the global reach of our overseas offices, which we already had in London and Toronto. We also have a New Market Development department in Jamaica; it covers new markets for us in Latin America and China, which is important for Jamaica from an investment point of view. These offices and our in-market brokers, who promote specific Jamaican sectors for investments, will be JAMPRO's voices promoting the country internationally. This year, we will execute the economic diplomacy strategy, which will operate through foreign service officers. Thus, we have embassies, high commissions, and honorary consuls across the globe that we will work with much more this year, so Jamaica can have a single message to target investors and buyers of product. This will also make them an extension of JAMPRO to give us greater outreach into the international markets. In addition, we will work heavily on our trade show presence to directly target investors and build global relationships, and we will use more digital marketing as a cost-effective way of reaching investors and a wider audience.</p><h4>Vision 2030 aims at making Jamaica a developed country by promoting six sectors. In which sectors do you see these results being realized thus far?</h4><p>All the sectors are definitely experiencing some amazing developments. To start, outsourcing in Jamaica has been experiencing rapid growth over the last five years, with 60 companies and about 35-36,000 people employed in the outsourcing sector. In terms of logistics, our goal is to become the region's logistics center with the actual physical infrastructure build-out. Tourism is growing rapidly, and some 7,000-8,000 hotel rooms are in the pipeline for the coming five years. Kingston is now taking its place as Jamaica's business tourism destination. Mining received a massive investment by JISCO, a steel company out of China. And agriculture is booming, with companies looking at backward linkages. There is a renewed energy to develop the coffee, cocoa, mangoes, and castor industries to meet international demand. We see major local players taking up the mantle of agribusiness, and a few foreign players entering the business as well, with controlled environment agriculture in greenhouses. Agriculture will definitely be one of the shining lights of 2019.</p><h4>What are the goals for 2019 and what are your expectations for the next JIF to come?</h4><p>Upskilling the workforce to attract more diversified and higher value outsourcing contracts is a major priority for Jamaica, and through the GSS project we will be able to achieve that. We also want to make Jamaica the logistics center of the Caribbean, and we want to secure tenants for warehousing projects currently being led by companies like the Port Authority of Jamaica. Attracting investments into Jamaica's Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in Caymanas, Vernamfield, and St. Elizabeth is also high on my goals for 2019. For tourism, diversification is our main focus. I would like to bring more investment into the eastern part of the island in Portland and Kingston and attract more European Plan hotels to provide an alternative to the all-inclusive properties. JAMPRO is also looking to attract more eco and medical tourism projects and attractions to Jamaica to support the growth of the tourism sector. Agriculture is also high on my list of things to develop for 2019 of products such as coffee, cocoa, sweet potato, scotch bonnet peppers, mango, avocado, bamboo, and castor. We should not forget about the creative industries, which are ripe for disruption. Jamaica needs more managers to oversee its recognized talent in music, film, and animation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Bank of Jamaica committed to preserving the purchasing power of the Jamaican dollar in the short and medium term?</h4><p>The Bank of Jamaica has been operating a monetary policy framework referred to as “inflation targeting lite" by the IMF. This means we announce targets for the inflation rate and use monetary policy tools to achieve the targets. However, because we do not have all of the elements, including the legal mandate, necessary to make that framework fully effective, we safeguard the value of the currency by focusing on delivering the target for inflation set by the government after consultations with us. At present, the inflation target for the medium term is 4-6%, and we aim for the middle of that range.</p><h4>What complementary micro-economic policies have helped Jamaica fulfill the IMF's precautionary standby arrangement?</h4><p>We adopted the IMF's metric called the Assessment of Reserve Adequacy (ARA) to determine the appropriate level of foreign reserves to hold. In that regard, our gross reserves at USD3.5 billion exceed 100% of that metric. It is as well to maintain adequate reserves in the context of the government's commitment to a flexible market-determined exchange rate. The foreign exchange market must have the liquidity to meet the demand and supply needs of participants in the market. Added to that are reforms that the Central Bank has undertaken to create and enhance domestic currency liquidity assurance for deposit-taking institutions. With a few other tweaks to our policy interest rate, we have aimed to improve the mechanism by which policy interest rates set by us can be transmitted into the market; we have more work to do on that front. We are also poised to introduce other reforms involving adjustments to cash reserves, liquid asset ratios, and so on. Our focus is to fix, correct, and realign various parameters to be more supportive of the modern, open, competitive economy Jamaica has been building. Some of these parameters have to be reset because the environment has changed, as have the methods of doing things in Jamaica and the world.</p><h4>What about a more independent central bank?</h4><p>The Bank of Jamaica has operated in an independent fashion for more than 20 years. However, the country will not be able to reap the full benefits and dividends of this type of arrangement until the independent operations of the central bank are carried out on the basis of an unambiguous legal mandate and with the proper legal arrangements in place for transparency and accountability. The design of the bank's independence within a suitable context for Jamaica is coming in recently tabled legislation. It will include specific arrangements that look at the independence of the board, such as revisions to the tenure of board members, and staggering board appointments to provide for periodic refreshment of the bank's leadership while providing continuity in governance and insulating the highest level of the institution from the ordinary political cycle. To that end, the government will continue to appoint board members, though there will be limits on the ability of any one administration to completely change the board during one political cycle, creating an institutional sense of independence. There will also be important reforms for the governance of the bank that will include a monetary policy committee to change the decision-making environment from one where the governor is the sole decision-maker to one where decisions are made on a collegiate basis. It will establish accountability mechanisms such as regular appearances by the governor in front of the Jamaican parliament. These reforms, coupled with fiscal reforms, should give stakeholders a reason to believe that Jamaica has addressed and structured a long-term answer to the macroeconomic stability problem, which we have demonstrated can be solved in the short and medium term. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Saudi Payments was established via the merger of SADAD and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency's (SAMA) General Department of Payment Systems. Could you tell us more about the organization's inception?</h4><p>Saudi Payments might be a new organization in its name and branding, though its legacy is about 30 years old, when SAMA started in 1985 with the establishment of the banking technology department. This department focused on developing shared payments infrastructure. SAMA's forward-looking vision for the need of a shared infrastructure was the impetus behind the center. The journey started in 1990 with the introduction of the national payment system mada formerly known as SPAN. In 1997, Saudi Arabia was among the first countries to introduce electronic real-time gross settlement system (RTGS). In 2003, the introduction of our electronic payment platform SADAD followed, in addition to other smaller-sized projects in between. In 2018, we executed a program SAMA had planned for a while: carving out all operational payment activities into a wholly owned subsidiary of SAMA. Saudi Payments was established with the mandate to continue that legacy by developing a national payment infrastructure, serving banks and fintechs equally, and providing the required interoperability to ensure all players have a level playing field. In short, we work on standardization, interoperability, and security, linking everyone and providing infrastructure. Other countries have similar setups, and global institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the G20 Committee have recognized that interoperability and shared infrastructure are the key enablers of fintech. Without these, the barriers for entry are simply too high; it would potentially lead to mega players coming in and eating up the entire market. We prefer a level playing field, and that is still our mandate. Our main KPI is not revenue-based; rather it is based on increasing the number of cashless payments.</p><h4>What strategies do you have in place to achieve the vision of having a 70% cashless society by 2030, as formulated by the Vision 2030's Financial Sector Development Program (FSDP)?</h4><p>To grow from 20% to 70% in one decade is an ambitious objective. From our global benchmarking, even the UK is only about 50%, and it is fairly advanced in digital payments. The most advanced societies are Sweden and Norway. That said, our financial infrastructure in place here, in addition to the high rates of technology by our customers, is promising. The pick-up of near field communication (NFC) payments in 2018 was phenomenal, reaching 40% of all contactless transactions. Within one year, we are reaching western European levels. Saudis use new methods of payment when these are convenient. In addition, mobile payment adoption is high compared to other countries, and it was only introduced in late 2018. There are still some missing pieces, like a faster payments platform. These RTGS transactions are still done from bank to bank via SAMA, which only operates during business hours, and currently, the only method of money transfer. Other countries are more advanced in this respect, allowing for bank-to-bank transfers, almost for free. An updated system will significantly reduce cash transaction, as many of these are P2P and usually low in value. This faster payments platform is our next megaproject and should be up and running in 2020. The nature of this program will require large changes to banking systems; we will adopt a new standard ISO20022. People are moving away from the old SWIFT messaging standard to that new ISO standard. The new systems have proven to reduce cash transfers and unleash a wave of innovation for fintechs thus far in the UK, Singapore, and the US.</p><h4>What is your approach toward mobile payment operators and solutions?</h4><p>Mobile payment is a large category with various different categories and methods. The market needs multiple solutions for multiple challenges. The first differentiator is between payment instruments and wallets. The proposition of the e-wallets is basically a light bank account on people's mobile phone or other that has fewer requirements than a bank would ask. The main purpose for these is doing payments, and there is no lending or difference between a checking and saving account. Mobile payment operators in this domain will continue to focus on the unbanked or underserved segments of society, and we support them with the interoperability, security, and infrastructure. Apple Pay, for example, falls in a different category and is just a method of payment. The account is still linked to one's bankcard, and they are debiting from their account directly. In the past one and a half years, we have worked to enable Apple Pay in Saudi Arabia as part of the existing infrastructure. We have also built mada Pay, which is a similar concept, though for Android users; customers can load their cards and use NFC to securely execute the transaction. There are areas to play for both those who would like to use their current account or card to make payments and e-wallets, which are more convenient.</p><h4>How do you consider your role working with both banks and fintechs, which are both competitors and collaborators?</h4><p>This is challenging because banks have long regarded us as their main deliverer, which we essentially still are. From a regulatory perspective, our objective is to serve everyone. Banks realize that the ecosystem is changing, and they are taking different approaches. Some have already established technology departments. The aim of those units is to find suitable partnerships for banks to partner with fintechs, either directly through capital investment or through partnership or extending bank services to those fintechs. We have yet to see successful examples, though partnerships are being forged and developed. Our proposition is providing a highway where, if a bank wants to expose a service to a fintech, our aim is to be an enabler for that layer. It is better to build one highway to fintechs rather than having every bank develop their own, which will lead to a scattered infrastructure; it also places fintechs at a disadvantage to be tied to only one bank. Luckily, the pie is large, and there is room for all banks and fintechs when they take a customer-centered approach.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>We are focusing on achieve the Financial Sector Development Program (FSDP) targets set by SAMA and the Ministry of Finance. Aside from financial inclusion—which currently stands at 74% according to the World Bank—and the cashless transactions objectives, we are also working on an e-invoicing platform, which has already been launched as a pilot at the end of Q1 of 2018. Such a platform will significantly reduce costs for corporates and SMEs because of all spending on B2B paper-based invoicing. There are advantages for the government as well, as it increases transparency regarding VAT and other taxation. Operationally, we aim to finalize the internal carve out from SAMA and be an independent organization. The ultimate goal is when we do not need to talk about payments because they are seamless.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you come up with the idea of Bounce?</h4><p>When looking at sport for youth in the region, we saw limited options. We love the concept of children, the community, and young adults getting fitter and healthier in an entertaining way, and with trampolining becoming widely recognized as an Olympic sport in Sydney 2000, we felt the time was right. The indicators all came together, and we decided to bring it to Qatar. One area we focus on is schools. Schools, similar to Bounce, try to find fun and innovative ways to educate kids on complex topics such as Newton's laws of gravity, and there is nothing cooler than learning this on a trampoline, with the added benefit of getting them fitter at the same time. In Qatar, we have already had about 25 schools and several thousand students visiting us.</p><h4>How are you working to attract new partners, and where do you add value?</h4><p>We met with a Qatari partner interested in sponsoring the idea and bringing it alive locally. He has been an incredible help, and like us is passionate about the health and wellbeing of the Qatari community. The company brings in a great deal of expertise on trampolining as a sport, the entertainment aspect, and the know-how of running an entertainment business. When there are thousands of Qataris coming in every week, it is quite an act to ensure they can come here and have a great time while being safe. We spent a great deal of time figuring out how to bring the brand to life in the right way. It is about the music we play, the people we hire, how we train them, the atmosphere we create, and the flow of the place. Trampolining is in our DNA, and this sets us apart. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the hotel developed since its establishment in Qatar?</h4><p><strong>MOHAMED CHEBIL </strong>The Curve Hotel opened its doors in 4Q2016. And within the short period of our operation, in 2017, we were among the top-10 ranked hotels in Doha. We not only capitalized on being a new property and a fresh brand, but also made sure that the vast experience of our staff was reflected in the service provided to our guests. From the start of our operations we have aimed to live by our tag motto, which is “the place to embrace the city." We do that by being customer oriented and by making sure that guests have significant memorable experiences and feel like they have a home-away-from-home on a daily basis.</p><p><span></span><strong>HANY GHANEM</strong> Best Western is one of the leading franchise businesses worldwide with over 4,200 hotels in operation. We are well known for affordable prices, which is what makes Best Western unique. Having an international chain attracts loyalty because most customers nowadays are looking for a hotel where they can have a loyalty program or get points and stay anywhere in the world. Our hotel has helped us gain a great position in the market, as we are located a five-minute walk away from Souq Waqif, a three-minute walk from the Corniche, and under 15 minutes from the airport by car. We are close to the business area, and thus enjoy a great base of corporate customers.</p><h4>How would you assess the impact of the blockade on the tourism sector of Qatar?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MC</strong> The primary challenge that the blockade brought to the hospitality industry was that the increased supply became more evident, as more new hotels and hotel apartments commenced operations, while the market suddenly narrowed. Our primary target market consisted of corporate executive managers, which was also a minority in the market. We widened our reach to include sporting events, airlines, diplomats, and the state sector, as well as tourism mainly from Oman and Kuwait as well as residents of Qatar. Through our efforts to promote our brand, we have increased awareness and generated positive feedback from our guests. In return, we are able to manage our high occupancy without affecting our rates.</p><p><span></span><strong>HG</strong> We have recovered well since the blockade. It had a major impact at the time, being a sudden decision, and we had to rethink our means of retaining revenue to keep our hotel operating. We were struggling in 2017 but were back on track again in 2018 as a result of the efforts of the government and the tourism sector. The focus today is not only on rooms, but also F&amp;B. The government found ways to attract different markets beyond the GCC for the long term, such as providing visa on arrival for 80 nationalities, and is keen to attract the Chinese, Indian, and Russian markets. As a result, we have ensured that we have employees trained in many languages, including Chinese, Indian, and Russian.</p><h4>What are your plans to maintain healthy visitor numbers?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MC</strong> The Curve Hotel sustains its principles of providing a consistent high level of service to ensure continued dynamism in terms of visitor numbers. It is more important to retain existing guests, which represent stable business. This luxurious and modern hotel transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary with its amenities and special offers as it allows guests plenty of opportunities to indulge and relax. It is an ideal place to settle in as a resident, or alternatively simply enjoy for a short stay, meeting a diversity of lifestyle needs. We are also taking the opportunity to promote individual facilities available at the property through separate promotions such as the rooftop pool, well-equipped gym, and the Skinsation Spa.</p><p><span></span><strong>HG</strong> Best Western is keen to attract the expatriate business. We are keen to have a variety of options suitable for different nationalities; we have an Irish pub, a Chinese restaurant, and a newly opened Filipino restaurant. We sponsored the Pakistani main event for National Day and received an award from a well-known social media platform for Filipinos as the Best Filipino Preferred Hotel. This is a standard we must maintain in 2019. We will continue our efforts to tap diverse markets, such as China, Russia, and Iran. Locally, we will focus on corporate accounts, and as we approach the World Cup there will be an increasing number of events and visitors. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Hertz's major developments?</h4><p>Almana Rent A Car-Hertz was established in Qatar in 1993. Hertz specializes in short-term rental. The company offers various packages, such as Super Cover, internet connection (MiFi devices), GPS, child seats, and additional driver, in addition to chauffeur-driven service and corporate deals. In Qatar, we had to enhance the rental car business as per the market requirements in order to meet our customers' needs. We also developed a long-term lease option for companies, for whom Hertz offers brand-new vehicles with the provision of all facilities at their premises, such as Hertz outlets, which are small workshops for maintenance and routine car. These workshops are operated by a team that is made up of a fleet supervisor, drivers, cleaners, and mechanics. Comparitively, Hertz's quality control and fast service differentiate it from the rest of the competition.</p><h4>How would you assess Hertz's fleet in Qatar in terms of maintaining it in line with market trends?</h4><p>Quality control and safety are our major features and motto, and as an international franchisee, we have rules and policies. As part of the standards of Hertz international for franchisees, the maximum age of vehicles is 24 months. However, in short-term rentals, if a vehicle reaches a high mileage, it will be de-fleeted even if it is less than a year old. Furthermore, our short-term rental fleet frequently undergoes thorough inspection by our quality control team. Ensuring customer experience and security are our concern and responsibility, and we are committed to guaranteeing them.</p><h4>What will be Hertz's focus in Qatar for 2019?</h4><p>At Hertz Qatar, we have to find and create opportunities rather than wait for them. With that in mind, there will be a fair bit of potential in 2019, as another international franchisee under the Hertz umbrella will join the group. This will come as a strategy to expand our share in the market between both multinational and local rental car companies in Qatar. In 2019, Hertz will focus more on premium fleet vehicles that embrace a superior and advanced quality service. Furthermore, the new franchisee will also provide excellent fleet while maintaining affordable and competitive prices for both categories. Strong growth also requires strong management, and we are doing our utmost to ensure that we are planning effectively and strategically for growth, accounting for the needs of all stakeholders, and using the most advanced technologies in the process. Technological advancements, along with the expansion of leading car rental companies in developing regions, will foster demand for car rental services, especially as the 2022 FIFA World Cup inches closer.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate user experience?</h4><p>We evaluate it based on user research data. Before we introduce a new service, we carry out surveys and conduct focus groups to further tailor the service and adjust it based on that feedback. This is a continuous process to ensure that our programs keep adding value. We also receive ample feedback based on our daily interactions with the library's users. Our librarians work with users to understand their specific needs and to guide them through our resources. Another similar example is for users researching science or medicine, which may not be accomplished through books alone. The latest work in such fields is often found in journals and conference proceedings, which may not be in print but in electronic resources. </p><h4>How is QNL preserving Qatar's intellectual heritage?</h4><p>The national library is responsible for preserving the intellectual heritage of the nation. The legal deposit is one where a copy of each book or journal published in a certain country is deposited in its national library for the purpose of preserving it for the future. A book published today about Qatar will be extremely important in 100 years, it will tell us much about the people, history, and culture of the time when it was produced. Another way intellectual heritage is preserved is through the curation of data of digitally published material. While we preserve the print and some of the digital information about Qatar, we also plan on preserving TV and radio programs. These are the elements that distinguish the mission of a national library from academic and public libraries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the opening of the National Museum of Qatar shape its cultural landscape?</h4><p>The launch of the National Museum of Qatar is one of the most anticipated museum openings globally, and we are eager to welcome patrons from March 28, 2019. The National Museum of Qatar is envisioned to become a hub of learning for the public, students, and museum professionals. It will redefine the role of a cultural institution, providing the conditions for discovery to thrive through dedicated learning spaces for children, in-depth archival materials for museum professionals, and spaces for the public to gather and interact. Importantly, being situated in the heart of a public realm that is taking shape around a key civic quarter, it will connect some of Qatar's most cherished cultural institutions, including the Museum of Islamic Art and the Art Mill project. Together, these reflect the wider urban, civic, and cultural development of Qatar and its capital.</p><h4>How was the architectural design of the National Museum of Qatar conceived?</h4><p>The National Museum of Qatar is inspired by the crystalline architecture of the desert rose, which symbolizes the life of the Qatari people between the desert and the sea and the transformation the country has gone through in the recent past. At the heart of the new National Museum is the historic royal palace of Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani, a building of great significance to Qatar and its heritage and one that has embedded itself in the collective memory of our people. It has been painstakingly restored and preserved for future generations and will make up a key gallery space in the new National Museum.</p><h4>To what extent has Qatar Museums' Artist in Residence program influenced Qatari artists?</h4><p>Under the visionary guidance of Qatar Museums Chairperson, Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, Qatar Museums renovated Old Fire Station to create a residency program to support artists in Qatar and provide a platform for creative exchange. The Fire Station rapidly became the heart of Qatar's flourishing local art scene where young artists come to create and interact. Many of the artists who have gone through the program, approximately 20 every year, credit the opportunities afforded to them at the Fire Station to work with local and international peers with inspiring new approaches to creating art and expressing their creativity. Another key aim of the program is to become an interactive space not just for artists, but the community as a whole. The Fire Station has collaborated with local entities and organizations on a range of activities including workshops and collaborative projects designed to engage all those involved in the program as well as the wider community.</p><h4>How do you work to promote arts and culture among the population living in Qatar? </h4><p>Education is a pillar of our society, culture, and economy, and investing in education will ensure our continuous advancement. As such, we work to instill the importance of art and creativity in students from an early age and have worked closely with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education to develop curriculum for schools across Qatar that includes a focus on art. We also work directly with teachers from across the country on what will work best for their students and in their classrooms and incorporate our world-class museum collections as tools in classroom learning. We see an impressive number of students walk through our doors on a daily basis as part of school trips. MIA alone welcomes over 150 students each day on average. Across the broader community, we seek to interact with all those who live in and visit Qatar as part of their everyday lives through everything from public art pieces installed around Qatar, to how we cross-promote our institutions and exhibitions across our museums and other properties, to supporting young artists on a grassroots level through programs like the Fire Station Artist in Residence. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your plans to boost e-commerce in the country, especially locally sourced e-commerce?</h4><p>Abu Issa Group was one of the first Qatari companies that started in e-commerce five years ago. However, we did not do it in the Qatari market, because the market is extremely small. We used our expertise in retail to adapt to e-commerce. We started in the US, the biggest market for e-commerce. We opened a flagship store in New York for one of our own-concept brands Mosafer. This store would complement online shoppers, and there was a physical store where shoppers could have direct contact with the product. We plan to increase the number of flagship stores in large cities in the US. After the US, we target two other large e-commerce markets where there is even more room for penetration: China and India. Qatar is early from a consumer perspective. However, we have plans for the consumer market that will be put in place by mid-2019. They will target more consumer products and not luxury brands. We have a strong distribution network of consumer items, which can be used more to establish an e-commerce platform in the country. For example, people will be able to order groceries online.</p><h4>Through uniPharm, the group is present in the healthcare market. How are you helping advance this sector?</h4><p>uniPharm is a distributing company of pharmaceuticals, OTCs, home healthcare products, health and beauty aids, cosmetics, confectionery, private label, and seasonal products. The healthcare sector is moving toward more home-based type of healthcare. Service to home will play an important role in the future of healthcare in Qatar. For example, uniPharm is working to provide devices for kidney cleaning treatment. Instead of a patient going several times a week to the hospital, which can be difficult for senior citizens, they can just have the treatment done at home. In addition, given the current direction toward more in-country production, uniPharm is developing capacity to produce basic pharmaceuticals in Qatar.</p><h4>A solid share of Abu Issa Holding's business is in Turkey. What are your expansion plans?</h4><p>Our experience investing in Turkey has been great. We have found a dynamic market of 80 million people, which means consumption capacity, as well as the right talent and partners to deliver our offering. We will have a physical presence in Istanbul's new airport, which has a capacity of 100 million passengers per year, and this will significantly benefit our group. Additionally, in 2017 we expanded to South Africa with the opening of two new luxury fashion boutiques located in Johannesburg. To continue our international expansion, we seek to intensify our presence in the US and penetrate China and India. In total, we are currently present in six countries.</p><h4>What are the priorities for Abu Issa Holding in 2019?</h4><p>Strengthening our own brands is one of our priorities. Given the current consumer trends, there is no need to be an extremely well-known brand to target high-end consumers. With our brands, we put in a great deal of effort to give them the right perception and features to reach the relevant consumers. Some of our brands include Mosafer, Karisma, or Liwani, which are product and consumer focused. Apart from that, we will focus on distribution to reach more clients in a quicker way. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did your professional history help form the foundation of Place Vendí´me?</h4><p>I have worked with large areas of land and mixed-use developers, both here in the Middle East and Australia before that. While in this region, one of my main mandates was to go around the region and find good locations for mixed-use developments. Location will always remain a key factor in real estate. This is perhaps more important because the model being developed in the Middle East over the last 10-15 years has been based on a retail, leisure, and entertainment destinations rather than just a mall and hotels. Place Vendí´me is one such destination. Experience tells us that once the location is right, the access, parking, and layout are the next big issues to get right. Hence, when I got the opportunity to join the Place Vendí´me team five years ago, the first thing we did was look at this project primarily from those perspectives.</p><h4>What will make this development successful?</h4><p>Typically, a mall of this scale is called a super-regional mall. From a master planning perspective, the best location for these malls is on the arterial roads ideally in a newer part of the city where you will not be confined by congestion issues, especially traffic. A mall like this can generate 4,000 cars in and 4,000 cars out at peak times, and we have to be able to manage this. We saw there was great planning for Lusail, and it was less than 10km from the center of Doha. It was a new master plan, we had some flexibility, and it was a government developer. It ticked all the boxes from a security of tenure perspective and was very well laid out and designed. We also noticed that the North of Doha was underserved in terms of major retail components, and the retail market in general was growing in Qatar. All the ingredients for success were there. Our development is a 230,000sqm mall with up to 585 retail and F&amp;B outlets, state-of-the-art cinemas, an 18,000-sqm family entertainment center, as well as fountain and laser shows at the central entertainment amphitheater. We have also developed two five-star hotels, Palais Vendí´me, a luxury collection hotel, and Le Royal Méridien, plus a serviced apartment complex, Le Royal Meridien Residences. This will be the essence of commercial mixed-use development and will be the retail, leisure, and entertainment place to be, not just in Lusail but in Qatar.</p><h4>Why was United Developers uniquely equipped to execute a development on this scale, and where did the inspiration for the project come from?</h4><p>Place Vendí´me is a project of United Developers, a group of four Qatari investors who partnered to align their expertise in retail, real estate, construction, and contracting. Abdulaziz M. Al Rabban, who also created Villaggio in Doha, clearly realized before anyone else that a themed development in the right location is attractive for retailers. This Parisian-inspired development is reminiscent of the famous high-end shopping street in Paris, Rue de la Paix, of which Place Vendí´me is the starting point. The architecture is intended to embody luxury and extravagance while conveying a touch of culture and artistry, setting the tone for the entire shopping experience. When we did our first roadshow in Europe in 2014, the brands we wanted in the mall immediately saw how they could be part of this story. Nothing they were doing was inconsistent with this idea of a little bit of Paris in Arabia. The brand buy-in was fantastic. It was not the usual architectural approach to shopping centers, which tend to be a bit boxy and generic. Having brands connect with the concept was important because, inevitably, there needs to be a story to communicate, not just the technical features of the development. We have found the greatest success in communication happens when we are able to speak directly with the brands rather than through a third party. </p><h4>What retailers have already committed to Place Vendí´me?</h4><p>The construction of close to 1,000,000sqm was completed by mid-2016, and the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing works are 90% ready on site. The external landscape and street works are underway, and the skylight construction is complete. Our first major luxury brand signed a lease agreement in October 2016, since which we have signed 90% of the world's luxury brands. Now we must secure the high street brands. We are set to open in 2020, and nearly 70% of our space is committed to.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Costa Rica a competitive country?</h4><p>Philip Morris International (PMI) invests in Costa Rica due to its stable political-economic environment, also infrastructure and conditions such as education and quantity of operational centers. We are expanding our Central American Hub, including the Dominican Republic and the Caribbean, and Costa Rica's political and economic security is a great advantage. In addition, we are a highly regulated industry, and the strong legal security in the country in which we operate is very important. The regulations must be clear and transparent, and there must be dialog with the industry.</p><h4>How can the sector advance commercially in the face of new challenges today?</h4><p>Even with increasing prevention and cessation efforts, there are still more than 1 billion people who currently smoke cigarettes, and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), there will still be more than a billion people who choose to smoke in 2025. More than 10 years ago, our Switzerland Research &amp; Development Center started to develop less harmful alternatives and study the effects of smoking. We realized that the greatest damage was caused by the combustion of cigarettes, which emits over 6,000 harmful elements that are linked to tobacco related diseases. With that in mind, we developed IQOS, a product that heats the tobacco without burning it; because of that IQOS reduces the exposure of toxic substances caused by the smoke generated by combustion. Switching completely to IQOS present less risk of harm than continuing to smoke based on clinical and non-clinical studies, as well as independent ones. The results are published and available for review. There are no smoke, less smell, and no ash. We are commercializing IQOS in 43 countries worldwide in which five countries are in Latin America and three under my responsibility.</p><h4>What role does PMI Costa Rica have in the global operations of PMI, both in terms of business and responsibilities?</h4><p>Every country is important for PMI; every market has smokers that will be part of that new transformation challenge. We want a future with no cigarettes and want to inform those smokers so that they can have the opportunity to understand and switch to a better alternative. PMI always bring innovation and opportunities to Costa Rica.</p><h4>From a commercial point of view, what is PMI's position in the regional market, particularly in Costa Rica?</h4><p>We are leaders in several markets in Central America and Caribbean region, such as the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica. It is important now to come together and discuss what society can and should to allow smokers to have access to better alternatives than cigarettes and implement the right regulatory framework to maximize switching to better products while minimizing any unintended public health consequences.</p><h4>How are you able to communicate to the market the importance of your studies while respecting the regulations around advertising?</h4><p>First, we want to communicate to smokers and explain the benefit of the new products. We will also work with authorities and those who regulate this market so they understand the science behind it and the difference between combustible and non-combustible tobacco products. This would allow them to assess the implementation of new regulatory framework that allows to communicate to smokers the benefits of switching to less harmful alternatives.</p><h4>How does PMI impact the communities in which it works?</h4><p>The development of IQOS has a significant impact on society. It is a product for those who want to continue smoking, and we provide a choice of a less harmful product which has less smell, no ash and no smoke. Our main project at this moment is IQOS and the development of other types of alternatives. At this point, 6 million men and women worldwide have already stopped smoking and switched to our heated tobacco product - IQOS. We are developing other alternatives to respond to those consumers who prefer 'vaping' to tobacco.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Jordan's economic and financial performance over the past year?</h4><p>Jordan's economy has shown resilience over the past few years, despite precarious regional developments resulting in unprecedented refugee influx, disrupted trade routes, and lower investments and tourism inflows. In 2017, GDP grew by 2.1% in real terms compared to 2% in 2016, while in nominal terms GDP grew by 3.9% in 2017 compared to 3.4% in 2016. The primary objective of the CBJ is to maintain monetary and financial stability. Monetary stability implies avoiding prolonged inflation and deflation and preserving the stability of the JOD exchange rate, while financial stability means ensuring that the financial institutional system is resistant to economic shocks and fits smoothly to fulfil its basic functions. Accordingly, the CBJ is continuously monitoring local developments, regional and global, financial, and monetary markets. In addition, the CBJ is always ready to respond properly to any internal or external shocks by using its monetary tools. In 2017 and 2018, the CBJ raised the interest rates on its monetary policy instruments eight times over the two years by 225 basis points, in addition to an increase by 25 basis points in late 2016, in order to preserve monetary stability and ensure a competitive return on JOD-denominated assets. Despite the increases in monetary policy's interest rate, during 2017, the credit facilities extended by licensed banks to the private sector grew by 9.3% during 2017 and by 5.9% during the first eleven months of 2018. Moreover, the foreign reserves remained at a comfortable level, USD13.4 billion, covering more than seven months of the Kingdom's imports in 2018. Furthermore, the government continued to pursue its national economic and structural reform program in 2018 in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Accordingly, the government has implemented a new bundle of corrective fiscal measures to adjust fiscal positions and enhance domestic revenues through mitigating distortions in the tax system caused by the unjustified expansions in tax exemptions. Consequently, the budget deficit, including foreign grants, declined by 0.2 percentage points, to reach JOD727.6 million, or 2.4% of GDP in 2018, compared to a budget deficit of JOD747.9 million (2.6% of GDP) in 2017. However, the gross public debt reached 94.0% of GDP at the end of 2018 compared to 94.3% of GDP at the end of 2017.</p><h4>What have been the effects of the implementation of IFRS 9 standard and its importance for the Jordanian economy?</h4><p>The CBJ is keen to continue its leadership of the Jordanian banking sector and to maintain the status of the banking sector as one of the most important pillars of the national economy. This leadership role mainly involves implementing and following the international standards and practices, among such standards is the IFRS 9, which became effective as of January 2018. Implementing the new standard will have implications in the banking and credit environment through enhancing the soundness and robustness of banks' financial positions, improving risk management in the banking environment, and boosting the quality of credit portfolios and credit granting procedures. Furthermore, these instructions will imply interconnections with other supervisory requirements, such as Basel III, capital adequacy, and liquidity. In order to properly implement the standard, banks should identify their strategic actions in the following areas: reconsidering their allocation of lending to economic sectors with greater sensitivity to the economic cycle, readjusting their loan-loss provisions, revising commercial policies as product economics and profitability change, and reforming credit-management practices to prevent exposures from deteriorating.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the progress thus far toward the goals outlined in the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) 2018-2020?</h4><p>Overall, access to finance has improved in recent years, but disparities remain for the majority of the population and vulnerable groups continue to be disadvantaged. As NFIS has become a widely used tool for accelerating financial inclusion in most countries, CBJ launched the NFIS on December 4, 2017 with two national goals: to increase access to finance for the adult population from 33.1% to 41.5%, and to reduce the gender gap from 53% to 35%. The strategy overall builds on a set of priority policy areas, three of which form the core industry pillars: microfinance, digital financial services, and SME finance. Four areas are considered cross-cutting enablers that facilitate the development of industries and make them more robust: FinTech; financial consumer protection and financial capabilities; data and research; and laws, regulations, and instructions. While financial inclusion targets all segments, NFIS prioritizes certain segments; the most vulnerable groups that traditionally have lower levels of financial inclusion and the bottom 40% of households in terms of income, which comprise women, youth, and refugees. The strategy is expected to contribute to reducing socio-economic inequalities, which will be a result of the convergence of a number of developments, such as new and more adequate funding sources and other financial services for the largely financially constrained SMEs.</p><h4>How is the CBJ working to support financing for SMEs, considering SMEs comprise a majority of businesses and promote economic growth?</h4><p>In Jordan, the economy depends almost entirely on SMEs, and about 98% of all businesses in the country are classified as SMEs. Noting that one of the main obstacles facing SMEs when seeking credit is a lack of awareness of their importance, the CBJ has been working on several fronts with various stakeholders to facilitate extending credit to SMEs, which contribute some 40% to the country's GDP. Accordingly, the CBJ launched in 2016 a program to enhance the high value-added sectors of the economy. This program provides financing for productive SME projects in targeted sectors, including health, vocational and technical education, transportation, industry, tourism, agriculture, renewable energy, information technology, and engineering services consultancy. The interest rates on the CBJ's program is set at 1.75% for projects located in Amman governorate and 1% for projects located in other governorates, with maturities up to 10 years. Funds available through the program are about JOD1.2 billion, and the amount of credit facilities extended through this program has reached about JOD653.3 million, which have contributed in providing 9,620 job opportunities, and have supported 965 projects. These projects are geographically distributed to all the Kingdom's governorates, with Amman receiving the biggest share of 501 projects. Over JOD325.6 million, or 50%, of the total credit facilities extended by the program were allocated for the industrial sector. The renewable energy sector captured JOD200.5 million, or 30.7%, and the tourism sector possessed about JOD53.9 million, or 8.3%. The CBJ continues to provide a bundle of incentives for the licensed banks to support SME lending through signing several agreements with international institutions, including the World bank, Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and European Bank, in the amount of USD440 million. About USD252 million has been utilized, creating 6,000 new job opportunities. To address obstacles regarding the lack of collateral for SMEs, the Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation (JLGC) was restructured in 2012. In addition, the JLGC, in cooperation with the CBJ and banks operating in Jordan, launched a special fund of JOD50 million to guarantee the loans for the start-up projects. The coverage under this fund was increased to 85%. A new guarantee program for women-owned businesses with lower cost was launched in late 2016. Furthermore, in early 2018, the CBJ launched, in cooperation with the Planning and International Cooperation Ministry, a Jordanian fund for entrepreneurship for USD98 million. The investment in this fund was split approximately 50-50 between the CBJ and the World Bank. In addition, the CBJ encouraged banks to establish an investment company to invest in the capital of medium-sized enterprises in order to expand and develop their business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[early-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is pre-university education so important to Qatar's development?</h4><p>Everything starts with education—at Qatar Foundation (QF) and in life. And within education itself, everything starts at the pre-university level. PUE is where foundations for lifelong learning are laid, and future leaders, innovators, and change-makers start to be equipped and empowered to make an impact in their careers and communities. The learning experience PUE provides is central to shaping the way our students' lives will unfold, not just through enabling academic achievement, but through the values it instills, and the creative, critical-thinking, discovery-focused mindset it inspires. For a sustainable, diversified economy, and a strong, resilient society, Qatar requires homegrown talent with the skills and dedication to make pivotal contributions to addressing national priorities, and a community of active, engaged citizens whose desire for knowledge never wanes, who care about their nation and its people, and who want to make a difference through their work and actions. From the age of six months onward, QF's unique education cycle nurtures young people who are what Qatar and the world require: proficient, conscientious, and driven to excel.</p><h4>How has QF's pre-university education network grown over the years?</h4><p>PUE's expansion has mirrored the overarching growth of QF—not simply in terms of facilities, but in its scope, diversity, and holistic nature. The schools we have established and the curricula we have devised are anchored in Qatari culture and values, while catering to Qatar's multicultural community. Our Qatar Academy model spans five schools in different locations within Doha, Al Khor, and Al Wakrah—each with its own identity and character, but with a collective commitment to educational excellence and meeting every student's personal learning needs. At Qatar Leadership Academy, we promote the personal growth of young students through a blend of academics, military discipline, sport, and leadership skills, while Qatar Academy for Science and Technology (QAST), launched in 2018, encourages, develops, and positions talented students to become innovators. The inclusivity of PUE is reflected by Awsaj Academy, a K-12 specialized school addressing the needs of students with mild-to-moderate learning challenges, and Renad Academy, established in 2016 to help children diagnosed with mild-to-moderate Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Renad Academy illustrates our recognition of the crucial role education plays in society and our dedication to providing the highest-quality education and support for children with ASD. We educate, nurture, and guide our youth with the next stage in their academic journey in mind. Our Academic Bridge Program—a two-semester general studies program focused on English, math, science, and computer skills—helps students make a seamless and successful transition from high school to university. Collectively, our schools and programs prepare students for so many things—higher education, adulthood, career achievement, and global citizenship.</p><h4>PUE's role in education stretches beyond the classroom. How do you help strengthen the educational fabric of Qatar?</h4><p>We always say that success is achieved collectively, not individually. This principle is at the core of our vision of learning and reflected in a broader sense through our Education Development Institute (EDI). A center of excellence in the sphere of professional development and lifelong learning, EDI supports the growth and evolution of the educational community, in Qatar and internationally. Through delivering programs that align with what educators need, providing training in teaching methodologies, fostering professional 'learning communities' of teachers, and opening up a flow of knowledge exchange, EDI enables educators to capitalize on best practices that are designed, and proven, to elevate student achievement. EDI has also established the Teaching &amp; Learning Forum, a leading regional conference and a platform for educators to network and learn from each other. Drawing together education stakeholders—students, teachers, school leaders, parents, and the community—it aims to equip educators with the tools to inspire young people to academic excellence and help drive continuous school improvement. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Qatar Academy for Science and Technology has opened under the Qatar Foundation. How will this new approach be complemented from a research perspective?</h4><p>We are excited about this new opportunity for our talented high school students, and QNRF is keen to develop new programs and expand existing activities to complement and support this important initiative. Our High School Research Experience Program (HSREP) will launch in April 2019 and provide great opportunities for students to learn research skills from scientists and researchers based in Qatar. Moreover, the Qatar STEM facility (STEM-HUB), a joint initiative with Texas A&amp;M University in Qatar, will allow students to get hands-on experience in our specially designed workshops to develop their cognitive and practical skills. Through the STEM-HUB, we will be able to provide students with advanced equipment, guidance, and mentorship. In addition to these programs, we are reaching out to high school students in Qatar to participate in the FameLab's master class training for science communicators to develop their soft skills. Finally, students can participate in our competitions and activities in the National Science Research Week. The programs at QNRF are interlinked and complement each other. Therefore, if a high school student joins one of our programs—including UREP, GSRA, PDRA, ECRA—they will have various opportunities to benefit from our support until they become an accomplished scientist.</p><h4>The country is seeing an increase in projects in industrial production. How has your National Priorities Research Program (NPRP) supported this?</h4><p>This is certainly true and extremely gratifying to observe. QNRF has contributed substantially to the industrial boom that Qatar is currently experiencing. NPRP has evolved from its initial remit of capacity building in the domains of science and technology to a more focused approach of prioritizing research that promises impact and, most importantly, has commercial potential. As such, NPRP benefits and impacts Qatar's industry in multiple ways. First, it promotes projects of industrial relevance and implementation with industrial collaboration and/or co-funding. Second, it welcomes direct proposal submissions from the private sector. Third, it benefits active recruitment of industrialists to help set its research priorities and review the program's proposals and projects. Such involvement is proving beneficial to the industry in terms of ensuring that research remains industry relevant. Fourth, it helps with dissemination of the findings of NPRP projects through ROS events and by publishing and distributing their final public reports.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the research community and culture in Qatar?</h4><p>This is one of the most pleasing aspects of Qatar's research ecosystem and one that QNRF has contributed significantly to. Through its funding programs, its regulatory body of policies and procedures, and numerous avenues of communication with national researchers and institutions, QNRF has nurtured a thriving research culture. QNRF insists its applicants and awardee researchers and institutions observe the highest standards of excellence in all aspects of research, including ethical conduct, quality of publications, IP, quality of international collaboration, accuracy and transparency of reporting, originality, and feasibility of ideas, among other related areas. We designed a system of merit that rewards excellence and eliminates poor performance and misconduct. Furthermore, QNRF leads by example and subjects its own functions to a strict process of quality assurance. This ensures that our processes and results are transparent and robust and inspire our awardees and applicants to follow suit. Another example where QNRF has helped the establishment of a positive research culture is the creation of research offices in each of our applicant institutions. These offices regulate all aspects of research activity in the institution, including those outside QNRF funding. Finally, we regularly organize and sponsor numerous research events designed to disseminate research, promote networking, engage stakeholders, raise public awareness, and aid the creation of impact. All these contribute to creating a mature culture of research of the highest standards. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[50 Bilateral Agreements Signed]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[saleh-bin-hamad-al-sharqi-director-general-qatar-chamber-commerce-industry]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Qatar Chamber of Commerce promote entrepreneurship and innovation? What importance do you put on training in this regard?</h4><p>The Chamber's strategy in fact attaches innovation and entrepreneurship special interest. It strives to support startups and SMEs, helping them to grow, and urging businessmen to adopt innovative methods to strengthen Qatar's position among the fastest-growing economies. To do this, the Chamber has adopted many initiatives to support entrepreneurs and streamline startup procedures and access to finance with many competent institutions in the country such as QDB. It also organizes a biennial Qatar Chamber SMEs Conference that provides an opportunity for entrepreneurs to learn about best commercial practices by examining the experience of a guest nation in developing its SMEs. The Chamber also stimulates businessmen and entrepreneurs to invest in innovative businesses away from traditional sectors in line with the National Vision 2030, which aims to build an innovative and knowledge-based economy.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the response of the Qatari business community to the ongoing blockade?</h4><p>The Qatari private sector successfully proved its ability to brave the event, and to overcome its consequences from day one. Since the beginning of the siege, various sectors have opened new channels to import foodstuffs and construction materials in order to maintain the flow of goods and products in the local market. Businessmen responded swiftly to prevent any goods shortages. From the beginning of the crisis, the Qatar Chamber has organized numerous meetings that brought together businessmen and the officials of diverse entities and ministries to review related issues and remove obstacles. It also organized business visits for Qatari companies to many friendly countries such as Kuwait and Oman, in the quest for alternative sources for goods formerly imported from boycotting nations, and identify new markets for local products. In general, the performance of the private sector during the siege was impressive, arising as it did from a sense of patriotism. During the siege, industrial companies have intensified the pace of work, increased their productive capacities, expanded their destinations for foreign trade and contributed to the creation of a renaissance at the level of the agricultural production sector in the country.</p><h4>From a business perspective, with which countries is Qatar currently strengthening its bilateral relations?</h4><p>Qatar is strengthening its relations with all countries, particularly those to have remained supportive since the start of the siege, and provided the local market with goods and commodities. The foremost are Kuwait and Oman, as well as other Arab countries, and to which may be added Turkey and Pakistan among others.</p><h4>How would you assess the role of the Qatari Government in supporting local companies conduct business abroad?</h4><p>It has been a satisfactory effort overall. The government is a strong booster of the private sector in outward investments. It always stimulates business and companies to increase their investments outside. Therefore, the government signed over 50 bilateral agreements with the aim of protecting and securing these investments. Indeed, the agreements provide a safeguard for external investments. Moreover, business visits of the Chamber in cooperation with concerned ministries and bodies have played a key role in this regard. They have contributed to enhancing external investments by briefing businessmen on the investment opportunities available in these countries.</p><h4>What has been the evolution of Qatar's non-oil exports? How do you expect export activity to develop over the next few years?</h4><p>Despite the siege, Qatar's non-oil exports have witnessed a rapid surge over the past two years due to the facilities and incentives offered by the country to boost investments in all productive sectors. These incentives mainly aim at achieving self-sufficiency and increasing Qatar's exports. In 2018, the country's non-oil exports had an overall value of QAR24 billion distributed across over 65 markets worldwide. I strongly believe that exports will further grow over the coming few years, especially in view of the country's orientation to diversify its economy and identify new sources of income that reduce energy dependence and promote industrial diversity.</p><h4>How do you think the new FDI related legislative framework will affect Qatar's economy? Which sectors will become more attractive for foreign investors?</h4><p>There is no doubt that Law No 1 of 2019 regulating the investment of non-Qatari Capital will make Qatar a perfect hub for trade, with a positive impact on its economy. I believe that the law represents a part of the country's economic openness to the world. It will promote economic development and attract foreign investment across all economic and commercial activities.</p><h4>What is Qatar Chamber of Commerce's outlook for 2019?</h4><p>The Chamber has many objectives to realize in 2019. Alongside its role in protecting and representing the private sector, it will continue to strengthen cooperation with all local bodies and concerned ministries to deliver the private sector views on all related issues. To expand its global presence, QC will further enhance cooperation with world chambers and institutions, as well as participate in all economic and business-related international conferences and events to champion Qatari private sector abroad. We will also focus on developing services provided to our members and increasing our online functions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major highlights in promoting sustainable practices in Qatar?</h4><p>Qatar's focus on sustainability and environmentally-friendly construction methods took off in 2006, when the Qatar Foundation made it mandatory for all projects to be LEED-certified. As a result, an increasing number of buildings across Qatar are sustainable and green. There have been investments not only in sustainable projects, but also in buildings that needed capacity to put the green agenda forward. We have managed to create a community of engineers, consultancy companies, construction firms, regulators, and other stakeholders that have created a new green system for Qatar, providing the country with the strength to boost development to a higher level. Qatar has the second highest number of green buildings within the MENA region. Moreover, future plans include sustainable healthcare and schools that will increase the size and extent of green infrastructure. The government has been extremely supportive of environment-related regulations; Qatar Green Building Council contributed to this entire process by, for example, training over 4,000 professionals for the sustainability field over the last three years.</p><h4>What are the criteria to be listed on the Qatar Green Directory?</h4><p>We are increasing awareness through initiatives such as the Qatar Green Directory, where all companies that offer sustainable services in Qatar are easily listed. The directory's primary target is the business sector, and the idea was based on the lack of knowledge and direction for a great deal of companies that were interested in green operations and product development. The directory is a hub of information about products and services. Though it is currently under development, we are trying to design an accreditation process that ensures accuracy. Previously, the onus was on the company to submit documents verifying the sustainability of their products to be listed on the directory; now we are working on a system that will allow us to directly verify the accuracy of claims. In addition to compiling companies interested in green operations, we consult with them on ways to pursue these services and maximize their sustainability. The demand for green products, including recycled materials, has increased significantly; when we started listing companies on the Green Directory, nearly 800 showed interest, a number that has grown steadily. </p><h4>What added value can QGBC bring to international companies interested in starting a green project in Qatar?</h4><p>It would depend on the specific company's products and general marketing and business plan. After a detailed assessment, we connect these companies with an organization that needs their products. The company is perfectly positioned to help international companies connect with domestic actors because we are familiar with local stakeholders. Therefore, QGBC acts as an excellent guide that leads companies toward maximizing their green operations in Qatar. </p><h4>How are you working to promote sustainability in the FIFA World Cup construction projects?</h4><p>All of the World Cup stadiums are certified by Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS). We do, however, try to help developments in related sectors, like hospitality, which will play a major role during the World Cup. We are also partners with the Green Key Certification system, which allows us to certify and consult with hotels on sustainability. We want the World Cup to leave behind a green legacy. </p><h4>How does Qatar compare to other GCC countries in terms of green practices? </h4><p>Since Qatar has the second-largest number of green buildings in the region, we regularly consult with regional companies and authorities to share our expertise and experience. Before long Qatar will lead other markets in eco-friendly practices, with its facilities, projects, and new recycling facilities being used as a benchmark across the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Sasol's key CSR initiatives in Qatar? </h4><p>Sasol has launched several key initiatives as part of its CSR program. They include support for the disabled community, promotion of accessibility and environmental awareness, health education on diabetes for children, and support for entrepreneurship in Qatar. Definitely Able is one of our flagship initiatives. It seeks to empower the disabled community in Qatar by raising awareness of their abilities and encouraging them to showcase their skills and convey their message to society. The Accessible Qatar initiative began with a website and smartphone application providing instant information on the level of accessibility in many local public venues before it developed into partnerships, sub-initiatives, and joint projects with stakeholders. Under this initiative, we work with various parties as well as disabled individuals to make Qatar an accessible place for all residents and visitors. The Qatar e-Nature initiative uses technology to provide information about nature in Qatar, including plants, birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, marine life, and natural reserves. It seeks to raise environmental awareness and introduce the public to the diverse nature of the country and encourage its protection. </p><h4>Why is Sasol launching these initiatives in Qatar?</h4><p>Sasol is an international integrated chemicals and energy company based in South Africa with operations in various countries. The company gives the utmost attention to its responsibility toward the communities in which it operates, including Qatar. In addition to its core business in Qatar as a partner of Qatar Petroleum in the ORYX GTL venture, Sasol offers these initiatives as part of its CSR program. These reflect the values the company believes in and works to promote them among the youth. Sasol believes in the value of all groups, particularly young people, and the great role they can play in building their societies if they receive the appropriate support and opportunities to participate actively.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the social impact of Sasol's initiatives?</h4><p>Throughout the years, Sasol has launched several initiatives in Qatar that have now become leading initiatives and left a meaningful impact on the local community. The initiatives were well received, evolving into strategic relationships with the public sector and civil society, such as the National Tourism Council, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, the Qatar Development Bank, Qatar Museums, Qatar Foundation, Qatar University, the Qatar Diabetes Association, and others. These partnerships helped increase the number of beneficiaries and spurred a sharing of knowledge with stakeholders for the benefit of Qatari society. Definitely Able and Accessible Qatar also reached out to many people with disabilities, both males and females from various nationalities and cultural backgrounds, engaging them in various activities and giving them the opportunity to be active in their communities. Meanwhile, Qatar e-Nature reached hundreds of schools, motivating tens of thousands of students to learn more about their local environment, its diversity, and the need to protect it. The Qatar e-Nature School Contest is now in its sixth year, with more students across the country enthusiastically participating. The initiative's partnerships expanded to include individuals and, consequently, broaden their outreach. Through programs like Accessible Qatar Ambassadors, individuals were encouraged to provide support for their communities. Through the support offered by Sasol, the ambassadors work to empower their communities and organize events that serve them and promote awareness of disability. </p><h4>How are these CSR initiatives aligned with the Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030?</h4><p>Sasol initiatives are in line with the four pillars of QNV 2030, namely human, environmental, social, and economic development. Each serves more than one. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the latest developments at QBIC?</h4><p>We launched the QBIC Fab Lab in February 2018, a space for engineers, designers, and entrepreneurs to design their products with the lab's machinery. This lab has the latest design and fabrication technologies, and has a great team running it. One of the start-ups from QBIC-ibTECHar manages the space, which is open to the public. Students and entrepreneurs from across the ecosystem, including our own incubatees, all use this space to develop and test prototypes of their products. In addition to this, we celebrated the 10th wave of our flagship Lean Start-Up Program. During Demo Day, we will graduate the start-ups from our ten-week program and choose the start-ups that will receive incubation funding for the coming two years. After four years, we have incubated over 129 companies and graduated more than 370 entrepreneurs. More than USD1.2 million has been invested in these companies, and they generated revenues above USD7.4 million. We have also launched a pop-up store at The Gate Mall, which is a space for start-ups to showcase and sell their creations. </p><h4>How does QBIC work to align its strategy with Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>We are fortunate to be part of the Qatar Development Bank and the mandate to target private companies in this economy. All four of the pillars of the vision are headed in that direction. One of the things we do in terms of human capital is provide the skills that citizens need to be entrepreneurs. This is a major contribution toward the vision, and we are proud to be involved in supporting and maintaining the national vision and the economy. </p><h4>How do you measure and evaluate feedback from entrepreneurs in the program?</h4><p>We have an excellent portal that helps facilitate both feedback and feedback assessment. The feedback period starts from the moment one applies and continues until they graduate. It includes many of the processes that are needed for the two years they are at QBIC. We also work closely with entrepreneurs as they work toward meeting their milestones. The Lean Start-Up Program focuses on achieving customer validation and developing a MVP; these processes are extremely feedback-oriented, and there is a great deal of give and take with entrepreneurs. Once they have validated the first three months of incubation, they start working on activating the company and ensuring it is operational. In terms of incubated start-ups, each company has a set of unique milestones, but we usually like to see some sales and customer traction within the first few months. We also work closely with start-ups in terms of connecting them with investors, when they are ready for it. At QBIC, we practice what we preach; we learn from feedback and develop solutions the best way we can. If there are challenges, we try to adapt to ensure that we are delivering the best content and support services for local start-ups.</p><h4>As one of the largest incubators in the region, what are some of the programs QBIC offers?</h4><p>The Lean Start-Up Program is our flagship program, and we have been working on it since QBIC's inception in 2014. It accounts for the largest number of entrepreneurs moving through this program. We also have the Mix and Match Program, which connects non-Qatari entrepreneurs with potential Qatari partners in hopes of establishing a local start-up. Our speaker series allows successful entrepreneurs from Qatar, the region, and beyond to share their knowledge and insights with local aspiring entrepreneurs to encourage them to start their own success story. Earlier this year we hosted the co-founder of Kickstarter, Charles Adler, a tremendously successful session. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the statistical system of Qatar aligning with the global best practices?</h4><p>In line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by world leaders in September 2015, the UN Statistical Commission adopted a transformation plan for official statistics in order to provide the necessary data and indicators for monitoring and evaluating progress in the implementation of the agreed upon goals and targets. The plan adopts a strategic approach that calls for the establishment of a new structure for data collection, processing, and dissemination. In this regard, Qatar has been chosen as a lead country for the implementation of the plan and the introduction of the transformation in the national statistical system. An evaluation of the statistical system was carried out in 2017, followed by two workshops on the “Modernization of Official Statistics in the State of Qatar" in December 2017 and September 2018. Based on the evaluation process, a number of priorities were set forth, the most important of which are: producing indicators for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and updating databases managed by UN organizations; adopting the Generic Statistical Business Processes Model in order to standardize methodologies for managing statistical activities and provide metadata; building statistical records based on available administrative records; and conducting the 2020 census. In order to modernize the statistical system, PSA has organized several consultation meetings with a number of statistical agencies, such as UK Office for National Statistics and Statistics Denmark, to name a few. It also hosts many international experts to provide their experience in the field of modernizing statistical systems.</p><h4>How is the PSA working to support the diversification of Qatar's economy?</h4><p>The authority provides technical advice to government entities during the preparation of the overall strategy and sectoral and ministerial plans. The NDS2 was developed with a view to diversifying the economy, improving natural resource exploitation, spurring entrepreneurship and innovation, and achieving sustainable economic and social development.</p><h4>To what extent has PSA managed to allocate the state budget to the development priorities?</h4><p>The Second National Development Strategy (NDS2) has set out priorities that were nationally agreed upon by all the stakeholders and approved by the Council of Ministers. This strategy was prepared in the light of an important legislation, Law No. (2) of 2015, on the fiscal policy of the State of Qatar. As per Article 10 of that law, all government financial units shall submit their budget estimates at the time specified in the annual publication of the State General Budget to the ministry. Such estimates and priorities shall be consistent with the national development strategy. The ministry shall determine the priorities of the development projects and their selection criteria in line with the state's fiscal policy. Ministries and government agencies will submit state budgets, including development projects that fall within the framework of the National Development Strategy. This does not mean that all the proposed projects will be funded, however. PSA also reviews draft medium-term strategic plans and the annual implementation plans of the implementing agencies to ensure consistency with the national development requirements and priorities. Therefore, PSA's role in supporting the Ministry of Finance in the allocation of budgets is related to the ability of the system to crystallize the agreed upon national priorities, as well as the ability of the system to align the institutional plans with the comprehensive development agenda and ensure their integration and consistency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can new companies entering Qatar benefit from the technological environment at QSTP?</h4><p>QSTP is cultivating an open ecosystem for research, development, innovation, and tech entrepreneurship under the framework of the Qatar Foundation Research, Development, and Innovation (QFRDI). Our role is to nurture technology innovation through our extensive accelerator, incubation, and innovation-driven education programs, which aim to facilitate the creation, acceleration, and scaling up of startups that have the potential to offer tech-based solutions. QSTP serves as a medium for both multinationals and startups to share their ideas with each other, and our free zone is home to some of the region's most brilliant minds when it comes to technological innovation. We create opportunities for mentorship, and connections for regional and global technology startups and entrepreneurs. Companies have access to the right expertise and knowledge, and the opportunity for collaboration with different entities within the Qatar tech innovation ecosystem. This valuable process of knowledge transfer with institutions across the world is a strategy we believe will deliver a positive impact on people's lives, both locally and internationally. QSTP's free zone provides facilities, service, and space for tech-based companies and entrepreneurs to develop their knowledge and ideas, while benefitting from the free zone's tax exemption status. </p><h4>What companies are based in QSTP's free zone, and who will enter in 2019? </h4><p>We have attained significant milestones since our establishment. Free zone tenants include leading global companies across different sectors, including aviation, energy, IT, and technology services. We have already achieved a 90% occupancy rate and should soon reach full occupancy. Our commitment to incubate and develop local tech startups is yielding results, as graduates from our accelerator and incubation programs have not only been recognized by Qatar's most prestigious technology awards, but also gone on to secure significant investment and market their products internationally. </p><h4>In terms of funding, how do you help develop new ideas or business models?</h4><p>QSTP recognizes that one of the biggest challenges in any entrepreneur's journey is funding. Through our Product Development Fund (PDF), we help SMEs and startups accelerate the development of products and services that are relevant to local market needs. Selected companies must focus on one of our priority industries: energy, environment, healthcare, or ICT, and are given access to funding of up to QAR1.4 million. The Tech Venture Fund (TVF) is another opportunity for tech founders and entrepreneurs to source seed-stage capital when they are first embarking on their journey. As the business matures and the value proposition becomes clear, QSTP can leverage the TVF to participate in a Series A or B round of funding.</p><h4>How do you help companies get connected to the international IT landscape?</h4><p>QSTP serves as an international hub for scientific and technological innovation, tech-based entrepreneurship, and high-tech businesses. The wide-ranging research, innovation and entrepreneurship programs offered by QSTP are intended to connect people across the region and globe, which could be access to human capital or a new market. As part of our commitment to fostering an entrepreneurial ecosystem in the MENA region, we have worked with the European Innovation Academy (EIA) to introduce the Arab Innovation Academy (AIA) to our range of programs. AIA gives aspiring 'techpreneurs' from Qatar, the MENA region, and the global community an opportunity to tap into the experience of leading experts and learn more about the latest developments in the fields of science and technology while developing their own startups, in just 10 intensive days. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Bedaya's approach to promoting business and entrepreneurship in Qatar?</h4><p>Our mandate is to push home businesses to become micro- and then medium-sized, and then expand to the point where they might even become corporate entities. At that point, Qatar Development Bank (QDB) assumes its role. Bedaya is a part of QDB and is really the start of the cycle. Bedaya has three main aspects to its services. First, we offer advisory and workshops, including one-on-one sessions, as each business is different. We deal with a wide variety of startups from IT to fashion, technology, sports, and tourism. The second main area of services we offer is Connect to Market, where we give new businesses a space to sell their products or services, such as handcrafts, artwork, and fashion, among others. We have three permanent marketplaces for our entrepreneurs to use, including a night market. In 2019 we will expand our markets into universities, where even students will be able to sell their products. For example, we have a contract with Al Meera supermarkets, where producers have the opportunity to sell their products, such as milk, juices, vegetables, and chocolates, to the nearest Al Meera from their house. We did not have this system in place before the blockade. </p><h4>What notable projects or success stories have you helped start? </h4><p>We started seven years ago and have worked with over 2,000 projects. Today, Bedaya has 16 full-time employees and 10 freelancers working on numerous projects. One project we are really proud of is a juice pressing business, Raw Me, which now operates a large production plant for health-conscience drinks. </p><p><br><br><br>How does Bedaya help young people develop their careers?<br></p><p>We help young people identify the career they would like to follow, thereby assisting in developing the Qatari economy. We also work with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education on a program called Compete, which guides young people on what major to choose. We then take the students to various workplaces, such as hospitals, so they can see the opportunities available to them in a particular field, such as medicine. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sidra Medicine launched Qatar's first maternity-based app—10 Moons. How has it been received by users?</h4><p>The feedback and take-up of the app has been positive, helping pregnant women to follow up on their pregnancy records and progress. What makes our app particularly different is that it is bilingual and its concept, content, and development were all developed in-house. Our women's services model of care is based on a private medical practice model, where the patient is the center of the care she receives at Sidra Medicine. Her journey starts with being given choices regarding her care provider or team as well as the amount of intervention she desires. Our women's services and the support we provide is not only related to maternity issues—we want young women to be active participants in their health, and that starts by feeling assured that as a healthcare provider, Sidra Medicine has invested across the spectrum of maternity and gynecology-related care concerns.</p><h4>Sidra Medicine has been a major player of the Qatar Genome Program since the beginning. How have these phases performed?</h4><p>This has been a flagship program, and has worked extremely well for us. We have met all our target numbers for gene sequencing and every deadline. We have sequenced 12,000 genomes so far, and the number continues to increase, constituting a growing source of data for scientists at Sidra Medicine and at other research institutes for use in research studies. The amount of data currently being captured in this country is immense and requires enormous data storage capacity and extremely high-powered computing and analytics, which we have developed at Sidra Medicine.</p><h4>How will the hospital expand in 2019?</h4><p>We have introduced the complex surgery of separating twins, robotic surgery for both women and children, and many other programs. Being a pediatrician who has been in this system for a while and knowing what other children hospitals have outside of the country, we provide almost all the specialist healthcare services that children might need. We will launch a trauma unit at our Children's Emergency Department and add kidney and bone marrow transplants to our list of services. In addition to accepting self-referrals for women's services, 2018 saw the launch of several key women's services, including the opening of our Women's Emergency, an obstetrics triage and urgent care center. We also expanded our perinatal mental healthcare services by accepting self-referrals. The service provides treatment and care to women, their infants, and their families during the perinatal period, which starts from the time a couple plans their pregnancy to the pregnancy and the first year of the baby's life. We also plan to launch IVF services soon. We have developed the medical tourism aspect and have an excellent relationship with Kuwait from where we receive patients. Because of our world-class expertise in cardiology, urology, neurology, cranial, facial, and plastics, we see interest from regional and neighboring countries. There is reverse tourism as well, as patients who formerly traveled abroad now see a local option. Our priority programs are genetics, maternal fetal medicine, and metabolic diseases, including diabetes. We intend to expand our translational research as we develop our clinical services, for example in areas such as cardiac sciences, pulmonary medicine and immunology. The entire genomic aspect has tremendous importance and is being done within the framework of the Qatar Genome Program. We want to encourage further clinical research. Research that delivers immediate benefits for our patients takes us further toward personalized medicine and produces new discoveries for clinicians and scientists across the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[safe-haven]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the idea behind opening Naufar in Qatar?</h4><p>It came from the higher authorities in Qatar that wanted a place where we could help people deal with addictions. There are many ways to approach addiction, and the public sector is one way. There is no culture of drinking in Qatar, so the percentage is low. However, Naufar deals with both alcohol and drugs, prescription or otherwise. The way we treat patients is different, as we try to heal them in a holistic way. It is not just about fixing a problem but rehabilitating a person so they can function happily. We needed to constantly communicate with patients and wanted a comprehensive program that took into account their physical, mental, social, and societal conditions. The family also plays a major role. We had to build a facility that could take all these factors into account, with protocols and care delivery to implement it, structure, and human resources. This is where Naufar stands in the Qatari healthcare system.</p><h4>How do you implement technology in your services?</h4><p>The first type of technology we use is a functional MRI. We look at the activities of the brain to see how it is affected and how severe the damage is. Brain activities change with recovery. We need to demonstrate to people how they can recover. For me, it has been dealing with sports medicine. You cannot convince people they need help unless they want it. We want to demonstrate what is happening to their brain with this technology. As time goes on, they can see how they are changing. Ultimately, this is different from other kinds of medication; it engages them at a human level. We need our patients to take charge of their lives. Technology is important, though the human component is 99%.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the healthcare sector and the importance of your services?</h4><p>There are always priorities in any sector. In the healthcare sector, for basic needs, most of us treat ourselves 80% of the time. The more knowledge we have to treat ourselves, the better we are. Then come basic healthcare services, such as primary healthcare, and then the more advanced services, like surgery. At the end of the spectrum comes a center like Naufar, dealing with addiction. Naufar is, to a great extent, proof of how advanced healthcare is in Qatar. In recent years, we have been working hard at innovation. If anyone can produce a perfect system for healthcare management, it is a country like Qatar. We are a small country with abundant resources, we have centralized decision-making, and we can provide big data. In the end, we will get there using the right technology and applying what we can learn from big data. Compared to the region, we have several advantages.</p><h4>Where do you see room for more private hospital involvement?</h4><p>We have many hospitals. We have three industrial hospitals about to open. Our population is perhaps 35% blue collar workers from abroad, and we provide services to them as well. We have done research and have found that 40% of people in Qatar are overweight. However, no one is underweight. The incidence of disease globally corresponds to access to healthcare; here, there are no issues with access.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2019?</h4><p>We want to continue refining our operations because we only opened in 2017. For any organization, its first task is to operate. Then, we have two years to refine everything—our operation, our culture, and the things we need to do. If we get our culture correct, the organization will be healthy. An unhealthy environment or culture however will not see us through. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[built-from-scratch]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the role of the company in covering Qatar's needs during the blockade?</h4><p>The blockade in 2017 was a disruption that turned into an opportunity for Baladna Food Industries. As entrepreneurs, our owners really took it as an opportunity to make our contribution to Qatar's self-sufficiency and food security. Previously, 85% of all dairy products in the country were imported. After the blockade, the government allowed Turkey, Iran, and other countries to fill the gap. This was also the moment the government had to accelerate its existing 2030 strategic plan. One year on, Baladna Food Industries is a market leader in the fresh milk industry. In my many years in the dairy industry, I have never seen this happen before. Our infrastructure was nonexistent, and a year later we were market leaders, basically from scratch, with completely new infrastructure of cows, barns, factories, water plants, and feed that was not in the country before.</p><h4>How has Baladna set new regional and international standards in producing dairy products in terms of processes and technology?</h4><p>Our owners were absolutely committed to becoming the best. We wanted high-performing cows, and, therefore, ordered high-quality cows from the US based on the Genetic Total Performance Index (TPI). We also hired the best consultants and design firms to advise us how to build our barns from scratch. We have now built 40, plus water plants and lagoons. All our factories have state-of-the-art technology that is the best one could buy in any part of the world. This is the nice part about the operation being greenfield, because we can make these kinds of decisions without compromising on quality. We want the best of the best. And this has all happened in a short period of time.</p><h4>What is Baladna Food Industries' contribution to the government's drive to promote the 'Made in Qatar' brand?</h4><p>After the blockade, a united spirit developed alongside a can-do spirit and commitment, and people are genuinely proud of what we have established here, not just for the sake of the dairy industry or Baladna Food Industries, but for the whole country. We use place of origin as a marketing tool and to express to the government that we want other countries' products to do the same so consumers can make this choice. Having a “Made in Qatar" marketing approach is highly relevant now. In the case of Baladna, what "Made in Qatar" means is that consumers get freshly pasteurized and locally produced milk. With our cows, we contribute to the country's self-sufficiency for the future. In fresh milk, which is the biggest dairy category, the whole industry reached 100% self-sufficiency one year after the blockade. We delivered what we promised.</p><h4>What are Baladna's plans to export its products?</h4><p>We definitely have export plans, though first and foremost our priority is to make Qatar self-sufficient. We are going into a wide range of products and have a great deal to do before the full set of products becomes available in the market. Once we have achieved this, or parallel to this, we will explore the potential of export markets further. Then, we have to look at the products and countries we will target for export. We bring in the best cows from all over the world, and that is expensive. Likewise, we do not have green pastures, so we buy expensive feed internationally. Added to this, we did not have infrastructure but built it all in one year, which meant high financing and set up costs. Our cost is thus expensive, and if we want to compete in the global market, we need to find the right type of products to sell; otherwise, we will sell at a loss. We are looking at exporting to Oman, Kuwait, and perhaps Syria and Iraq. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>After the onset of the blockade, what steps did you take to increase the production of the local agribusiness sector?</h4><p>After the blockade, Hassad's internal focus increased with the aim of supporting the private sector by filling any gaps in order to satisfy local market needs. In addition to Hassad's significant role in supplying the local market with the necessary products during the first few months of the blockade, the company also increased local production in key sectors, including fodder, poultry, and vegetables. In the fodder sector, we conducted in-depth research on local market needs, and then developed a comprehensive plan that covers both local and foreign strategic expansion to satisfy those needs, as well as secure external sources to be utilized by the country if needed. Additionally, we have successfully completed Phase I of Alfa Alfa local production on 1.5 million-sqm of land in Irkkiyah farm owned by Aalaf Qatar, one of the subsidiaries of Hassad. The total cultivated area of green fodder reached 8 million sqm locally, and we are currently executing Phase 2 of our expansion plans on Aalaf Qatar farms. We increased local poultry production to 16 million chickens and 120 million table eggs per year. We currently cover around 90% of local market needs from fresh chickens and achieved advanced stages in table-egg self-sufficiency. In terms of vegetable production, we recently launched Mahaseel, a marketing and agri-services company, to support the private agricultural sector to contribute to self-sufficiency, encourage local farmers to increase the quantity and enhance the quality of local produce, ease the burden on local farmers to increase their production, and purchase farmers' production and sell it to the local market.</p><h4>Australia and Oman are two strategic partners of Qatar in supplying food items. How is Hassad investing in other countries to increase production?</h4><p>We are looking to expand our international footprint. We currently have investments in nine countries including Oman, Australia, and Sudan and are looking at southern Europe, North and South America, as well as Africa in terms of investments, know-how, and trading. We recently signed an MoU with the Republic of Rwanda to look into opportunities for projects there. In Australia, we conducted strategic repositioning of our investments there; Hassad Australia's portfolio was merged with Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets' agricultural portfolio. In Oman, Hassad is investing 20% in downstream seafood with the Global Seafood Company. With this new investment, the company's total investments in Oman will reach approximately QAR500 million (USD137 million). Hassad has another major investment in Oman in the poultry sector, A'Saffa Foods, which is currently undergoing expansion plans. The company will produce around 44 million birds in 2019.</p><h4>How would you assess the role of the transport and logistics players in securing food supply for the country?</h4><p>Hassad played a major role during the blockade, as the company managed to develop a new route—land and sea—from Turkey and Azerbaijan through Iran to Qatar, and the private sector is utilizing this route to this day. The Ministry of Transport and Communications also did a great deal of work to open new direct sea routes to countries such as Pakistan and Iran. Now, with Hamad Port, we have all the facilities in place for shipping.</p><h4>How close is Qatar to being self-sufficient in its food supply?</h4><p>Food security involves supplies that we can produce and those we can store. In terms of storage, we are doing great work with the silos being built, as well as the expansion of other storage facilities in the country. Once those projects are completed, the situation will improve further. In terms of local production, in the dairy sector, for example, we have reached high levels of self-sufficiency. Moving forward, we need to do more work in the fresh vegetables segment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have operations at the Medical City complex developed since its opening in 2017?</h4><p>The formal opening of the three new hospitals in Medical City—Qatar Rehabilitation Institute, Ambulatory Care Center, and Women's Wellness and Research Center—by His Highness the Amir was a momentous achievement for Qatar. The new hospitals significantly increase capacity across our system while also providing highly advanced environments in which our care teams can treat patients. We have made great progress since the opening. In 2018, a number of new services opened at the new hospitals, including the diabetes clinic at the Women's Wellness and Research Center and audiology and ear, nose, and throat services at the Ambulatory Care Center. Every new service has boosted our ability to deliver the best care to our patients. Moreover, activity has continued to increase monthly; some 10,000 patients receive care within these facilities every week.</p><h4>Given Qatar's growing population, how is HMC working to attract qualified human resources to meet new needs?</h4><p>Increased demand for our services is not new, because Qatar's population has been expanding at a rapid rate for the past 40 years. We have worked hard to attract the world's best talent, Qatari and non-Qatari, and are proud of our achievement in becoming an internationally recognized teaching institution and academic medical center. Each year, our medical education programs welcome over 100 new doctors in training and this number is increasing every year. In the lead up to the opening of the new Medical City hospitals, we undertook our largest-ever recruitment drive and attracted thousands of skilled clinical and support staff into our workforce. We are proud to have a skilled and dedicated workforce and understand the importance of looking after our employees.  Numerous initiatives have been introduced across our organization in recent years, each aiming to make the daily lives of our employees as smooth, rewarding, and enjoyable as possible. The introduction of our human resources' self-service system has simplified the process for many employee requests. The Sogha discount program enables employees and their families to make great savings at a wide range of outlets and maximize the quality of life away from work. Moreover, our recreation centers allow employees to relax and exercise in advanced facilities on campus.</p><h4>How would you assess cooperation between the public healthcare system and private healthcare providers?</h4><p>Qatar's public and private sector healthcare providers all work toward the common goal of servicing the healthcare needs of the population. Along with the expansion of the public sector in recent years, the private sector has also undergone significant growth, with a number of new facilities boosting capacity. A patient referral system operates between the public and private sectors enables patients to efficiently transition between care providers. Notably, the ministry collaborates with many private hospitals and clinics on a range of quality and education initiatives, each aimed at improving the quality, safety, and effectiveness of care services for patients.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the health sector and the public system in Qatar for the year ahead?</h4><p>In the coming year, we will continue to expand capacity across our health system. HMC will continue to expand its services delivered out of its new general hospital in the industrial area and open a new trauma and emergency tower at Hamad General Hospital. In primary care, we will open two more health and wellness centers, boosting primary care's ability to help patients stay healthy as well as being the initial entry point for patients into the public health system. We will continue to strengthen the way in which health providers work together across the public health system. This will ensure patients experience smooth transitions and continuity of care from one provider to another along their entire treatment plan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What actions is the government taking to increase local production in agricultural affairs and fisheries and secure self-sufficiency in staple food items?</h4><p>The agricultural sector is considered one of the most important and vital sectors of Qatar's national economy. The government aims to achieve food security through vertical and horizontal development programs, where the former increases productivity by encouraging and expanding the use of modern technology in the fields of plant, livestock, and fish production. Horizontally, there is a focus on increasing vegetable, livestock, and fish-related activities by increasing the area of cultivated land and the number of animals and fisheries. The Ministry of Municipality and Environment (MME) aims to raise the level of self-sufficiency in the agricultural sector up to 65% within a short time and has adopted 10 strategic projects for the production of greenhouse vegetables to private sector investors with a total area of 100,000sqm per project and a total production capacity of 21,000 tons per year; proposed 24 new strategic projects for the production of greenhouse vegetables to private sector investors with a total area of 100,000sqm per project and a total production capacity of 50,400 tons per year; and provided existing farms with 3,500 greenhouses and 2,000 beehives with all its requirements, in addition to supporting agricultural production requirements. Qatari date production has also increased from 28,000 tons in 2017, approximately 84% of local consumption, to 29,500 tons, or 86% self-sufficiency. MME supports date-producing farms to achieve 90% self-sufficiency within a year. Qatari greenfield production has increased from 95,000 tons in 2017 to 105,000 tons in 2018, achieving 54% self-sufficiency. MME's strategy focuses on increasing greenfield production, irrigating with treated wastewater, and reducing land areas irrigated with groundwater. Local milk production has increased from about 60,000 tons in 2017, approximately 60% of local consumption, to 220,000 tons, with complete self-sufficiency. Qatar was also able to achieve a substantial increase in fresh poultry production from about 11,000 tons in 2017, approximately 50% of local consumption, to 22,000 tons per year, or complete self-sufficiency. Egg production has increased from about 4,000 tons in 2017, covering 14% of local consumption, to 7,000 tons, or 23% self-sufficiency. MME will shortly propose projects for the production of farm eggs in coordination with Qatar Development Bank. Local egg production is projected to cover 65% of local needs within two years. As for red meat, the number of economic animals in Qatar has witnessed a huge increase over the past few years from about 1.3 million heads in 2017 to more than 1.6 million in 2018. The number of cattle farmers currently stands at 17,000 from 15,000 in 2017. The local fish sector produces a total of 15,000 tons per year, which covers 75% of the state's fresh fish needs. MME has placed great importance on fish farming projects to increase production to cover 85% of local fish consumption. A new fish farming project, with a capacity of 2,000 tons per year, using floating cages, has been awarded, and two more projects will be tendered soon. MME has also proposed a shrimp farming investment project with a capacity of 1,000 tons to help Qatar reach complete self-sufficiency in two years. MME is a firm believer of scientific research to develop the agricultural sector and improve the performance level of this vital and essential sector. We have finalized the construction of the Maritime Research Center in Ras Al Matbakh tasked with conducting research on the development of fish farming and providing the fingerlings necessary to establishing 10 small fish farming projects in Qatar. MME also established a Livestock Wealth Research Center in Al Shiehana to develop livestock production research and artificial insemination technology aimed at increasing the country's livestock production. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your market share of meat products evolved since the blockade?</h4><p>Widam Food Company has always positioned itself as a key contributor and main player in Qatar's National Food Security Program. Following the blockade, and in response to the objectives of the program, Widam was able to formulate viable solutions ensuring an uninterrupted supply of red meat into the country, which has successfully resulted in an increase in its market share in Qatar.</p><h4>Which countries have become more important in meeting Qatar's meat needs? What investments are you making in these countries to increase production?</h4><p>Diversification of sources of supply is a main objective of Widam. In addition to Australia, the company imports red meat from various countries such as Sudan, Romania, Azerbaijan, Somalia, and Spain. The company has an important presence in Sudan through a branch involved in the fattening of livestock, agriculture, and the export and import of red meat and fodder.</p><h4>Which plans do you have in place to advance your in-country production capacity and promote “Made in Qatar" products?</h4><p>Regarding its activities within Qatar, Widam Food Company has completed the first phase of a sheep-breeding project in Arkeh with a targeted production capacity of 50,000 heads. The company's plan is to enhance its competitiveness through product diversification and thus achieve solid revenues. The current economic climate and development in the country will expedite the implementation process, enabling us to meet our goals, thereby increasing consumer confidence in Widam as the main supplier of red meat in the local market. We have also supported local private sheep farms by providing them with an outlet for the sale of thousands of sheep to encourage them to expand and increase production. Additionally, our plan is to reach every customer in the market. We have developed our website and opened additional slaughterhouses to cover most of Qatar. In addition, we designed a new easy to use mobile app aimed at attracting and increasing the number of consumers.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>Widam covers over 85% of market needs for red meat, and the company will pay particular attention to its projects, plans, and finances to implement these projects after confirming their feasibility and effective contribution to company revenues. We are making every effort to be part of the local food security system by meeting all sector requirements. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some recent highlights of the company, and what are you currently planning?</h4><p>In 2Q2017, we had many ongoing developments for both the country and the company. Es'hail-2 was supposed to launch in 4Q2017; however, it was postponed to 4Q2018 due to design changes. Building a satellite is a complicated process, and we need to be sure everything is perfect, because once it is launched, we will not be able to fix any issues. There were changes in requirements, which led us to making changes in the design. Es'hail-2 will complement Es'hail-1, which was a joint venture with France-based Eutelsat. Es'hail-2, however, is completely our own satellite. This satellite will be in the same orbital slot and is aimed at increasing capacity, allowing us to attract more customers and in turn more revenue; thus, we will see a higher retention rate. When we started the company, we had a different vision. The market circumstances were completely different; at that time, we wanted to launch four or five satellites. Since then, the challenges have increased, and we have become more realistic. We also target regions other than MENA, where we have had great success. We are currently in discussions with partners to invest in Asia. Both satellites are targeted at broadcasters and some telecommunications services. Es'hail-3, if we succeed with investments, will not be for video or TV; the current trend is for in-flight connectivity because passengers want to be connected. We need to have global covaerage for this in order to cover the entire flight route, including oceans. Owning the satellite would be best, though partnerships will likely be the way to go.</p><h4>What are some constraints to your ambitions?</h4><p>Our constraints are the limitations of frequencies. For any satellite operator to succeed, it needs money and the spectrum. Es'hailSat is fine financially, though the spectrum is the problem. The Qatar Satellite Company was established seven years ago, considerably later than other entities in the region. All the frequencies and orbital locations were taken by giant operators, so it did not have the space. To invest, we need the frequency, which is why we must complement our business with partnerships with companies that already have the spectrum.</p><h4>What was the goal of attending Satellite 2018 in Washington DC?</h4><p>It was all about networking. Our entire focus is on launching Es'hail-2 and completing our ground station in northern Qatar. We have another megaproject ongoing to build our own teleport.</p><h4>In what ways are you developing Qatari capabilities with the high-tech sector?</h4><p>This is something that is underlined in the Qatar Vision 2030. We are supporting and contributing to the vision by building capabilities and hiring Qataris. The satellite industry is still new in Qatar, and thus we are short in the skillset. This is why we have had Qatari engineers attached with the manufacturers during the construction of Es'hail-1 and Es'hail-2. We also have some synergies with Qatar University's engineering department. Similarly, we have started some discussions with universities that have plans to establish a space center. There are many foreigners here working in these positions, and the goal is not necessary to replace them, but to complement them. Young Qataris are extremely excited about the opportunities. It is an exciting time for our company and country.</p><h4>Has the blockade affected your business?</h4><p>It has positively affected our business, which was unexpected. At present, there are four main satellite operators in the region: Nilesat, Yahsat, Arabsat, and Es'hailSat. In the past, Qatari broadcasters had the freedom to choose between these operators; however, when the blockade occurred, local broadcasters shifted their business to us. This has inspired a great deal of confidence in our satellite and quality of service. As a result, 95% of Qatari channels are on Es'hailSat, meaning we are operating at full capacity, which is why we look forward to the launch of our second satellite. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see Qnbn's role in the realization of the Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>Qnbn successfully delivers on its mandate and vision by providing a nationwide shareable network. Qnbn has provided Qatar with a highly secure and unlimited bandwidth telecom infrastructure, increased the affordability of FTTh networks, and shortened the time to market in the government's preparation to offer smart services. At present, we cover 93 geographic zones in Qatar. In addition, Qnbn's network is designed to help telecom service providers access all major Doha areas so that the country as a whole could benefit by having a choice of service providers. As part of the strategy, Qnbn has been working closely with the government to identify an umbrella program called the Unified Government Network (UGN), which provides the infrastructure and fiber optics for all government departments to avoid any duplication of networks. In addition, we can provide the entire infrastructure for special events, such as the 2022 FIFA World Cup. We are working with the government to fulfill all the necessary requirements to make Doha a smart city and Qatar a smart nation. The fundamentals of all smart concepts start with the infrastructure. If we have fiber optics and high-speed infrastructure, it is easy to deploy and adopt smart solutions. That is why Qnbn focuses on infrastructure deployment in Doha.</p><h4>What benefits will the next generation fiber optics network bring?</h4><p>After installing the next-generation fiber-optic infrastructure, we hope to have the ability to deliver the smart solutions and applications that may arise in the future. Qnbn's investment in the infrastructure will enable Qatar to leverage smart solutions and applications that can help diversify its economy. These infrastructure improvements currently contribute 3.5-4% to our GDP, and our goal is for this figure to grow to 5-6%.</p><h4>How do you assess the progress that has been made with Qatar's digitalization agenda?</h4><p>The achievements to date have been great. Qnbn monitors the usage of digitalization between government ministries and in private sector companies and SMEs, and subsequently gives the necessary support. We support smaller companies to shift to smarter solutions and use digital technology in general. There are some smart services application packages available, and there are programs from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to help SMEs. Qnbn provides whatever is needed in terms of the infrastructure. Notably, the percentage of SMEs in Qatar's economy is growing steadily.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the blockade on Qatar's ICT sector?</h4><p>As a company, we did not feel the effects because within the first 48 hours we secured all the raw materials and spare parts needed for our network. We continued without any delay in our projects. At present, our projects are performing even better than before because our teams have excellent external channels that allowed us to continue our work</p><h4>The blockade has supported the idea that Qatar should be more self-sufficient. How do you see your own role in this regard?</h4><p>Our first focus in this regard is to provide a secure network for the public sector. This will truly help the country with its vision for greater self-sufficiency. We have been well-organized in this task and have been integrating more ministries under the same secure network with high standards of cybersecurity and stability. This makes Qatar more confident in its ability to deal with any attack.</p><h4>What are your outlook and main objectives for 2019?</h4><p>Through providing smart city concepts for the country and smart solutions and systems for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and Qatar National Vision 2030, our role in Qatar in the coming year is critical. Our goal is to provide a secure and stable ICT environment in Qatar that is able to host all kinds of business and events.

		<url><![CDATA[secure-digitalization]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give an overview of MEEZA and how </h4><p>MEEZA's Business Cloud can advance the digitalization of companies in Qatar?<br>MEEZA has been in the local market for the past 10 years and is now a mature company. It was established to accelerate IT adoption in Qatar as means of building a knowledge-based society in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030. <br>MEEZA is an end-to-end managed IT service and solution provider based in Qatar with a state-of-the-art data center, which is its first key differentiator. We have 4,000sqm of data suites and are LEED-certified. Over the years, MEEZA has continued to mature and add new data center services starting with managed services to the cloud. <br>MEEZA was a pioneer and the first to launch the concept of a cloud; the market, at that time, was careful to give it a try, and the level of understanding was not that mature. We did a great deal of education as first movers, and over time, the market witnessed other partners entering the sector. <br>In 2018, MEEZA Expansion launched <br>MEEZA Business Cloud and started to expand internationally by offering services and solutions online to the local as well as foreign markets.<br>Working closely with international and local partners gave us the ability to accelerate our execution plan, and we currently provide Microsoft products including Azure, security solutions, and Augmented Reality (AR), and are now working to introduce Virtual Reality (VR) and backpack PCs, mainly for the fields such as architecture and medical services. <br>Our go-to-market strategy is based on studies and analyses provided by well-known and certified advisors and consultants. We know that by 2022, some 30% of consumers in mature countries will depend on AI to decide on what they will eat and how they will wear clothes. This is an indication that we cannot ignore this trend, especially since we are fortunate to have the understanding of the board and the full support of investors. </p><h4>How does MEEZA work to enhance cybersecurity in a business environment?</h4><p>MEEZA is one of the pioneers of cybersecurity and one of the first movers to have a Commercial Security Operations Center (SOC) in Doha. We are extremely aware of the business needs when it comes to cybersecurity and data protection. Today, things are no longer tangible, and everything became digital even the money. Data is therefore becoming valuable. Future sources of wealth will be information, which is why cybersecurity has become an important and urgent matter in our industries.<br>The job of an IT service provider is to shoulder this responsibility so that clients and organizations can focus on their core business. There are four important security pillars that an organization needs to focus on to minimize the threat coming from the proliferation of digitalization: risk, governance, business continuity, and people. Those four elements, if secured to the client, will ensure any implementation will be successful, and all transactions will be secured. MEEZA's main focus since its establishment was to secure its platform and tools and always govern the deliverables of the partners, hence gaining its clients' trust in its services. Providing security services is essential for MEEZA as it plays an important role in offering protection against common threats and those targeting specific industries. MEEZA's Advanced Security Monitoring Services provides alerts and notification around the clock for organizations that require constant security monitoring of their critical assets and infrastructure.<br>Opting for the public cloud as a solution should be guaranteed with trustworthy platforms that are more secure than privately hosted servers. In addition, it is essential that the service provider take the educational path as a part of the delivery so to reduce human errors at the beginning. Continuous awareness programs will support a smooth and successful implementation and execution. If we do not explain exactly every step in the business and how users have to deal with those solutions and transactions, it will affect the entire investment and implementation. Clarity in engagement and communication is the key to success. </p><h4>What other changes will shape Qatar's IT sector in the near future?</h4><p>Qatar is pioneering many aspects, specifically in terms of implementing cyber laws. Qatar was the first GCC country to enact a law specific to data protection. 5G will also have a significant impact on our AI business and automation, and upgrade our hardware to cope with faster speed of communication and connection. This will also require telecom providers to work closely with service providers because the platform to render the service resides in our type of business. In the coming years, all telecoms will have to sell private network mobility, and this is another product that will be in the market soon. <br>Digital transformation will bring exciting opportunities, as well as new challenges, to all industries. We must harness the power of emerging technologies to create more efficient operations, new business models, and better customer experience. Our goal is to accelerate the growth of the IT industry in Qatar and the region through the provision of our services.</p><h4>What are the priorities for MEEZA Expansion in 2019?</h4><p>We are one team in MEEZA, and we are extremely excited to go international. The most important thing is to promote MEEZA and Qatar's platform. Our target is to position MEEZA as one of the most secured public platforms.<br>MEEZA Expansion recently established number of strategic partnerships that are aimed at not only expanding MEEZA's footprint outside of Qatar, but also diversifying MEEZA's already rich service portfolio. MEEZA is further developing its expertise to provide its customers with user-friendly and hassle-free, cost-efficient, and tech-savvy innovation through MEEZA Expansion, one of four organizations that acquired a LEED Platinum Certification worldwide. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[deeply-rooted-ambitions]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements for Vodafone Qatar during its 10-year presence?</h4><p>Over these years, Qatar has become one of the most advanced countries in the world in terms of both digital adoption, technology infrastructure, and a leader in pioneering innovation. We take pride in our role, built up over the past 10 years and substantiated by the more than QAR8 billion that we have invested to date, and of being at the forefront of the digital era. It's a role that has seen us become a leading partner in providing intelligent platforms and connectivity solutions to the smart cities of the future, our world-class network, our growing broadband footprint, and the ecosystem of digital products and services we have built. Looking to the future, our ambition stretches well beyond what we have already achieved. It is an ambition deeply rooted in our leadership role to help shape the country's economic success and improve lives through pioneering digital innovation.</p><h4>What is the company's new vision?</h4><p>Our vision is simple: to connect today's ideas with the technologies of tomorrow by pioneering digital innovation and becoming people's first choice in telecom and digital services. We will continue our strong commitment to pioneer digital innovation in Qatar and be a leading contributor to the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p><h4>What has been the role of Vodafone in bringing 5G to Qatar?</h4><p>We were one of the first operators in the world to go live with 5G commercially and the first to have connected customers to 5G in Qatar. We've built strong momentum in building our 5G network across the country since switching it on in August 2017, and we will continue to bring 5G to key locations across the country. 5G will bring a wave of technological advances that will be truly sector agnostic, changing every facet of the way we live and work. From predictive maintenance of elevator systems in a Westbay tower, to intelligent management of traffic flows in smart cities and smart irrigation and fertilization management solution, all will connect via sensor-based 5G communications to the cloud, making it possible to store and analyze huge amounts of real-time data for real-time decision making using AI. At the end of the day, it is difficult to map all of the eventual applications that will be enabled by the underlying 5G technology; however, our commitment to building world-class infrastructure and forming strategic partnerships to leverage the eventual applications that will be enabled by the underlying 5G technology is at the core of our ability to achieve our ambitions.</p><h4>What will be the impact of eSIM for users?</h4><p>As the name suggests, eSIM technology replaces the physical, plastic SIM card used by current smartphones. We were the first operator in the region to introduce eSIMs and the 11th worldwide, because we saw the potential in the technology. There are countless use cases for eSIM technology that can be used in conjunction with smart sensors and smart home devices in the future. From provisioning sensors and devices remotely without the burden of having to physically acquire and insert a SIM card to remote management via on the cloud re-programming using artificial intelligence, eSIM technology paves the way for an acceleration in innovation for both consumer and IoT applications. </p><h4>As Vodafone Qatar becomes a holistic digital provider, which particular solutions can you offer for SMEs?</h4><p>SMEs are the backbone of any advanced and diversified economy. Supporting small businesses with the most advanced solutions is a major priority, not only for Vodafone but also for Qatar. Our support of the SME segment starts with a strong understanding of the challenges they face today and developing services and solutions to support them and tackle their business challenges. Our solutions are anchored on our understanding of our customers' needs in terms of flexibility, be it connectivity, managed services, or smart solutions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the competitive environment of the Qatari communications sector?</h4><p>CRA is working to ensure that the proper regulation and infrastructure is in place to create the right market environment and encourage competition to sustain a thriving ICT sector. The current healthy competitive environment between the country's two service providers is a sign of the market's developing maturity. At the same time, increased competition in the mobile sector is having a positive impact for consumers in terms of reduced prices and increased service offerings. Meanwhile, increasing smartphone penetration is creating a larger market for apps, e-commerce, and other mobile web services. As consumer demand for telecommunications services continues to grow and mature, CRA is taking steps to ensure meeting this increased demand, through developing regulatory frameworks that reflect the continuously evolving structure of a converged ICT eco-system—one that depends on the availability of advanced fixed and mobile telecommunications networks. An in-depth analysis of the global ICT sector landscape indicates that the development of Qatar's telecommunications infrastructure is on par with that of comparable high-income countries.</p><h4>How is CRA cooperating with counterparts in other countries?</h4><p>CRA is highly active as a leader in the telecoms sector; we regularly attend leading world events to network, share knowledge and best practices, explore common challenges and partnership solutions, and understand the latest industry innovations. CRA coordinates with other regulators through its network and membership of the world's leading organizations such as ITU, UPU, and ICANN to discuss issues such as shared global use of the radio spectrum, international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, improving telecommunications infrastructure, development and coordination of worldwide technical standards, and the future direction of the postal sector.</p><h4>How will the early implementation of 5G technology affect the telecommunications sector?</h4><p>CRA has approved initial plans for frequency bands relating to 5G mobile service, and it will be a reality in Qatar starting from January 2019. 5G will bring a new level of performance and characteristics to the telecom networks, enabling the creation of a wide range of new services, ecosystems, and revenue streams. While 5G promises some impressive download speeds, it will probably not make a great deal of difference to the average smartphone user streaming a video; the biggest impact from 5G is likely to be on the Internet of Things (IoT). In recent years, we have increasingly seen the growth of so-called cyber-physical systems particularly in industry, manufacturing, transport, health, and logistics. Furthermore, in these environments, there is increased automation and autonomous decision-making, not to mention self-driving cars and smart buildings and the health sector. With all of these objects connected to the internet, considerable resources and bandwidth are needed to manage the colossal amounts of data that need to be gathered and analyzed in order to make these concepts a reality on a massive scale, and 5G has the potential to make this possible. 5G will create entirely new market opportunities not previously realized and entirely new business models will emerge as a result. Faster internet speeds lower the cost of innovation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will continue to initiate new projects, plans and infrastructure improvements in line with Qatar's 2030 vision of driving a knowledge-based information society. Looking forward to the year ahead, CRA will be working hard along with the stakeholders and service providers to deliver 5G mobile technology to the market in Qatar. In addition, CRA will continue its work towards the full transition from Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) to IPv6 before the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. In 2019, we will continue in close collaboration with the Ministry of Transport and Communications to develop the new Postal Law and will work on developing key related regulatory instruments for postal regulation. We are also looking to futureproof the regulatory framework. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major projects and milestones of Hill International?</h4><p>Over the years, we have delivered over 40 projects. 2018 was a challenging year for the construction market as a result of the blockade and the shift in priority from investing in real estate toward more strategic sectors such as food and industry. That is why we are working to enter new markets in Qatar. Even industrial projects require project management services. We are in contact with a few potential clients, now with a focus on design work and agreements like BOTs and PPPs with the private sector and the government. Nevertheless, there are still major projects going on, especially related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p><h4>What added value can Hill International bring to construction companies that want to get started in Qatar?</h4><p>We help contractors navigate through the processes that are required to start operations in Qatar. Most importantly, we can work closely with subcontractors by embedding our people in their teams and help them manage projects. We can take care of project management on behalf of the client, which is our core business, though we also manage construction, especially when projects are complex, and multiple stakeholders are involved. We have a structured way of managing things that helps contractors do better in terms of delivering on time and turning a profit.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the short term?</h4><p>We will see greater consolidation of infrastructure projects related to the World Cup. We will also see the start of expansions at the airport and extensions of the red and green lines of the Doha metro, which will start partially operating. At the same time, we will see the delivery of major projects related to Lusail and Qatar Rail. For Hill International, this will be an interesting and challenging time to be operating in Qatar. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess your company's contribution to the development of Qatar?</h4><p>We have seen a drastic change both in our company and in the broader industry. Some 20 years ago, landscaping was purely soft landscaping, which would involve only planting and irrigation of installations. Today, however, the definition of landscaping is completely different, with hard landscaping that includes walkways, granite and pavement installation, lighting, and water features. Every external element of a building is part of modern landscaping. Additionally, we have managed to go beyond this as a result of our capacity. We have started to do infrastructure projects for landscape areas, which means we are able to complete infrastructure jobs that are part of our landscaping projects.</p><h4>How have your World Cup projects progressed, and what is the timetable for their completion?</h4><p>We are extremely pleased to be engaged in these signature projects. It is great to work with the Supreme Committee, as it is one of the most professional clients in Qatar. It wants to send the world a message that Qatar is well prepared to host an excellent World Cup. We are being pushed to deliver faster, and we are on track to make this happen. Additionally, we are being monitored by specialists in order to ensure that the highest-quality methods and materials are being used.</p><h4>What is the significance of the World Cup in showcasing to the world what Qatar is capable of?</h4><p>In 2010, when Qatar was chosen to host the World Cup, it was a dream come true. No one outside the country took Qatar seriously as a host before it was chosen. Many Qataris knew it was possible, though we knew we would need to prove it to the international community. Qatar will be better prepared for the World Cup than any other organizing country. Three stadiums will be completed in 2019. Two years before the first kickoff in November 2022, seven of the eight stadiums will be ready. The eighth will likely be completed more than a year ahead of time, which is extraordinary. The World Cup will have an excellent impact on Qatar, showcasing to the world Qatar's ability to organize and execute one of the largest sporting events in the world. Additionally, hosting the World Cup is a major driving force toward the objectives of the Qatar National Vision 2030. </p><h4>How will you further develop the company, and what areas will remain interesting for the next five to 10 years?</h4><p>Peak landscape construction has yet to come; this will be in the last two-plus years before the World Cup. However, there is need for a vision to think beyond the World Cup, which is why we plan to develop our maintenance business. Additionally, Qatar is gearing up to become more of a tourist destination, which means there is significant room for further growth.</p><h4>What other major investment opportunities are there for international investors?</h4><p>Qatar is extremely focused on sports, education, health, and tourism. These areas all offer excellent areas for investment moving forward. Additionally, the blockade has spurred interest in food security. Investments in this area would undoubtedly lead to great opportunities. Self-reliance is becoming extremely important across many different areas.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for the coming year?</h4><p>Our objective is to continue to play a part in making the country more verdant and beautiful. There is still significant room for growth. There are many beautification projects in the pipeline. We started operations with less than 100 people and now employ around 4,000 people. Our group employs almost 6,000 people and has a portfolio of nearly USD1 billion. This has not been an easy process. Getting to the top is difficult; however, staying on top is more difficult. We need to continue to work hard. Nakheel Landscapes is proud to be a part of the country's success story. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Rumaillah in Qatar?</h4><p>Rumaillah Group was established as a small business with a single product in 1978. The group did well until the recession in the early 1990s, and as a result the chairman was put under pressure to employ someone with expertise in the sector in order to turn the company's fortunes. I accepted the offer after being approached by the company in 1995. Our challenges at the time were huge in terms of recruiting the right people, maintaining a healthy cash flow, and managing staff and customers. Nevertheless, we decided to continue our efforts, and today Rumaillah is an entirely different company with a strong service and product portfolio. We have seven companies that have been involved in major projects in Qatar, and we are currently working on one of the most prestigious projects in Qatar's history—an automated system for the Ministry of Health for which we are working closely with our German suppliers. Other than that, we have helped build several aircraft hangar doors. For example, equipment for Ras Laffan was provided by Rumaillah, which is something the group takes pride in.</p><h4>Given the diversification of the Qatari economy, which industries are becoming attractive for Rumaillah?</h4><p>Due to the upcoming World Cup, the hospitality and construction sectors will thrive over the next five years. Several hotels and restaurants are under construction in order to cater to the growth in demand during the World Cup season. Similarly, new trams will be needed, and Rumaillah is playing an important role in that. At the same time, the government is spending heavily on healthcare and education. Overall, all areas of the economy are growing in tandem, including military and security, because of regional tensions. Rumaillah has products and services to offer for all planned projects, so we are monitoring development in all the sectors.</p><h4>What are Rumaillah Group's plans for expansion abroad?</h4><p>We own a factory called Upton Partitioning, which is based in central England. We also have plans to open a factory in India and Turkey. At present, we have offices in Baku and Jordan. Moreover, the company was involved when Qatar National Bank opened an office in Yemen and Sudan. Notably, Rumaillah has carried out important projects with the US forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. Another important contribution of the company on the international stage is carrying out certain operations for ExxonMobil in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How do you expect the warehousing and storage business to develop in the mid term?</h4><p>Activities in warehousing and storage will be exciting in the next five years because the government has allocating land for various companies to build factories and warehouses. In total, there are three or four such locations in the country, and there is a free zone in the plans as well. All the new warehouses will need equipment, which is something that Rumaillah is well positioned and experienced to offer. Therefore, our outlook is extremely positive and better than before. At the same time, the 2022 FIFA World Cup will bring optimism to the entire country, though the sector that will benefit the most is hospitality.</p><h4>What is Rumaillah group's outlook for 2019?</h4><p>For 2019, we are cautiously optimistic. Rumaillah has a massive expansion plan coming up, and it is building major workshops and stores for 2019. There are multiple projects in the pipeline, and we are recruiting at the moment; the top management sets an example for the lower staff by working hard and showing strong commitment. We treat our employees well, and that is why we have less than 2% staff turnover. I have been in the country and with Rumaillah for 23 years, and this demonstrates my faith in the country, its people, and the company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What flagship projects has ASTAD developed in Qatar?</h4><p>ASTAD has completed more than 250 projects, though there are some projects we really take an honor in having been a part of, such as the Museum of Islamic Art, Qatar Faculty of Islamic Studies, Qatar National Convention Center, and the Lusail Sports Arena. This arena was due for completion for the 2015 World Handball Championship, and despite the tight schedule, it was completed in two years. In 2017, we also worked on three iconic projects: Qatar National Library, Sidra Medicine, and North Western University. We currently have an active project portfolio that includes the National Museum of Qatar, Qatar Foundation Stadium, and several rail projects.</p><h4>How is your international portfolio developing?</h4><p>We recently completed our five-year business strategy with the support of McKinsey and identified strategic partnerships as the way forward with operations abroad. We signed an agreement with a theme park consultancy firm in the US and have done the same with several real estate and construction stakeholders in Korea, Oman, Kuwait, Tunisia, France, Turkey, and the UK as well as in Russia, which will allow us to enter East Europe. As ASTAD grows internationally, we want to strengthen our collaboration with the existing market operators that share the same values. We are investing a lot of time in research and market analysis before collaborating with firms worldwide. We currently have offices and projects in Oman, Kuwait, UK, Sudan, Somalia, and Burkina Faso. We help suitable and carefully selected international partners enter the Qatari market, which has led us to work with leading firms that have worked with the likes of Disney on projects in Qatar.</p><h4>How can any party involved in a construction project benefit from SANAD?</h4><p>SANAD is a solution developed by ASTAD to support the contractual procedures within this region's construction industry. SANAD is the result of a wealth of experience gained by ASTAD after working on many complex projects in numerous sectors. It lays out the best ways of communication and cooperation between the contractor, consultants, and the client in a project. We used internationally known models as a reference and combined that with our expertise in Qatar. We have received positive feedback from contractors and clients in countries including Kuwait and Oman, and market operators now use SANAD locally in Qatar, which is why we now have a version in Arabic. Soon, we will also have it in French to serve as an asset in our international operations. We see SANAD as our social contribution to the construction industry. We took the steps to put together market expertise and share it with the industry at zero cost. The only thing we ask is that the users give us feedback within a year. We have won several awards for SANAD, including an award for social responsibility in engineering in Oman and several recognitions in Qatar.</p><h4>What is the added value of having a local project management company like ASTAD for operations in Qatar?</h4><p>We have more than 800 employees from 62 nationalities and have extensive experience in sectors such as aviation, sports, transportation, residential, education, hospitality, infrastructure, culture, and commercial. We have over 250 projects with a decade of experience within this industry locally, and we work internationally so we are well aware and well versed in the differences between operating within or outside of Qatar. ASTAD has the right mix of skills and a deep understanding of Qatar's construction industry in terms of what the authorities need, what might be acceptable in Qatar, and what will not work in Qatar. We understand contractors and deal with them accordingly. This is one of the reasons we established SANAD, because countries like Qatar do not make money from liquidated damages. All parties in a construction project need to fully understand how a project fits into the future of the country, adding value and reducing the risks and the difficulties involved. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What effect did the embargo have on the company?</h4><p>We landed a solid number of jobs in 2017 and met close to 40-50% of our targets, though things subsequently slowed down. By 4Q2017, we had done about 50% of what we had planned for the year. The main reasons for missing our targets were the embargo and the low oil prices. The entire situation impacted our business. Initially, with the embargo there was some panic, and it took a few weeks for people to settle down. In 2018, we looked at the opportunities that were emerging and the high priority jobs that we wanted to chase. We expected 2018 to be a truly busy year; however, not much happened in the first three months. Many of the jobs that were supposed to be awarded in 1Q2018 were postponed. We have some projects finishing, and we hope new projects will start soon. Looking at the bids and offers we have submitted, we know projects are imminent. Likewise, from the meetings I have had with the major players developing these projects, I know it is just a matter of time before the market bounces back.</p><h4>Are government projects more lucrative than private?</h4><p>We have not stopped pursuing private sector work completely, though we became selective due to the lack of timely payments by clients. Unfortunately, we ended up financing some projects due to late payments. We focus more on government jobs because we know when we will get paid. Things are getting tough in the private sector. It is getting harder to get financing from banks, which is why project owners are struggling. This is partly due to the embargo and oil prices, as well as the current market. Developers are still building towers and new cities, though there are not many people moving in. People need to move with the market and are not doing so. Even if developers can get the financing to build, they cannot get their money back through occupancy or sales to repay the bank. This is where the struggle lies.</p><h4>How do you work to develop a competitive advantage amidst the strong competition between contractors?</h4><p>Now is the perfect time for developers to build because prices are low, and there is a price war ongoing. Unfortunately, clients only look at the price, and not at what the contractor offers. Often, we see a gap of 30-40% between the lowest tender and the next bid, which makes us wonder how the contractor put together such a low bid. Clients typically select the lowest bid. We have had a few cases of being asked to come in and finish a job two or three years later. There are certain companies that are extremely desperate. It does not make sense to put in a tender when they know they will lose money, no matter how desperate they are to win work. Medgulf Construction has not reached a desperate point; we still have jobs, though if nothing changes in 2018, we will reach a difficult point.</p><h4>Will these economic conditions help clean up the sector and get rid of the weaker players?</h4><p>Yes, that is happening currently. In addition, many non-Qatari companies have left the market. This helps Qatari companies like us, though nevertheless there is still a great deal of competition and a strong price war going on.</p><h4>Is the government more objective in viewing the correlation between higher price and better quality construction compared to the private sector?</h4><p>The problem in the construction industry is that every entity, whether public or private, always think developers are ripping them off. We do not do so, though we have to survive and are in the business to make money. Margins are extremely low in today's market. We will be lucky if we break even. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been behind the company's success in the market?</h4><p>The company's unique fast-track strategies, streamlined design, and construction milestones are unlike any other traditional building construction undertaking, resulting in the total delivery of projects in shorter time periods and at competitive prices. UCC has always strived to stand up to its motto “We build trust." Besides this, we continuously invest in our own employees. Clients and authorities believe in and trust us to deliver. To achieve this, within the company we have an integrated management system to plan and integrate quality, safety, and the environment, all in one procedure. Without effective planning, a task can never be completed successfully.</p><h4>What are some of your flagship projects in Qatar, and how do you work to bring innovation to your projects?</h4><p>UCC has been at the forefront for the development of several iconic projects in Qatar that have contributed to the development of Qatar on the global tourism map, from the Banana Island Resort to the magnificent Mall of Qatar, the Sheraton, and the most recent Baladna Farms for strategic food supplies. We do not aim to merely construct a property; we ensure that it has a theme that provides reason for the area around it to develop.</p><h4>How would you assess your relationship with public-sector clients?</h4><p>Public-sector entities are one of our prime clienteles; around 70% of our work is done with the public sector. There are several positives and negatives associated with this that adds to our challenges. Public sector clients in Qatar are prompt and professional; their needs and requirements are well defined, making execution more practical and targets more achievable. We have been extremely successful with public clients for the past seven years and have received much acclaim for the work delivered. Projects in public sector work are mostly managed through one-sided contracts. Though this is to likely change soon; in all my interactions with officials I explain the difficulties corporates face with such contracts. They do understand and are trying to do their best to make contracts more robust as per international best practices.</p><h4>What is your strategy to cater to new clients from new industries, and which sectors are most attractive as real estate clients?</h4><p>Our target projects come from the public sector, as a result of which we get little space for private clients. There are many real estate developers in the market looking for opportunities to invest and create township-based projects in Qatar. However, this can be realized only if there is a strategic move by the government to increase the number of expats in the country. In addition, we strongly believe that the government should invest in free zones to encourage international companies to invest in with their skilled management. If a business opens here, it will bring in employees, who will bring in their families, which creates a need for schools, hospitals, and more. Thus, construction companies would have more opportunities in the market. This is also the best way to attract businesses from abroad, and it will help the economy for years to come.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Though we expect to see challenges in the sector in the coming years, with the government's keen interest to develop the tourism sector and a consistent political regime, we can see a continuous flow of projects in the country until 2030 for sure. We are all geared to expand our business portfolio in providing construction and turnkey solutions, especially in projects where all our resources can be of support. While we face challenges from the siege and the global economy, which have made budgets somewhat constrained, we look forward to contributing our best as a Qatari local company. As for now, we are eagerly waiting to commence work on the new prestigious project awarded to us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the company's key projects?</h4><p>The company is owned by a Qatari entrepreneur, with a solid reputation in the region. We have signed off on the police training institute, new ministry buildings, three schools, and a huge number of private and government developments. The company's turnover exceeds QAR1 billion per year as a contractor, and as a group exceeds QAR2.5 billion. The company employs 6,000 people in Qatar, and we have a diverse workforce. A large number of assets are 100%-owned by the company. We deliver a quality project that fulfills each aspect of our customers' desires. We also have an excellent safety track record and just hit 4 million hours without a major incident, which is a major milestone. Since the blockade, we have focused more on manufacturing, having acquired a number of factories. All the projects we are currently working on were awarded after the blockade. We are committed to sustaining local businesses and local manufacturing units and have worked to utilize Qatari firms to bolster their economic health. We have our own manufacturing and assembly processes as well, and have made huge investments in these areas. The plan is to have the largest aluminum plant in the region within five years. We have a number of concrete plants, a ductwork factory, two carpentry workshops that produce high-quality wooden doors, and other companies that provide valuable supply services. These companies can also supply other local contractors. This allows us to supply projects across the country. </p><h4>Which business opportunities has Qatar's industrial revival created for the construction sector?</h4><p>Since the blockade, many new factories have been established. This is especially true when it comes to daily-use products. While we can, and do, build such factories, they do not produce the materials or products we need for our own core business. However, the company has a huge farm that produces foodstuffs for the open market. We have not mass-produced in volume, but are working to build our capacity, which is part of our investment portfolio. One of the main reasons why the local market has been successful since the blockade has been the effort put into making the economy sustainable. We have put considerable resources into finding solutions to problems being faced and have engineered many solutions. It has cost us more sometimes, though we have maintained same quality levels. This speaks to the strength of the business community and the creativity of the nation as a whole. We decided to not go around the blockade, but to tackle it head-on by reengineering and redesigning our economy and business. This has worked well, to the extent that we have added QAR500 million to our order books as a result and expect to add a further QAR1.6 billion. Competition is getting tougher, though we have the criteria for success. This has been helpful in stimulating business and growing our workforce and operations. Retaining, training, and acquiring great staff has also been important for us. Our focus on acquiring great companies to help us execute has also been a key to our success. </p><h4>What are Hassanesco's priorities for 2019?</h4><p>We are qualified for a number of major government projects. We want to maintain our current clients and remain a part of the local economy's success. We will continue working with local companies and the government on its projects. We want to be a part of the airport expansion and have our own private investment portfolio that we intend to expand. We also own a small hotel. Our strategy is to maintain growth and local manufacturing, and we are keen to retain and develop our staff. Our ultimate goal is to become the preeminent choice for contracting in the country. We want to first contribute to the local market and show off the ability of Qatari companies to compete at the international level. 2019 promises to be a busy year for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Redco's main recent developments and projects?</h4><p>Redco Construction Almana has been building up its reputation in the local industry for over 20 years and has an enormous track record of delivering large projects across Qatar. We play a particularly large role in meeting the National Vision targets, especially in the hospitality sector, a main component of the World Cup's infrastructure requirements. We completed the InterContinental Doha-The City and the Crowne Plaza Hotel, and are now completing around seven more hospitality projects such as the Novotel, Sofitel, Dusit 5-star, Marriot Executive, Dohalive, and QIMC Tower, in addition to one more in Doha Oasis. In the mixed-used line, we are involved in different parts of the local construction sector as a main contractor. We even completed the Qatar Foundation Research and Development Complex, the second-largest such facility in the Middle East, which accommodates 600-700 scientists. We were part of the Handball World Cup in 2015, building the third stadium in less than 14 months, including a 65-room, five-star hotel and the Handball Federation's offices. We also built underground parking with VIP cinemas at the Souq Waqif. We did the mock up stadium for the World Cup before the Qatar bid that had a movable roof, with all the energy and solar equipment. This is how FIFA was able to visit and witness precisely how Qatar would factor air-conditioning technology into the World Cup venues. We have also done iconic projects, including the Abraj Quartier Gateway Towers that can be seen when entering The Pearl. </p><h4>What importance do you place on quality and environmentally friendly practices?</h4><p>Our projects are the highest quality available anywhere in Qatar. 70% of a project's success comes from the quality of its craftsmanship, and safety and quality go hand-in-hand at Redco. As a prominent local contractor operating at international standards, we have our own managers and directors overseeing these aspects. Regarding sustainability, we adapt to the requirements of clients. In Lusail, we completed five office buildings and company headquarters, where sustainability is as much a requirement as it is for the work we have done for the Qatar Foundation. Even if a project is not pursuing a sustainable certification, we still incorporate sustainable principles into the design and construction process to maximize value for clients. We internally recycle and treat resources like water as a means of reducing our costs and protecting the environment. Within our group, we have a department and subsidiary that assist clients in implementing sustainable practices through minor changes in the design during the construction. Practicing this approach in construction has become a requirement for most, if not all, of our projects, especially after the blockade. We strive to procure locally available materials, practice recycling to reduce waste, and ensure high welfare and safety standards for our people.</p><h4>Which parts of the group are capitalizing on manufacturing opportunities?</h4><p>A decade ago, Redco established sister companies to cover any gaps in the construction field, like ready-mix, aluminum, glass, electromechanical fit out, and facility management. We were already producing in-house materials such as aluminum and glass. After the blockade, our plants became busier. And now, to assist in economic security we are also establishing another subsidiary to assist in Qatar's food security using high technology systems in agriculture that can withstand our harsh weather conditions. As a Qatar-owned family business, we are keen to be part of the solution to the blockade and help in the food security of the country. We are negotiating with the government and Qatar Development Bank to share the financing of the high-technology farm. The Qatar Foundation wants us to take on the project because the technology we bring will assist its own research. Together with our international partners, Redco Construction Almana has developed an improved system specifically for Qatar's weather, an efficient cooling system with power savings of more than 25% and water saving of 90%. Cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, herbs, and lettuce are some of the products that we are planning to produce. We will also develop additional businesses, as products will have to be packaged and distributed following quality control inspection. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar is working to have stronger business relations with countries beyond the GCC region. What is the role of Qatari Diar in this regard?</h4><p>Qatari Diar is the real estate investment arm of the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). Our working capital is around USD40 billion, and we are active in 22 countries across five continents. In Africa, we are present in Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Sudan, and in Asia, we operate in Turkey and Malaysia. In Europe, we are mostly focused on the UK, where we have our own offices and work as developers. In the UK and the US, we have a combined working capital of around USD10 billion. We follow a growth strategy that mainly focuses on mature markets such as Europe and America. At present, we are seeking to enter Germany, which is an interesting market. Qatari Diar's business model does not limit it to invest in solid businesses with high feasibility prospects; we also want to contribute to the communities and countries where we are active as developers. A great example is the development of downtown Washington DC,, which used to have a high crime rate and community issues; however, things started to improve after we carried out the development project. We work internationally either by participating as a capital investor or a partner—which is mostly done in the US, where we do not have a development team and work with international mega-developers with a local know-how, such as Hines and Tishman. Notably, we have an actual presence as a developer in the UK, where we also engage in joint ventures. We are currently handling two projects without any partners in the UK: Chelsea Barracks and the former US embassy in Mayfair—currently known as Rosewood Hotel. We have mega-development projects in London, Manchester, and other areas within the UK. In sum, our strategy is to grow and maximize our economic benefits while being mindful of the communities in which we are working; we refer to such projects as transformative projects. Qatar, as a country, is keen to make global investments, and we have been doing the same since our inception in 2005.</p><h4>How close is the completion of the development project of Lusail City, and what further investments can we expect?</h4><p>All our infrastructure projects in Lusail will be completed by 2020. Lusail will be a one-of-a-kind smart city covering an area of 38sqkm, housing up to 450,000 people. Lusail's football stadium will host the final match of the 2022 World Cup, and the stadium will be surrounded by restaurants, shopping centers, metro station, and other facilities. Qatari Diar will invest more than QAR10 billion for the construction of buildings—specifically in retail establishments and some offices. Lusail is an extension of Doha, and a highway connects the two. It will contribute to the growth envisaged in the Qatar National Vision 2030 and serve as a catalyst for further investments. Plots of land will be offered on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for three activities: schools, hospitals, and entertainment. For example, an aqua park will be built, and we expect a number of similar establishments to be constructed by local and international investors. The company also works closely with the Qatar Tourism Authority to make sure its strategic needs are met. A new law will come into effect soon that will give Qatari Diar free rein in the area of international investment. Qatar is one of the safest places in the world; people leave their homes and cars unlocked, and there are no problems. All in all, the World Cup will showcase many of Qatar's unique qualities.</p><h4>What is Qatari Diar's outlook for 2019?</h4><p>In Qatar, we will work hard to secure the contracts to develop Lusail's commercial avenues. Globally, we will continue to carry out more projects. Furthermore, we will maintain Qatari Diar's growth rate and fulfill all the objectives set by our board of directors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does MME plan to increase Qatar's performance in terms of sustainability? </h4><p>MME, represented by the Urban Planning Department, inaugurated a number of achievements within the framework of the comprehensive urban plan of the State of Qatar, derived from the state's National Development Strategy, which contributed to the realization of the Qatar National Vision 2030. The plan lays down the principle of enhancing the utilization of available land and the development of land within the urban space of current cities, along with the achievement of a balanced and comprehensive urban development. A culmination of efforts was made in order to establish a systematic planning method that supports the goals of sustained development. The ministry's 2017 achievements include the preparation of the weather change strategy project for Qatar's urban planning and development sector. It aims to set the strategic frame for managing the risks of weather changes facing the planning and urban development sector, based on two main axes—adaptation to and amelioration of effects—concentrating on aspects related to spatial distribution of land use. It includes monitoring policies and tools directing the country's independent sustainable development. This will help MME and other institutions in evaluating and managing the opportunities and challenges related to fast urban development. The ministry also strives to enhance the state's performance in terms of sustainability through a number of actions. In the same context, Qatari municipalities are pursuing varied efforts in the field of spreading sustainability concepts among the public, particularly school students. The purpose is for the municipality to set a strategy to spread sustainability concepts and integrate society into it to realize the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p><h4>How is the livability of Doha expected to increase in 2030?</h4><p>In order to achieve the highest quality standards, a characteristically distinguished lifestyle, the goals of sustainable development, and to fit with the Qatar National Vision 2030, MME prepared a group of strategic projects and sectorial studies. They will offer basic support in connecting all planning levels and updating spatial municipal plans, being the systematic guiding framework regulating all state planning projects. They will provide a suitable framework for supporting investments that contribute to the financial and social dynamics that will ensure the maximization of efficiency standards and raise the standard of the quality of living for both locals and expats. Projects include Qatar State Planning Legislations, the National Guidelines for Urban Design, an evaluation study of Qatar's real estate market, the National Housing Strategy, and a number of other important projects. MME strives, in all its projects, to support the Qatar National Vision 2030 and the implementation of all state sectorial plans in accordance with a comprehensive framework that guarantees the integration of all state sectors.</p><h4>Which policies and actions will be the priorities for MME in the coming year?</h4><p>MME created an annual action program that centers on a group of priorities and executive measures that aim to implement the minister's vision and general policy through: enhancing governance with a group of policies, legislations, and executive guidelines to manage urban planning by finalizing the drafting of Qatari planning legislations and laying the foundation for a planning system that is clear, transparent, and efficient; finalizing the drafting of the Qatari real estate market evaluation to prepare a detailed analytical study of the Qatari supply and demand, and issuing recommendations and indicators to help decision makers and guide urban development processes and state investment decisions; achieving balanced and sustainable urban development through the improvement of the monitoring and evaluation process urban development; providing comprehensive services and intelligent solutions for urban planning to make it easier for customers to receive the services of the urban planning department; and raising the level of coordination between the different departments by providing the necessary infrastructure for various facilities and social services. The aim is to raise the level of urban planning and the efficacy of allocating state resources. The ministry will also strive to activate the electronic allocation system. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a transport provider, how is Mowasalat handling the growth in passenger traffic in the country?</h4><p>I joined the company in 2013, when it introduced technology to enable huge increases in passenger traffic. We have the physical and virtual tools. The former, for example, are human capital, assets, buses, and taxis, whereas the latter are the applications, including the real-time bus application. This gives users all the information about the buses, such as when they arrive and when they depart. For taxis, our app has a meter that measures the price of the ride and shows a phone number to call if there are any problems. At present, we have four private franchise operators using our taxis. They operate the same models of vehicles with the same turquoise color, but can be distinguished by their different roof-top colors.</p><h4>Qatar is promoting itself abroad as a friendly country for tourists. How do you work to improve the tourism experience?</h4><p>We have several agreements with Hamad International Airport and the Qatar National Tourism Council to provide our taxi services in places such as the ports. Our taxis and buses transport tourists from cruise ships to their excursions, and over the recent years, we have witnessed the increasing importance of cruise tourism. In the near future, there are many opportunities for us in the tourism sector, the number one being the FIFA World Cup 2022. Notably, Mowasalat will provide transport services to spectators and players. The upcoming World Cup is a major event for the country, and we are going to be there with top-notch support logistics throughout the entire tournament. We are expecting more than 1 million tourists. Keeping that in mind, we will dedicate 2,500 buses for spectators. At Mowasalt, environmental concerns are taken seriously, and in that sense, the company is increasing the number of CNG and electric buses in operation.</p><h4>The opening of the Doha Metro is in 2019. How are you coordinating to provide a comprehensive transport system?</h4><p>We have agreements with Qatar Rail to provide them with feeder buses, which will transfer passengers to and from metro stations. We are experiencing different approaches, such as conventional taxis, for example. We will have 50 feeder buses running when the metro opens, and these buses will operate around the clock. We will also have some minivans to help passengers reach points of interests in the most practical way. </p><h4>What are the priorities for the company in 2019 and beyond?</h4><p>The outlook for 2019 looks positive, although we have many challenges. The whole country and the companies working on the 2022 FIFA World Cup are working on how to transport spectators, because all of us want to avoid unexpected incidents; we are planning the best possible ways to reduce risks. Qatar is secure compared to other parts of the world, which is a positive aspect. In the future, the government wants Mowasalat to do an IPO, but that depends on how the company progress in the near future. We will see where future progress is being made and make a decision based on business and profitability. The school transport business is our main driver for growth, and with new schools opening in the country, we have good prospects for this business line, which will be decisive for the IPO. We transfer 60,600 students every day using 2,160 buses, and remarkably, our numbers are growing every year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the QTerminals project about?</h4><p>QTerminals is a joint venture between Mwani Qatar, which owns 51%, and Milaha (Qatar Navigation), which owns 49%. It is a joint government and private sector initiative to form a company to operate Phase I of Hamad Port. Phase I consists of container terminal 1 (CT1), the general cargo terminal (GCT), the multi-user terminal (MUT), which handles Ro-Ro for vehicles, machinery, and live animals, and the offshore supply services terminal (OST). During QTerminals' early days both Mwani and Milaha provided support services such as legal, HR, IT, and purchasing to help us set up our own expertise.</p><h4>How has the connectivity of the port evolved since its establishment, and how did the blockade impact your plans for increased connectivity?</h4><p>Before the blockade, Qatar traded with a narrow range of countries. Immediately after the blockade, Qatar had to find new partners. It was incumbent on the business community to create an environment where the changes could take place quickly, and I am pleased to say that it succeeded. Post blockade, Qatar has a significantly higher number of countries with whom it trades, and it has increased its core business group from about seven or eight countries to over 25. New trade lanes and diplomatic channels have been opened, and business within Qatar has found new partners in new geopolitical locations. Even if problems continue within the GCC, Qatar now has much broader trade, which is a great development. The types of relationships have also expanded, for example with Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, China, and India. Europe has always had a strong relationship with Qatar, and the UK recently announced a joint squadron with the Qatari air force. The US also has one of its largest bases in the region in Qatar. Similarly, Turkey also has a base here and both countries continue to enjoy a historic, strategic relationship. Before the blockade, the average monthly container throughput was close to 40,000TEUs, and after the blockade, we are at about 110,000TEUs, an increase of over 2.5 times. We could not have done this without our staff, who have stepped up and delivered a fantastic level of service.</p><h4>How will the Expansion Phase II of the port advance the positioning of Hamad Port internationally?</h4><p>CT1 is becoming extremely busy, therefore, we need to expand the container handling capacity in Hamad Port, and the easiest way to do that is by developing Container Terminal 2 (CT2). We plan to build a similar conventional operation in CT2 to maximize synergies between the two terminals. With both CT1 and CT2 operational, we will be able to handle the domestic import increase YoY. Qatar's GDP is increasing, and its disposable income is also growing. As a rule of thumb, we generally multiply GDP by 1.5 in order to make a rough estimate for the percentage increase in containerized and non-containerized throughput in Hamad Port. We are developing Hamad Port as a transshipment hub and have already transshipped containers via Hamad Port to other locations such as Iraq, Kuwait, and the Sub-Continent. </p><h4>What are the priorities for QTerminals in 2019?</h4><p>Our priority is to consolidate and strengthen delivery of services in Hamad Port, which is our benchmark and home port. We want to ensure that everything is stable and services are delivered to the highest standards. One of our projects moving forward is to expand overseas. Our clients are pleased with QTerminals and Hamad Port and are familiar with our quality, and as long as we can take that excellence overseas, they would be happy to work with us. We are proud to play a part in the diplomatic drive to create new partnerships and trade lines and participate in developing the Qatari brand overseas. In terms of its own business development, Qatar has done extremely well. The business community has adapted well, and moving forward, QTerminals will continue to play a leading role in enabling and facilitating trade with Qatar. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the recent integration of robotic process automation (RPA) solutions into your operations imply for your client base?</h4><p>Over the last year, we have been undergoing a significant digital transformation across the organization, and RPA is one of the technologies we have deployed. We are extremely proud of RPA as we are one of the few companies in the region to successfully deploy this technology. It essentially simplifies our back-office operations, reduces and eliminates human error, and automates routine clerical tasks. What distinguishes it is that it is not an idle system—it monitors, learns, and executes, which means that its potential is virtually endless. This gives us significant advantages directly related to our customers through faster, more streamlined, and accurate processes. At present, digital international start-ups in our sector are seeking our experience in deploying robotics, and that is a sign of the progress we have made. We have taken a leapfrog strategy to jump significantly in technology implementation, as we needed to stay ahead of the curve. Our vision is to be the partner of choice for our customers, and in order to do that, we need to be truly advanced in the way we serve our customers.</p><h4>What are your plans for expansion to increase or start direct shipment capacity?</h4><p>Since the blockade, we have deployed many new routes, ramped up our operations, and opened direct shipping lines to Oman, India, Pakistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. What the blockade did was fast tracking some of the plans we already had in place as it created a higher demand. We are proud of the speed and efficiency we demonstrated in deploying our network. At the moment, we are seeing additional pickup in transshipment, which is a great sign for the logistics industry. With the availability of Milaha Logistics City, free zones, and economic zones, more facilities are now available for the re-export market. The physical infrastructure is there and proven, and the next step is to look at the soft infrastructure, which include regulations, rules, laws, and investment incentives that will facilitate trade.</p><h4>What are Milaha's prospects for the export activity of Qatar, especially in non-oil sectors?</h4><p>Milaha is the largest supply chain enabler in Qatar, and we are proud partners of the largest players in the non-oil and gas sector as we offer a unique approach whereby we are directly or indirectly involved in every part of the supply chain. In terms of the maritime and logistics pillar of Milaha, we are involved directly in the container shipping, logistics, and port sides through our investment in QTerminals, which is currently managing and operating Phase I of Hamad Port. Additionally, we have our shipping agency side, export and import clearances, and a huge network of reliable agents at a global level. Having strong logistics is a way of supporting our clients so that we are able to make sure they have a matching import and export process. Being connected across the chain is one of the unique things that we can provide and leverage. </p><h4>How is Milaha Logistics City going to change the landscape of logistics in Qatar?</h4><p>The logistics sector of Qatar is already the second biggest among Arab countries, according to the World Bank Logistics Performance Index. It is also within the top 30 worldwide, which demonstrates the vision of Qatar's leaders. We have launched the first phase of the 400,000-sqm Milaha Logistics City (MLC), which has already made its mark on Qatar's logistics scene. As we continue to develop the facility, MLC will enable economic diversification beyond the oil and gas industry. It will also create value for end consumers and attract more regional and international customers. Additionally, Qatar will be able attract more cargo volume to its ports, which will help turn Hamad Port and airport into the transshipment hubs of choice. In the long run, the replication of MLC in different locations within the country will enable Qatar to take the lead as the Gulf's logistics center.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the role of Mwani Qatar in securing the supply of goods for the Qatari market?</h4><p>Mwani Qatar plays many roles in this aspect, in accordance with the Ministry of Transport and Communications' strategic plan. In fact, one of the most important goals is to overcome all obstacles to doing business in the state by providing a stable and reliable supply chain to meet the growing needs of the local market under all circumstances. We have come a long way in this respect, thanks to the close relationships that have been established with international port authorities and players in the maritime transport sector, which enabled our ports to play a major role in ensuring the smooth flow of goods, providing reliable services to our local and international customers, reducing long waiting periods for consignees to receive their goods, and ensuring access of Qatari products to the global markets.</p><h4>How have Qatari ports performed over the course of 2018?</h4><p>2018 was a record-breaking year for Qatari ports. Mwani Qatar's performance shows a continued upward trend. We saw a 70% increase in the number of containers handled in Mwani ports. Vessel calls jumped 24% in 2018 to 4,781 ships. As a remarkable feat, over 1.41 million tons of general and bulk cargo, 957,000 livestock, 71,000 vehicles, and 324,000 tons of building materials were handled at Mwani Qatar ports in 2018.</p><h4>As Qatar expands its commercial reach beyond the GCC, which new trade routes are being established?</h4><p>Mwani Qatar is working with its partners to set up Hamad Port as a transshipment hub for the region. Within a short period of time, the port has reached global port connectivity coverage, offering 28 direct services to more than 50 ports worldwide. Most of these ports are Qatar's most important economic partners. Opening new and direct shipping routes has provided the right tools to increase trade with these countries, as transit times have been drastically reduced, and the supply chain has become more reliable. Hamad Port's share in the volume of trade in Qatar in terms of exports and imports has reached 95%, which makes the port an important part of the economy and contributes effectively to people's daily lives. It has acquired a 28% share in the volume of trade in the Middle East.</p><h4>Mwani Qatar recently underwent a rebranding transformation. To what extent will this new identity contribute to position Qatar's port internationally?</h4><p>Mwani Qatar's new brand identity is just a part of larger plans and additional strategies set by the board of directors headed by Jassim Bin Seif Ahmed Al-Sulaiti, Minister of Transport and Communications, to enhance Mwani Qatar's contribution to the national economy and meet future aspirations. It will further contribute to open new horizons of growth and continuous improvement for Qatar's ports, supporting the company's strength and solidifying its position to become the forefront of maritime companies working in the field of ports and logistics in the region and beyond.</p><h4>What will be the priorities for Mwani Qatar for 2019?</h4><p>We will focus on the implementation of plans and objectives set by the board of directors, including expanding Hamad Port's direct shipping networks and services provided to our customers, establishing new partnerships, supporting efforts aimed at increasing the contribution of the company's facilities in the national economy, and promoting economic diversification in the state. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The growth of Turkish airlines has been extraordinary in the last decade. What have been the major internal drivers?</h4><p>As a member of Star Alliance, and an award-winning airline, Turkish Airlines takes its strength from its ever-expanding fleet, flight network, and the significant position of Istanbul as a global transfer hub connecting the world. With over 120 countries in its network, Turkish Airlines is the airline with the biggest coverage in the world. It also has ambitious expansion plans to become one of the world's five leading airlines and expand to new destinations. We are flying to more countries than any airline in the world. Moving forward, Turkish Airlines is planning to extend its capacity by moving to Istanbul's new airport. Moreover, 60 wide body aircraft will be acquired in the coming years. </p><h4>What are some of the current plans to innovate customer experience for Turkish Airlines client base?</h4><p>Turkish Airlines has been investing heavily in travel experience. The company has been developing steadily in terms of new destinations and aircraft capacity to meet the needs of its wide customer base. Within this scope, investments have been made to offer high-end customer services both on board and at the airport. Turkish Airlines strives to develop the travel experience to an even higher level and considers customer satisfaction an essential value to ensuring that each guest leaves the aircraft with memorable experiences. The new airport will also be adding value to the travel experience in terms of pre-boarding services in a brand-new environment offering high-end airport services.</p><h4>An important share of the operations of Turkish airlines takes place in the Gulf region. Has the geopolitical landscape of the region affected your operations? </h4><p>Demand may occasionally vary for some destinations due to seasonal or geopolitical issues, but as a global airline, and at the crossroads of all continents, Turkish Airlines operates flights to more than 300 destinations in more than 120 countries; its operations are conducted according to global demand. Thus, our company adapts its strategies to a sustainable operational activity. </p><h4>What is the importance of Doha as an air hub for your operations in the Middle East?</h4><p>Doha and the Middle East in general have been developing through the years to become an important hub. Turkish Airlines operates 14 weekly flights from Doha to Turkey and other international destinations covered by its wide global network. Thus, Doha offers interesting transit market share opportunities for airlines operating in the region.</p><h4>How do you expect the airline sector to behave in the Middle East in the short-term?</h4><p>Air traffic in the Middle East has been growing steadily during the last decade. Accordingly, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts a total profit of USD600 million in 2018 for airlines there, above the expectations of 2017, but below 2016 figures. Considering the future of air travel, the Middle East is expected to grow at a higher rate than other big European or American markets. </p><h4>What is Turkish Airlines' outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>With its continuously expanding network of over 300 destinations across more than 120 countries served by more than 320 aircrafts, Turkish Airlines will continue to invest in the development of its network with the delivery of new aircraft in upcoming years. The total number of passengers carried by Turkish Airlines rose by 9.3% to reach 68.6 million in 2017 and in 1Q2018, Turkish Airlines reached its highest quarterly load factor at 80.5%. With the opening of the New Airport in Istanbul, the total number of passengers is targeted to reach 74 million, including 33 million on domestic routes and 41 million on international routes. Accordingly, Turkish Airlines will also be increasing the number of employees, including experienced captains and first officers, who will become a part of the company's continued growth and success. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your training offer developed since the establishment of the college?</h4><p>Qatar Aeronautical College (QAC) was established in 1977 and we celebrated its 40th anniversary in December 2018. At the time of its establishment, QAC focused only on pilot training, and due to the airline market's growth in the Gulf in the 1980s and 1990s, we added engineering, air traffic control, and meteorology as well as the English language, which complements all our majors to date. We subsequently added new courses for advanced aviation and management that can serve all areas in airports, civil aviation, and even airline administration, which serves ground handling and airport management. We have many partnerships with top organizations in the global aviation industry, including International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), International Air Transport Association (IATA), and Airports Council International (ACI). Since the college's foundation, we have focused on developing our college academics to a high standard. At present, the aviation industry is different than what it was 20 years ago, and with that in mind, we enhanced it with new structures and education tools. Equally important, we implemented a new fleet of 10 diamond aircraft that we received in March 2018. These are highly equipped in terms of avionics technology and have multiple engines. Moreover, the college also built a new A320 simulator-based training for the multi pilot licence.</p><h4>How has QAC contributed to the consolidation of civil aviation in Qatar?</h4><p>We work closely with our regulator, the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority, and the main airline Qatar Airways, as well as the new Hamad Airport and other authorities. As a college, we need to meet the standards of training they require for operating. We train Qatari students and students from the Arab league and Africa, who can either self-sponsor or be sponsored to take one of our programmes. Our engineering programme is certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and our advanced aviation management course is approved by authorities and top organizations in the aviation industry. Notably, we have full gold membership of ICAO and held its global symposium in Doha in December 2018, to be attended by up to 500 aviation expects and participants. The topic will be aviation intelligence, and the event is under the patronage of the Ministry of Transportation and Communication and the General Secretary of ICAO.</p><h4>How would you classify the fleet used to provide training programs at QAC?</h4><p>We have done a case study on the needs of the market in the present aviation field, which resulted in choosing a more cost effective and efficient fleet. Our new diamond fleet is better in terms of fuel and maintenance, and boasts high-level avionics technology. This allows us to familiarize students with the aircraft before their initial flight.</p><h4>What are the priorities of QAC in 2019?</h4><p>For 2019, we are in the process of building new modern facilities and plan on continuing to enhance our learning tools and teaching methods. Also, we will be introducing a post graduate program in the near future. In addition to that, QAC is in the final stage of signing a new agreement with the French Aviation University (ENAC) in partnership with ICAO on aviation industry safety management systems. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Aside from being recognized as fifth-best airport in the world at the SKYTRAX World Airport Awards 2018, what have been the latest milestones and achievements for HIA?</h4><p>HIA received several awards in 2018. We gained the ISO20000 certification for our IT Service Management and the ISO55001 for our asset and facilities management. In October 2018, we successfully completed the first major phase of the Smart Airport program enabling Qatar Airways to process more than 25% of its passengers through self-check-in and baggage-drop.</p><h4>How does HIA plan to attract more visitors?</h4><p>HIA was designed to accommodate 24 million passengers annually, and we currently handle more than 35 million. This is far above our designed capacity, but we aim to further increase passenger numbers. Qatar Airways is expanding to a number of new destinations and waiting on the delivery of new aircraft. Many foreign airline partners are also joining HIA's network, further increasing passenger numbers. In addition, Qatar's Ministry of Interior has started a Visa on Arrival scheme for 80-plus countries.</p><h4>How does HIA work to align its strategy with Qatar's National Vision (QNV) 2030?</h4><p>We see ourselves as one of the most important parts of the transportation pillar of QNV 2030. Given the closure of land borders, transport is only possible through our ports or airports, which is one of the reasons we see an increase in passenger numbers and airlines.</p><h4>What is HIA's outlook for 2019 and beyond?</h4><p>Our challenge is the expansion of the airport; we will be extremely busy with this mega project. At the same time, we need to make sure we continue to focus on our customers and provide them with a seamless experience. The preparation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup started two years ago, and we have had enough time to create innovative plans that are now in place. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The airline has become extremely important for Qatar to overcome the blockade. What has been the role of the airline in keeping Qatar connected to the world?</h4><p>Qatar Airways has launched 24 destinations since the start of the blockade and continues with its significant program of expansion of new routes to further connect passengers around the globe. We currently connect more than 160 destinations every day through our Doha hub, the award-winning Hamad International Airport (HIA). Qatar Airways has launched an array of exciting new destinations recently, including Mombasa, Kenya; Da Nang, Vietnam; and Gothenburg, Sweden. The airline will add a number of exciting new destinations to its extensive route network in 2019, including Valletta in Malta and Isfahan in Iran, to name just a few.</p><h4>What will be the priorities of Qatar Airways as a group over 2019?</h4><p>Qatar Airways has a long-term strategy. We are growing and expanding at an aggressive rate, but through proper planning. We have many exciting new plans lined up for 2019. We will introduce our brand-new economy class seat in March, announce and launch new destinations, and continue to roll out our award-winning Qsuite Business Class seat to new destinations. We will also continue to roll out our state-of-the-art Airbus A350 aircraft and expand our 'Super-Wi-Fi' across our fleet. Qatar Airways is proud to be one of the youngest global airlines to serve all six continents, and thanks to our customers' response to our offerings, we are also the fastest-growing airline in the world. With more people travelling than ever before, our commitment to service is paramount.</p><h4>How is Qatar Airways working to attract a bigger share of passengers to visit the country for longer and fuel the local tourism industry?</h4><p>HIA is the home of Qatar Duty Free (QDF) and met several significant milestones in 2018, including being ranked thefifth-best airport in the world, fourth-best for shopping, and fifth-best for dining at the Skytrax World Airport Awards 2018. Notably, HIA also took home the title of 'Best Airport in the Middle East' for the fourth year in a row and 'Best Staff Service in the Middle East' for the third consecutive year. In order to boost tourism, in 2017, the Ministry of Interior (MoI), Qatar Tourism Authority (QTA), and Qatar Airways announced that Qatar will allow visa-free entry for citizens of 80 countries, effective immediately. Moreover, Discover Qatar, the destination management subsidiary arm of Qatar Airways, announced in 2018 its latest selection of pre-bookable city and desert tours for transit passengers. Initially launched in 2015, the transit tours are aimed at passengers with a transfer time of between five and 12 hours at HIA. The latest selection of tours includes visiting key landmarks such as The Pearl-Qatar for the finest quality shops and restaurants; Katara Cultural Village, a center dedicated to celebrating arts and heritage; Souq Waqif, for traditional jewelry, spices, and handicrafts; and the Museum of Islamic Art (MIA). In addition, passengers can book a unique desert experience and visit Sealine Beach and the sand dunes of Mesaieed either in the exclusive off-road monster bus or a luxury 4x4 vehicle during their stopover. Alongside city and desert tours, transit passengers can also book the 'Stop &amp; Shop' tour, which offers a chauffeur-driven car to the Mall of Qatar—home to luxury fashion brands and world-class restaurants. </p><h4>How have you managed to bring Qatar Airways to its current form and, at the same time, put Qatar on the map?</h4><p>Qatar Airways is renowned for its customer service and Arabian hospitality, striving to make every trip a pleasant and memorable one. Qatar Airways' on-board service features sophisticated meals designed by celebrated chefs, up to 4,000 entertainment options, and Wi-Fi via Oryx One as well as some of the most spacious seats in the air. Qatar Airways is proud to contribute to the National Vision 2030. We promote the State of Qatar and our brand through many prominent and prestigious international sporting events, such as the 2022 FIFA World Cup, of which we are the biggest sponsor. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In terms of civil aviation safety standards, what steps has Qatar taken?</h4><p>Since 2015, our focus has been on updating all existing regulations to improve our aviation safety and security standards. Safety is a central pillar of aviation, and to this end we have made significant achievements such as the memorandum of understanding with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and immediately implementing all the necessary changes related to air transport, air safety, navigation systems, and meteorology measurements. We have coordinated with all stakeholders, including Hamad International Airport, Doha International Airport, Qatar Airways, Qatar Armed Forces, Qatar Aeronautical College, and Gulf Helicopter to implement these regulatory changes as quickly and smoothly as possible. We have also established a safety data collection and processing system (SDCPS) for monitoring of occurrences and hazards impacting safety. In addition, within the framework of its State Safety Program (SSP), Qatar has established an Acceptable Level of Safety Performance (ALoSP) based on prescriptive, risk-based, and performance-based approaches in line with the strategic objectives of the Regional and Global Air Navigation Plans and the Global Aviation Safety Plan (GASP). Lately, the State of Qatar has achieved excellent effective implementation (EI) scores in various categories covered under the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Universal Safety Oversight Audit Program (USOAP), maintaining an average of 100% in both air navigation services and legislations, and a total rate of 92%.</p><h4>Qatar is strengthening its cooperation with ICAO on the back of the recent opening of a permanent office. How can we expect cooperation between the two parties to evolve?</h4><p>We have always been keen to maintain excellent relations and strong collaboration with ICAO, and over the past year, we have also strengthened coordination by opening a permanent office of the State of Qatar at ICAO's headquarters in Montreal. We have already implemented important changes to our structure, one of which is the establishment of an independent Accident Investigation Unit, under Law No. 15 of 2002 on Civil Aviation as Amended and Amiri Decision 67 of 2018 that will function fully independent from QCAA. The unit will have its own budget and dedicated responsibilities in line with ICAO Annex 13. Additionally, Qatar has started a candidacy campaign to become a full member at the ICAO Council in the elections during ICAO Assembly's 40th Session. In support of ICAO initiatives and helping countries develop their civil aviation sector in line with global industry standards, Qatar, represented by QCAA, has provided financial support of USD1 million to ICAO's “No Country Left Behind" initiative to ensure better coordination and implementation of standards and recommended practices at the global level with regard to aviation security management and facilitation activities, particularly in priority areas including safety, aviation, and aviation security.</p><h4>Qatar is currently negotiating comprehensive air services agreement with several parties. How will they advance Qatar's air transport sector?</h4><p>We are fully committed to the expansion strategy in terms of increasing our air service and bilateral agreements with new countries, to obtain more traffic routes and rights, which will increase the number of passengers through Hamad International Airport and add new destinations to Qatar Airways' global network. Since June 2017, we have established a deeper collaboration with ICAO and local stakeholders to continue increasing air connectivity for Qatar. To date, we have established four new inbound routes and three new outbound routes. Additionally, QCAA has developed a policy to ensure the principle of open skies within agreements signed with other countries and encouraged the national carrier to enter into cooperative commercial arrangements with foreign airlines. In this regard, QCAA has succeeded in concluding air services agreements with new countries and amending some existing ones, thus increasing the total number of signed agreements to 166. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the company's position and developments over the last 30 years?</h4><p>Seashore Group of Companies started as a small company, with 14 employees. Our first important project was construction in the port of Qatar. When we completed the port project, we expanded to almost 200 people and a large equipment base. With our equipment and expanded manpower, we were able to take on projects in Qatar from the beginning to the end. We became fairly stable in terms of our financing and industry knowledge. When Qatar's oil and gas sector boomed, we established our second company to keep up with the country's construction needs. We started a factory for waste management, and are currently responsible for nearly 70% of waste removal and processing. We have a fleet of almost 700 trucks and are the major player in this area within the country. We work closely with the government and are interested in pursuing similar long-term policy goals. Over the last 30 years, we have developed numerous companies to keep us abreast of national developments and now have 18 companies. Additionally, we also export steel to 30 countries, especially after the blockade. We export to the UK, Jordan, Dubai, Italy, Pakistan, India, and many others.</p><h4>What major projects have you completed in Qatar?</h4><p>We are working hard to help the government develop its undersea pipelines. Specifically, we have a contract to manufacture equipment to repair the pipeline infrastructure, and work is currently ongoing. We are the first company in the Middle East with these specific and specialized equipment possibilities. We also manufacture steel in the country. We have fully automated plants and currently manufacture around 400 tons of steel per day. Additionally, we have plans to increase capacity. As the World Cup approaches, there will be more demand for steel. We are now in the midst of pipe manufacturing in some of our newer plants. Manufacturing in Qatar has clear advantages. The country's constructions sector demands materials, and there are countries in the region where these materials can also be exported. Energy prices are also low, and the manpower is extremely competent.</p><h4>How will the expansion of the North Field affect your operations in the coming years?</h4><p>We welcome these initiatives by the government to expand its energy production, as it has a tremendous spillover effect on the economy and the companies working in the country. The last few years have been quiet, though we are hopeful about the upcoming projects. We support the government's efforts, and the government is also keen to support business and development. We are pleased to have such ambitious projects announced in this environment. The government is supportive of industry, and industry is supportive of it. We are particularly well positioned to capitalize on these new projects because we have a great deal of experience and know-how in this area. We have been handling some of the most important projects in the country, and we have a high standard of development.</p><h4>What types of new projects are you currently involved in?</h4><p>We have been involved in number of new projects in a few areas, particularly environmental protection. We are working on ensuring that environmental waste is handled in a proper way. We are taking our technology and know-how from different countries. We have brought technology from India and New Zealand, and we have seen important success thus far. In the last few years, Qatar has developed a great deal in terms of technology.</p><h4>What will be the priorities for Seashore group in 2019?</h4><p>We will focus on optimizing our own operations. Seashore Group of Companies is composed of numerous respected companies, and I am dedicated to making sure our operations are as effective as possible.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why does Coastal Qatar brand itself as “The Challengineers," and what are some of the challenges it has overcome through innovative engineering solutions?</h4><p>We specialize in, and really enjoy, executing challenging projects. Our project portfolio rarely contains any ordinary ones. We try to avoid projects that are routine and with a large number of competitors. We thrive on projects that push the boundaries of engineering innovation and creativity, and that force us to come up with innovative ideas and solutions. The Emiri terminal at the airport was one complex project we worked on. Others include the Khalifa Stadium, the National Museum of Qatar, and the Aspire Dome. The company has been structured with divisions that support each other, and there are synergies between the divisions, allowing us to carry out the majority of our works inhouse. Notably, we have steel, construction, steel fabrication, galvanizing, and trading divisions. We are by design a lean and agile organization where decision processes are optimized to address challenges instantly. Our team of specialized engineers and highly skilled and dedicated workforce has been and will remain our main strength. </p><h4>Coastal Qatar will manufacture seats for the 2022 FIFA World Cup stadiums. What does it mean for the country to have these produced locally?</h4><p>Coastal has a contract in place for the manufacture and installation of seats for six FIFA World Cup 2022 stadiums, totaling about 300,000 seats. Being able to contribute to such an important component of the stadiums is definitely something the company is proud of. The seats are an important part of the spectator experience and our seats are manufactured to the highest standards with technology transfer from our partner Forum Seating. Our seats can compete with any of the leading brands in the international market. Our goal is to showcase Coastal seats in the global market as a quality Qatari product. </p><h4>Qatar is experiencing a shift toward local production. Do you have plans to expand your in-country production capacity? </h4><p>The current direction of the company is to be a leading manufacturer of construction related products. We are witnessing a huge construction buildup as we approach 2022, which opens up multiple opportunities for local manufacturers. As mandated by the 2030 vison, we will continue to support a diversified economy. With the development of infrastructure like ports and improved connectivity, we will have better access to global markets. We are in the process of setting up manufacturing facilities to produce products in short supply due to the blockade. We will soon be manufacturing street lighting posts, including high masts and antenna poles, and road crash barriers in partnership with a leading German company. These products sit well with our existing steel fabrication and galvanizing facilities and enhance the synergies between our divisions.</p><h4>What is your approach to offer green business solutions?</h4><p>The environment is something the company and I personally take great interest in. The company's galvanizing plant has been built in line with European environmental standards, which are over and above the requirements of local legislation. For our seat manufacturing, we use recycled material as mandated by the Supreme Committee. We work with various local recycling companies to recycle the majority of our waste and ensure that only the bare minimum ends up in landfills. </p><h4>What are your goals and ambitions for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have a positive outlook for the year ahead, especially in the sectors we are operating in. Our primary focus right now is on infrastructure and World Cup related projects. We are ahead of schedule on most of our projects and confident on meeting the deadlines of the projects in hand. There are, however, challenges that will arise as the World Cup approaches. We are in the process of gearing up to meet these, which are potential opportunities for Coastal. We are confident of overcoming the challenges with our innovative ideas and engineering expertise, after all, we are the Challengineers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[making-the-made-in-qatar-brand-better]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the “Made in Qatar" brand being advanced at a factory level?</h4><p>Most of the industries in Qatar are focusing on making the “Made in Qatar" brand better. There are huge efforts ongoing in a growing number of sectors. Fortunately, we are being supported by the Qatar Development Bank (QDB). It organizes and participates in exhibitions around the world and provides support and facilities to SMEs to participate; it even covers all costs to introduce all the various raw materials being produced in Qatar. The main objective is to promote the “Made in Qatar" brand, as it will consequently impact the economy. It is extremely important for Qatar to focus on exports and inform the market about the development of different industries.</p><h4>How has the company's client base evolved since its establishment? </h4><p>QPPC was established in 1998, and production started in 2000 with the aim of producing FFS bags, shrink film, agriculture film, and blue sleeves for other applications needed by clients for Kahramaa projects. At present, our main obligation is to cater industries in Qatar. They are our main customers; typically more than 90% of our production goes to these companies. When the blockade was imposed, we fulfilled our requirement and focused on these companies. As part of our diversification and in addition to the existing products, QPPC started the commercial production of new wood plastic composite (WPC) products beginning in 2017. We are well positioned in the market for this product and are starting to look at Oman and Kuwait as export markets. Our subsidiary, a wooden pallets manufacturing unit QWPC, started production in 2013. At present our wooden pallets fulfill the demands of QAPCO, Qatofin, QAFCO, Q-Chem, and others. For QWPC, we have brought in an additional semi-automatic production line. This system allows us to make changes to the production process allowing us to better adapt to our clients' needs. </p><h4>What are your priorities in 2019? </h4><p>We want to further position WPC both in the local market and outside of Qatar. We are moving forward positively, thanks to the support of QDC. Another project that we are waiting on is the official announcement and details of the new petrochemical industry. In 2019 and beyond, we want to continue to serve our main clients with the highest possible standards, but at the same time, we want to look into gaining new clients, specially SMEs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-different-strategy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you been working to diversify materials and sources after the blockade?</h4><p>QPMC was established in 2006 to ensure we had adequate stock of the primary materials required for the construction sector from an aggregate point of view as well as washed sand and dune sand. When the blockade took place, most of the supplies came from the UAE, resulting in a huge shortage. QPMC made its strategic stock available to supply all projects. We were able to supply the entire construction industry until the supply from outside was secured again.</p><h4>What was the role of QPMC in securing materials for the construction of all the projects related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup?</h4><p>Since we had a close coordination with all the strategic projects, namely Ashghal, FIFA, and Kahramaa, we had detailed knowledge of market demand. They always communicated their needs with us so we could arrange materials according to different projects. However, at present, we have a different strategy. We are working closely with the Ministry of Municipality and Environment and Ashghal to see how we can use the materials available in Qatar, especially with regard to recycling. There are several dump sites across Qatar where the majority of the waste is construction waste, which means we can recycle it. By doing this, we will acquire materials and help the environment.</p><h4>How have you been working to guarantee the quality and environmentally friendly products?</h4><p>We have certain specifications and we are obliged to be in compliance with Qatar Construction Specifications 2014 (QCS 2014), and soon, new regulations and requirements for different types of materials will be in place. Notably, we are under discussions with the relevant stakeholders in Oman to establish a lab to guarantee the quality of the material coming to Doha. At the same time, we are establishing our recycling operations, which will contribute positively to saving the environment. </p><h4>What will be the priorities for QPMC in 2019?</h4><p>The priority for us is to make sure that the whole construction industry is well fed with the required raw materials, especially all projects related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The second priority is to start recycling; we are going to start with the construction waste but we intend to recycle other types of waste materials. The third priority is to help Qatari companies export their finished products. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>What are Sasol's prospects for the Qatari market as the country moves toward more downstream production?<br>We are focusing on opportunities to upgrade our product slate to produce higher-value products, which plays into Qatar's strategy to increase production of downstream products. If we consider the existing products, we would be talking mostly about diesel and naphtha. We are evaluating potential opportunities to manufacture higher-value products in Qatar so these can enter higher-value markets that have limited exposure to crude oil price volatility. This is an opportunity for Qatar to expand beyond products dependent on oil prices. We have a strong presence in the US, where we are adding new capacity to our chemical business. We also have a strong presence in Europe. Our chemical business' head office is in Hamburg, which is also complemented by a presence in Italy. </p><h4>What has been the success of your partnership with Qatar Petroleum, and how has this partnership helped Sasol enter other markets?</h4><p>With Qatar Petroleum, we established the first gas-to-liquids (GTL) facility, ORYX GTL, the first global facility on a commercial scale. This was a flagship plant for the whole world, and we have used the facility to tell our success story. We previously used similar technology in South Africa, though with coal. ORYX GTL was the first time our technology was used to convert gas to liquid fuel products, and it proved that there are other options with gas besides LNG. With GTL, we are creating higher-value products that can be used to export to other countries. The added advantage of GTL is that we can further create downstream industries, which means more opportunities for the country, in addition to the transfer of knowledge and skills. When the plant started, there were many Sasol employees that helped build the plant, though experience and knowledge was eventually transferred to local staff. </p><h4>How can Sasol-developed products contribute to a greener transport sector in Qatar?</h4><p>Diesel for cars or trucks is typically produced from crude oil. With our technology, we are making diesel from gas, which makes the product cleaner and of a higher quality. We have been asked if this diesel product can be used locally and are supporting Qatar Petroleum's efforts to evaluate what it will take to introduce GTL diesel into the local market. One of the main benefits of this would be a reduction in air pollution. There is a great deal to do in Qatar in terms of promoting greener practices to protect the environment, and Sasol wants to make its own contribution in this regard.</p><h4>How is Sasol investing in corporate social responsibility in Qatar?</h4><p>Sasol is proud to have taken a different view on how to support the community. We created initiatives that the country needs, making sure to positively impact the community. We created Qatar e-Nature, a mobile app and website that shares species information found in Qatar. This became a main source of information, and we are still investing to gather more images and include more species. This became possible because of a partnership with a local NGO, Friends of the Environment Center. We also conduct an annual schools contest supported by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education. Other initiatives include supporting people with disabilities, one of which is called Definitely Able, which we started in 2012; we work with all institutes that deal with disabilities. We also started the Accessible Qatar Initiative in 2016, which is unique globally. We hired an accredited accessibility consultant to do accessibility audits of public places and share this information via a mobile app and website, so that people can find out how accessible a venue is depending on their disability. The audit also allows the venue to identify any accessibility issues and fix them. We provide information to the venues as well as users, as it is their right to know. Each of our initiatives continues to grow and expand. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[resilience-solidified]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most important recent developments in your international investment portfolio?</h4><p>The main development has been the signing of a Heads of Agreement (HOA) with Indonesian power utilities Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) and PT Pembangkitan Jawa-Bali (PJB) in October 2017. This agreement relates to the joint development of an 800-MW greenfield gas-fired power plant complete with a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) in Medan, Indonesia. Notably, it will be one of the first gas-to-power (GTP) projects in the world. We are still focused on our target of adding 800MW of power to our capacity every year, which currently stands at around 4.5GW. Our investment in the Paiton Project in Indonesia at the end of 2016 was an extremely significant event for us, and subsequently we successfully arranged refinancing within a record six months from the acquisition, bringing back to Nebras nearly USD600 million. This USD2.75 billion refinancing was the biggest for the power sector in Southeast Asia in 2017 and was recognized by many international media and financing publications. Outside of the fast-growing Southeast Asian market, we are also working on developing and acquiring projects in other areas. The Middle East continues to be a key market for Nebras Power, but it is actively looking at a number of opportunities in other markets. We have been looking at North and South America as potential areas for investment and are actively involved in pursuing projects, specifically in Mexico, Chile, and Brazil. We are also interested in opportunities in both North and sub-Saharan Africa, such as Morocco, Tunisia, Kenya, and South Africa.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the blockade on Qatar's economy, more specifically on the utilities and power sector?</h4><p>Qatar's economy has proven to be resilient, and there has been no measurable impact of the blockade. We have seen economic growth comparable to other countries in the region and have actually fared better than some of our neighbors. The only impact on Nebras Power is that the markets of the blockading countries are no longer available to us. However, we are able to invest in many other areas of the globe, so the blockade has not truly harmed our operations. At present, our parent company QEWC has a few active projects in Qatar. One is the Facility E project, which involves the installation of a combined cycle power plant with a capacity in the range of 2,000-2,500MW and a net water production capacity in the range of 100-130 million imperial gallons per day (MIGD). There is a large appetite from international investors for such projects in Qatar, illustrating how little impact the blockade has had. There has not been any slowdown in growth due to the blockade or the oil crisis. Qatar has applied the 2030 National Vision in an effective way. The addition of these two power projects is a clear indication of the growth path Qatar is on, which are needed in order to keep pace with future power demand.</p><h4>What is your vision with regard to the transition to clean energy, and what projects do you have in the pipeline in this regard?</h4><p>One thing we closed in 2017 was a 52-MW solar power project in Jordan. It will be our second solar power project, which underlines the importance of clean energy projects to Nebras Power. The future is in renewables, and we want to increasingly concentrate our investments in this area. We are interested in both wind and solar, though we have not yet been able to land a project in the wind sector. We see gas as another form of clean energy, and regardless of developments within the renewable space, the world cannot stop having a baseload solution, for which gas is the most suitable. We are, therefore, focusing on two things in parallel: renewables and gas-to-power solutions. The latter is a trend that more and more countries are moving toward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role will solar energy play in Qatar's energy landscape, and what other energy sources are being explored?</h4><p>Qatar is working on a photovoltaic (PV) technology-based 700MW-capacity solar plant. The first phase of 350MW is expected to be commissioned by 2020 followed by another 350MW by 2021. This will support Qatar's commitment of staging the 2022 World cup as the first ever carbon-free tournament. In addition, this project will enable us to exceed the national target of 200MW of renewables by 2020. As PV technology-based solar plant output is during peak hours, it will serve as a much-needed peak plant. This project will diversify the electricity source and boost Qatar's position globally as it will offset COX and NOX emissions by reducing gas-based generation. Apart from the above, about 25MW is being produced by recycling domestic solid waste, while a feasibility study has also been completed on nuclear energy.</p><h4>How is technology being used to improve the customer experience for Kahramaa's large client base?</h4><p>Kahramaa has ambitious plans to install leading world class Billing and Customer Relations Management (CRM) systems to achieve a high level of service and interaction with its respected customers. This project is expected to be implemented by 2019. Kahramaa is also planning to outsource its new 24/7 call center operations. Moreover, we are in the process of implementing smart grid technologies, which will further enhance customer experience. Meanwhile, Kahramaa has enhanced its customer interactions by deploying mobile apps, social media, and several other services for its retail and bulk customers.</p><h4>Kahramaa is one of the major infrastructure investors in Qatar. What would you say to any company interested in participating in Kahramaa's tenders? </h4><p>Kahramaa encourages and supports foreign and local JVs with bids for all upcoming capex projects in open competitive tenders. The capex investments in all aspects of Kahramaa's infrastructure needs are still growing at a respectable level and will continue to do so for several years. For example, over the next five years, we are looking at projects worth about QAR30 billion in capex investment. In addition, Kahramaa is committed to establishing a source of locally manufactured spare parts.</p><h4>How is Kahramaa promoting energy sustainability?</h4><p>Kahramaa is completely aligned with the Qatar National Vision with regards to environmental issues and targets such as national gas savings. Under this initiative, the most efficient power and water producing plants are being utilized to the maximum. Less gas usage means lower emissions (CO2, NOX, SOX) and support for the clean environment drive. As discussed earlier, Kahramaa will operate a 700-MW solar power plant, which will help reduce the need for fossil fuels, and encourage renewables uptake in Qatar. Kahramaa pursues the opportunities to utilize technical and technological innovations around the world to reduce environmental impact and, in conjunction with other government entities such as QEERI and Qatar Foundation, it is also considering various initiatives to encourage community involvement in solar and other renewables. On the conservation side, Kahramaa leads the “Tarsheed" National Conservation program, under which a number of initiatives are being executed to reduce per capita consumption. District Cooling is an important contributor to reduce electricity needs due to its ability to provide cooling capacity for commercial and large residential buildings.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We expect yet another robust and challenging year of growth and prosperity for the nation and will continue to provide essential electricity and water services. Based on current projections, there will be no shortfall in the supply of electricity and water in the coming years, with strategic projects such as the mega reservoir, Facility E, and network expansion. Equally important, all Kahramaa projects related to the FIFA World Cup 2022 and Qatar Rail are on track. Kahramaa is also looking at various programs that serve the nation, with more responsive customer services, fiscal accountability, and on-time project execution. Our staff is capable of overcoming all business challenges and of living up to our motto of “Better Living." </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can ExxonMobil support Qatar in its plans to advance the status of the country's oil and gas sector?</h4><p>ExxonMobil is proud of its extensive partnership with Qatar Petroleum in the development of Qatar's natural gas sector. Through this partnership, ExxonMobil has participated in 12 of the 14 LNG trains, 27 of the world's largest LNG ships, three receiving terminals in Europe and the US, and Qatar's largest condensate refinery. Six of these 14 trains are considered the largest operating liquefaction facilities in the world, each able to produce 7.8 million tons of LNG annually. Current annual LNG production of ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum's joint ventures is more than 60 million tons. The new FDI law is expected to make Qatar an ideal hub for trade and re-exports and will continue to enable significant new investment opportunities and solid partnerships. One need look no further than the recent Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil investment decision to proceed with the development of the Golden Pass LNG export project in Sabine Pass, Texas to understand the dynamics of ExxonMobil's decades-old partnership with the state of Qatar. The project will have an annual capacity of 15.6 million tons of LNG and provide LNG to countries both with free trade and non-free trade agreements, covering markets in Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Americas. LNG is still one of the fastest-growing forms of energy, with annual sales expected to more than double to approximately 480 million tons in 20 years. We are proud to be progressing on new LNG projects with Qatar to help meet the world's growing demand for natural gas.</p><h4>What will be the role of technology in Qatar's expansion of LNG production?</h4><p>At its core, ExxonMobil is a technology company. We have almost 20,000 scientists and engineers, including more than 2,000 with PhDs. ExxonMobil spends around USD1 billion every year researching and developing new technologies. Technology has been critical in meeting the world's energy needs, and we have the potential to make an even greater impact in the decades ahead, while protecting our environment. We are finding innovative ways to operate more effectively and efficiently, and the technologies we are working on are enabling us to maximize value, all along the product value chain. Our broad portfolio, involvement across the LNG value chain, and global marketing footprint provide important flexibility and enable us to maximize value for our LNG ventures. Technology enabled us to increase the size of the LNG trains to achieve a lower unit cost in manufacturing LNG, as well as increase the capacity of the LNG carriers from 140,000-150,000 cubic meters per vessel to 250,000, creating what is now known as the Q-Max.</p><h4>To what extent is the Qatar ExxonMobil Open shaping Qatar's sports landscape?</h4><p>ExxonMobil Qatar has been the title sponsor of the Qatar ExxonMobil Open for 25 years, making it one of the most anticipated professional tennis events—attracting a star-studded group of players, crowds of spectators from all over the world, and the attention of regional and international media outlets. As a committed member of the community, ExxonMobil Qatar's role extends beyond its business activities and includes programs and partnerships that carry local significance and meaning. The tournament showcases Qatar's energy and its appeal as an attractive destination for tourists and business people alike.</p><h4>What is ExxonMobil Qatar's outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are committed to continuing our successful journey with Qatar Petroleum. The world needs reliable supplies of affordable, clean energy, and we can continue to play an important role with Qatar in meeting this need. Our world-class LNG facilities in Qatar have played an important role in meeting the world's energy needs, and moving forward, the Golden Pass LNG Export project and Qatar's North Field Expansion will help meet growing demand for LNG. Qatar's energy industry has a bright future, but it will require continued innovation and collaboration as well as a commitment to maintaining the highest environmental and ethical standards. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the outcome of Qatargas' merger with RasGas in 2018?</h4><p>The integration of Qatargas and RasGas resulted in the creation of a unique global energy operator in terms of size, service, and reliability. The integration pooled our resources and capabilities and produced an exceptional combination of efficiency and effectiveness, creating even more value for our stakeholders, namely the State of Qatar, shareholders, customers, employees, and other business partners. The new Qatargas is the largest LNG supplier in the world with a production capacity of 77 million tons per annum (MTPA) and a fleet of 70 vessels delivering to a wide range of customers across the world. The consolidation of Qatargas and RasGas as one company has enhanced the ability of the new company to offer more flexibility and to build upon the array of services. Indeed, the integration was not intended simply to reduce costs, but also to facilitate the optimization of the Qatari LNG portfolio at a global level.</p><h4>What is Qatargas' strategy to guarantee its position as the leading LNG producer?</h4><p>Qatargas has 35 years of experience with proven records of producing and delivering LNG efficiently and reliably. The magnitude of our reserve and asset base cannot be surpassed. Furthermore, we benefit from having a scale of operation under the control of a single operator, Qatargas, with a majority owner, Qatar Petroleum, which allows rapid decision-making in response to changes in market conditions. Finally, we have retained a significant portion of flexible volumes within our supply portfolio, which enhances our responsiveness to short- and long-term demand.</p><h4>How is Qatargas working to expand its client base?</h4><p>Qatargas has supplied LNG to 31 countries, and our client list is expected to expand over the next five years. Asia Pacific will continue to drive LNG demand, with China and India to become significant LNG importers. Other emerging markets in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa will also support the development of demand for LNG. We also intend to supply emerging markets in Europe. We have been innovating in our relationship with selected commodity traders to enhance market access and diversify risk. </p><h4>How do you expect the international gas market to develop in the next few years?</h4><p>With more stringent environmental policies, natural gas being the cleanest fossil fuel has a strong future. Ultimately, in three to five years, the LNG market is expected to experience a shortage in supply. Qatar Petroleum has already anticipated this by approving the expansion of Qatargas' existing production from 77MTPA to 110MTPA by 2023. This will maintain Qatar's position as the major LNG producer in the world and continue Qatargas' significant contribution to the country's GDP.</p><h4>How does Qatargas work to align its corporate strategy with the Qatar National Vision 2030? </h4><p>As the world's premier LNG company, we are committed to contributing to the achievement of the Qatar National Vision 2030 by setting targets that cover the economic, social, and environmental aspects of sustainability. Qatargas' role in the global energy sector has become more important than ever, with cleaner energy sources becoming a fundamental component of greenhouse gas mitigation strategies globally. </p><h4>What is Qatargas' outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Qatargas will continue to efficiently place its volumes in the short term where they can fetch the best value while also consolidating and growing our long-term sales. We plan to increase our footprint in Asia with the start-up of commercial deliveries to Bangladesh, a market that Qatargas opened recently in April 2018. LNG demand will continue to grow at a sustainable rate, and new markets, with which we maintain close contact, will start to import LNG before the end of the decade. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Qatar Petroleum's role in Qatar's current industrial renaissance?</h4><p>As the national oil and gas company, Qatar Petroleum is responsible for all oil and gas activities in Qatar, including exploration, production, refining, transport, and storage. Qatar Petroleum plays a critical role in driving and delivering Qatar's energy strategy. In April 2017, I announced the lifting of the moratorium on new projects utilizing North Field gas. This immediately re-energized industrial development in Qatar, placing the North Field Expansion project and the planned world-class petrochemicals complex at Ras Laffan at the center of Qatar's industrial growth. Progress does not end there. In conducting its operations, Qatar Petroleum is harnessing technologies to deliver enhanced and more efficient performance across its assets. The current industrial renaissance in Qatar includes strategic initiatives in the services sector in addition to the traditional heavy industries processing and extracting hydrocarbons. Qatar Petroleum has the largest industrial base in Qatar and is a major consumer of technologically complex industrial services, which it is leveraging to catalyze the growth of the local services industry. In February 2019, Qatar Petroleum launched the Tawteen initiative to attract suppliers to set up facilities in Qatar. This initiative is in conjunction with other positive steps across the economy to further enhance the attractiveness of investment in the industrial sector in Qatar, such as the creation of economic zones. Tawteen offers a large number of services-based business opportunities involving complex technology, which will support Qatar's economic diversification strategies. Qatar Petroleum is also taking significant steps internationally in the oil and gas sector, where, via acquisitions and global exploration agreements, it has entered several new jurisdictions in 2018, including Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, South Africa, and Oman. Qatar Petroleum's ambitions extend further, and it will continue to seek opportunities to invest and deliver on its ambitious growth strategy and vision to be one of the best oil and gas companies in the world.</p><h4>How will the new petrochemicals complex at Ras Laffan strengthen Qatar's position as a petrochemical supplier?</h4><p>Qatar will build the Middle East's largest ethane cracker as part of a new world-scale petrochemicals complex to be located at the Ras Laffan Industrial City. An ethane cracker distills hydrocarbons into materials that can be used to make plastics. With a capacity of more than 1.6 million tons per year of ethylene, the ethane cracker will be one of the largest in the world. World-class derivative plants will also be built at Ras Laffan Industrial City as part of the petrochemicals complex. Qatar Petroleum has invited a group of leading international companies, with extensive experience in the petrochemicals industry, to submit proposals to partner with Qatar Petroleum in the development and operation of this new world-scale petrochemicals complex. We are currently evaluating proposals and will announce the name of the selected partner in due course. The petrochemicals complex will consolidate Qatar's position among the leading petrochemical producers in the world.</p><h4>Given its strong position as a supplier of various petrochemicals and refined products, what measures is Qatar taking to maintain its position? </h4><p>Qatar Petroleum and its group of companies have established themselves over the past 20 years as a reliable and trustworthy supplier of LNG, crude oil, refined products, and petrochemicals. We are an effective partner in all our joint ventures. We ensure that we always maintain an open and constructive dialogue with all our customers and partners and listen to their needs, and this has contributed significantly to our reputation as a long-term partner and supplier of choice. Qatar Petroleum has been at the forefront of ensuring that all customer expectations are consistently met, thereby cementing Qatar's international reputation as a trustworthy and reliable partner. </p><h4>Growth in LNG consumption is expected to come mainly from Asia between 2020 and 2030. How is Qatar Petroleum working to secure its position as a leading provider?</h4><p>In 2017, we announced the North Field Expansion project. When completed, it will add four new mega-trains to our existing 14 trains and raise Qatar's LNG production capacity from 77 million tons per annum (MTPA) to 110MTPA. This will raise Qatar's total production capacity by about 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. In addition, we have recently taken, together with our partner ExxonMobil, the final investment decision for the Golden Pass LNG export project in Sabine Pass, Texas, which will have a production capacity of around 16MTPA. The additional capacity will enhance the depth and flexibility of our global LNG supply network, strengthen our leading position as the world's largest LNG producer and exporter, and further boost Qatar Petroleum's strategic growth plan. With an unparalleled LNG industry already spanning 22 years, Qatar has developed a reputation as a reliable world-class supplier of LNG around the globe. Qatar's focus is on harnessing existing relationships and establishing new ones to continue to be an LNG supplier of choice in developed and emerging markets. Qatar already has a strong presence in the Asian LNG markets, and we continue to underpin this position with new agreements such as the 22-year, 3.4-MTPA agreement with PetroChina in 2018. We will use the unique opportunity that the North Field Expansion project presents, as well as our plans to expand our involvement across the energy value chain, to boost our position as the world's leading LNG provider. We are also looking at increasing our regasification capacity, evaluating the expansion of South Hook and Adriatic Terminals capacity, and reviewing opportunities for new re-gas terminals in Germany and Asian emerging markets.</p><h4>The National Vision 2030 aims for a “fully developed gas industry that provides a major source of clean energy for Qatar and for the world." What is Qatar Petroleum's standpoint to meet this objective?</h4><p>LNG is the cleanest fossil fuel and Qatar, through its existing LNG supplies and the addition of North Field Expansion as well as the Golden Pass LNG export project, will continue to play a leading role in supplying clean fuel to the world. We are also focusing on meeting clean energy objectives through initiatives aiming at improving the energy efficiency, which would lead to an increase in production and reduction in emissions. Equally important, Qatar Petroleum is developing infrastructure for the use of CNG in Qatar's public transportation as well as corporate and government fleets.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Qatar's energy sector in 2019?</h4><p>It will be an exciting year as we make substantive strides with the North Field Expansion project and the new petrochemicals complex. There is also the transition of the Idd Al-Shargi North Dome offshore oil field into a 100% Qatar Petroleum operation. We are also working to further advance the development of our oil and gas fields and stimulate the enhancement of our local supply chain. Overseas, we will focus on investing in a range of high-quality opportunities in accordance with our growth strategy and vison “to become one of the best national oil and gas companies in the world, with roots in Qatar and a strong international presence." </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the position of Doha Insurance Group in the Qatari insurance sector?</h4><p>There are many factors to be taken into consideration, such as premiums, top-line gains, net results, equity, or investments, in order to quantify our position in the market. Many national insurance companies have branches abroad as well, so their published results will include foreign businesses and revenue. For us, the best way to quantify might be top-line growth and overall insurance revenue. We are ranked second in terms of overall premium and this is due to our key and strategic accounts, which are our target. We like to portray ourselves as a quality rather than a quantity player. Being an (A-) rated company has enabled us to issue policies for organizations such as Qatar Airways, the Emiri Guard, the Qatari Armed Forces, and Qatar Petroleum. Additionally, we are working with other national insurance companies in a consortium for all the major FIFA World Cup 2022 projects. Doha Insurance Group has managed to achieve such feats throughout its history, making it one of the strongest players in the market.</p><h4>How do you work to attract more national talent into your group?</h4><p>Insurance has traditionally not been a major part of our education or business environment, which makes attracting national talent difficult. We are working on several projects where we sponsor Qatari students in universities and offer the required training and support, either through our subsidiaries or insurance partners, to get them suited for the insurance world. This is something we are working on currently and will start rolling out in phases in 2019.<br>Doha Insurance Group has gone through a rebranding process. What has been the outcome so far?<br>Our rebranding involved several efforts, and we are seeing excellent results. Shifting our organization from a company to a group was a major step in our progression. The main reason for that was to have all branches and subsidiaries under the head company's umbrella, making workflow, risk management, and delegation of authority much easier. It gave us the platform to expand across the region, portraying us as an evolving regional and global player. Additionally, we have unified our corporate values—transparency, customer reliability, and performance—across the board. </p><h4>How are your new international offices in Beirut and London complementing your business expansion?</h4><p>All our geographic expansion is focusing on reinsurance. At present, the company is not planning to expand into any direct business abroad. We have investment interests in other countries in direct insurance, but being a full-fledged subsidiary wholly owned by our group, we are only focusing on reinsurance. We operate the MenaRe brand, which is our reinsurance syndicate for specialty lines, and MenaRe Life is our newly established office focusing on life and medical reinsurance support. MenaRe Specialty is another office that'll be fully operational in 2019, with a focus on energy line in reinsurance. </p><h4>To what extent is technological innovation relevant for your operation?</h4><p>We invest heavily in technology, not only to support our expanding local and international offices, but because it is simply the future. Within a few years, all insurance-related operations will be web-based. Doha Insurance Group is moving into this environment because this is where we see the demand from our clients. We are investing in information areas such as security, data warehousing, and developing new products. Notably, we have Barzan, an IT-focused company, under our group. It is located in Jordan to take advantage of the local talent in the field. </p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for 2019?</h4><p>From a direct line perspective, we will continue developing our Doha takaful products in accordance with Islamic sharia principles. We recently received all required approvals from Qatar Central Bank to turn it into a fully fledged insurance company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[harnessing-the-power-of-diversity]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Seib Insurance adapted to the increasingly multicultural population of Qatar?</h4><p>Between 2009 and 2018, Qatar saw a major shift in its cultural environment, in line with the Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030. When there is a corporate vision that helps the company align with the general direction of the economic, social, and political environments, it is significantly easier to adapt to the changing landscape. This is exactly what we have at Seib; we have seen the country grow from around 700,000 residents to more than 2.7 million. This transformation was major, and it required business leaders to make major changes within their organizations to ensure they were successful. At Seib, we have managed to create a common path for our employees so that the social dynamism of the corporate landscape works well within our business model, which is focused on superior customer service. We want to leverage the diversity of our team while making their association with Seib the common component of their work-life identity. Additionally, we want our employees to utilize their mother cultures when approaching the work environment, because this emphasis creates a more dynamic and creative workspace. </p><h4>How do you work to constantly improve customer service, and how is technology used in this regard?</h4><p>Technology is one element that assists customer service. However, in a culture that requires face-to-face communication and human interaction, we need to ensure we emphasize and support personal connections. There needs to be a balance between focusing on personal communication and utilizing technology. Wherever technology assists us, we utilize it, though people are and will remain a key element in our success story. We are a diverse business with diverse expertise and services. In health insurance, where we are one of the largest providers in Qatar, we take pride in the fact that we focus on superior customer service to create loyalty. This has helped us maintain our wide customer base, and this loyalty only comes with the full dedication of our team.</p><h4>Which insurance products are gaining more popularity in the country?</h4><p>Products must be assessed through two angles: corporate and retail. There is also a difference in what the market needs in terms of risk reduction. There is an immediate demand in terms of what people know, and in the retail space this means demand for motor insurance. When it comes to products that people are not aware of, like comprehensive motor insurance versus basic liability insurance, there is a need for spreading awareness. Seib is a supporter of unifying the regulatory platform in country and unifying the messages to be delivered by insurance companies; hence, we can improve the overall dialog between providers and clients.</p><h4>How has your new insurance product for low-income foreign workers developed since you introduced it in 2017?</h4><p>The product itself and the government's drive to protect the workforce in Qatar has translated into excellent growth. Domestic helpers, workers, drivers, gardeners, and others represent great potential for insurance companies because they make up a large portion of the population. At the same time, improving overall working conditions is an important component of the human pillar of the QNV 2030. We had strong demand for this, and we are proud of how well we were able to improve people's lives.</p><h4>How would assess the overall health of the insurance sector in Qatar?</h4><p>There are prospects for growth considering the potential of the general economy. The financial capability and liquidity of companies in Qatar's insurance sector is illustrated in their generally high ratings from international ratings agencies. There could be a certain level of volatility in certain companies, but the sector as a whole is extremely strong. 1Q2018 saw around 4% growth in the insurance sector, which is in line with GDP growth. Now that oil prices have risen above 2015 levels, we are even more bullish about the future. 2022 will also drive economic forces in the sector. Additionally, insurance companies have massive potential to grow externally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[building-a-secure-future]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar Insurance Company (QIC) is one of the founding members of Beema. What does it mean for your operations to have such a strong backup?</h4><p>Beema was founded in 2009 as a fully sharia-compliant private closed Qatari shareholding insurance company. QIC is the only insurer among the stakeholders of Beema, and it assisted by transferring its key staff to help operate Beema. For example, our deputy CEO, COO, a few other key staff members, and I were transferred from QIC to Beema. We brought a wealth of experience that has helped Beema continue its operations professionally and seamlessly from day one. Beyond that, there is no assistance from QIC from a business point of view. The other founders of Beema include other Qatari flagship companies, including Qatar Islamic Bank, Masraf Al Rayan, Barwa Real Estate, and Q-Invest.</p><h4>With such a competitive environment for insurance companies in Qatar, how do you work to stand out?</h4><p>We have established our own priorities and have managed to become the leading takaful insurance company in Qatar in terms of policyholder's assets, at more than QAR660 million (USD181.255 million). We reached this position in 2013 and have remained on top since then. We have developed our own strategies and introduced new products to the market, which is part of our success. At present, Beema is well positioned to capitalize on the government's special attention to SMEs because it has been catering to this segment fairly intensively. We stand out among the rest of the competition. We focus constantly on improving the services to our client. In fact, a customer can buy insurance or lodge a claim over the phone without coming to our office and pay premiums using our payment link. We have also introduced retail-focused products such as individual life insurance or insurance for caravans, among others. The retail sector in the country is nowhere near fully tapped and still has scope for more innovative products, on which Beema is working.</p><h4>How do you expect the sharia-compliant insurance market to evolve in Qatar in comparison to the non-sharia compliant market?</h4><p>Sharia-compliant insurance companies have their own niche market share, and it is still evolving. Beema is the number-one takaful insurer in Qatar with gross written premiums (GWP) worth QAR324 million (USD88.98 million) in 2017, and we are likely fourth among all the insurers in Qatar. The advantage of being a takaful insurer is that you can approach both conventional and takaful clients, whereas conventional insurers cannot approach a client that requires takaful products.</p><h4>What is Beema's outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>2019 looks positive. With the FIFA 2022 World Cup coming up, we expect many activities, mainly in the non-hydrocarbon sector, and it will reflect on our business for years to come. Having said that, we have to stay focused and approach 2019 strategically. Beema will move to a new location in Lusail at Energy City, a flourishing part of Doha that will draw a great deal of attention before, during, and after the World Cup. In addition, we will also continue to work to innovate in the local market and bring in new products that can cover new needs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the bureau's major highlights in its decade of existence?</h4><p>CB was established in 2011. The vision of the bureau is to create a secured credit system in the country that operates in accordance with international standards. Apart from individual and commercial credit summary reports, CB started issuing credit reports with FICO credit scores to customers in mid-2016. As a part of expansion into diverse economic activities, we added members from the telecoms and automobile financing sectors and provided them with our product and services to serve their customers. Furthermore, we have introduced SMS services to keep customers up-to-date with the latest developments and ensure their satisfaction.</p><h4>What are the criteria of becoming a member of Qatar Credit Bureau, and what benefits do members enjoy?</h4><p>The intending member should be a recognized/registered institution involved in a credit, payment, or collection related activity. The member will have access to credit information from various sectors and can take a comprehensive overview of their customers. This will assist the financial institutions and credit facilitators in making informed credit decisions in order to minimize credit risk and enhance transparency in the banking and financial sectors in the country.</p><h4>How would you assess the health of the banking and financial sector in Qatar?</h4><p>The banking sector, the mainstay of the financial sector, has remained solid, supported by healthy asset growth, adequate capitalization, a low non-performing loan ratio, and comfortable profitability. Proactive support from the regulators and prudent economic policies have helped the financial sector to mitigate the challenges that emerged in mid-2017 and regain investor confidence. This is also reflected in the assessments of various international organizations regarding the overall economy.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are working toward strategic expansion by adding more members. Furthermore, we add new data sources and sectors and provide fresh products and services for our clients. We are looking forward to launching credit scores for SMEs. Our contributions will continue in order to build up an efficient and stable domestic economic system by providing comprehensive and accurate credit information based on state-of-the-art technology and global knowledge. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has QSE further developed its portfolio of products and tools?</h4><p>2018 has been a successful year for QSE as it managed to deliver on its promises. We have launched two exchange-traded funds (ETF): the QE Index ETF, which consists of the 20 largest companies listed on the QSE, and the Al Rayan Qatar ETF, the largest single-country, sharia-compliant ETF in the world. These make investing in Qatar easier, as investors do not have to pick stocks in a market they are unfamiliar with. These have been important achievements for us. In addition, we have listed several new companies and have an active pipeline of upcoming IPOs. We also developed new regulation on market consolidation with Qatar Financial Market Authority (QFMA) as part of our efforts to enhance liquidity and efficiency. Furthermore, we are launching omnibus accounts for custodians to allow for more efficient order management on behalf of international investors. This is a technical feature that investors have asked for as it will reduce their costs and ease the burden on brokers.</p><h4>How do you assess the impact of the blockade on Qatar's economy?</h4><p>According to international reports, Qatar is the fastest-growing economy in the region with 2.8% growth rate. The blockade has not significantly affected our economy or performance, nor has it stopped new projects from going ahead. We have a clear agenda and are reacting to the situation. The blockade has had a positive effect in the sense that it has strengthened Qatar's focus on becoming more self-sufficient, for example in food supplies. Everyone is aware they have a responsibility to work faster and more efficiently. In terms of exports, Qatar provides the UAE with 40% of its energy needs and has not stopped this gas supply despite the blockade, which is illustrative.</p><h4>What are the main investment opportunities in Qatar for international investors?</h4><p>Qatar is one of the most attractive places for international investors who want exposure to the Gulf region. Qatar is a safe haven that has remained stable, and the country allows investors from any other country to come and invest. This is why the number of companies registered in the Qatar Financial Center increased by over 60% in 2018. People see Qatar as the financial market of the GCC. There are a vast range of opportunities in Qatar, with the non-hydrocarbon sector showing rapid growth. People now recognize the potential of Qatar to become an industrial country. Industry, manufacturing, and agriculture are important sectors that we have to build on. There are also avenues for cooperation with other countries to produce high-quality products. For instance, we are bringing new industries to Qatar today, such as pharmaceutical manufacturing. Qatar Development Bank (QDB) supports the business sector, for example, by running workshops for entrepreneurs and industries. We also have free zones and a Free Zone Authority that builds and promotes facilities up to international standards.</p><h4>What role can QSE play in the further growth of the country?</h4><p>QSE is the second-largest stock exchange in the Middle East and to date the largest emerging market stock exchange based on market capitalization in the region. We play a major role and are highly representative of the country's economy. People look at how companies are performing on the QSE before making business decisions. We need to maintain this excellent image and work with overseas companies to ensure we meet our obligations to investors and operate transparently. We bring more investors to the country along with foreign capital. We also support the SME sector. This is why we are launching Qatar Venture Market in 2018, which is specifically targeted at SMEs. Our outlook for 2019 at QSE is bright, partly due to the excellent government support we receive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent were Arab Bank's operations in Qatar affected by the blockade?</h4><p>Arab Bank established its Qatar operations in the 1950s and has experienced different cycles in Qatar and elsewhere over the years. Qatar's banking sector is resilient, and the Central Bank has provided the sector with implicit as well as explicit support since the blockade. This helped Arab Bank Qatar achieve strong results in 2017, with a growth of 16% in net profits. It is on track to achieve single-digit growth in 2018.</p><h4>What helped Arab Bank achieve such results in Qatar?</h4><p>Arab Bank's focus areas in Qatar are corporate and consumer banking, but it is also active in corporate lending. We have strong penetration across various sectors. Contracting finance is a key priority for us, and we have been involved in a number of mega projects in Qatar across sectors such as transportation, hospitals, and logistics, among others. Arab Bank Qatar is also largely engaged in the trading sector as well as several other sectors. <br>New projects in industry and food security have been initiated in Qatar. How is Arab Bank involved in financing these sectors?<br>The bank has been an active player in project finance locally and across the region. The industrial sector in Qatar is of significant importance, and we continue to focus on local manufactures and have aligned our priorities accordingly. Moreover, through our trading clientele base, we have a number of relationships in the food sector that play a pivotal role in Qatar's economy. The bank has a footprint in 28 countries and thus is well positioned to continue playing a role in the trading flows with Qatar. </p><h4>What priorities does Arab Bank have for 2019?</h4><p>Arab Bank Qatar's objective is to continue to deliver strong and sustainable financial performance. The outlook is to grow and be a meaningful partner and key contributor to the Qatari economy. We rank among the leading international banks in Qatar. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the group's recent milestones?</h4><p>Al Khaliji reported a strong set of results in 2018, which are reflective of our focus on growing operating income, efficiently managing our cost base, and deploying our balance sheet in line with our renewed risk appetite. We continue to diversify our income streams, resulting in 5% higher profits YoY. We achieved this topline growth by de-leveraging on non-core and low yielding assets, coupled with effectively managing our funding base and the continued reduction of the size of our portfolio of fixed income investments. Risk management continues to remain at the heart of our operating philosophy. </p><h4>How do you assess the impact of the blockade?</h4><p>Qatar's economy is strong and has weathered the impact of the blockade extremely well. For example, the IMF noted GDP growth of 4% in 2017 for the non-hydrocarbon sector and projected GDP growth of 2.6% in 2018. The government announced a pro-private sector budget, which features expenditure on major infrastructure projects, especially those associated with the 2022 FIFA World Cup, education, health, and food security. This will create business opportunities and demand for credit, and Al Khaliji is well poised to capitalize on these opportunities.</p><h4>What does a Qatar-centric strategy entail to Al Khaliji?</h4><p>Our Qatar-centric strategy encompasses our focus on our valued clients and the Al Khaliji staff who serve those clients. We continue to build partnerships with our preferred clients, primarily local firms, including government and government-related entities, the private and premium segments within personal banking, and entrepreneurs in the private sector through the Al Dhameen program in partnership with the Qatar Development Bank. In addition, the bank continues to support the private sector, in line with the goals of the Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030. Our physical footprint in Qatar also remains important; we have five branches, two service centers, and 53 ATMs. Al Khaliji has achieved its objective of reaching 100% Qatarization of management positions across all of its branches and welcomes Qatari graduates into its ranks and offers comprehensive training and mentoring programs, professional development opportunities, and strong incentives to build a career in the banking and financial industry.</p><h4>How can Qatar use the 2022 FIFA World Cup as a catalyst for growth in the financial sector of the economy?</h4><p>This high-profile sporting event will continue to create unprecedented opportunities across various industries in Qatar, with a focus on the continued development of the private sector. As part of QNV 2030, Qatar has been upgrading many aspects of its infrastructure. Al Khaliji and other local banks have been heavily involved in financing the key aspects of such projects. This, coupled with support from the private sector, has allowed banks to diversify the sectors in which they provide finance and support continued growth of the financial sector. Al Khaliji is ready, willing, and able to provide the necessary financial support. We will continue to broaden our future projects focusing on infrastructure and logistic financing leading up to the 2022 World Cup.</p><h4>What potential is there to enhance the growth of entrepreneurship and SMEs in Qatar through digital technologies?</h4><p>Al Khaliji is committed to the diversification of the national economy as one of the main objectives of the National Development Strategy and its overarching QNV 2030, while supporting the growing number of SMEs and boosting the private sector and entrepreneurial innovation. Our Al Dhameen program helps SMEs establish a credit history with banks for future credit facilities without the need for large collateral and encourages financial institutions to understand the importance of Qatari SMEs. We continue to work with the Qatar Development Bank with respect to digital technologies, including blockchain, to ensure that entrepreneurs and SMEs can leverage future opportunities. Additionally, we continue to invest in technology to ensure all our customers are able to interact with us across all modern channels in a secure and customer-focused manner. </p>]]></richbody0content>

The new Free Trade Zones in Umm Al Houl and Abu Fontas also open up a number of opportunities for foreign investors, and we are well connected with the relevant parties there. Our involvement in similar projects around the world, whether in Asia, Europe, or the Middle East, gives us a strong competitive advantage when it comes to serving enterprises across geographies and facilitating international trade and capital flows to help our clients grow their businesses.</p><h4>Qatar is working to become an enhanced hub for trade and re-export. What services can HSBC offer to exporters?</h4><p>We offer a full range of trade and receivables finance products that include export documentary credits and collections, as well as export loans.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will fintech affect the country and Doha Bank in particular? </h4><p>There has been a significant push to promote Qatar as a regional fintech hub. Qatar offers the right regulatory environment, extremely competitive operating costs, government support, funding support, and a ready financial services sector to work with. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) recently launched a new strategy that needs to ensure that fintech firms enhance the financial system. QCB Governor HE Sheikh Abdulla bin Saoud Al-Thani reiterated that Qatar is committed to investing in the rapidly emerging financial technology sector and has developed a strategy to create a fintech hub in the country. Fintech can help QCB achieve its goals to set up in the financial sector strategy. There is momentum building in Qatar, with opportunities in digital payments, money management, lending, loyalty and rewards, remittances, investments, and advisory. Doha Bank is keeping abreast of these developments and will determine its next course of action accordingly. </p><h4>How do you assess the impact of the blockade on Qatar's economy? </h4><p>Qatar's net international reserves dropped 30% in June 2017, and foreign currency deposits in banks fell the most in almost two years. That said, its reserves are more than twice its GDP, and the country made alternate arrangements for supplies. Essentially, Qatar was engaged in converting from plan A to plan B. In terms of financial stability, Qatar is strong, stable, and functional. The country's foreign exchange reserves with the Qatar Central Bank remained broadly stable, at around USD38 billion in February 2018, equating to six months of import cover. Qatar's banking system needs no further support from the central bank and sovereign wealth fund, as the decline in non-resident liabilities of lenders has subsided, according to the IMF. Qatar came up with various reforms in 2017 after the economic blockade that will further encourage diversification of the country's economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What value does the Commercial Bank of Qatar place on education?</h4><p>Education is one of the key strategic areas under the Qatar National Vision 2030. With more than 42 years of history in the country, we support the development of Qatar in many ways, including education. We have sponsored 153 students for university education, and another 83 students have gone through our graduate program. At the same time, we have an internship program for young students who want to acquire an early understanding of banking and could be interested in careers in the field. We also provide funding to the education sector where we finance operations, such as construction of new campuses or the expansion of educational facilities. In addition, we provide personal loans for students. For example, we have an agreement with HEC Paris' campus in Qatar to offer interest-free loans to promote education in business areas. </p><h4>You have been recognized as the best remittance service in the Middle East. How important are remittances in a country like Qatar?</h4><p>The majority of people in Qatar are expats. There are 300,000 Qataris and over 2 million expats. Many of the foreigners are here not only to make a living, but also to send money to their families through remittances. We have introduced a service that provides a 60-second remittance for certain countries. We have done it for India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, and we just opened up for Nepal and Pakistan. These countries contribute to the majority of the working population in Qatar. The service is digital, which is important so they do not have to withdraw money and go to a remittance place or branch. It is incredibly fast and secure, and users receive a confirmation back via an SMS. We started this about a year ago, and we have seen our volumes multiply by 10-13 times. However, the most important aspect is that by putting digital remittances into the work environment, we are improving people's experience and saving their time. </p><h4>Sanaduk is a tailored solution to support SMEs in Qatar. What does it entail? </h4><p>In any economy, SMEs are usually the main sources of employment. We have a dedicated division for SME clients that provides services to more than 12,000 clients. Sanaduk is a tailored solution for young entrepreneurs and companies because it is a ready package of services ranging from account opening to giving the owners the privilege and priority banking service to order POs, for example. We also work with the Qatar Development Bank on its specific loan program for SMEs and start-ups to bring financing to both current and prospective clients. Finally, we have also been focusing on bringing digital banking to our SME clients, since it is a productive, efficient, and quicker way of operating. </p><h4>How is the Commercial Bank of Qatar planning to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the 2022 FIFA World Cup?</h4><p>There are many contracts being awarded in the construction sector, while we are also financing one of our clients for one of the stadiums. The World Cup is a major driver of growth in the construction sector, and many of our clients are involved in construction and transportation, so we help them by financing their daily operations and projects. It is a great opportunity and we are seeing, for example, a lot of Turkish contractors working in Qatar for whom we are a natural link because we have a branch in Turkey. In general, Qatar will be increasingly visible on the international stage over the next four years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements and milestones for Barwa Bank in the past year?</h4><p>Barwa Bank has been in the market for more than a decade, having developed from a start-up phase into a mature organization that has consistently gained market share while increasing its asset base, client portfolio, and product offerings. In the last financial year ending December 31, 2018, we are proud to have realized a net profit of QAR765 million, and our total assets exceeded the QAR44-billion mark. The government is Barwa Bank's largest shareholder, and in line with the nation's ambitious economic diversification plans, we are focused on meeting the requirements of the local economy, namely assisting government-related entities, corporates, SMEs, and private and retail banking clients with their ever-evolving banking needs.</p><h4>How is Barwa Bank innovating through its digital services?</h4><p>The group's positive financial results come in line with its commitment to improve the products and services provided to customers and to benefit from the rapid development of technologies that provide the greatest flexibility and ease of transactions, while aiming to deliver distinguished sharia-compliant services equivalent to international standards. Our corporate internet banking enables secure access anywhere in the world. On another front, our SMS banking is designed to keep customers up-to-date with their finances with instant alerts to their mobile phones. In addition, we launched our all-new mobile banking app in 1Q2019 that aims to simplify banking transactions without any need to visit branches. The future of banking lies in mobile and online banking, and providing our customers with such accessibility comes in line with our efforts to deliver a seamless banking experience through a range of secure and convenient channels.</p><h4>How do you assess the impact of the blockade on Qatar's economy?</h4><p>The blockade was unfortunate and unexpected; however, there has been a negligible impact on the day-to-day lives of people. A positive outcome of the blockade can be seen in the new sectors that have emerged, covering food security, warehousing, ports, and logistics. The blockade has enabled local SMEs to claim a larger role in agribusiness, F&amp;B, basic commodities, light industries, and the medical sectors. Qatar has demonstrated to the world that it does not politicize trade, which has been a catalyst for FDI, tourism, foreign ownership, and the equity markets. Essentially, it has moved the wheel faster in terms of Qatar's strategy to diversify away from the hydrocarbons sector. On the financial side, Qatar's banking system remained healthy with ample liquidity, high asset quality, and strong capitalization, although external pressure prevails. Barwa Bank in particular had a solid financial performance in both 2017 and 2018. Today, we are  prepared to support public- and private-sector diversification initiatives, backed by Qatar's robust and dynamic economy. We continue to provide support to foreign companies based in Qatar and entities looking to do business in Qatar.</p><h4>What value will the Barwa Bank and ibq merger bring to Qatar's banking sector?</h4><p>Our board of directors and shareholders have approved the merger between Barwa Bank and ibq. The merger will rebalance the Qatari banking sector, creating a leading sharia-compliant financial institution with a solid financial position and robust liquidity. The combined assets of both banks are around QAR80 billion, with shareholders' equity of about QAR12 billion based on December 31, 2018 financial results. The merger will result in a large entity that will have a 6% share of Qatar's overall banking market and makes Barwa Bank and ibq more competitive to tap into big-ticket projects. Furthermore, the new entity will have a diverse financing and depositor's profile, diversifying risk and strengthening the business proposition of the combined entity given the individual segmental strengths of Barwa Bank and ibq. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As Qatar's largest bank, how do you assess your contribution to the development and growth of the country?</h4><p>QNB is fully committed to the goals of Qatar's National Vision 2030 with the objective of diversifying the economy in a sustainable way. As a financial intermediary, we view ourselves as a natural catalyst to nurture the growth of the public and private sectors, specifically SMEs. Regarding large corporations, our focus over the past year has been largely on the four key sectors in which we have been most active: utilities, transport, infrastructure for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and food security. With regards to commercial and small businesses, we have seen a surge in the numbers of SMEs in Qatar in the past year. Entrepreneurs are stepping in to seize opportunities in the run up to the World Cup and in the wake of the rise in projects supporting growth in self-sufficiency. We are partnering with Qatar Development Bank to encourage and empower entrepreneurs and innovators to contribute to the diversification and growth of the Qatari economy. Our goal is to help establish businesses that are commercially viable and contribute positively to a sustainable society. We do not limit our engagement to financial contributions alone, but also bring a social contribution supporting economic growth and financial inclusion. We are an employer of choice and aim to offer fulfilling careers and development opportunities for highly skilled employees.</p><h4>How will QNB support Qatar Rail in developing the transportation sector? </h4><p>Our support for the Qatar Rail project is facilitating a new and sustainable mode of transport for the country that will also bring long-term benefits for the environment. QNB has already helped the project by participating throughout the value chain, supporting not only Qatar Rail, but also its contractors and subcontractors. This allows us to extract the most value from the project, which broke ground in 2018. At the same time, this important landmark project will bolster the development of the transportation sector in Qatar and further contribute to economic growth. Furthermore, we also signed a landmark merchant agreement with Qatar Rail, which will see the bank join as a strategic partner and the official acquirer bank for all Travel Card and Fare Media payments. It will ensure that Qatar Rail will be able to accept payments made with all major credit and debit cards issued in Qatar and worldwide. Payments will be possible directly at the stations through the Travel Cards Vending Machines, on a dedicated website, and through the mobile app. This will enable the quick, safe, and secure purchase of Travel Card and top up as well as facilitate the purchase of limited use cards. </p><h4>How do you assess the impact of the blockade on Qatar's economy, and has it affected QNB's operations? </h4><p>The blockade has been an unexpected shock to the country that has been weathered well, demonstrating that Qatar's economy is robust and resilient. The authorities were quick to react and have swiftly taken measures not only to mitigate the effect but also re-direct the economy toward new avenues of growth. As a result, Qatar has successfully overcome the blockade and served as a catalyst and platform for future long-term growth where the challenges imposed were transformed into opportunities. New ownership laws were ratified to allow up to 100% foreign ownership, free zones have been created, and other incentives from seed capital to tax incentives and free office space are being provided to attract foreign direct investment. Furthermore, a package of labor reforms, permanent residency, and visa waivers for over 80 nationalities have been undertaken, while Qatar has also diversified its network of trade partners. Existing trade ties have been strengthened, and new trade opportunities have emerged. Despite the blockade, the banking sector remains highly profitable and well capitalized with high levels of asset quality. The blockade has done little to substantially diminish our position as the largest bank in the Middle East and Africa. Domestically, it has reinvigorated the market, fostering more innovation, creativity, and drive to self-sufficiency. It has also fuelled a number of sizeable food security, manufacturing, tourism, and infrastructure (including utilities) projects that QNB has been instrumental in supporting. Finally, several new trading partners and routes have also been established. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your priorities for your new five-year term?</h4><p>The global economic and financial front has raised new challenges and opportunities, which have influenced central banks all over the world. In fact, they have changed the future of central banks. Two priorities are leading our five-year agenda, strengthening our monetary policy framework as well as financial stability, and fostering the advancement of the financial and banking infrastructure. Henceforth, aiming to achieve Qatar's ambition to be a leading financial hub in the region, and in order to face the challenges, three main strategies were designed considering new policies, regulations, and tools. Strategy wise, from the sectorial level, the Financial Sector Regulatory Strategy for 2017-2022 was released after the economic blockade in June 2017. This focuses on guiding the state of Qatar in its future endeavors towards building a sound and resilient financial sector to ensure sustainable economic growth in alignment with Qatar National Vision 2030 objectives. The strategy is also helping the banking and financial sectors support the country as it prepares to host the 2022 World Cup with things like the payment system platform. Given the globalization of financial technology, we have designed a Financial Technology Strategy in cooperation with Qatar Development Bank (QDB) to create a "fintech hub" in the country, which is critical for our future success. Awareness that the ecosystem will be more important than ever encouraged us to create a financial inclusion and literacy strategy, which will seek to broaden the financial sector through supply and demand-side measures linking banks' service development to customs awareness and protection. A key element of this strategy is promoting the SME sector, which will also be consistent with the Qatar National Development Strategy (QNDS 2) objective of economic diversification and promoting greater private participation.</p><h4>What green economy plans does the Qatar Central Bank have in mind?</h4><p>The focus on green financing has spread rapidly throughout the world, and leading central banks are taking significant initiatives to address issues related to such financing. In Qatar, we have also taken initiatives to support green financing. Commercial banks have launched innovative credit products like 'green mortgages,' which reward environmentally conscious new homebuyers  with concessional financing terms. Relatedly, Qatar Development Bank (QDB) is also proactive in funding SMEs in agriculture, livestock, and fisheries with the twin objectives of empowering local businesses and achieving self-sufficiency. The Second Strategic Plan for Financial Sector Regulation provides a well-defined roadmap to promote sustainable investment and green finance. This includes, among others, devising incentives for firms to promote green financing, enhancing cooperation with QDB to foster economic diversification, and exploring the possibility of issuing green bonds.</p><h4>With the implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS-9), which improvements are you seeing in the Qatar financial sector?</h4><p style="margin-left: 20px;">IFRS-9 is designed to bring more transparency, accountability, and efficiency to financial institutions across the world through high-quality accounting criteria. Given the forward-looking nature of this regulation, this will make banks proactive in establishing and building up their allowance for possible future credit losses. Not only will this further improve their credit risk assessment skills, but additionally improve data quality and ensure better pricing of loans. This will enable them to better manage their profitability, as identification and corrective measures can be taken well in advance. In sum, IFRS-9 reporting will enhance the overall health and resilience of the banking sector and better equip them to address sharp and sudden downturns in economic cycles. ?</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Clever Leaves led the evolution of the sector in Colombia? </h4><p>Clever Leaves began 2018 with secured funding. We partnered with Northern Swan and started to grow from there. We were pretty much in line with five or six players at that time, and there were clearly two leaders a little ahead of us. Today, we are among the top-two players in developing the medical cannabis industry in Colombia. We have led it in different dimensions; first we have been aggressive in all of our operations deployment and have been able to build over five hectares of cultivation, which are now up and running; these will expand to over 15 hectares by mid 2019. We have also built a GACP-grade post-harvest facility and already started producing in a GMP pharma type production facility; in less than a year that is remarkable for any company in Colombia and elsewhere. We were five people in early 2018, and now have over 130 people. It should reach 200 in January 2019 and over 600 by the end of the year. That gives a sense of how fast we have been setting up our capacity. Secondly, we have been the most aggressive company in developing partnerships with different potential clients across the world, which gives us a solid position to show that we are not only growing cannabis, but have clear destinations for it. Third, we have helped the country make a leap on the regulatory side of things, which is one of the reasons why the cannabis industry has moved forward this year. Fourth, we have invested significantly in innovation at many levels. </p><h4>What will be the socio-economic impact of a robust medical cannabis sector for Mexico? </h4><p>The potential is huge. A large part of the healthcare system in Mexico is state run and highly centralized. If Mexico continues down this path, patients will have access to affordable high-quality medical cannabis relatively soon. From a societal standpoint, medical cannabis does not have a lot of push back. Recreational is a different story, but the medical benefits will be well received. It is clearly a win-win situation for doctors and patients alike. </p><h4>What lessons can Mexico learn from medical cannabis in Colombia and vice versa? </h4><p>Mexico has already implemented a few things taken from the Colombian legislation, since there are certain similarities in what they are proposing and what we have. One of the things Mexico has done well is position itself as a country that can supply the world, whether medical or recreational, whereas Colombian law limits production and commercialization to medical cannabis. Though I agree that whether or not cannabis should be legalized for recreational purposes is an issue that must be resolved locally, a country's ability to position itself as a world supplier is economically promising. Colombia could adopt this part of the regulation from Mexico. One thing Mexico could learn from Colombian law, on the other hand, is that it abides by all the international treaties and agreements. In Colombia, we have to get quotas approved with the ICNB, restrictions today that will be an asset for the country from a regulatory standpoint in the long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since its inception in 2006, what have been some of the major contributions of Qatar Tribune to the media sector?</h4><p>Qatar Tribune has been a significant player in advancing the role of free media in Qatar and the region with its sharp, balanced, and objective reporting. Since its inception, it has focused on providing an edge to reporting and writing about issues that concern both local communities and the broader nation. Effectively, it has played its desired mediating role in strengthening the key institutions for a free and vibrant society. Qatar is on the right track to becoming a knowledge-based society, and Qatar Tribune is contributing to help achieve Qatar National Vision 2030. The paper adheres to the time-tested norms, laws, and media ethics of journalism. Objectivity and accuracy are sine qua non of journalism, and it is in our DNA to follow the profession's established canons. On the micro level, Qatar Tribune has contributed to refining the genres of print journalism. For instance, it was the first newspaper in the country to print separate sections on national affairs, sports, business, and entertainment. Second, we were the first media outlet to publish special pages focused on different communities. On each day of the week, a full-page is devoted to one specific expat community, while another is reserved for highlighting Qatari traditions, culture, and way of life. This has undoubtedly brought communities together.</p><h4>What is your strategy for capitalizing on the increasing level of online penetration in Qatar?</h4><p>Consumption of news and information from online sources has increased in the last couple of years. Qatar has one of the highest internet penetration levels in the world. Accordingly, Qatar Tribune has a strategy in place to adapt to this environment. At the same time, traditional news sources such as print are still viable and will remain so for a long time. We have a substantial online presence and are keen to press ahead with ideal and desirable convergence of print and digital. We are the first Qatari newspaper to have native mobile apps and e-papers to promote our digital presence. We are also present on all social media platforms and are always looking for ways to improve and engage with users. Qatar's media sector is dynamic and evolving and has adapted well to recent digital trends. </p><h4>How do you keep the business community well informed? </h4><p>We have a strong business team working to keep readers informed about developments in the economy and business world. The Qatari economy has been firing on all cylinders since the blockade was imposed, and we report down to the minutest of detail on both micro and macroeconomic developments taking place in various sectors of the economy. </p><h4>With the blockade, Qatari newspapers were blocked in the UAE. How did you cope with this situation, and how would you assess the response on the Qatari side to this action?</h4><p>The media sector in Qatar has not been affected by what neighboring countries have done or how the media in those countries have reported the issue. We have exposed the blockading countries' duplicity and hypocrisy while maintaining decorum and dignity. The entire world is witness to the fact that Qatar's leadership, people, and media have maintained equanimity and calm in response to extreme provocation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are confident about the year ahead and the future in general. International media outlets have acknowledged that Qatar not only weathered the blockade but has come out stronger than before. There is total unanimity within the global community that the neighboring countries shot themselves in the foot by declaring a blockade on Qatar. One of the most positive outcomes of the blockade has been the Qatari government's determination to achieve self-sufficiency in various sectors of the economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What motivated Roland Berger to open an office in Qatar?</h4><p>Roland Berger has been active in the country for over 10 years. We have successfully been advising Qatari companies and government entities on a variety of strategic and operational topics. I personally delivered the first project in Qatar in 2010. Qatar has been on a highly dynamic trajectory in recent years, not only in terms of economic growth. A clear vision of the future, a comprehensive transformation strategy, and a consistent implementation has laid the foundations for a diversified economy. That is why Qatar is a highly attractive market and is on track to continue its path of accelerated growth. What is more, Qatar and Germany have a time-tested relationship, a cooperation that only grows by the day.</p><h4>What characterizes German-Qatari business relations?</h4><p>Qatar and Germany have highly complementary business characteristics with a variety of historical parallels. In recent years, both countries have been working intensively on joint initiatives, such as the Qatari-German Joint Task Force to expand and deepen cooperation and promote economic ties as well as political relations between them. These initiatives have resulted in a surge in direct investments and several partnerships between Qatari and German companies. By connecting the business characteristics of Qatar with Germany's innovative ecosystem—built on its strong industrial competencies, technology-driven organizations, and international network—Germany could strongly support Qatar's business environment and facilitate the move toward a well-diversified economy. The German economy is driven by several key values such as entrepreneurship and innovation, as well as family-owned businesses (mittelstand). Germans focus on the development of successful ideas and concepts; however, equally important is the effective execution and implementation of these concepts and solutions. As true entrepreneurs, we put ourselves in our clients' shoes instead of watching from the sidelines. The German economy is built on consensual national and international relations, enabling intense collaboration and lasting partnerships, which is why we are confident that our strong German DNA can contribute to the success of the entire Qatari ecosystem.</p><h4>What expertise can Roland Berger bring to the country?</h4><p>Qatari organizations and companies have been growing rapidly and have embarked on their transformational journeys. We expect this to continue. In recent years, Germany and its organizations have been in similar transformational environments. Roland Berger—the only leading global strategy firm with German roots—has helped companies and public institutions to master these transformational challenges, and we strongly believe our expertise in strategy, innovation, and digitalization can support the diversification and enhance the resilience of the Qatari economy. Looking beyond 2022, our international network could be extremely valuable to Qatar. Roland Berger could link Qatar with leading companies to leverage their industrial expertise, open doors to global capital markets, and connect the country with the most innovative start-ups to accelerate business model and product innovation. </p><h4>What does the future of Qatar look like?</h4><p>In recent years, Qatar has taken the right decisions and started a number of pivotal strategic initiatives. By pushing the diversification of its economy, Qatar has laid the foundations for sustainable growth. This has been supported by several important initiatives such as the development of the country's free zones, the expansion of new air and sea shipping lines, and the start of operations at Hamad Port. We expect the services sector to become one of the most significant contributors to Qatar's economic growth, driven by industry segments related to the ongoing preparation of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, such as transportation, public services, real estate, and financial services. However, the question is how Qatar will continue on this growth path beyond 2022. Qatar should further focus on the diversification of its economy and continue to transform into a knowledge-based society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Qatar's potential as a business hub changed with the introduction of the new FDI legislation?</h4><p>The new Foreign Investment law strengthens the option of using arbitration to resolve commercial disputes as a non-Qatari investor may agree in its agreements on settling disputes with other parties through arbitration or other means, such as out-of-court dispute settlement. The new law provides several investment incentives for non-Qatari investors and allows the allocation of land to a non-Qatari investor to establish his investment project through rent or usufruct in accordance with the legislation in force. Moreover, a non-Qatari investor may import the necessary equipment to establish, operate, and expand investment projects, while non-Qatari investments may be exempt from income tax in accordance with the procedures and regulations stipulated in the Income Tax Law. Equally important, the law states that non-Qatari investment projects are exempt from customs duties on machinery and equipment imports, while non-Qatari investment projects in the industrial sector shall be exempt from customs duties on imports of raw materials and semi-manufactured goods required that are unavailable in local markets. In addition, the Council of Ministers may, on the proposal of the Minister, grant investment project incentives and benefits in addition to the incentives provided for in this law. Other incentives are that non-Qatari investments shall not be directly or indirectly subject to expropriation or other similar actions, unless undertaken for the public good and with appropriate compensation; non-Qatari investors are also free to transfer their investments to and from Qatar without delay, including proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or some of their investments, the proceeds of the settlement of investment disputes, and any compensation due to a non-Qatari investor; and a non-Qatari investor may transfer the ownership of his investment to any other investor or relinquish it in favor of his national partner in case of a joint venture. The investment shall continue to be treated in accordance with the provisions of the law, provided that he or she continues to operate the project and assumes the previous investor's rights and obligations.</p><h4>To what extent do other changes in the residency legislation attract FDI?</h4><p>Under Law No. 10 of 2018 on permanent residency, expatriates in Qatar can obtain a permanent residency permit (PRP) under certain rules and conditions. Expatriates in Qatar should complete 20 years in the country on a legal ordinary residency permit if he or she is born abroad and 10 years for expatriates born in Qatar. The residency duration should be uninterrupted and completed prior to the date of application. With the implementation of a formal permanent residence program, Qatar's aim is both to retain the existing highly skilled foreign population and reward them for their services to Qatar. Furthermore, the program aims to attract additional foreign investments and open Qatar's economy up to other industries as the country's efforts to diversify continue.</p><h4>SANAD was developed by ASTAD to support contractual procedures in the construction industry. How can it be used to avoid disputes?</h4><p>SANAD, meaning support in Arabic, is the integrated suite of contracts developed by ASTAD. It includes a suite of four contract templates and standardized forms covering construction, design and build, design services, and professional services. It aims to bring all parties involved in a project together by reducing costs, maintaining appropriate risk for all parties, and offering more balanced contract terms and conditions. It solves the key challenge of standard contracts in the region regarding inequitable and inefficient tender documents, while providing users with its original purpose, to support and improve traditional contractual procedures. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Al Sulaiti Law Firm recently celebrated its 15th anniversary. How do you reflect on its growth, evolution, and contribution to Qatar?</h4><p>Our 15th anniversary was indeed a special celebration, and the Minister of Justice inaugurated the event. The anniversary was held on the same day as the opening ceremony of our new offices in Doha Tower. Our relocation was a major accomplishment for the firm and has allowed us to open new doors to international and local opportunities, and we were crowned Qatar Law Firm of the Year 2018 at the LexisNexis Awards. We have always striven to be the best we can by providing top quality legal service through our professional qualified associates and consultants.</p><h4>What is your vision for further local and international expansion?</h4><p>Our vision is to be a global firm with a regional outlook, which we make sure to implement in our daily practice. The firm participates in and sponsors several international conferences as a tool to broaden its international network, such as the International Bar Association (IBA) Annual Conference, which we joined in 2005. We have recently signed partnerships with law firms around the world, including in Italy, Turkey, and Kuwait, among others.</p><h4>What makes Al Sulaiti Law Firm the right fit for international companies operating in Qatar?</h4><p>With more than 15 years of experience, we have fast become one of the most prominent and reputable firms in Qatar. We are one of the founding members of MENA City Lawyers, an organization that links five law firms in North Africa and the Gulf, and have highly qualified lawyers from Egypt, France, Italy, the UK, India, Lebanon, and more.</p><h4>How have you bridged the gap between the legal traditions of your clients and Qatar's?</h4><p>We provide services to link the gap between international and local legal systems at the local and regional level. This allows our clients to be more at ease to deal with lawyers by choosing to speak in the language they feel more comfortable discussing their case with. In addition to that, we have a professional training program for associates at all levels to allow them to constantly improve their social, negotiation, and communication skills. Employee satisfaction is crucial to having a successful law firm. Our attention and keenness to provide professional legal services is what ranks us among the most prominent law firms. We are also keen to keep our attention on details in dealing with our clients from the first meeting all the way to providing after-service support. We keep communicating with our client on a regular basis and providing them with all the information, details, and steps we take. This is how we establish trust with our clients. </p><h4>What are your objectives and expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>In our relentless pursuit of growth and business development, we are implementing a 10-year plan to maintain our rate of progress and growth. Such success is due to our ability to recruit qualified lawyers and legal advisers to our team. Since we are a Qatari law firm with a regional reach and global outlook, we adopt effective policies aimed at diversifying our scope of work with the most talented lawyers and professional legal advisors available in the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ghada-philip-el-rassi-chief-executive-officer-expansion-executive-board-member]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give an overview of MEEZA and how MEEZA's Business Cloud can advance the digitalization of companies in Qatar? </h4><p>MEEZA has been in the local market for the past 10 years and is now a mature company. It was established to accelerate IT adoption in Qatar as means of building a knowledge-based society in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030. MEEZA is an end-to-end managed IT service and solution provider based in Qatar with a state-of-the-art data center, which is its first key differentiator. We have 4,000sqm of data suites and are LEED-certified. Over the years, MEEZA has continued to mature and add new data center services starting with managed services to the cloud. MEEZA was a pioneer and the first to launch the concept of a cloud; the market, at that time, was careful to give it a try, and the level of understanding was not that mature. We did a great deal of education as first movers, and over time, the market witnessed other partners entering the sector. In 2018, MEEZA Expansion launched MEEZA Business Cloud and started to expand internationally by offering services and solutions online to the local as well as foreign markets. Working closely with international and local partners gave us the ability to accelerate our execution plan, and we currently provide Microsoft products including Azure, security solutions, and Augmented Reality (AR), and are now working to introduce Virtual Reality (VR) and backpack PCs, mainly for the fields such as architecture and medical services. Our go-to-market strategy is based on studies and analyses provided by well-known and certified advisors and consultants. We know that by 2022, some 30% of consumers in mature countries will depend on AI to decide on what they will eat and how they will wear clothes. This is an indication that we cannot ignore this trend, especially since we are fortunate to have the understanding of the board and the full support of investors. </p><h4>How does MEEZA work to enhance cybersecurity in a business environment? </h4><p>MEEZA is one of the pioneers of cybersecurity and one of the first movers to have a Commercial Security Operations Center (SOC) in Doha. We are extremely aware of the business needs when it comes to cybersecurity and data protection. Today, things are no longer tangible, and everything became digital even the money. Data is therefore becoming valuable. Future sources of wealth will be information, which is why cybersecurity has become an important and urgent matter in our industries. <br>The job of an IT service provider is to shoulder this responsibility so that clients and organizations can focus on their core business. There are four important security pillars that an organization needs to focus on to minimize the threat coming from the proliferation of digitalization: risk, governance, business continuity, and people. Those four elements, if secured to the client, will ensure any implementation will be successful, and all transactions will be secured. MEEZA's main focus since its establishment was to secure its platform and tools and always govern the deliverables of the partners, hence gaining its clients' trust in its services. Providing security services is essential for MEEZA as it plays an important role in offering protection against common threats and those targeting specific industries. MEEZA's Advanced Security Monitoring Services provides alerts and notification around the clock for organizations that require constant security monitoring of their critical assets and infrastructure. <br>Opting for the public cloud as a solution should be guaranteed with trustworthy platforms that are more secure than privately hosted servers. In addition, it is essential that the service provider take the educational path as a part of the delivery so to reduce human errors at the beginning. Continuous awareness programs will support a smooth and successful implementation and execution. If we do not explain exactly every step in the business and how users have to deal with those solutions and transactions, it will affect the entire investment and implementation. Clarity in engagement and communication is the key to success. </p><h4>What other changes will shape Qatar's IT sector in the near future? </h4><p>Qatar is pioneering many aspects, specifically in terms of implementing cyber laws. Qatar was the first GCC country to enact a law specific to data protection. 5G will also have a significant impact on our AI business and automation, and upgrade our hardware to cope with faster speed of communication and connection. This will also require telecom providers to work closely with service providers because the platform to render the service resides in our type of business. In the coming years, all telecoms will have to sell private network mobility, and this is another product that will be in the market soon. <br>Digital transformation will bring exciting opportunities, as well as new challenges, to all industries. We must harness the power of emerging technologies to create more efficient operations, new business models, and better customer experience. Our goal is to accelerate the growth of the IT industry in Qatar and the region through the provision of our services. </p><h4>What are the priorities for MEEZA Expansion in 2019? </h4><p>We are one team in MEEZA, and we are extremely excited to go international. The most important thing is to promote MEEZA and Qatar's platform. Our target is to position MEEZA as one of the most secured public platforms. MEEZA Expansion recently established number of strategic partnerships that are aimed at not only expanding MEEZA's footprint outside of Qatar, but also diversifying MEEZA's already rich service portfolio. MEEZA is further developing its expertise to provide its customers with user-friendly and hassle-free, cost-efficient, and tech-savvy innovation through MEEZA Expansion, one of four organizations that acquired a LEED Platinum Certification worldwide.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry opened an office in Brazil in 2017 and one in Panama in 2018. What was the philosophy behind opening these new offices?</h4><p>Dubai Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry tends to open offices in markets with potential for businesses from Dubai. We look to these offices to provide us with more information because they are on the ground in those markets. As well as that mandate they showcase products and connect Dubai businesses looking for potential new markets. As part of this, our offices facilitate meetings and explain to members more about what can be done in a particular market. Our Panama office is the Chamber's 10th office. We started in Africa to facilitate trade and investment from both sides. In Latin America, Sío Paulo was our first office, Panama is the second, and we are not going to stop there. We are currently looking at Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Chile, and Colombia. We are trying to build a network to support our businesses in Dubai so they can learn more about the opportunities for trade and investment internationally. If they want to proceed, we want our people on the ground to help them close deals and connect with other businesses. We are also trying to promote Dubai through our overseas offices, facilitate more relationships and trade, and attract more businesses to the Emirate.</p><h4>How do you think the 3rd Global Business Forum Latin America in Panama will foster stronger economic cooperation between Dubai, and in general the Arabian Gulf and Latin America?</h4><p>The Global Business Forum Latin America — Panama 2019 is a platform through which we are trying to connect businesses together from both regions. We also involve the government to talk about challenges and opportunities, and showcase what can be done. This will be our third Global Business Forum on Latin America and the first held outside Dubai. This is a new experience for us. By hosting this event within Latin America, we can connect with a much bigger business community from not only Panama, but also South America, Central America, and the Caribbean region. We see a lot of potential in these regions and the first two forums were very successful in exploring opportunities and synergies We learned more about what can be done and through this third forum we want to continue that conversation. It will be an opportunity to showcase and provide more information because businesses keep evolving. We see a lot can be done to connect the two regions, and Panama and Dubai are great partners to do that.</p><h4>How exactly will opening your Panama office assist Panamanian and Latin American companies and improve trade and exchanges between them and Dubai?</h4><p>Promoting Dubai as an international business hub is one of Dubai Chamber's strategic objectives. Commerce and international trade are at the core of what we and our members do in Dubai. Through that we try to emphasize what we have been doing well for the past 40-50 years and we want to continue growing this into new markets. We have been doing a lot with Latin America, but of the USD360 million in trade Dubai generates each year, only 2% is represented by the region. For that reason, we believe there is still a lot of room to grow. Latin American markets have been trading with our part of the world, but perhaps they have not focused on it in the past. We see a lot of opportunities and it is not just about Dubai or the Gulf region. This is about the wider region of the Middle East, Africa, and Southern Asia. This is what we are working on by being on the ground in Latin America. We are expanding the Dubai Chamber's role and membership all the way through Latin America, and Panama is a great city to be in to connect with that region. We believe by doing this we can give our businesses more reasons to consider trading with that part of the world. We can also gather and validate more market intelligence if it is coming from the Dubai Chamber locally on the ground. It is a network that will support our international expansion and allow our businesses to grow their relationships with a part of the world that has a lot of products to trade. We are focusing a lot in the area of agriculture because the Arabian Gulf region imports nearly 90% of what we consume. For that reason, we are always looking at alternatives for imports in case circumstances change. We have succeeded in Africa with coffee, tea, and flowers, which Latin America already trades in, but not directly with our region—it is usually through Europe or America. We hope we will be able to divert some of that trade, which can provide quite a lot of value addition to businesses from both sides. People see Latin America as far away, but by establishing the infrastructure with offices and the direct air transport links Emirates offers, as well as growing existing businesses and establishing businesses in more countries, we believe trade will grow. This will connect the two regions further.</p><h4>What are the advantages for Latin American countries using Dubai as a gateway to Asia, Africa, and the wider Middle East region?</h4><p>Dubai is a distribution hub. We have a good geographical location, world-class infrastructure in terms of ports and air connectivity, and a business environment that makes it easy to conduct business. Dubai is relatively competitive and we have free zones that allow 100% foreign ownership and offer a tax-free haven. Dubai also has a business community that is well connected with the wider region. Therefore, doing business with our members gives a firm access to a sizable regional market in terms of population that demands and imports a lot of products. We believe that by connecting Latin America and the GCC through Panama and Dubai, we can offer wide access to companies from Latin America. And we are not only looking at trade; we are also looking for investment. We hope to be able to showcase some investments from Latin America, for example in the hospitality industry, where UAE businesses already have quite a good competitive advantage and strong knowledge, and the supply chain and logistics industry. We are looking for real estate opportunities, which Dubai knows how to do quite well. On the other side, Latin American companies are looking to showcase their infrastructure where Dubai Ports, for example, has already been operating well. They are hoping to connect more businesses, for example, in the field of renewable energy. We think there is a lot to sit and talk about, and continue the dialogue that has proven to be successful in the past. There is a very strong political relationship between the UAE and many Latin American countries and the Chamber wants to build on that. We want to increase tourism and connect businesses from both sides.</p><h4>What is the biggest synergy and priority you see today between Latin America and Dubai?</h4><p>We see a number of them. Agribusiness is one of our top priorities. We already have a strong relationship with Brazil, for example, and we want to diversify that into other countries. We have relationships with a number of countries, but these are quite concentrated and we believe there are other things that can be showcased. Latin American countries also want to diversify their business relationships away from North America. We realize that many Latin American businesses have Middle Eastern roots from previous generations, and some would like to reconnect with this part of the world. We are trying to address this. For the Global Business Forum, we are in partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank, which is doing a great job of supporting projects in Latin America, particularly in infrastructure. We hope that through this partnership we can engage more businesses from both sides and build more trust and transparency. Again, all of this is aimed at supporting businesses. The financial sector is one sector we did not look at in the past. Now that we have an established a presence in  Panama, a leading finance hub for Latin America much like Dubai is to the Middle East, we look forward to exploring this high-potential area of cooperation further through our discussions and interactions with stakeholders at GBF Latin America — Panama 2019.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dyarco was originally focused on the oil and gas sector. Is the economy now diversifying? </h4><p>The economy was forced to diversify partly because of the embargo. Therefore, one of the major developments was Qatar's focus on having more local products and services to meet demand rather than depending on its neighbors. For example, there is more attention on agricultural and other consumer good production, complex manufacturing, and warehousing. Previously, goods came in through Dubai and other major regional shipping hubs and were transported to Qatar by truck. This was economically cheaper for the whole region, though now there is a degree of self-reliance in Qatar as a result of the embargo. This alone has started to develop a new economy here. Diversification is taking place, and Dyarco has done the same. We have increased our shipping and logistical volumes, along with the number of resources we are applying. The traditional economic activities of Qatar, which were oil and gas and petrochemical products, are still strong because the country needs a solid economy to support growth, regardless of the viability or economic sense of these activities today. The government is likely to give more subsidies because areas like dairy farms, agricultural manufacturing, and poultry, for example, all need to be developed. These industries cannot be established locally without the government providing incentives, which it has done.</p><h4>What investment opportunities exist in the current climate?</h4><p>There are certain product ranges and activities that make sense, but those in high demand are not historically produced here. For example, manufacturing plastic pipes is one opportunity that has emerged. I am chairman of the executive board for a local pipe manufacturing company that is ranked number one in terms of turnover and has more than 14 years of experience in the country. This was originally a joint venture with a British company before becoming a UAE company, though it has 14 years of experience in the region. There are products Qatar used to import from the UAE and Saudi Arabia that are now manufactured locally. There is a huge amount of infrastructure development going on in Qatar, particularly in the interior, all of which needs pipes. In the existing cities, infrastructure projects are predominantly for new, faster roads, such as the ring roads in Doha. It has taken some time to build this infrastructure compared to neighboring countries, but Qatar has its own pace because this is the way it has developed. This entire infrastructure will develop new areas of urbanization further out, and there will be demand. The population may fall, though consumption will not change much. The Qatari economy remains strong because the byproducts from gas, such as petrochemicals, are still high in demand. Countries like Qatar are blessed even if oil is only USD45 a barrel.</p><h4>Do you predict a positive trajectory for the Qatari economy in the coming years?</h4><p>The economy has to improve, and I have better expectations for 2019. Since the embargo, shipping has been the most active sector in the country. There are sectors where the cost factor is high now. The consumer goods sector, especially fashion and retail, has shrunk dramatically because costs have gone up. Shipping and storage costs have increased. Qatar now pays more attention to making the country more conducive to business and controlling cost factors. The country needs to modernize, mechanize, and look at all the current facilities in order to compete with its neighbors, especially in warehousing and manufacturing facilities. The government is providing many incentives, though there are also many challenges, given the increased demands of setting up industries here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Tadmur evolved into its current holding structure?</h4><p>Tadmur was established in 1977 and is considered one of the oldest companies in Qatar. Our first business was in waterproofing, and once this was established and well-known, we added a trading division. Other divisions then started to grow slowly. We currently count almost 4,500 employees, up from six when we began. In 2004, we decided to take the next step in becoming a holding company with different subsidiaries and became a legal holding in 2009, managing to merge many of the businesses into one. For example, when we established Tadmur Trading, we merged six or seven divisions together. We sought synergies between the divisions in terms of clients, labor force, suppliers, and providers. Since then, we have also established OCS Qatar, a partnership between OCS (49%) and Tadmur Holding (51%). We also set up Norwood Qatar, Tadmur Solid Surfaces, Tadmur Pump Factory, and ASAS Construction Chemical Factory.</p><h4>How do the different subsidiaries work together to encourage innovation and sustainability?</h4><p>Many of our subsidiaries work together on many projects, as this is one of the ways we obtain new projects. Tadmur Contracting is our main construction contracting company founded in 1987. This company did many flagship projects such as the Student Center for Qatar Foundation. It has eight different zones, including a bowling alley and a hospital clinic, as well as a huge space for restaurants. It was built at a cost of USD156.55 million. We also just finished building the multipurpose and sports hall of Qatar University, where 5,400 students graduated in November. It cost USD115.35 million and was completed in nine months as per the contract. Additionally, we have acquired all the relevant certificates in sustainability and to date are the only private investor constructing a project in Lusail with LEED Gold certification. We work in close cooperation with the Qatar Green Building Council to raise awareness about green practices in construction. In 2018, we handed out the Tadmur Special Award to HBKU University for its research project 'Climate change implications for built environment: impacts, mitigation measures and associated challenges in GCC countries.'</p><h4>What are your plans for helping Qatar achieve self-sufficiency in industrial production?</h4><p>After the blockade, companies in Qatar started looking into opportunities within the country to boost industrial production to meet both their and others' needs, even outside of Qatar. At the beginning, there was a disruption of supply lines that affected businesses, though at the same time, it made us look into new ways of keeping our business running smoothly. We started looking for new places and products to add to the portfolio to replace the products made purely in the blockading countries. We furthermore decided to make products locally and set up two new factories post blockade. Our previous two factories were operating prior to the blockade, but they did extremely well during the blockade. We then established Norwood Qatar a few years before the metro was planned to start and supplied locally 23 stations with their framing systems. We ran the factory for 22 hours every day for six months to produce the material. Tadmur Solid Surfaces worked on nine stations, producing acrylic sheets. Additionally, we have two other factories, Tadmur Pump Factory and ASAS Construction Chemical Factory, which will go live in 2019. We are currently conducting trials and hope to have a full-blown manufacturing of construction chemicals by June. In January, we signed an agreement with one of the biggest construction manufacturers in Turkey that wants us to produce 64 products in Qatar under its name. Our target is for the factory to run 24 hours. 2019 will be a busy year for all our factories and businesses. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The holding started operations in 1945 with the vision of providing quality international products and services to the people of Qatar. What have been some of the highlights? </h4><p>Since its inception in 1945, Ali Bin Ali Holding has stayed true to its vision of providing quality international products and services to the people of Qatar. This is the reason why we have emerged as one of the largest retail and distribution companies in the country. Today, the holding contributes to Qatar's growth through 400 international brands across 13 diversified lines of businesses. Our footprint is spread across industries such as FMCG and distribution, beverages, luxury, fashion, hospitality, production and events planning, information and communication technology, medical supplies, contracting, facility management and real estate development, printing, hypermarkets, sports and lifestyle, travel tourism, and cargo. Besides diversifying its operations over the years, the holding has launched several firsts in the country and contributed significantly to Qatar. One such example is the "Bazaar Majna" commercial plaza. Built on 38,000sqm in Katara Cultural Village, this soon-to-open project includes a series of features that are the first of its kind in Qatar and the region. It will host the well-known French department store chain Galeries Lafayette and the first Evian Spa in the Middle East. Another example is the prestigious Manateq Special Economic Zone where ABA Logistics was chosen as a partner for the massive governmental project. We have completed the building stage and will soon start operating the state-of-the-art warehouses and storage areas with world-class infrastructure. Projects of this caliber signal the clear intension of the management to invest in some of the largest and most strategic locations in Qatar.</p><h4>Which sectors are more attractive to continue diversifying your business portfolio?</h4><p>Qatar has emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. That being the reality, almost all the economic sectors have potential for healthy growth. Sectors such as tourism and hospitality, healthcare and medical research, sports and lifestyle, education, technology, and light industries have immense potential to grow. We are fortunate to be engaged in most of these sectors. As a Qatari business conglomerate, we would like to further diversify and explore opportunities in light industries, manufacturing plants, and industrial lines. Medical research is another area where we see immense potential. </p><h4>The ongoing blockade has opened the doors to the local development of F&amp;B production. How has this affected the holding's business?</h4><p>As a homegrown proud Qatari entity, it is our pleasure to support local industries in every way we can. Keeping the Qatar National Vision 2030 in mind, we seek to work with Qatari production industries, encourage them, and make their presence prominent in the local market. The blockade has led to the industrial renaissance of Qatar. Many local companies are now producing high-quality F&amp;B products. One of the biggest success stories in the midst of blockade has been the emergence of Baladna Company. Baladna launched several dairy products and signed an exclusive agreement with Ali Bin Ali Holding for distribution in the local market. We are confident that through our understanding of the Qatari market and commitment to developing best-in-class technologies, we will exceed customers' expectations and maximize the reach of the products to more than 1,600 points of sale throughout the country. The blockade has made us more self-reliant, which is positive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

They experience the consistency in our services across all sectors, and we continue to maintain these established standards with a firm commitment to providing an ever-evolving market with what it needs most. </p><h4>What competitive advantage do you have for distributing certain brands? </h4><p>We have successfully established ventures in a wide range of industries, with a special focus on luxury and high-end markets.

We have earned the trust not only of our customers, but also of leading global brands seeking to expand into Qatar and the region.</p><h4>Alfardan Group announced the launch of the Marsa Arabia Resort luxury development project. How will this be different? </h4><p>Marsa Arabia Resort is Alfardan's latest major venture in integrated luxury lifestyle development and part of its initiative to boost international hospitality offerings and commitment to supporting Qatar's progress in diversifying the economy through tourism. As Qatar is positioned to become the preferred luxury destination in the Middle East, we are bringing an exclusive development masterplan to the market that transcends the boundaries between residential living and hotels. The landmark project is strategically located within Porto Arabia along the Pearl Qatar waterfront, featuring an architectural design that reflects both the Arabian and Andalusian cultures. Our aim for it is to showcase an entirely new way of living, with world-class facilities and amenities under the management of the St. Regis brand. The tourism sector is at the heart of our core offerings, and we are always guided by the vision of Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, to build a highly developed and sustainable nation. We will continue to build our offerings following this agenda in line with the Qatar Vision 2030 and take advantage of the strong momentum in Qatar's tourism and hospitality sector. The current developments in the sector, including infrastructure investments, are massive, and there is upward of USD200 billion for new projects. The generous support of the Qatari government to sustainable development further reinforces our confidence in significantly contributing to and tapping into our business capabilities to strengthen Qatar's presence on the global tourism map. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As one of the biggest conglomerates in Qatar, how do the financial results of Aamal reflect the resilience of the economy in spite of the blockade?</h4><p>Qatar's economy recorded a remarkable performance in 2018, with GDP higher than the previous year. This clearly demonstrates the resilience and strength of the economy resulting from the successful implementation of the government's strategy to drive economic diversification. By driving Qatar's economic self-sufficiency and expanding Qatar's international trading relationships, this strategy also clearly mitigates any effects of the blockade. As one of the most diversified groups in Qatar, Aamal's business strategy and objectives are aligned with the government's, and our performance in the first nine months of 2018 reflects that, with the delivery of a net profit of USD92.447 million. This further demonstrates the underlying resilience of the private sector in Qatar, as well as Aamal's expertise and ability in identifying and seizing the right opportunities that our strong local economy provides. Our three latest industrial projects in copper, aluminum, and drum materials manufacturing are in line with our strategy to target opportunities to further diversify our industrial manufacturing division by taking first-mover advantage into sectors that offer strong growth potential and complement our current businesses. This approach is enabled by and aligned with the government's objectives for Qatar's economic and industrial diversification. Aamal is always on the lookout for potential investment opportunities in our target markets, especially within the industrial manufacturing sector. In this way, we continuously seek to provide innovative projects that add value to the local economy and contribute to its continuing diversification. </p><h4>How can we expect the international investment portfolio of the company to develop?</h4><p>After focusing our businesses on Qatar for four decades, we have achieved a strong foundation that will provide a solid base for our international expansion. We have focused our international investments in real estate development, acquisition, and leasing, with a primary focus on the hospitality sector. Al Faisal Holding has expanded its international investment through Al Rayyan Tourism Investment Company (ARTIC), the hospitality arm of Al Faisal Holding. ARTIC aims to achieve sustainable growth through geographic expansion and diversification in key cities around the world, creating a portfolio of premium hotels, which includes 26 properties in Qatar and the MENA region, Europe, and the US.</p><h4>What are the most appealing sectors for industrial diversification?</h4><p>One major advantage of Qatar is the presence of competitively priced raw materials, including secure energy supplies. The government considers industrial development an integral part of its plan to diversify the economy through leveraging its huge natural gas reserves and strongly supports local investment in the manufacturing sector. In addition to the government's plan to invest in several downstream industries related to oil and gas, it also encourages private companies to invest in setting up local manufacturing and assembly facilities, spurred by large-scale infrastructure development. Aamal has established a strong industrial base that it continues to build upon, and we are in a strong position to explore opportunities related to the manufacturing of industrial products that depend on locally available raw materials to fulfill growing local demand before expanding to neighboring and international markets. A strong factor that supports this is the new Hamad Seaport, which has had a positive impact on Qatar's growth as a regional trading hub for various industrial activities in the Middle East.</p><h4>What have been some of Aamal and Al Faisal Holding's major achievements?</h4><p>Our economic contribution is having introduced innovative projects and product solutions. Our business model, including our diversification strategy and innovative projects, has attracted leading foreign investors and provided talented youth with promising job opportunities. In addition, our companies' projects have changed the face of the country in the sectors in which we operate. Both support activities that boost awareness of best business practices, governance, and environmental issues, while empowering people and providing training and safety awareness programs to employees. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-smart-way-to-proceed]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the grounds for establishing The Single Window?</h4><p>Qatar's Single Window is one of the initiatives that highlight the government's commitment to the ease of doing business and removing barriers for local and foreign investors. It focuses on three main areas: excellence in service delivery, namely delivering investor-focused licensing and registration services, which includes comprehensive information and end-to-end transactional services; optimizing government operations by streamlining processes and removing duplications in tasks, regulations, roles, and responsibilities, reducing the cost per application by achieving cost efficiencies through technology, and automating any low-level tasks to increase government workforce competitiveness; and providing a single version of business licensing and registration services. This will enable the government to identify challenges that may hinder the licensing process and act quickly to resolve them.</p><h4>What are some of the transactions that can be made online?</h4><p>These include exploring Qatar in terms of business opportunities, the laws, investment environment, and so on, and planning one's business by providing tools, data, and case studies to help investors as they plan and set up a business. This includes registration and licensing for local and foreign businesses and foreign labor recruitment approvals. Other areas include managing one's business in the form of renewing and updating licensing data and information, as well as closing down a business.</p><h4>The Single Window started the “Own your Factory in Qatar" initiative to help investors in the industrial sector. What does this entail, and how has it gone so far? </h4><p>We looked at what Qatar currently imports and saw a shortfall in local production. This initiative was thus fueled by a strong shift from local and international investors toward manufacturing and local packaging. The “Own Your Factory" initiative seeks to speed up manufacturing and support entrepreneurs to be part of the Qatari economic growth cycle. However, what made “Own Your Factory" unique was an increase in demand for Made in Qatar products, a strong industrial infrastructure with water, electricity, and gas, and highway access to the Hamad airport and seaport, and an up-to-date market study on what Qatar is eager to have, which was converted to manufacturing opportunities. We cover eights sectors—food, energy, mechanical, metal, chemical, medical, paper, and primary materials—with a total of 75 subcategories. Other advantages include a single window that acts as a one-stop shop to license and open a business in Qatar, and offering investors 100% ownership to attract greater foreign investment. Own Your Factory initiatives was a success to the community and economy and saw 55 successful entrepreneurs get land, completed industrial licenses, and pre-approvals for financing in certain industries. The other great outcome of the “Own Your Factory" program is seeing greater interest from international brands keen to have a presence in the production arena, which will enliven the market variety and consumer tastes.</p><h4>Apart from helping companies get started in Qatar, what kind of market information can be found on the platform?</h4><p>On the platform, investors can find information on business opportunities, datasets for planning purposes, case studies from different industries, laws and regulations governing the different industries, and the process and procedure for every business activity, all delivered in a simple and easy way. Through a smart questionnaire, The Single Window will recommend the requirements that an investor will need to adhere to. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar now offers 100% ownership to foreign investors. To what extent can Manateq Zones be attractive to foreign investors?</h4><p>It is indeed a welcome move by the Qatari government because in the past, foreign investors faced complexities in setting up business operations in Qatar. At Manateq, we are honored to play a role in helping facilitate investment opportunities for local and foreign investors in our commitment to Qatar's National Vision 2030. The zones are mandated to encourage the establishment of new industries, sectors, and businesses, thereby bringing significant contributions and benefits to the country, including the development of a vibrant private sector and a diversified knowledge-based economy. Manateq achieves this by offering a range of business-friendly services and incentives through its Client Services Center. In executing this, Manateq will aim not just to have new domestic, SME, and foreign businesses locate their projects here, but also encourage import substitution and added value in the form of new jobs, skills, technologies, and locally purchased materials and services. As a full-service agent, we are able to ease the strain and reduce the time it takes for companies to set up business in Qatar. We will continue to leverage our expertise and 360-degree services to help drive that investment. In times to come, we will see more such infrastructural landscapes developing in these areas to support investors, boosting economic growth.</p><h4>How would you rate Qatar's recent efforts to attract more foreign investment?</h4><p>FDI is a stimulating factor in any economy, and the Qatari government has long recognized this as it strives to diversify the economy away from oil and gas. Initiatives that encourage and attract investment across the full spectrum of sectors are positive. World-class infrastructure coupled with incentives and legislative framework regulating foreign investments in Qatar, among other measures, have made the country's logistics infrastructure on par with the best. Manateq sees many excellent opportunities for Qatar to increase FDI inflow. Qatar has the right infrastructure and flexibility in the system to attract more international companies and compete with any other logistics park or industrial zone in the world.</p><h4>How have you been working with the private sector to advance the status of Manateq's logistics and warehousing parks? What has been the role of PPPs in this regard?</h4><p>The government has made significant progress since forming a technical committee to stimulate private sector participation in economic development projects directed and managed by the Prime Minister's office. The committee seeks opportunities in public-private partnerships (PPPs), and Manateq plays a crucial role in this. Qatar's private sector also plays an important role, and the country is currently working on a PPP law that will support the sector and foreign investors. We are confident in Qatar's sustainable economic policies and ability to consolidate its position as a regional business hub. The government, meanwhile, is committed to invest its oil and gas revenues to build a diversified and competitive economy. In conjunction with this, Manateq recently celebrated the successful completion of four warehousing parks developed in partnership with the private sector. We have now offered around 2 million sqm of warehousing space by inviting developers in the field of warehousing and logistics services to tender for the construction of these. Following the tendering process, contracts for the project were awarded to four developers on a build, operate, transfer (BOT) basis for 25 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar has improved its ranking in several indicators of the World Bank's Doing Business report. What factors lie behind this?</h4><p>Qatar has undertaken several measures to improve its ranking in terms of ease of doing business by reducing the number of procedures and time required to start a business, introducing a one-stop shop to streamline foreign investment applications, providing greater support for international investors throughout all stages of their applications, and offering consumer credit scores to banks, financial institutions, and borrowers. Qatar has also abolished the paid-in minimum capital requirement for limited liability companies and exempted invested foreign capital from income tax for up to 10 years, for specific investment projects. These measures have resulted in improved rankings when it comes to the Starting a Business or Access to Credit Information indicators. Furthermore, Qatar has issued new laws and introduced amendments to existing legislation to attract and encourage domestic and foreign investments. These include amendments to the Investment Free Zones Law and a draft law regulation for the Investment of Non-Qatari Capital in Economic Activity, which allows up to 100% foreign investment in all economic and trade activities. At present, Qatar is in the process of drafting a public and private partnership law to pave the way for the launch of several investment projects.</p><h4>The IMF forecasts a growth rate of around 2.6% in 2018 and the upcoming years. How has the ministry managed to orchestrate an effective response to the blockade and guarantee Qatar's growth?</h4><p>Ensuring the continuous flow of goods and commodities to Qatar has always been one of the government's priorities. We had plans, strategies, and projects that were formulated several years ago to overcome any regional or global economic crises and ensure the flow of goods, services, and food products to all citizens and residents without interruption. After the illegal blockade was imposed on Qatar in June 2017, Qatar utilized its world-class facilities such as Hamad Port and Hamad International Airport and its hi-tech logistics capability to mobilize existing regional agreements with Kuwait, Iraq, Oman, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Azerbaijan, and Central Asia. Qatar has undertaken several investment projects to cement public-private partnerships. Within the framework of these, the state has launched an initiative to establish four aquaculture projects. The government has issued licenses to establish four greenhouse agricultural projects to produce 80,000 tons of fresh fruit and vegetables a year, a production rate of 20,000 tons per year per project. Qatar has also completed the first phase of a program aimed at maintaining a strategic stock of food supplies and feed, whereby the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has built a stockpile to cover the strategic needs of the state.</p><h4>What other initiatives can we expect to increase the global competitiveness of Qatar?</h4><p>Qatar has introduced an array initiatives and projects designed to foster a competitive and investment-friendly business environment and bolster the country's infrastructure, human capital, and international relations. For example, to increase the size and share of exports of non-hydrocarbon goods and services, Qatar has developed a high-standard end-to-end supply chain that enhances its export competitiveness and cultivates its market positioning regionally and globally. We are also developing a public-private partnership (PPP) framework, including the law, governance mechanisms, and implementation tools. In a short time, all will be in place to open a new chapter for private project finance initiatives in Qatar. These have resulted in the nation achieving advanced positions in the latest Global Competitiveness Index. Globally, Qatar ranks first in terms of low inflation rates, sixth in terms of the effect of taxes on competition, eighth in terms of venture capital availability, and ninth in terms of financing SMEs, according to the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Global Competitiveness Report 2018.</p><h4>What is your message to investors or entrepreneurs considering starting a business in Qatar, and what is your overall outlook for 2019?</h4><p>Qatar is a country with a prime strategic location, excellent transport connectivity, and a favorable business environment that offers opportunities and incentives across a variety of economic sectors. We all know that the world's trade focal point is moving east, from Europe to Asia. Qatar is ideally situated to enable investors to capture the opportunities arising from this significant change. We are located at the heart of the triangle connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa. We are capitalizing on this strategic location by developing superior logistics infrastructure and assets. These include a world-class airport which will soon achieve a passenger capacity of 50 million. Notably, the nation's flag carrier, Qatar Airways, serves more than 150 destinations. Furthermore, the newly opened Hamad Port, a USD7.4-billion project, will be able to accommodate up to 7.5 million containers in the future, with the potential for further expansion. The port currently accounts for 27% of regional trade in the Middle East. Due to its massive mineral reserves, Qatar is the world's largest LNG exporter and has the largest gas-to-liquid facility in the world. In terms of downstream products, we have an extremely competitive petrochemicals industry and are the world's largest exporter of helium and the fourth largest producer of urea. With all this in mind, the nation's outlook remains positive, driven by a competitive business environment, far-reaching reforms, and the government's infrastructure investment push in preparation for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. We expect to achieve the same growth rate in 2019. Thanks to Qatar's ability to reroute its trade, we expect to have a trade surplus and low inflation in 2019. Qatar's foreign trade increased by 16% by the end of 2017 to reach USD103 billion, compared with USD89 billion in 2016, while exports increased by 18% to USD67 billion in 2017 compared to USD57 billion in 2016. This resulted in a trade surplus of 49.9% in 2017, rising from USD25.18 billion in 2016 to USD37.75 billion in 2017. I would like to invite local and international entrepreneurs and investors to invest in Qatar and grow with us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Germany and Qatar are linked by many years of outstanding and trusting relations and have many shared interests. Against the background of current global and regional crises, our partnership with Qatar—as well as with the whole of the Middle East region—has perhaps become even more important to us, both at a foreign and security policy level, as well as for our economy. </p><p>In January to October 2018, trade between Germany and Qatar amounted to EUR1.4 billion. This is a remarkable figure, but there is certainly room for raising it higher. German companies have already been involved in many impressive infrastructure projects in Qatar, with their successful developments even including an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records for work on the Doha Metro. Qatar's diverse infrastructure projects are not only driven by the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but also by the country's National Vision 2030 designed to diversify the economy. The German business community stands at the ready to be a reliable and competent partner in all of these projects. Over 130 German companies have operations in Qatar. Plant and machine manufacturers and service providers from our country are helping to construct and expand a forward-looking infrastructure, and by doing so are contributing to the success of the Qatari economy. German companies foster the good partnership we have with Qatar by offering first-class products and comprehensive services; they also have local operations that provide training and employment for young people, as well as transferring technological expertise. Our businesses respond to the needs of Qatari partners and play a part in diversifying the economy. </p><p>Our trusting cooperation extends not only to the many skills offered by German companies providing their services in Qatar, but also to the involvement of Qatar in Germany. Qatari investors support important German companies by providing capital. They contribute to growth, value creation, jobs and prosperity in Germany. And they receive something in return. German SMEs in particular offer ideal investment opportunities for investors from Qatar. They are welcome partners in Germany. <br>Building upon our positive experience with investors from Qatar, it therefore remains of particular importance to me to promote investments in Germany. As part of this work, around 1,000 actors from government and business came to Berlin in the autumn of 2018 to attend the Qatar-Germany Business and Investment Forum, led by Federal Chancellor Merkel and His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Amir of the State of Qatar. A key contact for people interested in investing in Germany is our business promotion agency Germany Trade &amp; Invest (GTAI).</p><p>The economic links between Qatar and Germany in strategically important areas such as infrastructure, digitalization, health, and financial services offer broad potential. This will also be the focus at the upcoming meeting of the German-Qatari Joint Economic Commission taking place in Berlin on February 19, 2019 and hosted by my ministry. The event will enable the numerous representatives from government and business attending from both countries to discuss further opportunities for cooperation. I would be delighted if German-Qatari business relations continue to grow into the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The UK and Qatar have a long and rich history together, and our relationship continues to grow from strength to strength. Our bilateral partnership extends to many areas, notably in trade and investment, culture and education, prosperity, and security. We see 3,900 Qatari students choosing British universities, and over 70,000 Qataris visit the UK each year, while Qatar is home to over 600 British companies.</p><p>Trade between the UK and Qatar has grown significantly in recent years, and it was my pleasure to visit Doha in December to co-chair our second Joint Economic and Trade Commission (JETCO) with Ali bin Ahmed Al Kuwari, Minister for Commerce and Industry. We were both able to reflect on the significant progress in the trading relationship that our countries have made over the past 12 months. Bilateral trade between our two countries totaled GBP6.3 billion in 2017 and has increased by 21% in the last five years. We also looked back on some important accomplishments, including the visit to London by Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, an MoU on cybersecurity between the UK and the Qatar Central Bank (QCB), a significant sale of Typhoon jets, and the visit of the Lord Mayor of London to Qatar. But we are keen to do more together.<br>The Department of International Trade (DIT) has built an expert trade policy team with the knowledge and experience needed to build on our trading partnerships across the world. During my visit to Qatar, I met with UK businesses that were excited to get involved in a huge array of new opportunities, including the World Cup, and to contribute to Qatar's National Vision 2030—the ambitious multi-billion-dollar national reform plan. There are also significant opportunities for British companies to set up business in the newly developed free zones.</p><p>I visited the World Cup 2022 Legacy Pavilion and was impressed by the significant progress that has been made in preparation for the tournament. DIT has already helped British companies to secure GBP940 million in British-Qatar World Cup-related exports and aims to secure at least a further GBP500 million before the competition kicks off in 2022.<br>As a country, we have a long track record of delivering the world's biggest sporting events. At Brazil's 2014 World Cup, UK firm Blue Cube provided the seats on which fans cheered their teams, while at the Rio Games, British company PKL provided temporary kitchens to feed the athletes, staff, and fans. The 2022 FIFA World Cup is the first of many opportunities for the UK to support National Vision 2030, which includes GBP140 billion of infrastructure development and offers significant collaboration opportunities for UK companies.</p><p>The UK already sees more than GBP50 billion of investments coming from Qatar. In March 2017, Qatar announced a GBP5-billion investment commitment at the Qatar-UK Business Investment Forum. Almost half that amount has already been committed by Qatar to specific investment projects, and work continues on additional investments into the UK. It is an exciting time for both our nations as the UK sets up its independent trade policy for the first time in more the 40 years, and as Qatar continues to drive forward its National Vision 2030.</p><p>As a world leader in sectors such as tech, financial services, healthcare, and education, the UK is committed to supporting Qatar in diversifying its economy. Our recent trade talks provided an opportunity to review our progress on bilateral trade and key areas of collaboration that support our respective economies. Such engagements will work to cement the long-term future of the UK-Qatar trade partnership, and I am confident that between now and the next time our two countries sit down to talk trade, our shared prosperity will have continued on its upward trajectory. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were your motivations for the founding of the Club and how have these changed throughout the years? </h4><p>The main driver for the creation of this organization was to promote and defend the interests of Spanish companies doing business abroad. 22 years ago, Spain was beginning to open up to international business, especially by investing abroad. There was no business organization that had as its agenda to defend, promote, and create a more stable and business-friendly environment for companies to export and invest abroad. Since then, that is what we have been doing and it is the only organization that has as its exclusive objective to promote international business for Spanish companies. Two years ago, we made a strategic plan to see how we could evolve as an organization, and one of the outcomes was that our members wanted the Club to stay as it is, a multi-sector organization focused exclusively on international business, and also a Club full of networks, and contacts that were more easily accessible. One and a half years ago we created a work-group exclusively dedicated to Africa. Member companies felt that the presence of Spanish companies in Africa was insufficient, considering the size of our economy. We are close geographically to Africa, so it made sense to create this group to encourage companies and inform about business opportunities in Africa.</p><h4>Which are the requirements to join the Club?</h4><p>We have three requirements to be a member, one is that it needs to be a Spanish legally incorporated company; second is that they do international business from Spain; and third is that it must be an honorable company. We have a code of conduct and you have to be a rule-following company and not engaging in irregular and illegal business.</p><h4>Which services are most popular with your members?          </h4><p>As a Club, we are not focused on providing services; other organizations already provide services such as trainings and trade missions. We do not need to organize those activities because others already do them. The Club does three things. The first one is advocacy, as we try to make proposals to governments, political parties, the press, and society in general about ideas and measures that promote and facilitate international business. Spain does not have agreements to avoid double taxations with several countries that are important for Spanish companies (e.g. Peru or Angola). We actively promote the signing of double taxation avoidance treaties with specific countries that are of interest to the member companies. The second activity is networking. We organize small events with member companies and authorities, be it Spanish or foreign, to facilitate dialogue, information, contacts, and networking. This morning, for example, we had breakfast to talk about future trade agreements between Australia and the EU. In such small events people can talk and exchange views. We also have an agreement with the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so we organize a business breakfast or lunch event with ambassadors accredited abroad or new ambassadors going out. We are planning an event on Kazakhstan soon as well. The third activity is to give information that we believe is relevant, such as studies or publications that may be of interest to companies.</p><h4>In 2018, exports ceased to be the engine of growth of Spain, what happened?</h4><p>We do not know yet. The fact is that in November exports of goods were 0.3% less than in November 2017. In December, exports went down 3.7% in comparison to December 2017. It is a cause for concern. What has happened, we do not know yet. We are currently studying it.  </p><h4>The Club has advocated for the implementation of internal measures that could boost international competitiveness; what type of measures are we talking about? </h4><p>In taxation there are technical matters. For example, when a Spanish company is doing business abroad, it will have expenses. Spanish tax authorities consider those expenses are only valid if the paper support is compliant with Spanish legislation. But Nigerian or Argentinian legislation might not be exactly the same as Spanish legislation. This means that if I ask for a market study in Brazil, they issue the invoice and I pay the invoice and the characteristics of the invoice are not exactly the same as the characteristics of the invoice that Spanish tax authorities require. It might not be considered an expense. This is one of the things we are working on; we make proposals about diplomacy, our foreign network of trade promotion offices, expert credit insurance, expert finance, visas for foreign workers, plans on climate change, and education. It encompasses many sectors, and we are trying to promote measures and structural reforms to increase the average size of Spanish companies. We think that Spanish companies on average are too small and it is more difficult for small companies to do business internationally rather than a medium-sized company. These are measures that help companies to grow bigger.</p><h4>Which foreign markets are the companies associated with the Club most interested in? Have you noticed a transformation in this trend over the years? </h4><p>In Spanish investment abroad, the main focus was clearly Latin America. It has changed, however, and companies have started investing in North America, Europe (the main destination of our Spanish investment) and increasingly they are more interested in Asia and Africa. There are actually two geographically-focused working-groups in the Club. One deals with Asia and another one deals with Africa. We do not have a working-group in Latin America or Europe.</p><h4>Do you think Brexit could turn into an opportunity for those who are brave enough to venture into emerging markets? </h4><p>Brexit is going to be bad for everybody, especially for the UK. The risk for a Spanish company is that, the UK being our fifth export market, if there are custom-duties and other similar measures, Spanish exports to the UK will be more difficult, or more expensive. They might lose competitiveness and the UK may replace them for exports from other parts of the world. There is a risk also for tourism, the UK being the number one country sending tourists to Spain, as right now there are no frontiers. If Brexit ends up being stricter and harder, there will be border controls, passports, and if the economy slows down the pound will also be devalued in relation to the euro. That means that Spain as a tourist destination will become more expensive than before. The UK is the first international foreign investor in real estate in Spain and this could also be problematic. Many Spanish companies have invested in the UK and they have business in electricity generation, banking, transport, managing airports and bus transport in the UK. All these might be affected.</p><h4>What can companies do to circumvent these protectionist trends, and is there anything they can do now themselves? </h4><p>Every company should have a contingency plan. There are UK funds that have invested and are shareholders in funds that could affect Spanish companies. Each company has a different position and different interests, so every contingency plan should be different.</p><h4>What are the Club's objectives for 2019 and 2020, and how can you help your members further?             </h4><p>For the Club itself, we have a strategic three-year plan that we approved in 2017. We have defined key performance indicators so that we measure what we do and how we do it, in order to keep up with our activities and impact, for example. Regarding the Spanish economy and Spanish businesses, our goal is to facilitate and to create and contribute to a favorable environment within an international rules-based system. Open markets have been the main driver of wealth creation since the Second World War, and before. If that stops or slows down, there will be a negative impact on business. We are supporting the EU in negotiating trade agreements and we supported the one with Canada, the one with Japan and another one with Australia that is being negotiated now.. In Spain, our hope and objective is to contribute to creating a more competitive economy. We are asking for structural reforms; not undoing existing ones. We would like to go further and continue carrying out reforms so that our economy becomes more competitive. This means increasing the average size of companies, increasing research investment and development in companies and it means improving our trade diplomacy with more embassies abroad, as well as having more coverage for political risk.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[200 Years Teaching]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[javier-tafur-managing-director-escp-europe-madrid-campus]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2019 is ESCP Europe's bicentenary. What have been its major transformations in the last 200 years?</h4><p>ESCP Europe has evolved significantly over these 200 years, whilst keeping the soul of the school intact. ESCP Europe was founded in Paris in 1819 by a group of academics and entrepreneurs, including scholar Jean-Baptiste Say, who coined the word “entrepreneurship." In just three years, 30% of students were international, which was a remarkable rate for the 1820s. More than 10 European languages were taught at the school, and ESCP Europe has maintained this international ambition and connection ever since. At the same time, the school has been evolving and transforming in order to continue to lead in its practices. Mainly because of this combination of academics and entrepreneurs, the school belongs to the Paris Chamber of Commerce—and France is the only country in Europe that allows its higher education system to rely on chambers of commerce and industry as well as universities. Our faculty is not entirely composed of academics but practitioners as well. Providing a practical education has been our focus for 200 years, along with retaining an international ambition and leading in technology and innovation.</p><h4>ESCP Europe—Madrid Campus also celebrated its 30th year in 2018 and is ranked number two in terms of European business schools in Spain. What have been the campus' most significant achievements?</h4><p>compete with the other three top Spanish business schools and share the premier positions with them. This makes us extremely proud, because the Madrid campus is fairly small compared to the rest of the school. Our first challenge over the last 30 years was just getting established in Madrid. Then, it was developing the business model, as it was running in other European countries and integrating that business model with the rest of ESCP's structure. Over the last five years, the challenge has been expanding the Madrid campus. We have quadrupled the size of the school in Spain in terms of our activities and number of students, as well as increasing the number of permanent faculty members. This feeds the faculty numbers of the entire school because professors from the Madrid campus also teach in Paris, London, Berlin, Turin, and Warsaw.</p><h4>How does the Madrid campus differ from the other ESCP campuses outside France?</h4><p>Our Madrid campus has its own personality, partly because it is in Spain, and we are at the crossroads of different worlds. We are like a bridge connecting South America to Europe and Europe to the rest of the world. We are a part of Europe, and the continent cannot be understood without Spain: Madrid represents Spain as a part of the whole that ESCP is. At the same time, South America cannot be understood without Spain. We seek to link these sides up. While Madrid is fairly small in size compared to our largest campuses in London, Berlin, and Paris, it leads in terms of technology-based innovation. Our first online master's program was launched from the Madrid campus.</p><h4>Is e-learning a challenge or an opportunity for ESCP Europe?</h4><p>Online learning is a clear opportunity because we are here to serve companies and our students, and society is evolving so we have to adapt to these changes, and the sooner the better. E-learning is also a great opportunity for limitless classrooms given the Madrid campus' smaller size. We acted quickly and were successful in launching this combination of online programs and custom-blended solutions at the executive education level. The first online program we have launched is unique because it is run in three languages—Spanish, English, and French. It has over 45 nationalities in a group of 150 students. Once again, diversity is part of our DNA.</p><h4>How does the Spanish higher education system fare in comparison to its European counterparts?</h4><p>Higher education in Spain is a leading practice. We have an outstanding business school base in Madrid and the rest of Spain. In addition, business leaders from Spain or educated there are recognized worldwide. We perhaps lack some of the practices, though leadership programs and business leaders from Spain are remarkably sought after. The problem is that we have to make this model comprehensive because we are under the umbrella of European higher education, though at the same time we have to tackle the challenges of a local legal framework, which is completely ruled by the public administration in Spain. Sometimes, these are not cohesive, and there are constraints from the local government and national legal frameworks.</p><h4>Will ESCP Europe's focus on increasing diversity, such as its Women in Leadership scholarships, filter down into the workplace?</h4><p>We are fully involved in increasing diversity; it is reflected in the motto of the EU. ESCP Europe is similarly diverse and should help others manage diversity. This is not only about cultural diversity, but also background, gender, faith, and language diversity. We are not an Anglo-Saxon business school with a common language, even though today English is generally the lingua franca providing the common vehicle for people to communicate. Our school is also improving our students' ability to communicate in different European languages. All in all, for us, diversity is a must. Amongst other things, we have chosen to focus on women in leadership to increase women's contribution and their gateway to following the career path they want. Society cannot be understood if all these elements are not present.</p><h4>What are your objectives for ESCP Europe—Madrid Campus in 2019?</h4><p>We have to continue to grow ESCP in Madrid because the school seeks to make the business grow as a whole, and Madrid is a key element of this structure. ESCP Europe's mission and vision cannot be understood without the Madrid campus. The main constraint in making this growth feasible is the lack of physical space at our Madrid campus. We may have to look for a new campus or expand our campus somehow. Currently, we cannot accommodate all the students we want to accept into ESCP's Madrid campus, which is a problem because our mission is to facilitate and ease the way for those who want to pursue an international career path. Madrid is a dynamic region, with a lifestyle that many people want to be part of, so it is a pity that ESCP Europe—Madrid Campus does not have the capacity to welcome them. This is one issue we have to address in 2019.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Riyadh Front is reaching its final stage. Could you tell us more about the latest developments?</h4><p>We consider the current stage to be the soft opening of phase one, and already some of our tenants have moved in. In 2019 we expect the whole project to be opened officially. When we look for tenants, we are truly focusing on the quality, both for shopping and for office space. On the shopping front, we have signed to open the largest cinema in Saudi Arabia and the largest Virgin Megastore in the Middle East. Aside from flagship stores, we are looking at the customer experience, especially in terms of entertainment as well as food and beverage offerings (mention there's also a variety of fashion and luxury brands). We are planning to provide a 360-degree environment in terms of structure, architect design, landscape, and surface. The facility has been built to host different types of activities and events. We have a dedicated area for art exhibitions and we aim to become a cultural hub and meeting point for artists in Riyadh. One of these plans is to have competitions among artists to temporarily design this space, based on the current events in the Kingdom in that period, like New Year's, Eid, or Ramadan. We have built an arcade along one whole side of the project. The technique we use here to open and close the whole area is modeled after Zorlu Center in Istanbul, Turkey. Turkish winters are too cold while our summers are too hot. The climate control systems we use here is unique to Saudi Arabia. To develop our office spaces, we have signed with the global accounting firm KPMG, Jolly Chic, and Saudi Arabia's Noon, which are one of the largest and most successful e-commerce companies in the Kingdom.</p><h4>What are the unique characteristics of the logistics park? </h4><p>Logistics today can offer complete solutions. Our logistics park is the first project in Saudi Arabia that will provide the infrastructure and a complete solution for our clients, not to mention being a one-stop-shop, as the fact that we are licensed by MODON makes obtaining a license much easier. Most of the warehouses that have been developed in Saudi Arabia are small-scale. We are changing this and are starting with 1 million sqm. It is an integrated solution: a gated community with security, property management, facility management, and warehousing. As part of Kaden, we have a third-party logistics (3PL) company that offers their services to our tenants, which makes it easier for them to quickly hire extra capacity in terms of trucks, manpower etc., while we have clients in the sphere of e-commerce that require world-class logistics services. We have the unique advantage of being the only lessors of large spaces without partitions. Traffic moves easily in and out of the project as we have a great location with great connections and accessibility. We are now working on a similar park in Jeddah.</p><h4>How do you approach environmental sustainability in the Riyadh Front?</h4><p>For all our projects, we rely heavily on green and open areas. This is a significant challenge in a country like Saudi Arabia, but it gives great added value to the projects. For example, the coverage area for both projects, which is how much we build on a plot, is less than 20%. This is a low rate, with 80% open and green. This is an environment that requires a great deal of investment and operation costs, which is a key part of our master planning.</p><h4>How do you intend to implement smart city elements in your projects?</h4><p>We provide many services to our tenants, which makes it more comfortable for the companies that decide to work with us. We will offer shared smart services, with an application letting companies book conference rooms as well as parking spots for their visitors. Secondly, we will take care of all government-related services such as licensing. We have great access to all the relevant agencies.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What solutions are you creating for energy companies, and in what core areas of operation does this have the most significant impact? </h4><p>Schneider Electric is a global energy company, leading from the front in terms of sustainability in the digital economy. The company is listed in Europe and its yearly revenue is about EUR25 billion. We work globally in three big areas: energy, automation, and software. The biggest themes we are focused on addressing is around digitization, energy sustainability, and climate change. Digitalization affects everything we do; in the oil and gas sector, we are engaged with making operating assets of petrochemical companies safer, more effective, more productive, and more agile. We deliver solutions on how to make electrification more sustainable and safer, we provide the electrical distribution systems and their incumbent infrastructure for a variety of sites. Additionally, we implement automation systems to safely and productively run assets. As the world's leading supplier of safety systems in petrochemicals and refining, we also have operations regarding software, including design, simulation, and optimization.</p><h4>What trends regarding technological adoption do you see in the field?</h4><p>On a global level, the oil and gas industry is diverse in terms of adoption levels—some firms are at an early stage while others are advanced. ADNOC is one of the global leaders, driven by high-quality leadership and the national drive towards digitization. ADNOC is a leading adopter of technologies, and we are proud to be working with them. The level of adoption in the UAE is strong, and I am aware that other players are looking at ADNOC as a leader and as an example. There is not a single blueprint, but in Abu Dhabi there is a strong culture of early adoption which really puts them in a strong position.</p><h4>What is the significance of working with ADNOC on the Panorama Command Center, and what do you think this level of technology means for the wider industry?</h4><p>The Panorama Command Center is ADNOC's platform for driving digitialization across the organization. Schneider Electric's technology is what drives Panorama and will enable greater digital engagement on all levels. Panorama allows the C-suite to see all of ADNOC's operations in a single room, therefore, they can undergo an intuitive examination of the processes and how infrastructure can be developed. This was very empowering for ADNOC, and they are starting to develop new systems in response to what they are learning from the center. ADNOC currently has around 130 compressors and turbines, and its able to determine why certain assets perform better in comparison to others, allowing it to adjust operations practices and allowing us to assist them in maximizing efficiency. Panorama allows ADNOC to totally optimize its operations; it delivers excellent cost-benefit analysis and million-dollar savings on a regular basis. We are proud to have been able to facilitate the first leg of ADNOC's development in this area. One of the core reasons we were successful in the Panorama project is that we were the only company capable of providing solutions that could be compatible with third parties. Many other firms also have open protocols, we are not the only ones. But we are willing to have our architecture and systems open, which allows us to work with different partners and solution providers.</p><h4>How do these advanced technologies tie into your other operations in different sectors? </h4><p>Schneider Electric's operations in the UAE are not limited to the oil and gas industry. For example, Schneider Electric is significantly involved in creating efficiencies in buildings and water networks, including Dubai Municipality, NPCC, Al Rawabi Dairy, and Hilton Garden Inn MoE. The technology we are using with Panorama is called Wonderware, and it has also been deployed in smart city solutions and at present, we are using it in an Indian city near New Delhi called Naya Raipur, India's first greenfield Smart City. The technology is useful across multiple applications. Schneider is heavily involved with green technology and sustainability solutions, in particular global energy challenges. The world needs 50% more energy, but that energy needs to be three times as efficient in the reduction of greenhouse gases. A lot of these challenges are being solved through our digitization and electrification efforts. Furthermore, we are maximizing efficiencies across electrical usage systems to make us greener; these sustainable considerations permeate through Schneider Electric's global operations.</p><h4>Where do new technologies such as AI fit into Schneider Electric's strategy and what is your assessment of the level of impact this technology will have? </h4><p>Schneider Electric is involved in the development and application of nearly every new major tech idea. A fundamental component of this is the new company we have created this year called AVEVA. We have taken all of Schneider Electric's software operations and merged it with an existing British company called AVEVA; the new firm remains listed on the British stock market but it is now 60% owned by Schneider. This plan was in line with the company's objective to acquire a single agile vehicle for its digitization and software. AVEVA originally started as a Cambridge University startup that was focused on designing software for the oil and gas sector. At present, AVEVA is working with Schneider Electric on AI technologies related to asset maintenance. This includes digitally twinning a real asset and using the digital version to enhance operation sustainability and optimization. At present, we have R&amp;D centers in the UK, the US, India, and the Middle East. The sustainability of these assets comes from changing behaviors as well as changing technology. We want to change the way oil companies operate so that these technologies become embedded parts of operational behavior, thereby driving optimized outcomes. We have technologies that prompt operators, for example, through the correct processes so they can behave in the safest way. Additionally, we must engage with personnel on how to use assets properly when manually collecting data so that the data is usefully informing broader systems. Training and positive reinforcement are vital in motivating people properly. We want to create technologies that are intuitively making people more efficient and are thus incentivizing people to operate in the best possible way. Therefore, the company is working on making adoption more natural and thus more widespread and effective. This requires an understanding of local culture and how it affects operations. While this is a global story, there seems to be national and regional differences on how to use technology. The faster we adopt good digital technologies, the faster we can ensure that our operations are optimized for long-term sustainability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What new products has Sandvik added to its portfolio and how do your services create benefits for energy companies?</h4><p>Sandvik is one of the most innovative companies in the world in regards to material development. Our focus is to tackle corrosion challenges. Since several gas fields in the region are sour, there is demand for materials that can withstand the well and formation conditions. Our product portfolio is geared toward this environment and as a result, we work with most of the end-users in this region. We understand the major developments in the fields and across the industry, in particular those that might drive material development. Our products enable the development of many fields as many products could not begin because the gas is severely corrosive. At the 2018 Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC), we launched a new product called onsite coil tubing, one of our productive innovation solutions. It essentially adds end stage production on the customer's site. It is combined with a digitization offering that allows us to remotely monitor the supply chain for the end-user and manage the operation. Implementing end stage production on site helps reduce wastage and is therefore more sustainable. This product is generating significant interest.</p><h4>Would you elaborate on some of the projects Sandvik is engaged in both in Abu Dhabi and regionally?</h4><p>Sandvik is active in upstream, midstream, and downstream. In refining, we provide materials for heat exchangers and seawater cooling applications. Furthermore, we are engaged with operations in wells that are being drilled offshore upstream. In Abu Dhabi, Sandvik works directly with the NOC as an end user because our products are often integrated into other products. Overall, the company enjoys healthy relationships across all areas of the supply chain.</p><h4>With lower oil prices in recent years, have you seen some operators and clients striving for greater cost effectiveness and how can Sandvik's solutions help with this?</h4><p>Material development is an interesting topic with regards to creating better cost effectiveness. Some of our materials have high alloy content, for example, and by conducting material research and testing for an environment, we can propose alternative materials for that application that could support cost savings for the end-user. Consequently, we are also looking five and ten years ahead to future field developments and performing material testing for those potential projects.</p><h4>Have the changes and restructuring at Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) had any major impact for Sandvik?</h4><p>It obviously has an impact at a practical level with regards to making things more streamlined when engaging with the end user. It is important to be close to the end-user to understand how their set up is going to change, what the organization is going to look like, and who the key decision makers are going to be in the new environment. Having seen a reduction in the number of operating companies allows us to be more focused on ADNOC's specifications and respond to their needs. In terms of adding in-country value (ICV), our ambition in the countries we operate in is always to work with various partners to generate that value. Our approach has not necessarily changed, but you always have to evaluate your route to market across different regions, considering the countries' current ICV programs.</p><h4>What does the growing demand for gas in the UAE mean, and how will gas feature in the energy market in the years to come?</h4><p>In general terms, gas development is significant for us, because the regional sour gas environments drive the need for our materials. In the UAE, there is a clear-stated ambition to be self-sufficient in gas and to reduce imports. Sandvik's portfolio is aligned with the UAE's direction. As a company, we are constantly evaluating the portfolio and engaging with stakeholders to ensure that our portfolio will reflect the market long term. We try to operate across the full energy mix and have developed our portfolio for the renewables market over the years in different market segments.</p><h4>Does your operating strategy differ markedly in the UAE from the rest of the Middle East and other regions?</h4><p>As a group, Sandvik always tries to be close to its customers, for example, we have opened an office in Lagos, Nigeria. Sandvik is a diversified group so some segments of our business are operational in many countries, with the office now in Nigeria this is a new enterprise for us as a materials business. If you look at the Asia region, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Kuala Lumpur in 2018, we have invested during the oil and gas downturn to position our business strategically for the upturn. It is a constant process, as it is for any business, and our approach has been consistent, so we are now in an excellent position to explore these opportunities.</p><h4>What role do you think digitization and technologies such as AI, analytics, and blockchain will play in your industry and for Sandvik?</h4><p>Sandvik is approaching this from multiple angles. From an internal point of view, we analyze how to improve productivity and efficiency in our manufacturing footprint. That is driving our internal digitization strategy and our efforts to take advantage of new technologies. In 2018 we have invested in increasing our metal powder footprint, for activities like the 3D printing industry, and advanced and additive manufacturing. Externally, we look at industrial productivity for our customers and how we can potentially become more integrated and aligned. Products like the one we launched at ADIPEC is an industry first as we are moving the final step of the manufacturing process to the customer's site. With this, we should be able to reduce wastage and stoppages on projects. This is productive industrialization and digitization, which is a focus for Sandvik. As a company of 45,000 people, we are working in many segments and looking for trends, and we are well aligned.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the level of digital adoption in the oil &amp; gas industry compared to other industries?</h4><p>From our business perspective, we are seeing a purpose-driven digitization. This is positive as potential customers can see how new products bring technological innovation that can be beneficial. This is not digitization for the sake of it, it is to improve processes and productivity, and to improve sustainability and reduce waste. It is easier to create an awareness of the benefits to a customer when you are closely aligned with their business. Sandvik has a rich industrial heritage, with over 150 years in the business and tremendous knowledge of materials, and this development and application gives us an insight into how the likes of digitization can benefit the industry. We recently launched SentusysTM intelligent tube system, that allow us to monitor industrial and chemical processes in real time in a customer's application and provide real time data across the many different parameters.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[principles-and-priorities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the future of Ecuadorian-Qatari bilateral relations?</h4><p>The last two official visits—my visit to Doha and the visit of the Amir of Qatar to Ecuador—demonstrated the willingness of both governments to strengthen bilateral ties. The backdrop of these were the favorable environment that Ecuador has created for the generation of fair trade and employment, care for the environment, inclusion, and sustainability. For this purpose, we built a positive agenda with the national and foreign business sectors. Ecuador sees in Qatar a prosperous nation that is open to the world and whom it counts as a partner in the advancement of greater international causes. The outlook of our economic relations has never been better. Under my government, the Ecuadorian state has adapted its laws to fully develop commercial exchanges, ventures, and investments. We are committed to generating competitiveness, providing incentives, and guaranteeing a balance between public and private interests. During the visit of the Amir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, in October 2018, we signed a memorandum for the establishment of a joint ministerial commission on economic, commercial, and technical investments. Other cooperation and exchange agreements were also signed in the fields of youth and sports, environmental protection, and agriculture. The Amir reiterated the importance of strengthening Qatar's relationship with Ecuador, mainly in economic, commercial, and investment matters. He also reiterated his interest in cooperating in the development of the country's tourism infrastructure. During my visit to Qatar, we presented our government program Toda una vida, which consists of meeting citizens' needs at every stage of their lives. We also met with executives of the Qatar Foundation, one of whose flagship projects was developed by the Al Shafallah Center for people with disabilities. Qatar can benefit from our experience in this area and is but one exchange of many that augur an excellent future for our mutual relations. </p><h4>How can Ecuadorian companies support Qatar to reach a higher level of food security?</h4><p>Our food exports are of the highest quality. Qatar requires food, and Ecuador is in the best position to provide it. We have ratified the need to promote and diversify agricultural exports, increase their quantity and quality, provide them with greater added value, and develop economic sectors of the agroindustry with export potential. We are confident we will be able to conclude an agreement on this matter to help Qatar acquire high-quality food products from Ecuador. This will allow Qatar to reach the necessary level of food security while strengthening bilateral economic ties. </p><h4>How likely is a bilateral investment agreement between Ecuador and Qatar, and which sectors of the economy would interest Qatari investors?</h4><p>One of our priorities is to negotiate a bilateral investment greement with Qatar to provide greater legal security and predictability for investors. Ecuadorian law has broad incentives to guarantee that foreign investment meets normal labor standards, environmental care, and fiscal requirements. A bilateral agreement will provide an additional framework to help Qatari investors enter our country, obtain a fair profit for their economic activity, and contribute to the progress and generation of employment. The opportunities are many. We seek to strengthen the productive, industrial, and financial sectors through direct investments as well as the promotion of public-private partnerships for investments in infrastructure, bio-economy, hydrocarbons, energy, mining, telecommunications, transport, and public works. All new investments will have tax incentives from which Qatari investors can benefit for several years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities does Croatia's booming tourism sector offer Qatari visitors and investors?</h4><p>Qatari tourists have recognized Croatia as a desirable destination, and in recent years their numbers have been on the rise. We are experiencing a significant growth in the number of visitors, 140% in 2017 and 18% in 2018. In 2018, we had around 10,000 overnight stays by Qatari visitors, a figure we seek to increase significantly. There is great potential for growth and for our people to get to know each other even more. Croatia has high-quality and diverse accommodation, a rich cultural and historical heritage, and an exceptionally well-preserved natural heritage that also encompasses eight national parks and 11 nature reserves. Croatia is also increasingly recognized as a halal-friendly destination—we are among the few EU member states with an officially registered halal standard. Croatia is, by all means, open to Qatari investors in tourism projects. There is great potential for Qatari investors in various tourism projects, especially with respect to high-class facilities and health tourism.</p><h4>How will the recently established Croatian Business Council (CBC) contribute to the intensification of business relations for both countries?</h4><p>The Croatian community in Qatar is extremely successful, influential, and highly appreciated. Croats may not be present in large numbers in Qatar, but they have certainly started to make their presence felt by setting up the Croatian Business Council (CBC). Around 500 Croatian expatriates work in different positions in Qatar, and CBC can serve as a link and contribute to promoting cooperation. Bilateral political relations between the two countries are extremely cordial. CBC seeks to become one of the main bridges between Croatia and Qatar and hopes that companies and individuals from both sides will find this bridge worth crossing. Thus far, Qatar and Croatia have had many potential opportunities for business cooperation, though many were also missed. </p><h4>Which sectors are better placed to capitalize on the increasing relations between the two countries?</h4><p>The goal of Croatia's economic policy is to strengthen and accelerate economic growth in three areas: improving conditions for doing business, strengthening institutional efficiency, and boosting investment potential. Croatia has introduced numerous incentives and privileges for investments such as non-refundable grants, tax incentives, direct employment incentives, free lease of state-owned assets for investment projects, and other measures. There is huge potential for economic cooperation through the direct investment of Qatari partners and implementation of joint projects. This includes cooperation in all types of tourism, ICT, electronics and electrical engineering, construction, and health. Croatia has knowledge, experience, and a longstanding tradition in maritime affairs and marine culture that it can share with Qatar. Croatian companies have capability and experience in building seaports and their accompanying infrastructure. Croatia has tremendous potential, and with the help of investments from Qatar it can develop production capacities that would, by and large, fulfill the needs of Qatar—and Croatia—for first-rate food products. Croatia has over 100 companies with halal certification and experience in organizing halal conferences. A major Croatian energy project—the construction of the LNG terminal on the island of Krk, which is vital for the energy security of Croatia and the EU—is a contribution to the further diversification of energy sources, supplies, and routes and could be of interest to Qatar as an entry point for supplying natural gas to the central and southeast European energy market. Furthermore, Croatia's defense industry offers some of the best products in the world. There are also significant opportunities for military to military cooperation, especially in the area of education and training. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In the Name of Allah the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Brothers and sisters, members of the advisory council, it gives me pleasure to meet with you on this auspicious annual occasion of the opening of a new session of your esteemed council. A day marking the beginning of a new legislative term, in which our constitutional institutions will proceed with their responsibilities to reach the goals we have set ourselves, from economic growth to keeping up with the achievements of contemporary human civilization and the formulation of our Qatari Arab and Islamic identity and culture on sound moral and civilized grounds.</p><p>Since our last meeting, Qatar's economic invulnerability against external tremors has been boosted, and our self-reliance has increased. The bonds with our allies have become stronger than before, and our relations with most of the world's countries have only deepened. Most importantly, Qataris have become more committed to the ethics they are renowned for; their awareness of the scale of their country's accomplishments; the importance of its national sovereignty; and the independence of our political decisions, under which these accomplishments were achieved, have been deepened.</p><p>Brothers, members of the advisory council, the world economy witnessed an economic recovery in 2017 involving most countries and regional and economic blocs, including developed countries, among them the US, the eurozone, and Japan. However, this improvement did not include the Middle East, North Africa, or the GCC countries, including the state of Qatar.<br>But growth in Qatar was the least affected, and a drop in our hydrocarbon output was coupled with about 4% growth in GDP from other sources, reflecting the role of economic diversification as an important growth component.</p><p>Exports rose 18%, leading to a significant improvement in the public budget, trade balance, and current account. The banking system recovered in less than 10 months to its pre-blockade levels, while certain indications even improved. In addition, the Qatar Central Bank regained its reserve level, and the Qatari Riyal has maintained its value and free circulation. The state continued to provide funding for World Cup projects without compromising those required to achieve the National Vision.<br>It is noteworthy that the number of factories operating in the state has also increased by about 14% since the blockade, and these have managed to achieve a great deal of self-sufficiency in certain food products and consumables. While the role of the private sector was pivotal in achieving these results, we expect from it an even greater readiness for direct investment and bolder initiatives.</p><p>Honorable brothers, we are moving at a steady pace to achieve water and food security, and to secure sufficient electrical energy to spur further development. The first phase of the Strategic Water Reservoir Project was inaugurated, and work is proceeding to commission the remaining phases by the end of 2019, with a 155% increase over the current freshwater stock. The Umm Al-Houl station in the Economic Zone has also come onstream and will soon open. This megaproject will increase Qatar's electricity production by about 30% and water desalination by about 40%.</p><p>The state has adopted a conservative fiscal policy to reduce spending necessitated by the sharp drop in oil and gas prices since 2014. We had to strike a balance between spending cuts, which are also beneficial to the state and community, and the expenditure requirements dictated by pursuing infrastructure investments and key development projects for the World Cup, which has not been an easy task; however, the signs of success of this policy have started to be seen, by the grace of Almighty God and by virtue of the joint efforts and cooperation among all the government's monetary, fiscal, investment, and economic institutions. Government expenditure this year decreased by around 20% from the previous year, while household spending rose by 4%. This policy is expected to lead to a budget surplus this year, one that will increase in coming years.</p><p>Qatar has been able to overcome the impacts of the blockade to a large extent, and economic institutions and financial markets share our optimism. The World Bank expects Qatar's economic growth rate to reach 2.8% in 2018, and rise to around 3% in the following years. Global credit rating agencies have also revised their outlook for Qatar's economy from negative, immediately after the blockade, to stable, thus reflecting their favorable expectations for the financial and economic performance of Qatar in the future. Confidence of the international financial institutions in the future performance of Qatar's economy was evident when Qatar raised USD12 billion in a sovereign bond issue in the international financial markets. The volume of subscription for the Initial Public Offering reached USD53 billion, at moderate interest rates.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, Qatar National Vision's goal to achieve economic diversification and reduce dependence on oil and gas have never meant neglecting the oil and gas sector, the basic source of our wealth. Rather, economic diversification aims to achieve growth without being affected by fluctuations in the price of these two sources. But it is necessary to constantly develop them, and preserve the wealth that God has bestowed upon us, for us and for our future generations.<br>In this context, I would like to refer to certain important developments in this sector. First, preliminary studies have been completed for the development of a major project for the production of LNG from the North Field, whereby Qatar will maintain its position as the world's largest liquefied natural gas exporter for many years to come. <br>Second, the merger of Qatar Gas Company and Ras Gas Company was carried out so that gas production, liquefaction, and marketing will be led exclusively by one company. The merger was aimed at unifying the distinctive resources and potential of the two companies and creating a unique energy player in terms of scale, efficiency, and centrality, as well as reducing annual operating costs, as the merger saves about QAR2 billion annually. </p><p>Third, Qatar Petroleum will become more global by participating in oil and gas exploration and production abroad. Exploration and production agreements were concluded with Oman, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and South Africa in partnership with international and Gulf-based oil companies. </p><p>Our oil exports have not been affected by the blockade; the state has been keen to fulfill all its obligations under existing contracts, and has concluded several long-term contracts, the latest of which was with Petro China, whereby Qatar will supply various Chinese districts with about 3.4 million tons of liquefied natural gas annually. This agreement extends until 2040. <br>Brother members of the advisory council, regarding the Qatar National Vision, the Second National Development Strategy 2018-2022 entered its implementation phase at the beginning of the year. All ministries and government agencies have started to activate the programs of this strategy by continuing to develop infrastructure, promoting economic diversification, developing the private sector, rationally managing our natural resources, protecting the environment, promoting human development by introducing a comprehensive and integrated health care system, implementing a quality education system, and building up an efficient and committed workforce. It is also aimed at perfecting social development through the application of justice and the provision of security for all citizens and residents, while working for cultural enrichment and athletic excellence.<br>The human being remains the core focus and target of our development plans. High living standard for citizens must be coupled with values, cultural evolution, and care for morality. Otherwise, the possibility of welfare degenerating into a state of social corruption based on an unproductive and constantly resentful culture of consumerism and rising sense of entitlement. To prevent this, parents and teachers must educate children. </p><p>A modern society and state and a developed economy have emerged in Qatar. We have transformed the oil and gas economy into an advanced industry. In order to pursue development and achieve sustainability, and avoid slipping into the chasms of the economy of consumerism and the culture of social reliance and indifference, it is necessary to emphasize work and its ethics. Both quantitatively and qualitatively, this means respecting work time, fulfilling promises, and observing honesty in assignment reports. They are based on a sense of duty and responsibility towards society and the state and participating in burden-shouldering. This leads to modesty and an appreciation of the value of work, including that done by others, and the adoption of competence and qualification as a basis for recruitment and promotion, without regard to one's background. Hence the importance of national service and its role in building the youth of this country. </p><p>Brothers and sisters, the security and stability of our Gulf and Arab countries will not be achieved by infringing the sovereignty of states, but only through respecting the rules that regulate relations among them, and working to resolve differences through dialogue that takes into account the interests of all parties concerned. History teaches us that crises are destined to pass, but that their mishandling may leave behind long-lasting repercussions. It is unfortunate that the ongoing Gulf crisis revealed the failure of the GCC to attain its goals and meet the aspirations of our Gulf peoples, which weakened its capability to face the challenges and risks, marginalizing its regional and international role. It is hoped that the current crisis will be used to develop the council on sound foundations, including dispute resolution mechanisms, and ensure that the same disputes are not repeated.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the deterioration of the pan-Arab situation, including the Gulf, strips the Arab world of its unity and ability to cope with the aggravation of various issues we suffer from in Palestine, Syria, Yemen, Libya, and elsewhere. However, Qatar will remain, as it has always been, an active and supportive agent in all exerted efforts to resolve differences and confront the challenges and dangers surrounding the Arab and Islamic Ummas, and in dealing effectively with the issues and problems that threaten international peace and security. </p><p>The Palestinian cause remains at the top of our priorities. And in light of the continued Israeli intransigence and lack of will to achieve a comprehensive and just peace in imposing a fait accompli policy, we call upon the international community to put Israel at the forefront of its responsibilities to stop all illegal practices against the Palestinian people, end the unjust siege on the Gaza Strip, halt the settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, as well as other continued violations of the rights of the Palestinian people, and resume peace negotiations in accordance with the principles of international law based on the two-state solution, the right of return, and the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital. </p><p>In regards to Yemen, we reiterate our concern for the stability, unity and territorial integrity of that nation. We call upon all parties to cease fighting and resort to dialogue to resolve this crisis politically. It has been proven that there is no military solution to Yemen's disputes. On the Syrian question, we have been keen, since the onset of the crisis, on keeping Syria as a united country, and we support all regional and international efforts to ensure the success of a political solution that will bring Syria out of its crisis, and fulfill the aspirations of the Syrian people for freedom, justice, security, and stability, in accordance with the declaration of the Geneva Conference. We also look forward to accelerating the political solution in Libya and call upon all factions and groups of the Libyan people to achieve national reconciliation, build a state and its institutions, put an end to the suffering of the brotherly Libyan people and achieve security and stability. May God bless you with success and may God's Peace, Mercy and Blessings be upon you. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[New Vision on Sustainable Tourism]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[john-pagano-ceo-the-red-sea-development-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Red Sea Project is among the Kingdom's current most ambitious megaprojects. What is your grand vision here, and how do you expect it will change Saudi Arabia as we know it today?</h4><p>Our grand vision for The Red Sea Project is one that is underpinned by sustainability. We are working towards a new era in sustainable luxury tourism, where every element of the development considers sustainability first and foremost. We are committed to managing visitor numbers to protect the site from over-tourism and work towards our goal of net-positive impact on the environment. The destination will be powered 100 percent by renewable energy and we plan to implement policies requiring zero waste-to-landfill and a total ban on single use plastics. We are also seeking to develop new technologies and solutions to continually improve our environmental footprint. The Red Sea Project will position the Kingdom on the global tourism map and help Saudi Arabia meet its Vision 2030 objectives. As a development, we are ideally positioned to tap into the global luxury tourism market, the fastest growing segment of the international travel and tourism industry. This presents us with the opportunity to open new areas of economic activity and we estimate that the project is expected to contribute SAR22 billion per year to the Kingdom's GDP.  The Red Sea Project will play a vital part of the Kingdom's economic diversification and lead the way in incorporating sustainable principles into business and development.</p><h4>The project is set to include 40-50 hotels. What opportunities for the global hospitality industry are there to get involved?</h4><p>The Red Sea Project offers many opportunities for investment, including from hospitality, retail, leisure and entertainment companies as well as from companies interested in working on the base infrastructure that will support the project—the utilities networks, the dedicated airport that will serve the destination and others. We are seeking to work with like-minded partners who share our uncompromising approach to delivering a sustainable luxury tourism development.</p><h4>The project is set to create 70,000 jobs while creating new opportunities for the local economy—including for the SME community individual entrepreneurs. How do you envision to facilitate this growth?</h4><p>At completion, the project will directly employ around 35,000 people and will support an equivalent number of jobs in the wider community by creating opportunities for local businesses, entrepreneurs and supporting industries. As an employer, our primary mandate is to create opportunities for Saudis and we will be investing significantly in training, education and development programs to foster the skills and capabilities that we need from within the Kingdom. We are working on developing various training programs to roll out in the coming years to help Saudis with an interest in the hospitality and tourism industries acquire the skills they need to build successful careers. We're committed to working towards educating and encouraging Saudi citizens across disciplines and industries so that we can not only facilitate growth within the company, but also within society as a whole.</p><h4>The Quality of Life program seeks to enhance the standard of living in the Kingdom, with executive authorities for sports entertainment looking after new infrastructure and activities in their respective fields. How do you synergize within this ecosystem that strives to develop the Kingdom's leisure industry?</h4><p>The Red Sea Project is fully aligned with the wider Vision 2030 plan, supporting with the creation of jobs and opportunities for Saudis—both direct and indirect—as a consequence of opening up the international tourism market. We are creating new opportunities for people to build promising careers and realize their personal ambitions. This is a collaborative effort in which we work closely with all relevant government ministries to ensure that we realize our ambitions as effectively and efficiently as possible.</p><h4>What are the primary ambitions you have set for the period of the first phase of the project?</h4><p>Now that the Master Plan has been completed, we are beginning the first phase of the project, which is scheduled for completion in 2022 and includes 14 luxury and hyper-luxury hotels. Phase One will provide more than 3,000 rooms across five islands and two inland resorts, as well as the development of necessary infrastructure and supporting logistics, including the new airport planned to enhance access to the destination. The Red Sea Project is a unique opportunity, and it's one we want to approach in the right way. First and foremost, we are focused on building a sustainable development. This means seeking out the most sustainable options across all different stages and creating new alternatives where none exist currently. To achieve all of this, we are engaging partners across the development and construction industries who share our commitment to sustainability and are like-minded in their approach.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Forecast 20% Growth in 2019]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[daniel-lucio-president-summum-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The oil and gas sector is recovering after a difficult period. How was 2018 for SUMMUM? What significant events defined your year?</h4><p>It was a positive year for the company, where growth percentage was double digit over 2017. Our staff doubled to 1,200 employees, which reflects the new contracts and businesses that we were able to generate in 2018. Additionally, in terms of portfolio and customers, we managed to attract 40% more companies in Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Furthermore, we forecast for 2019 a growth in sales of 20%. We are very competitive, and our percentage success rate in proposals made against those won has also increased considerably. In Peru, our operation had only one client a year ago, and today has four. We have operated an office with a certain position in Mexico for nine years. We managed to continue generating business, although in that market the start was rather slower, and we hope to create further opportunities in 2019 following the inauguration of the new government.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind the remarkable growth of your portfolio?</h4><p>We proactively identify potential customers and commercial opportunities, especially since the market sustained a severe blow from the fall in prices between 2015 and 2016. As of 2017, we decided to strengthen the commercial teams of our two divisions. We understood the investment plans of the clients, and today work with 16 of the 20 largest oil operators in Colombia.</p><h4>What expectation does SUMMUM from the oil and gas investment environment in Colombia over the coming years?</h4><p>We have a positive expectation, and in 2018 we knew that some operators had under budgeted due to pricing pressure. Companies have unfortunately become accustomed to working in a pricing environment that generates little financial gain. In 2018, certain Colombian oil operators reported strong high positive numbers, but still put pressure on prices for services companies like us, which led them to remain without suppliers and certain services required for their projects, thus hampering investment plans. Oil operators must understand that service companies also need to generate financial value. In short, they should review the prices they offer to suppliers as our margins remain tight, despite the inherent risks in the field.</p><h4>How is does SUMMUM's innovative approach help it to face particular challenges of the Colombian market?</h4><p>In 2018, we started with a strong strategy called Ruta SUMMUN 2018-2021. The job of the organization's management committee was to analyze the company's potential position four years ahead, what it should change to improve, where to innovate, and what lines of business to integrate into its service portfolio. As a business, some years ago we are working at aspects such as artificial intelligence or the internet of things. These issues are going to touch all industries, and we must prepare for what is coming in the future. External consultants supported us by generated the roadmap for the Ruta SUMMUN 2018-2021. Having reviewed our current business lines, we identified certain additional technologies that could be integrated into some of those business lines. We also reviewed our partnerships, and are looking for key players with specific characteristics in order to penetrate new markets. While we are happy to continue performing strongly in the Mexican market, we know that there are further opportunities to tap in America, and our focus lies in North, Central, and South America. We have offices in Mexico City, Colombia, and Peru, which gives us the advantage of familiarity with the idiosyncrasies of Latin American cultures. We know that interesting businesses are in the pipeline. Our evaluations have been translated into concrete projects that will involve the entire company. There are valuable ideas that come from all over the world. In 2019, we have to work hard to cover the schedule we have established. The year of 2018 was one of structuring and defining projects, and 2019 will see the start of some of those projects.</p><h4>SUMMUM was the first oil and gas company to be part of the anti-corruption business commitment for transparency in Colombia. What is the potential of such initiatives to transform the Colombian corporate world? </h4><p>We have worked hard for three or four years in our commitment to compliance, and on strict adherence to the law in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We have reinforced our compliance work, and actively participate in related discussions. SUMMUM has clear operational procedures. We wanted to be part of a representative entity to give opinions and listen to other companies as a good internal practice of our own operations. We are proud to be the only oil and gas company to do so, and this year, we have further initiatives along that line. For example, we will become ISO certified against corruption. We will continue participating in forums because there is an essential challenge to the dirty game that blights everyone in Colombia and the region. This effort cannot come from individual governments alone; the private sector must also contribute. SUMMUM will also be part of many more such initiatives going forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[27% Investment Growth in 2018]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[paul-doany-ceo-turk-telekom]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What infrastructure investments have facilitated Türk Telekom's broadband and mobile success?</h4><p>In 2018, with an increase of 27% in comparison to the previous year, we actualized TL4.1 billion worth of investments. Of these investments, 68% was allocated to fiber and other fixed network developing structures and the remaining went towards the mobile infrastructure. We delivered our fiber services to a total of 18.6 million households and workplaces. In 2018 alone, we raised the internet penetration within our country to 55% by increasing fiber home pass by 2.4 million and we aim to continue and increase that momentum. With the arrival of more advanced and developed technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things) and smart cities that are gaining popularity with the fast approaching arrival of 5G, the way we as operators deliver services to our subscribers must also be advanced and developed. The high cost and construction of necessary infrastructure that next generation communication technologies such as 5G require for fast data transfer is the largest obstacle facing operators. The most effective solution for this situation lies in inter-sector collaborations and models that will be developed in the construction and utilisation of the fixed and mobile infrastructure.</p><h4>How will 5G factor into your mobile growth strategy over the next several years?</h4><p>During the development stage of 5G and once it has been put into practice, this technology will create a global platform encompassing the next generation and digital society. Instead of remaining on a single step of the value chain, operators will spread to each and every step with 5G and will be given the option to widen their range of services and grow; they will become network developers, service providers and even OTT creators which will in turn generate an extra revenue flow. As Türk Telekom, in order to contribute to this development, we are preparing our industry for advanced technologies by providing digital transformation and consulting services to industrial corporations in Turkey with our solution partners. However, in order for the 5G networks to be able to deliver the speeds it promises, all its cells must be connected to a fiber backbone. As Türk Telekom, with our 282 thousand kilometres of fiber network infrastructure, which covers the country end to end, we have already created Turkey's 5G communication backbone. Additionally, due to the 5G network's different architecture, operators must adopt collaborations and sharing models in infrastructure if they want to meet the high data speed and capacity 5G provides and increase return by decreasing capital expenditure. As Türk Telekom, the fixed and mobile infrastructure sharing models we developed in line with sector and country benefits will not only provide operators and our country with a significant profit in the long term, but at the same time will become successful exemplary models for many regions around the world that want to transition over to 5G. With our 282,000km fiber infrastructure, we as Türk Telekom have already reached a fiber household access of 18.6 million and have fiberized approximately 80% of our country. What we need now isn't to take fiber to households, much more than that, we need to ensure more people use the internet; basically, we need to increase the internet penetration.</p><h4>How does Türk Telekom work with its subsidiary Argela in developing 5G capabilities?</h4><p>In order to actualize Turkey's goal of becoming one of the first countries to transition over to 5G, our works in 5G technologies and infrastructures are continuing at full speed through Argela, our subsidiary that generates value in information technologies. At our R&amp;D centers such as Türk Telekom Innovation Centre and Argela 5G Centre of Excellence, we develop local products and technologies that create added value for the national economy and accelerate national development as well as maintain our leadership for Turkey to reach a position where it not only produces but also exports new technologies. With the network slicing smart software ProgRAN, which was developed by Argela and its Silicon Valley affiliate Netsia, we have raised our productivity to the highest level through our use of artificial intelligence in the optimisation of fixed and mobile networks. Most importantly, we have reached a position where we are now exporting patented 5G products to leading global operators such as Telefonica, Verizon, and Orange and thus are furthering our contribution towards the national economy. Through Argela and Netsia, we have obtained 6 new patents in 5G on an international scale in 2018. Hence, we have proudly raised our 5G patents to 17 and our total patents to 26 by the end of the year.</p><h4>Within the health, education, and energy sectors what investments have been made through Türk Telekom's venture capital initiative?</h4><p>We support the entrepreneurial ecosystem in order for Turkey to become stronger and more economically independent. As Türk Telekom, we define this support as being able to present value-added services to our customers through collaborations with innovative technological start-ups and being able to create economic benefits for our country and sector by accelerating these start-ups. In this context, we set up the sector's first corporate venture capital company; TT VENTURES in early 2018 in order to support growing start-ups. Our first investment was in the healthcare sector to Doctor Turkey; an innovative service that provides online health consultant services. TT VENTURES' second investment was in education and one of our previous initiative accelerating programme PILOT's graduates actualised MentalUP; Turkey's first gamified education platform for children that develops their thinking and learning skills. We are also investing in the energy sector through our collaborations with Turkey's leading energy companies. As a company that prides itself on the importance it places on customer satisfaction, one of our aims is to make the lives of consumers easier by combining electricity services with internet and voice services at a single point of contact. Moreover, one of the results of our investments and work across the vast area of smart cities and IoT are significant savings in the energy area. With the smart solutions we brought to areas such as electricity, lighting, recycling, fuel and irrigation, we generate a large amount of savings for our country and government; up to TL3 billion each year. We will continue to invest in smart cities and solutions that contribute towards Turkey's digital transformation and bring significant savings to our local councils, government, the citizens of Turkey and for Turkey itself.  </p><h4>What investments has Türk Telekom made in cyber security?</h4><p>As Türk Telekom, we had an aim of becoming the region's data center base and ensuring the safety of our customers, the people of Turkey and the entire country. With the Cyber Security Centre that we opened, which is the country's largest, we have successfully increased the diversity of traditional and innovative cyber security services we provide and have become Turkey's largest cyber-security operator. Ensuring that Turkey's data remains in Turkey and is stored at the highest security is one of our most valued responsibilities we have taken upon ourselves. In addition to providing cyber-security to all 500 of Turkey's largest companies as well as many private and public institutions, we are systematically preparing them for the future with our corporate products, services and digital solutions during their digitalization process. By equipping these companies with the correct moves we are ensuring their adaptation to Industry 4.0.</p><h4>How will Türk Telekom be impacted by its corporate structure change, involving a majority takeover by a SPV owned by Akbank, Garanti Bankası, and İşbank?</h4><p>The majority takeover of the company by an SPV owned by said banks has eliminated uncertainties pertaining to the partnership structure and has ensured Türk Telekom maintains its activities and investments more strongly, take the necessary steps towards the future and continue its successful operations and service delivery.</p><h4>What are Türk Telekom's most exciting plans and primary objectives over the next 12 months?</h4><p>In order for Turkey to actualize the development leap it is aiming for and be able to take its place amongst the top ten global economies, digitalisation and thus the proliferation of internet usage is of vital importance to our country. Therefore, our main priority for 2019 will once again be to increase the internet penetration. On the fixed internet side, we are aiming to ensure the 5G-ready infrastructure in mobile along with fiber investments. We will increase our project-based collaborations on subjects regarded as concrete indicators of digitalisation such as internet of things, smart cities, and smart health campuses, and we will proliferate our works in these next generation areas across the country. In addition, we will continue to grow our Digital Products and Services, for both the consumer market and the 'new enterprise,' through digital transformation services we provide through our three main subsidiaries Innova, Argela, and Sebit. I am particularly excited about our digital keyboard, TAMBU, which we as Türk Telekom believe will become an important new platform in the upcoming period. With our digital solutions such as our self-service point of contact we have with our customers, ONLINE SERVICES; our loyalty program where we offer awards to our customers, SİL SÜPÜR; our application that allows customers to solve their internet connectivity problems on their own, PRACTICAL SOLUTION; ELEQ, our live mobile gameshow program that presents a brand new gaming experience, Turkey's favorite digital music platform MUUD, Turkey's technologic and rich content OTT TV platform TIVIBU GO, the country's leading digital gaming platform PLAYSTORE, Turkey's rich content digital magazine and newspaper reading platform E-MAGAZINE and EYESENSE, Turkey's first photography application for the blind are providing users novel experiences. It goes without saying that we will continue to develop while we grow and connect Turkey to the future in the period ahead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Workforce and the 11th Malaysia Plan]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[m-kula-segaran-minister-human-resources]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on your plans to boost productivity by reskilling and upskilling workers?</h4><p>All employers from 63 subsectors within three key economic sectors (services, manufacturing, and mining and quarrying) are obliged to register with the Human Resources Development Fund (PSMB) and pay a 1% Human Resources Development (HRD) levy of their total Malaysian employees' salary for Human Capital Development (HCD) initiatives. As of October 31, 2018, the total number of PSMB-registered employers is 24,627, and these employers hire 2.24 million Malaysian employees. The agency offers financial assistance and training schemes that are driven by its registered employers' training demands, encompassing technical and soft skill trainings in domestic and international courses, setup of training rooms and relevant facilities within an employer's working space, as well as facilitating training for disabled and future workers. More recently, PSMB established a fully-fledged customer engagement team tasked with identifying the training demands and challenges among its registered employers. More recently, in the 2019 budget announcement under the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) initiative, the government will allocate to PSMB a MYR20-million (USD4.86 million) matching grant for the implementation of two TVET driven programs: the Apprenticeship Program and the Graduates Enhancement Program for Employability (GENERATE). These programs are targeted at school leavers and graduates, respectively, helping them to become job-ready while simultaneously ensuring higher productivity levels at the workplace. From 1993 to October 2018, over 19.7 million local employees of PSMB registered employers benefited from these schemes, and in 2019, PSMB targets approximately 1.2 million people. Boosting productivity by reskilling and upskilling workers is one of the most important aspects of human capital development.</p><h4>While the availability of tertiary educated Malaysians is increasing, so is graduate unemployment. Is there a skills mismatch between university curricula and professional requirements on the labor market?</h4><p>There has been a lack of attention paid to this problem, which could blossom to become a major issue soon. My worry is that there are too many graduates in this country. Though we need graduates, there seems to be an issue of a skills mismatch in terms of university curricula and the professional requirements from the labor market. Universities in Malaysia fall under the purview of the Ministry of Education, and it is taking steps to address this issue. On the part of the Ministry of Human Resources, there are several initiatives underway to prepare local workforces for the future. Among these are conducting a TVET Master Plan Study that encompasses the issues of TVET's demand and supply toward addressing the issues of skills and industry needs, including the challenges of Industry 4.0 and ensuring high employability among TVET graduates with better pay. In order to enhance the quality of TVET and in line with the needs of Industry 4.0, this study will address the aspect of curriculum restructuring, upgrading of facilities and training equipment, professional development of TVET instructors, and other related matters. Another of our initiatives is the review of the National Occupational Skills Standard (NOSS) to meet the current knowledge and skills in the era of digitalization, automation, or Industry 4.0 required by industrial players. Although youth unemployment is relatively high at 10.3%, Malaysia faces a situation of full employment. We do not have enough workers and even have around 2 million legally documented workers from other countries, and it is likely that many more are working in Malaysia illegally. At 3.4%, unemployment in Malaysia is surmountable. We are looking at the situation holistically.</p><h4>What role will high-tech play in Malaysia's transition to a high-income and developed economy?</h4><p>There is no looking back for Malaysia when it comes to adopting technology. It will play a major role in how we work as a country. In that sense, Malaysia has developed the Industry4WRD policy to provide a platform for industries to adopt any of the 11 pillars under the Industry 4.0 banner. The platform is a combination of tax and cash incentives to ensure that the technological adoption is led by the industries. The changes in technological adoption will most likely see industries creating a new employment landscape not been seen before under the traditional economies. The new employment landscape will also result in increasing incomes and ultimately push us into a more competitive, vibrant and developed economy.</p><h4>How will the government enhance the participation rate of women in senior and management positions?</h4><p>The 11th Malaysia Plan emphasizes on anchoring growth on people, focusing on empowering human capital, including women talent. The 2019 Budget clearly reflects the government's concern on this matter, and the government is taking the lead in encouraging women to contribute to the economy and pushing for more women in leadership roles which include senior and management position. Further to this, there is also a push to increase women on boards to 30% by 2020. To support this agenda, the government also announced tax exemption on employment income to be enjoyed by women on career break who return to the workforce. Furthermore, the Career Comeback Program under TalentCorp aims to encourage employers to recruit and retain female talent in the workforce, which caters to women in management positions right through to professional level. To date, we have placed 694 women in the workforce since the launch of this program with an average monthly salary of MYR7,000-8,000. Moving forward, TalentCorp is highly committed to continue engaging with the relevant stakeholders and women talent to advance this initiative forward with the support from the Ministry of Human Resources.</p><h4>What are the most important requirements for Malaysia to maintain and further enhance its international competitiveness?</h4><p>Malaysian employees are some of the most sought-after employees of the world due to their linguistic prowess, diligence, and skills. There are about 1 million Malaysians working abroad. Our productivity should increase, though we are a highly competitive country on the global stage. My biggest concern is the lack of R&amp;D. More money and time must be spent on this, and the government must give attention to this. International competitiveness is all about being better than our competitors. As a leading developing nation that is on the cusp of being a develop nation, our benchmark are developed nations. When we look at developed nations, they have some ideal characteristics that we can look upon for inspiration, such as value-based ideals and technology adoption. These value-based ideals include integrity, transparency, and accountability in how we do work. Having sound value based ideals provides us the opportunity to work with large organizations that share those kinds of values. Those organizations are sensitized toward many social, environmental, and economic issues, and they base their strategies on meeting those ideal values. Technology adoption is one area in which Malaysia sees bright potential as a new source of revenue for the country. In light of this, Malaysia has developed the Industry4WRD policy as a platform to enhance our international competitiveness by adopting technological changes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role will digitization play in growing the SME segment's contribution to the Saudi economy?</h4><p>Digitalization is an increasingly important aspect that has recently gained even higher relevance as a trend, acting as a disruptive force across different sectors of the economy. Take the retail segment, for example: e-commerce has brought major changes, revolutionizing interactions with clients and more generally the way business is conducted. Even the concept of asset-ownership has been witnessing a meaningful change. Uber is a successful example of leadership in its car-sharing, logistics segment without owning transport vehicles; in a similar way, Airbnb has disrupted the hospitality segment without owning any property. These stories tell us that digital is already there, impacting business models and setting new trends even in Saudi Arabia's market and Saudi companies. As such, SMEs need to align themselves to make sure to remain ahead of the innovation curve and fully exploit the various competitive advantages of this economy.</p><h4>What are the Small and Medium Enterprises General Authority's strategic priorities and expectations for 2019, and what is the main driver behind them?</h4><p>Looking at the SMEs ecosystem in Saudi Arabia, it is important to state that we are in the early stages, especially when looking at the development of entrepreneurship. Indeed, we have recently started setting up the necessary infrastructure conducive to a sustainable environment and meeting the goals set by Vision 2030. As such, we need to look at the broader spectrum and implement and support programs and projects aimed at developing and growing SMEs within their different stages and requirements. On the Venture Capital side, we launched a government VC fund targeting startups, aiming at bridging the investment gap and spurring more SME investments, up to SAR2.8 billion. When it comes to business enablement, we have created and supported through official licenses a series of hubs and co-working space to nurture young companies and provide them the right environment. Last but not least, we have announced many accelerators to ensure startups grow organically into businesses providing the right type of services to the market.</p><h4>How can the government increase the attractiveness of entrepreneurship in the eyes of young Saudi nationals?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia's startup environment is in its nascent phases, with many different young companies that are in their early phases and led by young entrepreneurs. As such, the whole country is very much reliant on the success of these business propositions and young minds, which is why we need to provide all the necessary support to make them succeed. Naturally, this will also have to come through a certain proposition of incentives, which is why we recognize the best startups with appropriate awards. This initiative provides the whole ecosystem with a positive, healthy competition and seeks to spur all players to progress in their endeavors despite the natural challenges that they will find along the road.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What must brands do to ensure their attractiveness in the Abu Dhabi market?</h4><p>When a firm enters the market, it is likely to face high degrees of competition from other companies trying to serve relatively young, sophisticated consumers with high purchasing power. This is why excellent service and quality, as well as innovative ideas are extremely important to succeed. Second, brands need to utilize the most advanced technology at their disposal in order to gather feedback from their consumers and understand how they can improve themselves and adapt to their new needs. The brands and companies that are most successful at constantly doing so and succeed in creating an emotional relationship with their clients will be the ones to survive. Given the youthful nature and explosive growth of market players in the UAE and Abu Dhabi, brands must stick to the basics in terms of customer centricity and quality, while at the same time, change how these basics are delivered. The third requirement is to cut through the noise. I once read that 30 years ago, consumers in the US were exposed to 300 messages per day. Today, consumers are exposed to 5,000 messages a day, consciously or unconsciously. This means that given the amount of noise in the market today, brands need to cut through this noise by making their message simple, easy, relevant, and emotionally engaging. Last but not least, it is healthy for brands to target different categories of the population and be more aware of price sensitivity. Good deals are always attractive to customers, especially those who are used to purchasing goods when they travel or online and expect to pay similar price ranges for similar products.</p><h4>How can technology help marketing firms build brand consciousness and add value to their clients' business?</h4><p>We are in a very exciting time for technology, especially as marketers. Technology allows for improvements though immediate feedback whereas before, brands had to rely on focus groups, surveys, and questionnaires to improve services. Today, types of artificial intelligence, whether it is via chatbox or facial recognition, allow brands to assess consumers' real interests and reactions. Another major benefit brought by technology is time saving. A firm will be able to gather more data and push the line that drives greater interests, thus growing the top-line and reducing costs. With technology, advertisers can also better track how well their messages and campaigns have reached their target audience. We can do more testing via digital platforms and other technological applications and tools, and save our clients' money on their total marketing spent. In this way, AI can turn marketers into more proactive planners and include them more in the development of a product. In Abu Dhabi, the government is keen to empower technological change in a number of industries, such as fast-moving goods, banking, real estate, and leisure.</p><h4>What is the UAE's competitive advantage with regards to the adoption of technology?</h4><p>The country is safe, secure, stable, and extremely commerce-friendly, which helps in any business endeavor. The government recently enacted a number of new decrees to enhance SMEs and start-ups in the country. However, at the end of the day, it goes back to the entrepreneur and the brand. The economy changes, though the basics remain key. The marketing industry should push clients to think globally and act locally, especially multinational firms. We need to provide clients with the same level of ideas that they would find in Tokyo, London, or New York, while maintaining a local flavor and consciousness. Another important aspect is agility; lean and flexible companies are more likely to keep up with an ever-changing market. A final tip would be to always be cognizant of the government and its various strategies for the economy. By aligning itself with the government, a company maximizes its chances for success and is not left out of key trends happening in society.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[70% of Energy from Water Sources]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[maria-fernanda-suarez-minister-mines-energy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Colombia's electricity generation diversifying to reduce variability and meet higher demand?</h4><p>Colombia has initiated a path toward energy transition. We will diversify, complement, and improve the competitiveness of our energy grid, promoting unconventional sources of renewable energy such as sun and wind. About 70% of the energy produced in our country comes from water sources. This has led to an energy matrix that's considered the sixth-cleanest in the world by the World Economic Council. However, this also makes Colombia's power generation system vulnerable to climate variability, which is why it is essential to diversify. This government will promote the full potential of alternative renewable sources. In the Caribbean region, there is a unique opportunity: the wind in La Guajira blows at a rate that doubles the global average, and that region also has one of the highest luminosities in the world. The potential of wind and solar resources in this region is greater than the hydroelectric potential of the whole country. However, all this potential has yet to be developed. The goal of the government of President Duque is to go from 50MW to at least 1,500MW of installed capacity in unconventional sources of renewable energy, which represents estimated investments between USD1.3 and USD1.8 billion and an approximate reduction of 2 million tons of CO2, equivalent to the planting of 6 million trees.</p><h4>Which segments of non-energy mining are seeing the largest investment and presenting greater opportunities in the medium term?</h4><p>On the path toward energy transformation, we also see opportunities for the diversification of mineral production based on greater knowledge of subsoil and global opportunities. Copper, for example, holds great potential for us as an export commodity and presents a prime opportunity for the development of a responsable and sustainable mining economy that can generate employment and resources for our economy. Colombia currently counts with over one million tons of proven reserves of copper and we estimate that by 2030 this number can rise to 2 million, which would make Colombia the third largest copper producer in Latin America. Our goal is to have at least two copper projects in advanced exploration stage in 2022. However, in our strategic plan for the mining sector, we have set the goal of enhancing gold production. Our goal is to move from 21 tons of gold to 27 tons produced by mining owners. For this, we have an active inter-institutional agenda that includes the financing of environmental authorities with resources from royalties generated by the mining-energy sector, as well as a roadmap between the National Mining Agency and the National Environmental Licenses Authority for the exchange of geographic information and responsive procedures between the two entities.</p><h4>What does the mining sector represent for the country and in terms of foreign investment?</h4><p>The mining and energy sector is one of the main economic drivers in Colombia and represents employment, investment, tax revenues, and opportunities for the country and various regions. In particular, the mining sector generates 350,000 direct jobs and more than 1 million indirect jobs. Between 2010 and 2017, it represented on average 2% of GDP and 20% of exports. In addition, it has raised COP14 trillion (USD4.511 billion) in royalties, or COP1.7 trillion (547.8 million) per year. These resources must be translated into works for the territories. According to the central bank, in 3Q2018, the mining sector received USD1.527 million in direct foreign investment, representing 18.5% of the country's total. The main investors in the Colombian mining sector are Canada, Australia, and the UK.</p><h4>What will be the role of the mining economy in the post-conflict era?</h4><p>In general, the mining and energy sector is and will continue to be fundamental to the stabilization of areas affected by violence, generating new employment opportunities and investments that help guarantee equity in Colombia. As a result of the production of hydrocarbons and mining, the regions will receive COP24.2 billion (USD7.799 million) from the Biennial Budget of Royalties for 2019 and 2020. This is the highest amount since the creation of the General Royalty System in 2012. The regions will receive a total of COP30 billion (USD10 billion), if we take into account the COP6 billion that have not yet been executed from previous periods. These are resources that will finance works in the departments and municipalities, as well as education, science, technology, and innovation, and the stabilization of the areas affected by violence. Resources for post-conflict areas will increase from COP511 million to COP1.9 billion, almost four times the value of the previous biennium. To conserve this source of revenue, it is essential to continue to bet on the mining and energy sector and increase the current reserves of oil and gas, which are 5.7 years and 11.7 years, respectively. Self-sufficiency in hydrocarbons will not only guarantee the energy security of the country but also continue to provide resources for peace, equity, and the development of the regions. Finally, our goal is to bring electricity to 100,000 families who do not have access to this service today. Energy connects territories and generates opportunities for transformation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Towards a More Resilient Nation]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[rear-admiral-james-anthony-morse-president-rabdan-academy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Rabdan placed in the education ecosystem and what factors shape the design of your curriculum?</h4><p>Rabdan Academy is an Abu Dhabi government entity and our founding decree allows considerable flexibility for us to work across the Abu Dhabi, Federal, private and international market, under the direction of a Board of Trustees comprising very senior leaders from across our major stakeholders. The Academy is now over five years old, with major stakeholders in safety, security, defense, emergency management and crisis response (SSDEC), such as the Armed Forces GHQ, Abu Dhabi Police, the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Interior and National Security Council, amongst others. The Academy acts as a catalyst to build and develop interoperability between relevant entities, based upon education and training programs, which aim to make the SSDEC sector more effective and in the longer term to allow rationalization to make education and training more efficient too. The Academy is also working with stakeholders to identify common standards and doctrine, and how these can be aligned for organizational interoperability. This should result in better coordination of training, which improves operational performance whilst resulting in clear financial benefits. The added benefit of coherence in the education and training system, such as agreed national standards, is that this enables nationally recognized skills certification, which ultimately creates a more employable and portable workforce. In addition to our academic programs, the Academy has also been making significant progress in the development and delivery of short courses and vocational training over the past few years. Moreover, we are working to provide more flexible pathways to education, including recognition of prior learning, suitable for the future requirements and in alignment with relevant regulations, so that we can the contribute to a highly skilled workforce, prepared for the future challenges. As the Academy grows we are also increasingly looking internationally, to develop partnerships with top universities for mutual benefit; this includes further building on our successful student exchange program, which allows our students to spend a semester at another international university and for them to send students to Rabdan Academy. In this Year of Tolerance such exchange programs contribute to building understanding and trust, and help to break down barriers and misconceptions, with a semester overseas being a most enriching experience for a student.</p><h4>How does technology effect curriculum design and how can technology be a utility to build transferable skills?</h4><p>Technology has a significant impact on curriculum design, as the SSDEC sector is moving very fast across the spectrum of new scientific developments. In particular, everyone is talking about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the many questions and challenges it raises for the future of education. If AI will replace current skills and workers, then what skills should be taught to ensure our students are ready for an AI-enhanced future? With such fast technological developments, it is not easy for organizations to predict what skill-sets they will need from employees six years from now, which is the length of development of a new program and its delivery at the Bachelor level, so this presents a significant challenge when designing a curriculum. However, I would contend that fundamental human skills, such as critical thinking and leadership, are going to be just as important, if not more-so, as AI enters the workplace. Our graduates will need to be able to do the things that AI cannot or should not do, such as showing curiosity, creativity and innovation, ethical thinking and other human abilities that are hard to program into computers and artificial intelligence. To my mind, the challenges of timeliness, relevance and student availability also mean that there will be a debate over the best form and shape of education and training in the future, with sponsors increasingly demanding shorter-term interventions and close partnership. This would allow highly qualified employees access to education and training, without requiring lengthy leave of absence from work, relevant to their employment and sponsor. Within this approach the benefits of education as opposed to training, such as focused research, critical thinking and developing leadership, must not be lost.  For example, the Academy's Masters' of Intelligence Analysis research projects are related to either the student's current employment, or the jobs they will have upon graduation, so they are focused on real world or future issues. We are trying to teach techniques and approaches to thinking for problems that will arise in the future, via problems that exist today. These are the transferable skills that AI may not be able to provide. In a nutshell, education is about preparing students to deal with the unknown and unknowable problems of the future; training is about preparing them for the known problems of today.</p><h4>How do you assess the increasing role of technology in areas such as policing and emergency management?</h4><p>Technology is transforming the whole SSDEC sector across the UAE, bringing many advantages and benefits, including linkages to partners and allies worldwide. Technology is, of course, also being exploited by criminals and terrorists, so we are effectively in an arms race in the security area.  Perhaps some of the fastest moving areas of policing are found in cyberspace, facial recognition and predictive algorithms, which can provide significant advantages in the fight against criminals, but there is a concomitant ongoing international debate about the balance of privacy with security, as nations seek to find a way to keep their citizens safe and secure, whilst allowing individuals appropriate levels of privacy. This debate must of course be shaped by the threats that individual nations and their societies face, with a recognition that “one size will not fit all". In the field of emergency management technology is also having a major impact, with predictive software now better able to provide warnings of emergencies, better design and novel technologies are making our environment safer and in the event of an emergency we can use technology in many ways to respond more effectively.  On the latter point, drones and unmanned vehicles, both with sophisticated sensors, allow us to search disaster sites more quickly and safely, and of course mobile phones have transformed our ability to communicate with survivors. Simulation and synthetic environments also contribute to our effective training and response to emergencies. But technology is not the answer to every problem - there are plenty of international examples of wars in which the side with the best technology, people and training did not prevail because they did not understand the war they were fighting. This can equally apply to other areas of the SSDEC field. So the Academy still emphasizes and teaches the importance of understanding the character of the conflict or situation, whether in the military or policing area, so that we can think through the problems to find solutions through good analysis and planning. So we must remember that not everything has a technological solution; frequently the skills needed are human ones, such as truly understanding the problem, and these are skills that are best developed through education aided, but not replaced by technology.</p><h4>As information and cyber security challenges are continuously evolving, what needs to be done to create greater awareness of these threats?</h4><p>While the Academy covers the topics of cyber security and information security, in the context of how it relates to policy and operations, we do not teach our students the technical aspects, which are covered at other institutions. The speed at which cyber security challenges are evolving means that every student in the SSDEC sector must be aware of how this area will impact them and their organization. As with all technologies, our opponents are also heavily investing in cyberspace, with organized crime, as an example, seeing it as an area of lower risk and higher returns.  Cyber policy around warfare has also been a hot topic of policy debates, with a particular challenge of garnering international consensus on the legal framework that should govern cyber operations. Our students need to be aware of this debate and the policy freedoms, constraints and uncertainties that accompany it.</p><h4>What are your expectations and outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We held our first graduation ceremony in October 2018, so are proud that our graduates are in the workplace in 2019 using the skills they have gained at Rabdan Academy to keep the UAE a safer and more secure place. As we look forward into 2019 we will be launching our new Master's program in Policing and Security Leadership, to add to our portfolio of relevant programs across the SSDEC sector. We are also seeking to expand internationally, building on our reputation for maintaining the highest standards and seeking the best possible educational outcomes for our students. We will be offering a wider range of vocational training courses to our stakeholders and also developing the centers of excellence project to enhance interoperability and effective, efficient training regimes. We are in the process of developing plans for a new simulation center, which we hope to have approved and building started in 2019. This will enable the Academy to run a host of scenarios, whereby our students benefit from diverse experiences prior to the real world of work, and we can experiment and research new techniques and procedures to be more effective in the future. Moreover, through 2019 we will continue to build our research capabilities. Rabdan Academy's reputation will continue to grow throughout 2019 and our alumni will be recognized for their achievement and contribution “towards a more resilient nation".</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the essence of the Quality of Life program—launched in mid-2018 with a SAR130 billion budget—and how you envision funding be allocated to achieve these goals?</h4><p><span></span>The Quality of Life Program is one of the vision realization programs (VRPs) adopted by HRH Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2016, which is based on three main pillars: a vibrant society, a thriving economy, and an ambitious nation. Vision 2030 aims to bring about a major qualitative leap on several levels including economic, social, cultural, and others. The Quality of Life program is one of the most comprehensive programs to achieve this vision, and the most relevant to the lives of citizens and residents. It was originally established to enhance the quality of life in the Kingdom through improved lifestyles and infrastructure development. Secondly, we also aim to improve lifestyles to support the entertainment, cultural, sport, and recreational sectors and to increase the interaction of individuals and society with these sectors. The infrastructure for this includes work on transport, urban landscape, housing, education, health and other vital sectors of the country. Funding for the program's initiatives is through several means. Initiatives with high returns that can be accomplished quickly involve the private sector, such as the cinema sector, which has been revived through the program's initiatives, the implementation of General Commission for Audiovisual Media (GCAM), and the private sector. Vital initiatives that lack financial or low-cost returns are achieved through direct government spending from the budget allocated to the program's initiatives, which are implemented by various government agencies according to their mandates, such as the General Culture Authority (GCA), General Sport Authority (GSA), the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Housing, the Ministry of Education, and other quality-of-life partners. In total there are 14 executive bodies for the initiatives of the program, on a total of more than 100 diverse initiatives, divided according to the competence of the partners. The program team works with all these agencies to ensure that the initiatives are completed and implemented.  </p><h4>In terms of livability in Saudi's major cities, what are the main priorities to achieve a higher ranking?</h4><p>Our priority is the parallel developments of lifestyles and infrastructure. Each of the executive bodies takes its initiative as a top priority, and we work with all partners to enable them to accomplish their initiatives efficiently and quickly. This is part of the Crown Prince's vision when he talked about priorities: “We have many sides to deal with. We cannot stop the achievement of a particular entity due to the delay of another. It will definitely delay the entire government work. All parties are supposed to be supported and motivated to accomplish their achievements, and the delayed entity must be reviewed to identify their hindrances and work on it." One of our objectives is to enhance the presence of the cities of the Kingdom in our international indicators. The ultimate ambition of the program is to include Saudi cities on the list of the world's best 100 cities to live in by 2030, including the development of all sectors that pay attention to the quality of life and the well-being of citizens and residents. Part of our ambition is to rethink the existing infrastructure we have—for example, we can repurpose schools for other activities outside of school hours. </p><h4>How can the Quality of Life program provide for a smooth transition into an active and vibrant entertainment sector, with all stakeholders involved?</h4><p>Initiatives of a legislative nature occupy an important area of the program. The program works through several initiatives to change and develop legislation related to entertainment and culture and general legislation, which affect the quality of life in the Kingdom. We have initiatives with GCAM, GEA, and other sectors to remove any legislative obstacles to the growth of the sector and add incentive legislation that contributes to its growth. The legislation concerning GCAM and GEA was recently approved and is one of the main initiatives of the program to develop the general legislative environment in the Kingdom. Our organization is also well-positioned to monitor the ownership of the various programs, guide collaboration between the various authorities and, if needed, reassign certain responsibilities.</p><h4>The entertainment industry alone is set to create 220,000 jobs by 2030. Where do these employment opportunities primarily come from?</h4><p>The revitalization of the entertainment, cultural and recreational, sports, and artistic sectors means effective participation of the private sector, greater revenue growth, and an integrated economic cycle, which is positive for the Kingdom's economy as a whole. For example, the recreational sector, which means more activities and recreational activities, leads to further employment of the private sector, increased investment, and increased financial revenues due to increased spending by families and individuals on entertainment, which directly creates job opportunities for Saudis in this, here, relatively modern sector. </p><h4>What primary ambitions you have set for the coming year? </h4><p>Following the approval of the organizational arrangements for the Quality of Life Program Center in November 2018, the program has now become one of our core priorities. The center will be independent and aims to support the hobbies sector, develop possible regulations and specialized competencies in quality of life, and initiate innovative creative initiatives. In 2019, we aspire to improve the quality of life in the Kingdom, move ahead with all the program's initiatives, build a broader strategy for the coming years, and come closer than ever to making the Kingdom's cities some of the leading cities in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[21% Growth in 2018]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[kaan-terzioglu-ceo-turkcell]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main reasons behind Turkcell's success over the past year?</h4><p>2018 was a remarkable year for Turkcell, during which we exceeded all the targets we had set for ourselves and communicated to the market. These results are not just about one year, but are the result of the combination of hard work over the last four years and of our journey from being a traditional network-oriented telco to a telco that is experience oriented — what we call a digital operator. A traditional telco-customer relationship is around 32 minutes a day. If we look at the trillions of dollars generated by the digital economy in the last 10 years, very little of that trickled down to telcos, which is a missed opportunity. That is why four years ago, we made a bold move in our strategy and said we will not be satisfied with the 32-minute relationship and want to take that to all 1,440 minutes in a day. To do that, we had to focus on the things that customers loved consuming—music, TV, instant messaging, search engines, and all types of magazines and newspapers. As we built our capabilities on those digital services, our relationship with customers expanded and got deeper, and this allowed us to create more value. All those efforts to date translated to Turkcell being the fastest-growing telco in the world. In 2018, we grew 20.8% and reached TL 21.3 billion, while the 24-month growth rate was 49%. What we see is not only a high-performing telco but one that has adapted a new business model. Our vision in Turkcell is simple and is represented by two letters: DO or “digital operator." Our strategy is also simple and is represented by the number of minutes in a day: 1440. DO 1440 will be something that customers will hear more from us, as we explain how we created this high-performing operation.</p><h4>How has today's globalized economy shaped the way Turkcell invests internationally?</h4><p>Today's global dynamics do not necessitate a telco growing globally by acquiring or starting other telcos internationally. Belarus, Cyprus, and Ukraine are examples of Turkcell's old strategy. They are all investments that we made in the past that we are pleased with, though in the future our global growth story will come not from owning telco assets outside of Turkey but digital services. BiP, our communications application, has been downloaded in more than 190 countries and is growing quickly. Our products and everything we do is done at world-class standards, which is why many people outside of Turkey where we have no operations also choose us. We have close to 10,000 BIP customers in Oman, close to 150,000 in the UAE, 250,000 in Saudi Arabia, and 110,000 in Morocco. We do not have telcos there though we have customers, and we provide a service to those people. This expansion model requires us to work in partnership with other telcos. Our business model is completely different from the OTT players around the world; data—the most important natural asset in every country—has to be processed locally and turned into services locally. The telcos in every country have a responsibility do to that. That is why we develop partnerships with telcos in other countries to convert them into digital operators and is the reason why we intend to build an international franchise not to be just one company that provides services from Turkey to everywhere, but to offer the technology know-how to be operated in the countries creating jobs, tax dollars, and investment locally in every country that we partner with.</p><h4>How do your international operations act as a hedge against volatility in your Turkish operations?</h4><p>We do not rely just on our international operations as a means of hedging our risks in Turkey; we have a complete business hedging strategy. For every infrastructure investment we make, the average payback time is around four to five years. We also make sure we match our loans with the same maturity, which allows us to be less exposed to liquidity risk, a problem for Turkey. We continuously hedge against maturity risks, foreign currency risks, and interest rate risks and have created a company whose growth plans are always fully funded.</p><h4>From an investment and technology standpoint, how important is your partnership with Huawei?</h4><p>Huawei is one of our infrastructure technology providers. We work around 50% with Ericsson and 50% with Huawei in Turkey in terms of deploying our mobile infrastructure and fixed infrastructure. Based on our experience with Huawei, it has been a trustworthy and reliable business partner and has helped us significantly during the four years of Turkcell's transformation. We are aware of the warnings surrounding Huawei; however, on the other side, we are responsible for securing our networks, and we have the ability to ensure that our networks are secure and protected. We have a responsibility to keep our networks secure, and Huawei has been a reliable and resilient business partner.</p><h4>What responsibilities do telcos have as network technologies continue to expand?</h4><p>We should stop defining network technologies as simply 5G or any generation of network, because these are not the right terms for what we should expect in the future. We are coming to a world of democratization of information and AI, which has created not only a digital economy but also all sorts of ills for society. In Turkey, we have a saying that bad news travels fast, and in the digital age it is exactly the same; misinformation and other ways to manipulate the way people think travel quickly. As we move in this direction, we also need to prepare for the era of AI, where digital operators like Turkcell will have a major role in making sure that a country's infrastructure is ready. Every industry will experience a different impact from AI. Many people ask, what is today's killer app? The killer app depends on what one looks for, though to start with it is AI, because AI will come with completely different ways of doing business.</p><h4>To what extent should Turkish companies collaborate to improve the country's telecommunications experience?</h4><p>Turkey has a deficiency in terms of fiber infrastructure—the country has 10% of the infrastructure it needs and a limited number of home passes. Today, Turkcell has about 5 million home passes, Vodafone has around 1 million, and Turksat has another 4-5 million. To optimize our resources, we decided to have access to each other's home passes in order to bundle our services and increase value. However, with everything pooled together, we perhaps reach around 5.5 million home passes, and Turkey needs 20. It is a great step in the right direction; however, in addition to sharing existing infrastructure, we should open the doors to jointly investing in new infrastructure, which would benefit the country. None of the companies in the telecoms space are wealthy enough or in a position to alone make the major investments we need. Companies need to be allowed to combine their resources on certain infrastructure investments of national interest.</p><h4>What plans are in place for the next 12 months, and what are your objectives to maintain the growth seen in 2018?</h4><p>There are two kinds of information: headlines and trend lines. As investors, we need to look to trend lines in order to block out some of the panicky nature of news that pops up as headlines. The trend lines say Turkey is a young, growing economy that has proven its resilience time and again despite different challenges. Our domestic market is extremely strong, and we will continue to invest in digital infrastructure and digital services. However, what makes me extremely excited about in the coming years is exporting the digital know-how we have created. We are excited about our DO 1440 strategy and expanding what we export to other telcos that have been late to the game or are not blessed with the type of resources we have. Customers will be seeing many announcements from us in different parts of the world, Turkcell partnering with other telcos, and exporting BiP, Fizy, TV+, Yaani, and Lifebox. We will help them transform themselves into digital operators and will take this industry back on a growth track.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[harry-sacal-president-ceo-pluscorp]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the new administration impact the Mexican economy and your business?</h4><p>Mexico is facing a new type of leadership and a new mode of doing business, and we remain optimistic about it. The new administration is fulfilling some campaign promises, and the market has reacted negatively, but we still believe that the country has strong economic fundamentals. We will continue to invest in Mexico and be on the lookout for opportunities to grow.</p><h4>What are the main areas of opportunity you have identified in Mexico's financial market?</h4><p>The main areas of opportunity in the Mexican financial market remain in the underserved SMEs. SMEs in Mexico represent 99.8% of the economic units in the country, generating over 40% of the GDP and employing over 78% of the country. However, there is a lack of institutional sources of capital for them. PlusCorp, through its subsidiaries Sofoplus and Plus Leasing, offers innovative banking solutions to SMEs, ranging from simple and revolving lines of credit to leasing solutions.</p><h4>What differentiates you from other SOFOMES in the market that focuses on mid-sized companies?</h4><p>Most SOFOMES in Mexico are focused in micro-credit and financing payrolls. However, we look to target high growth SMEs who need capital to scale and grow. We can build long term relationships with cash flow generating SMEs who need access to capital to finance growth. We are nimble and have enough experience to understand our clients' financing need so that we can provide tailor-made solutions for our clients. Also, being a regulated entity has given us access to competitive sources of funding from public markets, including BMV and BIVA, and development and commercial banks, enabling us to have competitive prices.</p><h4>What sectors are you focusing on? </h4><p>We always look to maintain a diversified portfolio. The main sectors we focus on include, construction, services, tourism, and manufacturing. We expect a lot of growth in the tourism and services sectors in the Mexican market in 2019. As noted, we are sector agnostic and have enough experience and expertise to give the best solutions for our clients.</p><h4>What kind of steps do you need to take to launch the IPO in the future? </h4><p>We have been thinking of an IPO since the creation of the Company. Firstly, in 2015 we became a regulated entity in 2015 and began CEBURE program in the BMV and BIVA. We also operate with a high degree of corporate governance, having independent committees and Board of Directors. We have always complied with all the National Banking Commission audits. In 2018 we partnered with Creation Investments and are currently working in a business plan that includes aggressive growth in portfolio and improvement in our best practices. In the next few years, we will reach the scale to have a liquidity event through an IPO.</p><h4>How was PlusCorp developed? </h4><p>The founding team of PlusCorp has been heavily involved in the financial sector in Mexico for the last 30 years. Prior to PlusCorp, they developed one of the largest currency exchange companies in the country. While operating the currency exchange, the founding team realized that many of the institutional customers where SMEs who needed net working capital financing. In 2006, Sofoplus was created with the premise to give tailor-made lending solutions to Mexican SMEs. In 2014, we founded Plus Leasing, focused on leasing solutions for SMEs, and PlusCorp as the Holding Company.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-vision]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Al Raid Group doing to diversify Oman's retail options?</h4><p>
	Our group was built on a vision to create a better future for Omanis. The decision to construct Al Araimi Boulevard was mainly due to the fact that no similar mall existed. The retail options available and the design of the mall are unique. Not only is the mall revolutionizing the existing market, it has also set a new benchmark for all future Omani projects.
</p><h4>
	How was Al Araimi Boulevard designed to match changing retail consumer preferences?
</h4><p>
	The retail industry has changed over the past few years. Most consumers today would prefer to spend on the entertainment or F&amp;B segments. Different and new forms of entertainment, such as virtual reality and gaming, are emerging. Therefore, we built a virtual reality theme park with an iCOMBAT gaming center. We want to encourage consumers to spend as much time in the mall as possible, so these public spaces also have to be designed in a certain way.</p><h4>What specific segments of the market do you target with Al Araimi Boulevard?</h4><p>
	Al Araimi Boulevard is open to all. When we first thought of developing Al Araimi Boulevard, we decided to put all biases aside and create a brighter future for the retail sector in Oman. Al Araimi Boulevard is more than a mall; it is a haven, far from the troubles of life where people can relax.</p><h4>How did Al Raid Group choose the location of Al Araimi Boulevard in Seeb?</h4><p>
	We chose the location due to its expected future potential. Our strategic vision is to cater to all and creating a mall in a densely populated area provided the greatest impact. Equally important, the location is close to a highway and an important intersection that connects two major areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the government and banking sector help in starting your business?</h4><p>The environment for start-ups in this part of the world is still a bit conservative, but my background in the banking sector helps me navigate the system. When we registered the company, the government was helpful in setting up the company; the only challenge we had and still have is acquiring visas for our foreign workers. The banks work as business partners rather than just a source of financing because they help you to grow, which is a strength of the system in Oman. In terms of women empowerment, our culture is different from other places as the families push and welcome the concept of a woman starting a business.</p><h4>How do you stay in touch with changes in market tastes?</h4><p>In Oman, word of mouth is the strongest way to build or ruin a business; therefore, we focus on communicating with our clients about what they want, need, and are looking into. Every salon has the same products, the same suppliers, same service steps, so what makes a salon different is the overall customer experience.</p><h4>Do you have expansion plans?</h4><p>Our expansion is based on the expansion of malls in Oman. We are expanding into the forthcoming Oman Mall and we will be opening in Sohar City Centre; we're also in talks with the Palm Mall. Other than that, we are rebranding and changing the concept. Change is important in our field; after being in the market for 10 years, we are aware that customers want to see and feel something new, and change can also bring in new clients. </p><h4>What are your objectives over the next 12 months?</h4><p>We are looking into expansion and we are working hard on setting up new branches and hiring more Omani staff. </p>]]></richbody0content>

The three sections of our business, sport, tourism, and commerce, are doing well, and moving forward, we have clear plans for each. Our original plan was to reignite the country's maritime eminence and bring the Omani people into sport, tourism, and commerce. At present, we seek to solidify all our gains in these areas. Our Olympic aspirations are solid and have been a key goal since the beginning, and we are making impressive steps forward in this area. Mohammed Nabil Al Balushi became the first-ever sailor from Oman Sail to represent Oman at a Youth Olympic Games in the Men's Windsurfing Techno 293+ class at the event in Buenos Aires in October 2018. It takes time to develop a strong national team and system, but the youth programs are a key element of our strategy. When we started, we were introducing the country's youth to sailing for the first time, and now they are consistently winning. The Sultanate has a small population, but Omanis are consistently performing well against some of the largest nations in the region. Notably, schools are active in the youth programs, and sailing is part of the national curriculum. </p><h4>What will the company accomplish over the next decade?</h4><p>We want to compete in the Global Ocean Race, the Olympic Regattas, and we want our youth program to grow further; our strategy is to get as many people into the program as possible. On the commercial and business side, we have a wide range of projects. At present, about 30% of our income comes from the private sector, and we are constantly searching for new opportunities. We are hosting several events, such as marathons, to encourage Omanis to become active in sport and lead active lives. The marathon fits into both the sport box and the tourism box because it brings in foreign participants. Part of our strategy with marathons is to attract big names to the race. For example, world record marathon champion Paula Radcliffe is slated to be the ambassador of the eighth edition of the Al Mouj Muscat Marathon. A big name such as Radcliffe attracts participants and helps the marathon become a significant regional sporting event.</p><h4>How does the Oman Sail's strategy fit into the Tanfeedh initiative's goals for tourism?</h4><p>The Tanfeedh objectives relating to tourism are fairly diverse. There is a plethora of initiatives, and one of the initiatives we are working on to fit within Tanfeedh relates to sport and adventure tourism. Some people view it as niche, but adventure tourism is absolutely enormous and is one of the fastest-growing components of the tourism market. In real dollar terms, sports and adventure tourism is worth the same to New Zealand as oil and gas is to Oman. Oman is perfect for sailing, cycling, running, and triathlons. We have all the infrastructure for these sports; all we have to do is attract the athletes. </p><h4>What will be the long-term economic impact of hosting international events?</h4><p>The number of tourists focused on trekking and hiking is huge. If we you look at the economic impact of these tourists on various parts of the world, then we can begin to understand the impact it can have on Oman. We are promoting Oman in many different areas, and this will have a compounding effect on the country as a whole. We will conduct economic impact studies for the coming five years to determine exactly how many visitors return and their impact. We expect to see a large multiplier effect. All of the initiatives we are engaged in are for the long haul. By the time we host our second race, our aim is to have over 1,000 runners. Our job is to promote the country, and we have been dedicated to this task from the beginning. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>From which sectors of the economy does OCEC see the most demand for MICE events?</h4><p>In terms of attracting international events to Oman, we have a strong presence in the medical sector and have been able to secure over 22 international and regional congresses. Some of the events that OCEC is looking forward to are the 2020 World Cancer Congress, the 2020 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Congress, SICOT 2019, and the World Hospital Congress 2019. Other sectors such as oil and gas also play a major role in bringing world-class events to the Sultanate. We successfully hosted the 2018 World Heavy Oil Congress and have secured it for the next three years.</p><h4>What innovations within the MICE sector top OCEC's list?</h4><p>Most of the newly built convention centers follow the trend of having a purpose-built precinct. We are one of the few following this trend on a global scale as it provides hassle-free experience for delegates. Our center was awarded LEED Gold certification from the US Green Building Council, which sets the standards for sustainable development, reflecting the future of Oman's growing tourism industry. The center demonstrates environmental stewardship and leadership in sustainable design and holds the highest LEED point score in the Sultanate. The design of the center ensures a flow of the meeting spaces and incorporates expansive concourse areas to accomodate large delegations with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking landscaped gardens and water features. The precinct will provide the necessary infrastructure to host successful international, regional, and local events for the enjoyment of delegates, visitors, and the local community. The precinct includes a JW Marriott Hotel linked to the convention center and the Crowne Plaza Hotel. A business park and a retail shopping mall, surrounded by a nature reserve, together with parklands and a wadi (valley) park, are also part of this precinct.</p><h4>Considering its proximity, how is OCEC benefitting from the new airport?</h4><p>Tourism, particularly business tourism, is expected to increase significantly in Oman. With the opening of the new Muscat International Airport, there is a steady increase in the amount of new international flights, which means more access to over half of the world's population.</p><h4>How much growth is OCEC seeing as a result of the government's focus on developing the tourism sector?</h4><p>The economic impact of OCEC cannot be measured solely within the confines of the facility; however, Oman Tourism Development Company's (Omran) significant investments in the business events sector means Oman can now provide more options for business travelers and act as a new hub for business events in the region. According to a study by Strategy, the OCEC project is expected to generate OMR295 million in local spending, create an additional 15,000-18,000 permanent jobs, and contribute OMR200-240 million to the national economy by 2030. At the center of Oman's business development program, OCEC will act as a catalyst for business travel in Oman.</p><h4>How does OCEC, and more broadly Oman, differentiate itself from other venues for attracting and hosting events?</h4><p>Global competition is fierce, as there has been tremendous growth in venues in recent years. The key to success is creating flexibility in both facilities and services that can respond to new demands. To that end, we have a purpose-built exhibition and a dedicated conference center with a variety of 55 spaces to choose from, including a 3,200-person theater. In authentic culture and history, Oman has so much to offer to conference and exhibition organizers, and as a result, we have already won 18 international and regional conferences with a total economic impact of OMR22.5 million. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the goal of transferring projects from the Ministry of Tourism to Omran?</h4><p>Omran was established in 2005 as the government's executive arm responsible for developing and operating tourism related infrastructure and projects that support the objectives of the 2040 Tourism Strategy. Omran executes its mandate in two ways: receiving the transfer of existing tourism related assets from ministries such as the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Heritage and Culture, and Ministry of Finance, and managing and enhancing those assets to maximize value for the government, the tourism sector, and the local communities; and developing new projects on government-owned land either by itself or in partnership with other investors. Omran has made significant progress on both fronts. For example, it has received several existing hotels from the Ministry of Tourism and is now asset managing those and also a number of tourist and heritage destinations such as Nizwa Fort, Harat Al Bilad, and Hoota Cave. With respect to new projects, Omran has successfully delivered the Oman Exhibition and Convention Centre and two new hotels at its new Madinat Al Irfan master-planned community. Also in 2018, Omran entered into two development partnerships with regional investors DAMAC and Majid Al Futtaim to develop two large mixed-use tourism communities, being the redevelopment of Sultan Qaboos Port and Madinat Al Irfan West.</p><h4>How does the Ministry of Tourism work in partnership with Omran?</h4><p>The ministry produced the 2040 Tourism Strategy, which we use as our reference point. The ministry sits on the Omran Board and our corporate KPIs are aligned with the 2040 Strategy. Our management works closely with its counterparts at the ministry and there are a number of working groups addressing specific needs and objectives. There are also joint working groups within the Tanfeedh initiative, for example, there is a group focusing on enhancing facilities for domestic tourism. </p><h4>Which sub-sectors of tourism development are most important to Omran's strategy?</h4><p>Omran is the biggest owner and developer of hotels in Oman, so our hospitality business is extremely important to both us and the tourism sector. Also, we have six investment partnerships across the country developing integrated tourism complexes (ITCs) on large pieces of land. These projects are important because they bring in a significant amount of FDI, create new opportunities for Omani SMEs, employ Omanis, and bring economic and social benefits to the surrounding communities.</p><h4>What is Omran's plan for developing projects that target the middle-income segment?</h4><p>Since our hospitality portfolio includes three- to five-star hotels across the country, we are already diversified across all income segments. We work with all the large international hotel operators but we also have developed our own in-house brand called Atana. Our Atana hotels are smaller and offer a more local authentic Omani experience in the three- and four-star categories. For example, we recently received two small hotels from the Ministry of Tourism near Sur and Salalah, which we are turning into Atana branded offers. We are also working to develop “integrated service centers" along major road networks that combine petrol stations with convenience shops and motel-style accommodation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the tourism sector in the next five years?</h4><p>All indications and KPIs confirm that tourism in Oman will continue to grow over the next five years and beyond. The government has made significant investment in tourism infrastructure over the last years with the opening of two international airports, the Oman Exhibition and Convention Centre as well as infrastructure for several ITC projects across the country. The number of four- and five-star hotel rooms in the country has doubled, and there have been an equal number of developments for new cultural and heritage attractions like the Royal Opera House. The government has put down the right foundations to allow both public and private sectors to build a sustainable and growing tourism industry that will deliver the objectives of the 2040 Strategy, especially in creating employment and SME opportunities across the Sultanate. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the new Muscat International Airport and improvements to Oman's other airports improving the Sultanate's tourism industry?</h4><p>The new Muscat International Airport and the recently launched airport in Salalah will be the new aviation gateways for Oman. In addition, three regional airports have been built. Two of them, Duqm airport and Sohar airport, are in commercial operation. Oman has an ambitious aviation strategy, clearly manifested in these highly sophisticated infrastructure that ensures that tourists have positive first experience. We have seen a steady rise in the number of international tourists over the years. New international routes will allow more tourists to enjoy this extraordinary country. To that end, Oman's budget carrier, Salam Air, recently added Tbilisi and Baku to its network. Another new airport, Duqm airport, will serve the highly promising port city of Duqm. Airport improvements across the Sultanate have focused on implementing modern technology within contemporary Omani design, and the addition of world-class terminal amenities to significantly enhance the passenger experience and reflect the very best of Oman's renowned hospitality.  </p><h4>What changes or investments should Oman airlines make to facilitate more travel to and within Oman?</h4><p>Oman Aviation Group, which is in charge of the development of the aviation sector, is working on various initiatives in close cooperation with the Ministry of Tourism. Projects like Airport City, Business City, and Logistics City are being looked at to boost the number of arrivals. Oman Air, the Sultanate's four-star Skytrax airline, continues to expand its route network and modernize its fleet of aircraft. The airline currently flies to 54 destinations around the world and continues to explore new markets for future destination opportunities. Recent successful route launches include Casablanca and Istanbul, while Maldives, Moscow, and Athens will be added in the short term. Within Oman, the airline continues to increase frequencies on popular routes—such as Muscat-Salalah—to facilitate air connectivity for both Omanis and international visitors seeking to explore beyond Muscat. Oman Air operates one of the youngest fleets of ultra-modern narrow- and wide-body aircraft, including Boeing 737 MAXs and Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Oman Aviation Group, a government holding tasked with empowering Oman's aviation sector and enabling its tourism and logistics sectors, is focused on numerous investment initiatives that aim to attract more tourism and investment to the Sultanate. </p><h4>The National Tourism Strategy has designated 14 tourism clusters around Oman. What incentives or regulations have been created to encourage investments in these areas?</h4><p>We are currently implementing our 2040 Tourism Strategy with international consultants using global best practices. A key component of this strategy is the notion of “clusters." The strategy will be using five planning concepts, namely: tourism sites and attractions, clusters, resorts, and touristic zones of national interests and itineraries. One of the most important objectives the Oman Tourism Strategy seeks to achieve is an increasing contribution of the sector to GDP, in conjunction with the sustainable development process currently taking place in other economic sectors. The Ministry of Tourism realizes the key role tourism can play in enhancing the standard of living of Omanis across the country. Importantly, the government has special investor incentive schemes for mega projects.</p><h4>How does the ministry work in collaboration with other government institutions and the private sector to ensure its plans are in line with the market's needs?</h4><p>The ministry works with a steering committee via Tanfeedh. This committee comprises undersecretaries of various ministries as well as senior management from the private sector. This allows the Ministry of Tourism to work closely with other government institutions and stakeholders.</p><h4>How is the ministry planning to promote development of more affordable hotels and tourism options?</h4><p>The Ministry of Tourism has revamped licensing procedures to make it simple and speedy for interested players to consider Oman as an investment destination. A one-stop shop is now fully functional at the ministry, making application procedures hassle-free for all hotel categories. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the King Hussein Foundation's innovative and evolving approach to socio-economic development translated into successes for the country?</h4><p>The King Hussein Foundation was created to give an enduring life to King Hussein's humanitarian vision and legacy. We do that by focusing on equitable access to socioeconomic opportunity including health, education, microfinance, and cross-cultural programming, with an emphasis on women, youth, and marginalized groups in particular. The King Hussein Foundation was built, in part, on the sustainable development initiatives of the Noor Al Hussein Foundation going back nearly 40 years, and today includes eight institutions: the Jordan Micro Credit Company (Tamweelcom), Ethmar for Islamic Microfinance, the Institute for Family Health, the Community Development Program, the Jubilee Institute, the Information and Research Center, the National Center for Culture and Performing Arts, and the National Music Conservatory. All of these entities are characterized by a multidisciplinary approach to address challenges in their respective fields with what was initially a pioneering inclusive development methodology. This has been enabled by an emphasis on transparency, collaboration and national and regional capacity building—what I call our “open-source" approach. This means we have been sharing our expertise to the broadest extent possible, not only in Jordan, but in our programs in the wider west Asian region since the early 1980s. We rely on invaluable partnerships with the public and private sectors, as well as civil society and international organizations. These are vital, not only to our work and our ability to develop expertise, but to make use of it where most needed to address critical needs. In the early years, after my marriage, when trying to fill gaps in public and private sector development efforts, it become clear that in order to achieve real sustainable development, a more holistic or multidisciplinary approach might best maximize the use of our country's limited resources. This is exemplified in our comprehensive, integrated community development model, which achieved more effective improvements in healthcare, education, economic productivity through training, gender-balanced participatory decision making, and the provision of revolving loan funds managed by the communities themselves. This approach animates much of our programming today: blending education, healthcare, income-generating opportunities, entrepreneurship development and the protection of environmental resources.</p><h4>Is there a specific example that embodies this approach?</h4><p>Our Institute for Family Health, is a good example of our efforts to mainstream our development approach. It has evolved from being a local community family health center in 1986 into a national and regional comprehensive healthcare model with outreach around the country, working with local Jordanian communities, the public sector, displaced people and regional capacity building. Its strength derives from continuously adapting to emerging needs and requirements for expertise, not only in basic family health needs, but also in psycho-social services and trauma care for gender-based violence, child abuse and victims of war. This is a need that has increased with the influx of so many refugees entering our country. We have become specialized in a range of areas that we had not focused on initially. Recently, the Institute for Family Health has been contributing to the government's first anti-torture program by training judges and prosecutors dealing with trauma cases and equipping them with knowledge to best handle them. Ethmar for Islamic Microfinance is another example of how our initiatives evolve. Through Ethmar, we are filling the supply-demand gap for sharia-compliant microloans which we identified through the work of our first microfinance company Tamweelcom.</p><h4>Can you elaborate more on the King Hussein Foundation's two microfinance companies, Tamweelcom and Ethmar?</h4><p>The Noor Al Hussein Foundation and the King Hussein Foundation later did not start off with the financial endowments that most foundations launch with, or that most people assume foundations have. Our capital was our expertise and our early best practice programs, which drew in partners, both national and international. I call this our “best practices philanthropy". The seeds of the microfinance companies began with the revolving funds in the community projects we started in the early 1980s. The revolving loan funds were managed by men and women sitting together in isolated, sometimes impoverished pockets of the country, making decisions about their priorities and how the financial returns of any income-generating program would be distributed among the community. Most of those original funds are still active and providing support to their communities. We now have a total of 150 revolving loan funds around the country. Tamweelcom, established in 1999, is one of the foundation's significant success stories. It is a leading not-for-profit microfinance company in Jordan and the region, serving more than 90,000 clients with the purpose of integrating low income and productive communities into the mainstream economy, and to contribute to promoting entrepreneurship and closing the unemployment gap. Tamweelcom's mission has also evolved with the growing needs of local communities ranging from responsible finance to broad-based projects including green energy, home improvement, technology innovation and others. Our sensitivity to the evolving needs of the market has also prompted Tamweelcom to look into utilizing digital financial services to entrepreneurs in order to provide responsive and responsible credit at all times, wherever they may be located. Ethmar, which is over two years old, addressed the gap for services for people hesitant to take advantage of any kind of loan structure that is not sharia compliant. Ethmar has built an efficient micro finance model through diverse network of vendors and the utilization of technology and was awarded the 2018, Global Islamic Micro Forum Award for developing a financial tracking system for Islamic compliant loans. Again both companies also have pioneered holistic approaches to the field with an array of non-financial services and support to clients including educational support for our clients' children, mobile banking services, and health insurance. Our multidisciplinary development model is more effective than the conventional public and private sector partition of development fields throughout much of the world, and is one of the reasons we have been able to help develop capacity in human resources and specific programming over 22 countries in MENA and West Asia. We are trying to ensure that we have a ripple effect through our best practice programs, touching the lives of as many people as possible.</p><h4>What initiatives are you putting into place today to ensure that people are ready for the way the economy is developing?</h4><p>The King Hussein Foundation's programs are focused on levelling the playing field for our youth socially, educationally and economically. 50% of Tamweelcom's clients are under the age of 35. Our Community Development Program, for example, is integrating efforts with our two microfinance companies, to provide business training and incubation, reaching into different regions. This will enable maximum economic productivity among those who have not had such opportunities before. In expanding our work in the south, we have a program focused on women in micro- and small enterprises. This program is designed to address women and girls' social, educational, and financial needs, including business incubation. In addition to our specialized economic development programs, the mission of the Jubilee Institute, our primary education thrust, which includes the Jubilee School, is to maximize opportunities for public and private school teachers and scholarship students from diverse backgrounds to enable them to thrive in our rapidly changing world. Just as throughout all of the foundation's programs, our mission is to foster King Hussein's exemplary personal values throughout the educational process- curiosity and critical thinking, integrity and ethical values, humility and mutual respect, and a sense of social, national and global responsibility. The Jubilee School is focused not only on providing Jordanian scholarship students with an enhanced and enriched education experience, but also an emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs, without dismissing the importance of the arts. Incorporated into their schooling are entrepreneurship programs and community service. We are also trying to mainstream gender in every aspect including in national advocacy efforts through our Information and Research Center, which was founded to assist practitioners and decision makers to develop evidence based and effective socio-economic policies. King Hussein's approach to leadership and his public service stemmed from his most deeply held personal values. He sought to translate his humility, faith in his fellow man, and deep and abiding humanism into systems of governance that promoted human dignity, equitable opportunity, and justice. Our mission will continue to be to give enduring life to those commitments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is NTI's role in helping provide jobs to the oil and gas industry?</h4><p>The role of NTI is to develop the national workforce to bridge the gap between educational supply and the demands of the labour market. Being a vocational training provider, we constantly reach out to a large number of employers within the oil and gas sector to understand their needs and expectations and align our programs by following rigorous training needs analysis. This helps us customize our programs to industry needs and gain total customer satisfaction. We bridge this gap by acting as an enabler between job seekers, employers, and the training agency.</p><h4>How do you differ from other vocational training institutes?</h4><p>At NTI, we consider our clients as partners. We believe that effective partnership between the client and training provider is the key to total customer satisfaction. To ensure the effectiveness of this partnership, we engage with them at different stages and various levels of the training solution provision. These engagements help achieve the desired quality training outcomes of the program. What's more, we provide the best in class infrastructure, facilities, and services, far ahead of the competition.</p><h4>The enrolment for tertiary education or vocational training in Oman is around 8%. What needs to be done to improve the pipeline?</h4><p>Oman is at a much higher percentage compared to the rest of the GCC, especially in vocational training. However, a lot needs to be done to attract the Omani youth to entry-level jobs in various industry segments. Employers and various industry bodies should also contribute by giving due recognition and dignity to all jobs.</p><h4>How would you assess Omanization efforts thus far?</h4><p>These are certainly yielding the desired results, although much more needs to be done. The policies implemented to make private sector jobs attractive have remarkably improved the numbers in different sectors. However, the attrition is high at entry roles due to the lack of a structured training and development plan for new entrants; this needs to be addressed. Another challenge is the wage disparity; employing an expatriate worker becomes financially viable for the private sector compared to the cost of employing an Omani.   </p><h4>In which sectors do you foresee growth in demand for vocational training?</h4><p>Tourism and logistics will be the emerging sectors. Tourism is not our forte, though the supporting industries for tourism offer an opportunity for our courses. For example, construction for the tourism industry is booming, and, therefore, construction technicians, electricians, and welders are needed. Logistics is another area being heavily promoted; however, we have not seen much movement in training and employment in this segment as of yet. </p><h4>As a focus of Oman's diversification strategy, how will training follow manufacturing growth?</h4><p>The rate of Omanization in the manufacturing sector is low compared to other sectors. We are well placed to establish realistic partnerships with the employers in creating and delivering apprenticeship programs that have the right balance of both off- and on-the-job training and assessment. Another important area will be to support employers in creating a continual professional development framework for new entrants and supporting their training needs to reduce attrition.</p><h4>How prepared is NTI for regional expansion?</h4><p>We are constantly raising the bar with respect to the market needs and expectation. We have great infrastructure and systems in place, and we have the expertise, market knowledge, and a long history of training in the region. We are well prepared for expansion within the region if situations prove conducive. At present, our focus is on ensuring sustainable business operations within Oman. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the presence of international students in the system benefit Omani institutions? </h4><p>There are many advantages of having international students at higher education institutions in Oman. They help create more culturally diverse classrooms, and therefore learning environments that are more experiential in nature. They also bring in more funding for institutions. All these in turn improves the general quality of education. More international students also help create additional economic activity through a knock-on effect on local businesses. Both overseas students and academic staff are valuable resources in increasing the level of internationalization of higher education institutions. International and Omani students engage and interact with each other inside and outside of the classroom, which helps students to expand their horizons as they learn more about traditions, norms, and values of different cultures. Thanks to this experiential learning experience, our students will develop indispensable intercultural communication and international skills that they will need to hold their own in an increasingly globalized economy.</p><h4>How does the ministry work in partnership with the Oman Academic Accreditation Authority (OAAA) to establish standards and generally improve the quality of higher education?  </h4><p>First, I would like to underline that quality assurance is our priority. The Ministry of Higher Education strives to ensure quality through a number of strategies, including auditing by the OAAA, advocacy of best practice by the Oman Quality Network in Higher Education (OQNHE), and guidance, monitoring and inspections performed by the ministry. OAAA is charged with assisting in the development of the country's higher education sector through institutional accreditation, which includes quality audits, as well as thorough academic program accreditation processes. Furthermore, the OAAA and ministry work with international experts and representatives from Oman's higher education institutions. Undoubtedly, a major challenge facing Oman as a rapidly developing country lies in higher education institutions not being able to timely respond to new developments. In 2015, the Strategic Plan 2020 for the Colleges of Applied Sciences and College of Education in Al Rustaq was implemented, helping institutes become even more responsive institutions with job-ready graduates. The Strategic Plan 2020, which is in line with the Strategic Plan for the Education Sector, consists of policies and 40 mechanisms, whose aim is to further improve the quality of education offered by the colleges.</p><h4>How does the ministry stay in touch with the private sector to determine which sectors of the economy have the most jobs in demand?</h4><p>The ministry aims for students to study in areas that have been identified as national priorities and have potential for economic growth. Oman's scholarship students are meant to develop the knowledge and skills required for the development and diversification of the economy. In 2015, the ministry established the Graduate Survey Department, which evaluates how well prepared graduates are for the job market in terms of knowledge, competencies, and skills. Recent results show that many of the graduates who participated in the survey have been employed by the private sector in the areas of engineering, business, and information technology. The Graduate Survey department highlights areas according to demand, and valuable data that is used by many entities, including a research team that puts together the annual plan for undergraduate scholarships. One way to help students develop skills is through work placements or internships. In 2018, an online training portal was established to allow higher education institutions and companies to communicate in view of providing on-the-job training opportunities for students.</p><h4>What are the ministry's primary objectives over the next 12 months?</h4><p>Examples of the ministry's primary objectives are to further build a positive work environment and foster productivity through the implementation of the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) criteria; to offer scholarships at the undergraduate and graduate level in areas of study deemed relevant to the needs of the diversifying economy; further update the ministry's electronic information systems and enhance electronic services; further streamline payment processes by moving toward a paperless payment processing system; further tailor the ministry's customer services to the needs of the public; and further improve the quality of education in Oman. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[One Hospital for All]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[one-hospital-for-all]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How many hospitals does the group manage within Oman and the Gulf region?</h4><p>United Medical has planned, managed, developed, commissioned, and operated hospitals and healthcare projects in over 25 countries including the UK, Middle East, and Far East since 1973. The success of United Medical in delivering high quality services led to the British government, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and other development agencies awarding United Medical several contracts worldwide. Our model with new projects is that wherever we operate, we offer innovative and cost-effective solutions by implementing quality standards and driving efficiencies and effectiveness. The group has always been a leader in bringing in the latest technologies and advancements, such as advanced imaging modalities like 3 Tesla MRI, 128 Slice CT Scans, Cardiac scans, and Cath Lab interventions that benefit patients. We operate in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, and the UK. The infrastructure for all these centers is different, though our biggest infrastructure investments to date have been in Muscat and Saudi. We built and manage the Muscat Private Hospital (MPH), the first private hospital in Oman. The MPH brand has been well known across Oman as a premium brand with quality and trust for over 18 years. We are the first custom-built greenfield private healthcare project with all services under one roof.</p><h4>What are the key differentiators between MPH and its competitors?</h4><p>It is the first custom-built private hospital and is a one-stop shop for all healthcare needs. It has the largest number of departments compared to other hospitals in the private sector and the highest number of skilled medical staff compared to any other private organization. We are the first center to have JCI accreditation, the gold standard of healthcare quality across the globe. We are still developing and adjusting our capacities, as the group has moved into different areas of healthcare service offerings. We found certain gaps in our service delivery that we predict will be necessary in the coming five to six years with the aging population and increase in chronic patients due to life-style changes. We are looking at the gaps in the private sector and determining how we can complement the entire healthcare system so that patients can receive end-to-end treatment rather than having to travel overseas for better treatment. MPH can easily complement and support the Ministry of Health in reducing the shortage of acute care beds as we have developed infrastructure that can act as a backup support. Equally important, we have started working with the Ministry of Health to handle expat emergency cases which put pressure on government beds. The Ministry of Health is encouraging more and more private participation in healthcare deliveries, helping MPH to pursue lucrative projects in the future. </p><h4>How do you see the new health insurance law shaping the health industry in Oman?</h4><p>It started in phases over the last two or three years, and the majority of the population is getting insured without any problems. During these tough economic times, the prime motive of leadership teams in companies is controlling costs. Issues arise when companies cut down on costs and their insurance premiums fall, as payers want to control loss ratios, and providers are paid less. To have a win-win scenario for all stakeholders, we require a regulatory framework with different types of insurance plans so that quality can be controlled with standard pricing. The pricing mechanism should be one-on-one, with payer companies based on previous track record, the quality of team and services, and infrastructure support.</p><h4>What are your primary objectives for the next 12 months?</h4><p>Our objective is clear: we want to be the leading healthcare player in Oman in terms of quality, value, and patient experience. The brand has created trust among the local community and is perceived as a one-stop shop for everything. Now, we need to continue to meet these expectations in terms of infrastructure, service quality, clinical outcomes, and adapting to the latest smart technologies. We will satisfy patients and communities using digital technology to create a dynamic healthcare system across all ages and by offering round-the-clock services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the operating model for Royal Hospital differ compared to private hospitals?</h4><p>The operation model of the RH differs in many ways. First, it operates as a highly specialized public tertiary care provider for the whole country, while also working as a secondary care hospital for the capital. We are a not-for-profit service and our mandate covers the entire population of the Sultanate. Second, the service is provided based on a national healthcare delivery matrix of institutions connected by an electronic referral system. The care is provided free of charge for Omani citizens and to non-Omani citizens if they are employed by the government. Third, the hospital supports other non-Omani residents of Oman when specific services are not available in the private healthcare sector, albeit this category of patients represents only 4 to 5%. Finally, the hospital outsources services that are needed but not available in-house such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, immunological essays, and other highly specialized genetic and biochemical laboratory tests. </p><h4>How are you independent from the Ministry of Health, and in what ways does it guide your operations?</h4><p>RH is the only health service provider within the Ministry of Health's structure to be under the minister's office directly. It is governed by a board chaired by the minister of health with membership of leaders from the hospital and the Ministry of Health. The board creates the vision and strategic objectives for the hospital and sets in place the hospital policies, values, and long-term planning. As a result, the hospital has a significant degree of human resources and budgetary autonomy and makes its own decisions about employment and how to allocate expenditures; however, certain procedures of tendering and financing large projects are governed by the Ministry of Health.  </p><h4>Which services has the hospital seen increasing demand for, and how are you working to increase your capacity in response?</h4><p>With the rapid growth in population, life expectancy, and increased survival of patients with chronic conditions, the health system in Oman is confronted with the challenge of increasing demand for the care of chronic non-communicable diseases. These require chronic follow-up to provide preventive and curative services through outpatient, inpatient, and day-care services. The hospital had to continue expanding these services several fold over the years. Some of the RH's departments have evolved to be highly specialized semi-autonomous national centers.  As of now, apart from the several tertiary care clinical services housed within the main hospital, the RH's complex operates a National Heart Centre (NHC), a National Oncology Centre (NOC), a National diabetes and Endocrinology Centre (NEDC), a National Genetic Centre (NGC), and the National Hyperbaric Medicine Centre (NHMC). The departments and services of the hospital play a major role in adapting to increasing and changing demands. The hospital incorporates process optimization using continual improvement LEAN methodology to improve safety, quality, and productivity to deliver high-value services for the community. The hospital has also been a pioneer in introducing transformative efforts that have started to show success in creating a culture of continuous improvement. RH prioritizes improving clients' experience and thrives to provide a client-centered care. This approach will result in further quantitative and qualitative improvements in the services we provide for the community and a deeper engagement and integration with other healthcare providers. </p><h4>What are your primary objectives over the next 12 months?</h4><p>The hospital will execute a strategy to enhance a culture of quality and people-centered care. To achieve this, we adopted a strategy to build high performing and effective leadership capacity and established a framework of leadership competency model for RH's current and future leaders. These efforts will not only result in improving the client experience in the short to mid term, but will also result in a sustainable culture and establish systems in which RH's clients will be part of all planning and decision-making activities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the Ministry of Health's (MOH) primary health concerns and resulting priorities?</h4><p>During the past two to three decades, the Sultanate of Oman has witnessed, as other parts of the world, an epidemiological transition to non-communicable diseases and other morbidity-related unhealthy life-style behaviors. Most communicable diseases have declined to endemic levels, while non-communicable diseases and other conditions related to changes in life-style behaviors are on the rise. For example, in 2017, approximately 40% of inpatients were treated for non-communicable diseases, while the communicable diseases patients represented only 17.2%. This transition resulted in the predominance cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and chronic respiratory and renal diseases. These require advanced and expensive technologies and medicines for diagnosis and treatment, draining the health system budget. They are the main concern, at least for the near future, together with sustaining health gains especially in controlling communicable diseases. </p><h4>How does MOH's most recent health plan address these concerns?</h4><p>The epidemiologic and demographic transition described, together with the people's expectations and worldwide advances in technology, have necessitated revising the health system. The aim is to strengthen the health system to face future changes, which is a challenge, as predicting the future of healthcare delivery can be fraught with uncertainty and risk, especially with the number of determinants that affect healthcare, whether demographic, political, economic, social, technological, environmental, or legal. With that in mind, the MOH developed its long-term vision Health Vision 2050. The ninth Five-Year Health Development Plan (2016-2020) is the first out of seven health development plans to adopt and implement visions and strategic actions of the Health Vision 2050. Its development, implementation, and follow-up have been institutionalized, such that each Directorate General with its directorates and departments bear the full responsibility for achieving their objectives. These objectives include sustaining and further developing achievements in primary health care and equipping it with the means to screen for early detection of non-communicable diseases, and care for the elderly. The ninth plan also targets further developing specialized and tertiary healthcare to ensure the availability of highly specialized and well-trained health personnel. This was done through re-visiting the health profession's education strategies and adopting them according to future needs and expected future technological advancements. A national committee for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases was developed and the committee has inaugurated its national plan to face the challenges from non-communicable diseases.</p><h4>What role should the private sector play when operating alongside public hospitals?</h4><p>The private health sector has been slowly growing in Oman. It provides all types of different levels of curative medical services through clinics, centers, polyclinics, and hospitals. Private health establishments include 1,215 clinics and 17 hospitals with 725 hospital beds as of YE2017. These are run by a total of 12,366 health workers, of which 2,340 are doctors (50% specialists), 982 dentists, 1,795 pharmacists, 3,799 nurses, and the remaining are other paramedical staff and administrators. In addition to the existing specialists, a number of specialist consultants visit the Sultanate through private centers, polyclinics, and hospitals to provide consultations and highly specialized treatments that have significantly reduced the number of patients seeking medical treatment abroad.</p><h4>How does the ministry work with WHO and other international organizations to push for global initiatives?</h4><p>We work effectively with WHO to address a number of priorities related to improving Oman's health sector. For example, we are working together to develop a country cooperation strategy (CCS) that reflects a medium-term vision of WHO for technical cooperation with Oman. It aims to allow WHO to provide technical support to the health system in Oman in a coherent manner to address its own priorities and challenges and implement global initiatives. Similarly, the partnership with UNICEF in health development is being implemented through successive Country Program Action plans. This partnership has played a vital role in achieving commendable health outcomes especially in the health of children and women in priority areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main achievements and successes that you are proud of as CEO of KLC?</h4><p>Our biggest success was to find small delivery friendly locations across different areas in Kuwait that met our requirements. We set up our first restaurant in 2009 that delivered to several nearby areas; now we cover nearly 90% of the areas in Kuwait across all of our eight brands. We have been able to fully utilize these locations and operate several brands from the same area efficiently. A key factor has been to deliver using a combination of our own fleet and a third party, which has improved our overall efficiency significantly. We did this to better utilize our kitchens. A lot of things have happened along the way as the market has matured to the point of saturation, so now it is about continuously improving the quality of our product and service whilst offering the best prices.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your positive work culture?</h4><p>Each and every one of our team members has played an important role in developing this company. We continuously strive to recruit people that complement our hard working and dedicated team and we strongly believe in creating a positive, fair and friendly working environment whereby each team member's opinion matters. All our managers have an open-door policy and everyone is encouraged to get involved and contribute to improving the business.</p><h4>What strategies did you find during expansion that helped you reduce operational costs?</h4><p>As the business grew and so did our costs, specifically in the head office and marketing. Several departments had to be set up to manage this expansion which eventually encouraged us to continue our expansion across the country. These costs encouraged us to expand faster to bring in more revenue and also have a higher contribution towards our head office and our marketing resources. As we expanded we were able to hire more experienced personal who supported us in expanding more efficiently.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans and goals for the coming year?</h4><p>We have recently opened a large central kitchen in Jahra and are working on several new concepts targeting underserved cuisines such as breakfast, dessert, and fried chicken in specific areas in Kuwait. We are also studying the opportunity of expanding our brands across the GCC.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What motivated your decision to relocate your activity from France to Kuwait in 2001?</h4><p>FAME Co moved to Kuwait in 2001 with the objective to commercially represent French food brands in Kuwait and help them find local distributors. Since then, our activity has shifted, and we directly commercialize brands through the horeca market as well as our different retail channels: FAME Co online shopping and Oh! Petit Fame boutique. FAME Co furthermore specializes in the field of pastry/baker and chocolate. Because of the origin and the high quality of products we offer, we have witnessed a great reception from local customers. In addition, we place an emphasis on constantly bringing new and trendier items such as freeze dried items, which are experiencing growing demand. Finally, we now have our own Chef event called “Pastry Live and Beyond", organized every two years and where we offer consulting services also provided by our Chef. Nonetheless, it can be challenging for a foreign SME to get established in Kuwait. In order to register a company, it is mandatory to have a local partner or sponsor. Even though there are institutions such as Kuwait Investment Promotion Authority (KDIPA) to help foreign investors in Kuwait, its solutions fit the needs of bigger corporations. Therefore, it is important for the country to find ways to facilitate the investment of SMEs in Kuwait.</p><h4>What challenges did you encounter in terms of regulations and standards when importing French products in Kuwait?</h4><p>Kuwait is a market with great potential; however, it is important to be extremely organized and have extensive understanding of the regulations and forbidden items. For example, it is compulsory for any importer to have two samples per product to show at customs. It is also extremely important to properly label in Arabic all compulsory details as well as the production and expiration dates. In that sense, Kuwait is more complicated than certain markets such as Bahrain and the UAE. Because of our local expertise, it is paramount to have a clearing agent who makes sure that the samples are given to the Baladiya. If Kuwait wants to boost its import market, it is essential for the country to increase the efficiency of customs and its authority.</p><h4>What shift in consumers' behavior have you witnessed?</h4><p>As far as our field is concerned, Kuwait is leaning more toward a European market in terms of taste buds and demands. There is a growing number of health-conscious people in Kuwait. In mid-2018, we started with a line of <em>superfood </em>that I personally want to include in the world of pastries. In five to 10 years, Kuwait will definitely be more Europeanized than Americanized in terms of taste buds. Customers want more quality and have a growing awareness of what is beneficial for their health. This will provide a great deal of opportunities, especially for French companies. In fact, FAME Co offers trendsetting ingredients for pastries and chocolate making that are of high quality and extremely healthy. We are also close to our targeted market and the chefs that are the primary consumers of our brands. They are the ones transforming the raw material into something unique, and that also educates local consumers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does OFIC manage a balance between domestic production of crops and imports?</h4><p>The major governing factor that affects our hay production is water. Oman faces water scarcity and good quality water is typically used for municipal consumers; what OFIC has to look at is marginal water. There are marginal water aquifers in parts of the country where certain types of crops can be grown. However, a proper assessment has to be carried out and resources managed wisely to make sure that we do not deplete the aquifers. There are areas in Oman where green fodder is currently being produced and the big question is to what level we want this to continue and to what extent the country's current agricultural areas can be expanded. We have to work closely with suppliers to maintain an equilibrium whereby we can address our fodder needs, but still preserve the ecosystem. Some areas in Oman can freely produce some of our needs; however, we see imports of feed as a major and important aspect of OFIC's operations. <br>To manage and understand this from a value chain point of view, we have to address the sources for imported green fodder. We are currently looking at various options including South Africa, the Americas, Spain, Australia, and elsewhere to check the viability, availability, and price. For example, for North American or Spanish sources, it is important to check freshness, moisture, protein, and nutrient levels; it is vital to make sure that cows are receiving the right feed. Afterward, it is equally significant to look at the whole value chain from the sources to where the fodder is delivered. This is a massive operation that involves working closely with various types of freight movers and logistics companies to ensure we get the right product. Oman currently imports meat from across the world, and OFIC is addressing that by setting up a big operation in Thumrait, Dhofar through Al Bashayer Meat, a company that specializes in producing red meat. Similarly, that operation has to be assessed from the value chain perspective because the sources where these animals are available in abundance are places such as East Africa, Brazil, Argentina, and Australia. The transportation involves sensitive issues like animal welfare, choosing the right feed, herd management, disease control, and quarantine systems. We have to ensure that whatever is produced in the market is produced to the highest standards and can compete with imports. You also have to address local tastes, such as meeting proper Halal Supply Chain (HSC) and animal welfare standards. Overall, it is a highly complex and multifaceted operation.</p><h4>In 2018, OFIC signed an MoU with Oman Global Logistics Group (Asyad) to collaborate on transportation within Oman. What initiatives are you hoping to see as a result?</h4><p>Under this collaboration between Asyad and OFIC, we are working to address Oman's food security and export goals from a multifaceted perspective. Together, we look at Oman's competitive and comparative advantages and how it can benefit as a food hub. We see the Gulf as an immediate market, but beyond that Oman is connected with various maritime routes, especially countries around the Indian Ocean, East and North Africa, and Russia, and China through the Silk Road. Moreover, since Oman is located close to India and Sri Lanka, it is well positioned to address their food needs and serve as a storage facility for their food. </p><h4>What future projects is OFIC considering?</h4><p>There are a number of studies being conducted now for the creation of new projects, including a study on a food technology park, a project on fish canning for tuna and sardines, and a project on vaccinations that is nearing completion. We would like to see these project ideas converted into legal entities by YE2018 or early 2019. In 2019, we might be at the stage of recruiting the right people to manage these companies and prepare the blueprints for building various projects at various sites. OFIC's success in promoting major food projects and recent rise in competitiveness index of Oman confirm the attractiveness of the investment ecosystem. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the ministry working to promote commercial fishing vessels?</h4><p>We launched a plan for commercial fisheries at the beginning of 2018, and we changed the way we look at private sector applications for vessels. We now have a Service Level Agreement that requires the ministry to inform the company about its application decision within four weeks. The committee now meets every month and determines if the companies satisfy the requirements to receive the commercial license. We have a plan to launch a total of 200 vessels of different classes over the next five years, including both purse seiners and long liners, and have one trial permit for pelagic trawling. The idea is to harness the Indian Ocean resources of tuna and small pelagic, which is currently beyond the reach of our local fisherpersons. This is an important move for the ministry.</p><h4>How has the Omani tuna fishing capacity in the Indian Ocean increased over the last three years?</h4><p>We have witnessed a huge landing of tuna over the last three years; the catch for Oman jumped from 5,000-6,000 tons to 18,000-20,000 tons of tuna. This could be due to the recovery of the stock in the ocean or a change of migration toward Omani waters, as there are many players in the Indian Ocean fishing from the same resource. We are trying to harness the opportunity but want to do it with the governing body—the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission—because we have to work with it closely to ensure tuna stocks are not overfished.</p><h4>What investments and development need to happen in order for fish to be processed and exported correctly?</h4><p>We have excellent infrastructure in Oman, with solid investments from the government and the private sector. We have 38 processing plants that are approved by the EU in terms of quality standards, and many others are waiting to be certified. We currently have fresh tuna exported directly from Sur fish market to many European cities using Oman Air, and we also use other airlines such as Emirates and Qatar. The industry is ready to receive any quantity, and there is investment in the pipeline for more factories with an application for a huge tuna canning, sardine canning, fish meal, and processing plants for value-added products.</p><h4>How is the ministry promoting aquaculture developments?</h4><p>We have a plan to produce around 100,000 tons from aquaculture farms by 2023. The first project started with seabream cage offshore farming similar to the Mediterranean farms that have started exporting to Dubai and Saudi Arabia. We have two more projects for shrimp, each with a 3,000-ton capacity, and construction for both will start before end-2018. Moreover, we have one abalone farm that is under construction and are planning to farm other species such as tilapia using freshwater/brackish water in ponds or aquaponics systems integrated with agriculture farms. For example, Tilapia production jumped from less than 2 tons in 2014 to more than 80 tons by 3Q2018, and we expect 2018 to end with 100 tons. Aquaculture will truly offset any decline in the wild stock and will solve seasonality, as aquaculture can supply the market all-year round and ensure quality products as required by international markets. It will also employ many Omanis, which is one of the main objectives of these developments along with diversification and balance of trade and exports, all of which will help the Omani economy to grow and be sustainable.</p><h4>Are you integrating SMEs into the development of the fisheries sector?</h4><p>One farm needs more than 40 services; it needs divers, net suppliers, feed suppliers, and so on, so SMEs have a huge opportunity to support commercial farming, which is why we work with the Public Authority for SME Development. Typically, companies will seek small workshops to fabricate equipment or cage maintenance. We try to link SMEs with commercial farms, which is a great way forward for SMEs to develop in Oman. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Colombia’s Creative Sector]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jose-manuel-restrepo-abondano-minister-of-commerce-industry-tourism]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What sectors of the industry and economy have the most potential for growth in 2019?</h4><p>Colombia has the potential for growth according to the new policies of this new government, which is pro-private initiative and pro-industrial and firm development. The government understands the importance of building new firms for this country and attracting more investment for the country to not only increase growth but also build such equity to generate employment and build inclusive growth for the country. There are many sectors that the country will develop in the coming years. The tourism sector has grown by double digits in the last four years and attracts millions of international visitors. The sector is growing in terms of domestic tourism and takes advantage of Colombia's most important assets: our biodiversity, beaches, sun, and the growth in events and convention tourism. Adventure tourism and environmental tourism are also rapidly growing. However, there are many ways to further develop this sector. Another important sector for Colombia is the creative or orange economy. It takes advantage of the most important asset of this country, namely our human capital. The quality, perseverance, resilience, and creativity of our human talent sets Colombia apart from other countries in the world. The creative economy includes traditional sectors such as music, arts, design, fashion, architecture, gastronomy, and even tourism. The sector currently represents approximately 3.8% of GDP, and we expect it to grow to 5% in the coming four years. Another key sector is industry. Areas particularly in metal mechanical and auto parts, as well as in plastics and other sectors, have developed significantly in terms of productivity and competitiveness. Industry is also growing considerably in terms of exports. In December 2018, industry growth in exports was almost 5%, and we expect this to continue in the medium term.</p><h4>How can the ministry help develop a mentality and a culture of entrepreneurship in Colombia?</h4><p>Something that is different in this country is the courage in our entrepreneurs; the global entrepreneurship index highlighted Colombia as a country with a great deal of potential. We have the organization iNNpulsa to further develop entrepreneurship. Every year, we hold the most important meeting of entrepreneurs called Heroes Fest, and 2018 saw the highest-ever number of attendees. We develop this mentality and culture by holding meetings, discussions, and clusters of entrepreneurs in different regions of Colombia and promoting them. We also give them the opportunity to obtain seed capital to develop their ideas. To further organize the ecosystem of entrepreneurship, we work with institutions such as Fondo Emprender and others focused on entrepreneurship. We have to segment the policy, as sustainable entrepreneurship is different from opportunity entrepreneurship or high-value entrepreneurship. We are developing a process of segmentation of the policy of entrepreneurship in the country. Another important issue is providing enough capital to entrepreneurs. We are considering the possibility of attracting more risk and venture capitals. In this way, we are combining public and private partnership to promote entrepreneurs and provide enough seed capital, risk capital, and venture capital and support them. We expect to attract around USD500 million in the next four years and plan to do so by working with Innpulsa, Fondo Emprender, and other entrepreneurship funds in Colombia combined with the assistance of the Bank of Foreign Trade (Bancóldex) and other similar organizations in the government.</p><h4>Which sectors of the economy are currently the most important for Colombia's export economy?</h4><p>We have three strategies in our trade policy that was in the national council of trade: taking advantage of current free trade agreements, facilitation of commerce, and legal and loyal commerce. We have a great opportunity to benefit from the many FTAs that Colombia has signed. In terms of the sectors, we want to boost agro and agroindustry products, especially in the EU, where we have almost full access to our agro products immediately. We have other opportunity in terms of industry, for example in terms of confectionary. Other important sectors include metal mechanical and auto, plane, and boat parts; plastics; and services. We have to open new markets and continue our negotiations with Asian countries and associated nations in the Pacific Alliance to take more advantage of inter-Pacific Alliance commerce. We should also start opening partial agreements with African and Caribbean countries, which are important in terms of buying food and agro products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Al Tasnim hope to capture further projects in Duqm?</h4><p>As a pioneer of innovation in the cement products industry, Al Tasnim's cement division has established itself as a premier supplier of cement products and services. We hold a substantial market share in the Muscat region with a robust and dedicated taskforce earmarked for each project. We have proactively set up three batching plants and mobilized our resources along with an experienced group of personnel to cater to the customized needs of our clients in Duqm. We have been supplying high grade concrete across Oman over the last four decades and are recognized as a quality concrete supplier. We are also one of the leading producers of asphalt in Oman; our plant in Duqm produces 200 tons per hour. We are excited about the business prospects in the Duqm area and are committed to the region's development.</p><h4>What is Al Tasnim's strategy for participating in the development of high-growth sectors such as tourism and transportation?</h4><p>Al Tasnim has been a dynamic participant in bolstering the tourism and transportation sectors in the Sultanate and has been instrumental in creating some of the major integrated tourism complexes (ITCs) such as Al Mouj as well as the Redevelopment of Ras Al Hamra for PDO. We have also contributed significantly to the many prestigious hotels, such as the upcoming W Hotel and Shangri-La Barr Al Jissah Resort &amp; Spa. We offer premium end-to-end solutions, beginning with the initial work on barren land to the final shaping of resorts and hotels. In the transportation sector, our roads and infrastructure division has built a solid reputation, winning client appreciation that spurs the group toward further success. Our commitment to quality and safety regardless of the challenges is unwavering and paramount with respect to each one of our endeavors. </p><h4>What are the main initiatives and strategies to contribute to and further develop ICV in the Sultanate?</h4><p>Our group constantly endeavors to meet and exceed its ICV commitments. In line with Oman's vision to promote the growth of SMEs, Al Tasnim works closely with nearly 50 SMEs. We have also gone one step further by establishing a mentorship program for SMEs. Interested SMEs are screened, and, once selected, Al Tasnim mentors the selected companies to set up operations by providing structured assistance on recruitment, financing, and periodic performance monitoring to ensure they are profitable within a two-year period. The group is currently mentoring two SMEs. We were recently given an award by the Oman Economic Review (OER) for 'Supporting National Efforts to Recruit and Develop Omani Cadres.' It gives me pleasure to state that the group is on track to exceed its ICV target for 2018 and 2019.</p><h4>What are the group's objectives for 2019 and vision for the country over the next three to five years?</h4><p>From a small family business to a full-fledged organization with more than 30,000 employees, Al Tasnim has contributed and stands committed to the Sultanate's growth and economic diversification. A key area of expansion is our fabrication and manufacturing facilities in Misfah, spread over 15,000sqm. The group is also developing capabilities in upstream oil and gas and downstream EPC projects. Additionally, with increased focus on green and sustainable energy, the group is widening its offerings in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and emissions control. We are running an initiative called 'Project 10 10,' which aims to grow our organization 10-fold in 10 years. We desire to achieve this growth in all aspects, such as employee satisfaction, turnover, and client satisfaction.</p><h4>What techniques or innovations differentiate Al Tasnim's work from its competitors?</h4><p>Each project we undertake is augmented by intensive research by our in-house resources and knowledge data bank. All processes at Al Tasnim are integrated as a result of the digitalization of our entire operations. Equally important, we are steadfast in our mission to take the right steps toward following superior practices in managing and developing human resources. Our highly skilled workforce, together with state-of-the-art infrastructure and technology, delivers premium quality performance every time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[on-top-of-trends]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a company already diversified across several industries, how will Alfardan benefit from the initiatives of Tanfeedh?</h4><p>As one of the leading family-owned business enterprises in the region that focuses on luxury and high-end markets, Alfardan Group fully supports Oman's key policies and long-term development plans, which include diversifying the local economy to provide its citizens and residents with quality and prosperous life. Tanfeedh, which seeks to reinforce public-private partnerships (PPPs) in areas of national importance such as manufacturing, tourism, transport and logistics, mining, and fisheries, is a unique opportunity for us to further strengthen our ties and ongoing collaboration with relevant government entities to help achieve not only our business objectives but, more importantly, the fundamental goals of the government as well. Promoting open communication and dialog to effectively overcome identified challenges, the initiative also allows us to be continuously part of the country's journey toward a more sustainable future.</p><h4>How are you projecting the market reception to the opening of Alfardan's newest mixed-use property in Oman?</h4><p>We are confident of a positive market response to our ongoing mixed-use project on the Sultan Qaboos Highway located near the Muscat International Airport. Upon completion, the sprawling 100,000-sqm development will feature luxury residential apartments, office spaces, and showrooms designed to cater to the specific needs of the local market. Prospective occupants will also be impressed by the unique blend of traditional Omani architecture and the key elements of contemporary design. Furthermore, we are optimistic that our project will set new benchmarks for the domestic real estate sector as well as help boost Oman's economy. This project is being developed against the backdrop of Oman's dramatic transformation that is giving rise to immense opportunities across sectors, including real estate. Analysts expect Oman's GDP to increase by up to 5.2% this year, thanks in part to the introduction of natural gas production at the Khazzan gas field and the opening of the new airport. Stable political and economic systems, transparent legal systems, and investor-friendly rules are driving the country's growth as well. All these will play a pivotal role in the success of our mixed-use property development in Oman.</p><h4>Finaa Alazaibah is one of the largest mixed-use properties in Oman. How do you see this sector developing in the next five years? </h4><p>The demand for mixed-use developments in the next five years will expand even further given Oman's urban density. The trend is continuously shifting toward combining retail and commercial offerings with sectors or services that are traditionally not part of the mix. This is usually the result of changing customer expectations and demands, among others. The rising necessity for mixed-used projects highlights the need for constant innovation in terms of concepts and designs. We expect leading property developers to respond to these modern changes and requirements, which is why we, at Alfardan, constantly work to be on top of upcoming trends and easily adapt to the ever-changing demands of the sector.</p><h4>Within real estate, what trends or innovations does Alfardan see as most promising to the industry?</h4><p>Next-generation technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and 3D printing are expected to have a massive impact on the real estate sector in the coming years. Modern innovations will definitely disrupt the entire industry and bring the real estate sector to unimaginable heights. We are excited to see where these technologies will take the whole sector. </p><h4>Which sectors do you hope to focus on or expand into in 2018 and beyond?</h4><p>Alfardan Group will continue to strengthen its presence in various sectors where it currently operates in by consistently delivering high-quality, innovative, and luxurious products. Focusing on property developments, including Finaa Alazaibah and other premium projects, and the flourishing automotive industry, for example, will surely reinforce our position not only in the Middle Eastern market but also in big markets such as Turkey, where we are eyeing to bring our signature luxury brands. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has growth in the healthcare market benefited the design and engineering industry?</h4><p>Government hospitals and clinics are continuously expanding, and the private healthcare sector is also booming. In the last few years, the private healthcare sector has expanded rapidly. The existing international hospital management groups are opening new hospitals and clinics, and new healthcare groups are also entering Oman in a big way. Government hospitals provide free treatment to the Omani citizens, and usually have long waiting queues. Expats have limited access to government hospitals and clinics. It is also mandatory for companies to provide healthcare cover for their expat employees. All of this increases the demand for private hospitals and clinics in the country. Any new healthcare developments require a local design consultant on board—if not for the design, is for local authority approvals. This adds value to the design and engineering industry, making healthcare a huge sector for the design consultants to benefit from.</p><h4>How will the introduction of real estate investment trusts (REITs) in Oman impact Design Unit Engineering?</h4><p>The introduction of REITs will add possibilities for more large-scale developments in the country, which will benefit Design Unit Engineering. Currently, the expat population is allowed to buy property in limited areas. REITs will allow many people who are living here to start investing in real estate, which will lead to the launch of some quality real estate projects. The prospects of ownership will bring in newer developments and will create more work for Design Unit Engineering. We will be able to develop better designs and facilities, instead of just constructing standalone buildings with limited facilities.</p><h4>Do you predict growth in mixed-use buildings in Oman?</h4><p>I think mixed-use developments is the way to go. A successful example is Al Mouj, which has become a highly popular destination for both locals and expats. These developments are of good quality, giving the residence a sense of community. People also enjoy coming here to retire because of the safety, security, and the excellent quality of life, which increases the demand for good-quality, mixed-use developments. With all this in mind, I am sure there will be growth in mixed-use developments around Oman.</p><h4>What benefits do SMEs receive from the Omani government?</h4><p>The government incentivizes working with SMEs. For example, some large projects require a certain percentage of smaller, local Omani companies to be involved alongside multinational contractors. For public-sector megaprojects, the government insists that a certain percentage of sub-contracting work should go to local SMEs. Design Unit Engineering is an SME, and this has added value to its business. One of the main advantages is the ease of getting work permits. In addition, we are given an advantage to work with international consultants on large scale projects, and become architects on record.</p><h4>What are your objectives at Design Unit Engineering for the coming 12 months?</h4><p>On the management side, we seek to match our standards to those of international consultants so that we can compete with them as a 100% Omani company. We are an ISO 9001:2015-certified company, and have developed some strong processes in the organization, which have improved our quality standards. We look to add new services to our organization, and become a one-stop shop for our clients. We have also been moving toward sustainable designs, which adds a lot of value to our projects, and will continue doing so. Our vision is to continue setting higher standards in the market and raising the benchmark for local consultants in Oman. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Who was your target demographic when designing the Ghadeer Parks Townhouses and Juman Two Apartments?</h4><p>We hold 75% of the market share of freehold sold properties in Oman; such strong performance could not have been achieved without a deep understanding of the customer's needs. Ghadeer Parks Townhouses target the growing young families with its three-bedroom homes, which includes a uniquely designed courtyard where the family can enjoy an indoor park and create a fun and memorable experience every day. With the Ghadeer precinct itself, we will be creating a place where residents can not only live an urban lifestyle but enjoy the unique spaces that allow for social interaction between residents as well as the opportunity for a healthier and active life. It will include a central park with a running creek, toddlers park, community hub, a mosque, community pools, and a proposed international school, making it a prime example of our commitment at Al Mouj Muscat to provide unparalleled experiences. Juman Two is our most recent marina front apartment product release, and it comes in line with the increasing demand we are witnessing for exclusive waterfront properties in Oman. The apartments have been designed to augment the lifestyle of the residents. The project offers luxury marina living along with exclusive finishes and world class amenities. Juman Two is a reflection of what it means to live in the most exclusive address in Oman.</p><h4>What was the vision for Marza Plaza?</h4><p>Marza Plaza is the first public square built by a private developer in Oman; it is a masterpiece in urban design with traditional Omani architectural influences. As public spaces play a significant role in the social life of communities, this modern interpretation of a town square gives residents and visitors a unique space to gather and enjoy a world-class lifestyle. Marsa Plaza quickly became a perfect setting and platform for Oman's diverse artists to showcase their works, sharing and celebrating our rich culture with both visitors and residents. In addition to culturally connecting people, a year-round public outdoor space like ours also encourages healthier lifestyles and promotes happiness and quality time spent together among families and friends. Moving forward, we will anchor it with two international F&amp;B outlets and small local SMEs by offering various new kiosk concepts; therefore, we can further enrich the experience.</p><h4>How is Al Mouj Muscat planning to expand its hotel capacity?</h4><p>Al Mouj Muscat is an integrated tourism complex (ITC). The tourism aspect is thus an integral part and is one of the main reasons the government has been establishing the ITC projects to unlock the huge potential of our tourism industry. We have aggressive plans in the tourism sector and are located at the heart of Muscat and close to the state-of-the-art Muscat International Airport. We successfully opened Mysk Al Mouj by Shaza, a four-star 190-room hotel, in December 2017 and Kempinski Muscat, a five-star hotel with 310 keys, in March 2018. We are currently building Rayhaan by Rotana, a four-star hotel and service apartments with 255 keys; it will be completed in the next two years. </p><h4>How is Al Mouj Muscat working to fulfill the demand in the sports tourism segment?</h4><p>We have delivered an internationally awarded tourism infrastructure such as Al Mouj Golf and Al Mouj Marina. These facilities in Al Mouj Muscat have enabled the country to increase its touristic appeal and allow it to host international sport competitions such as the America Cup, Extreme Sailing, and European Golf Tour, to name a few. We are also working on the third edition of Al Mouj Muscat marathon and expect the 2019 edition to host 10,000 runners. Similarly, we are working with Muscat Municipality to promote the “Tour of Oman," a highly successful international cycling event that highlights Oman's tourist appeal through its global TV and media coverage. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the new Muscat International Airport represent for SalamAir and for the industry?</h4><p>The new airport was something that everybody had been waiting for and the way it has turned out is wonderful. It is not only the architecture that is pleasant, but also its functionality and the value it brings to the whole industry. The airport reached completion at the right time as SalamAir started operations one year before its opening. It falls in line with the company and Ministry of Tourism's vision to boost tourism. The new airport also improved SalamAir's passenger experience with its modern features. Moreover, it has attracted more passengers to choose Muscat as a transit point, which was previously avoided due to congestion. The new airport and its facilities have attracted a whole new market.</p><h4>Has it been an operational challenge to move into the new airport?</h4><p>Most major changes come with challenges. The airport's decision to move all at once was the biggest challenge, as there were so many stakeholders involved; however, the airport handled the challenge extremely well within a short time. </p><h4>How did the market come around to understanding the pricing of low-cost airlines?</h4><p>With Salalah, for example, which accounts for 30% of our capacity, the market was used to one price, whether you booked a year ahead or on the same day. When we came we challenged that norm and managed to provide rates in the market that were previously unheard of. We dropped the price of a round-trip flight from the OMR60-70 range to below OMR40, though the market hasn't completely changed; we still see most customers booking right before they travel. We will be able to bring more efficiency by matching capacity and demand. We are trying to educate customers through pricing techniques and different levels of fares, but it is a long process.</p><h4>What factors do you consider before opening new routes? </h4><p>Generally, we respond to the market's demands; therefore, we are always listening to our customers. We start by conducting a route profitability study and work with our civil aviation authority to secure traffic rights. For example, we saw that the figures from last summer were high to Baku, which has no direct flights from Muscat. Therefore, we decided to add a direct flight during the summer as it is only three hours away. In other cases, we expand the number of flights we offer to certain destinations to meet demand. For our route to Shiraz, we started with two flights and soon had to add a third due to additional demand.</p><h4>What are your plans for fleet expansion and financing required for new aircraft?</h4><p>In 2019, we will add six more aircraft to the fleet so that we have a total fleet size of nine. Our three operational aircraft are leased, and we will use lease agreements and banks to finance the next six. This is a typical growth pattern for new airlines—leasing aircraft at first is a better way to manage cash and the risk of investing capital into a large asset at the beginning. Within five years we would like to have a fleet of 20 aircraft and reach around 60 destinations.</p><h4>After over a year of operating, what is the next phase for SalamAir?</h4><p>Our objective always is to offer a product that is appealing to customers. During the past year and a half, we were going through a start-up phase where we had brought three aircraft and managed to sustain the operation to grow it to its current level. The next phase is to grow our fleet and number of destinations. With that, we will open a lot of opportunities and will be able to have a bigger network which connects more points together to meet the vision of this country to boost tourism. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps need to be taken to ensure that Oman's airports are among the top 20 in the world by 2020?</h4><p>We are already working toward making sure Oman's airports are ranked among the top 20 in the world by 2020. One of our main goals is providing seamless passenger experience. Offering exceptional customer service and an overall positive experience with convenience is what OAMC strives to provide. Another factor that we are working on is to ensure that the operations at all airports flow smoothly at all times and in an excellent manner. Moreover, we have increased the variety of world-class F&amp;B offerings in our airports and will continue to introduce more brands in the near future. Duty-free is another important highlight that we have worked on; we have some of the best brands in the world at our airports and this is only set to get more appealing to ensure OAMC offers exceptional duty-free shopping. </p><h4>How has the transition to the new Muscat International Airport been for your different lines of business and operations?</h4><p>The entire operational readiness, activation, and transition (ORAT) process for the new airport was awarded to Munich Airport as the main consultant for OAMC and associated parties. Consultancy activities included live trials and exercises conducted for more than six months, to guarantee full readiness for the entire airport and its facilities across all lines of businesses and operations. ORAT processes included provision of qualified staff who have been diligently trained to operate the new airport. The team was trained to run all of the airport's technical systems.</p><h4>How important is it for Oman's development to upgrade and maintain its regional airports? </h4><p>The development of a country goes hand in hand with the development of its airports. In fact, OAMC's five-year transformation strategy works in conjunction with the Sultanate's strategy to expand the tourism, transport, and logistics sectors. The country offers high connectivity between ports, road, and air, and by maintaining and developing excellent services and facilities in the airports, the country's tourism and economic sectors are sure to reach new levels of success. Plans are in place to ensure that the vision relating to the country's aviation industry complements and supports the Sultanate of Oman Logistics Strategy 2040, which is a plan designed to transform Oman into one of the top 10 logistics location by 2040. </p><h4>1H2018 saw a 25% increase in cargo business. Why has that occurred, and what operational challenges has it posed?</h4><p>A new cargo terminal was built, as part of Muscat International Airport's expansion earlier in 2018, with a capacity of around 350,000 tons per year and an expansion capacity of 500,000 tons per year. The facilities include modern and technologically advanced equipment to keep pace with the steady growth in air traffic. The cargo building is fitted with automatic cargo handling that enables seamless processing of cargo containers and pallets. It also contains two state-of-the-art lifts to carry and place goods systematically. This will enable efficient handling and delivery of goods and improve production levels. Keeping in mind that a significant portion of Muscat's import and export cargo is made up of perishables and temperature-controlled goods, the building is fully air-conditioned and has a cold room storage facility that guarantees cold chain integrity is maintained throughout the entire handling process. There is also a 2,500-sqm live animal center designed to manage all types of live animals. The cargo terminal also has offices for the relevant ministries, Royal Oman Police, airlines, and cargo companies, all under one roof. The air cargo industry aims to provide all cargo services with a “one stop station," reducing the burden on customers. </p><h4>What are OAMC's objectives for 2019? </h4><p>One of the main objectives is to facilitate the increase of airlines operating at the airports as well as the destinations connecting Oman. Moreover, providing exceptional service and enhancing experience is a continuing objective of OAMC. Moving forward, we hope to score high in the Airport Service Quality survey by ensuring that our customer service in second to none. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role will Oman Post play in the development of Oman's e-commerce market?</h4><p>Postal services around the world have undergone fundamental evolution in recent years driven by technological advancements that have resulted in reinventing ourselves and moving into financial services and retail digitalization. In particular, the rise of e-commerce has revied the importance of postal services. Postal operators are becoming e-commerce and m-commerce facilitators after combining logistics and financial services. Oman Post brings specific solutions to the e-commerce ecosystem such as door-to-door delivery and cash-on-delivery. The first choice e-commerce player when it comes to last-mile delivery is the post and not courier, express, and parcel (CEP) players because CEPs were the original Business to Business (B2B) players in this space. The postal services on the other hand were always operating in the B2C and C2C space. Over the last two years, Oman Post has made great strides to play a major role in the e-commerce sector. We focused on key projects particularly related to transforming our domestic network, implementing track and trace system and customer relation management, as well as launching online shopping and setting-up the financial services business line. As a result, between 2017 and 2018, we saw e-commerce parcel traffic grow by 26%. Two other services that saw expansion were express mail service (EMS), which grew by 35%, and parcels, which grew by 227%. We fully embrace the opportunities that digital disruption and IoT present. We are taking advantage of emerging technologies to generate new efficiencies, products and services, and deliver long-term value. We very much see ourselves not only as important players in the e-commerce industry, but also as facilitators of trade, developers of enterprise, and enablers of micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises.  </p><h4>How is the government working to promote e-commerce growth?</h4><p>The country has taken e-commerce seriously and there is high-level participation from the government in the e-commerce space. A national e-commerce strategy is currently being developed, and there are many policies being implemented on a national level. We need to play catch-up, but we have made great strides in a relatively short period of time. The Middle East is one of the highest growth markets for e-commerce. According to our research, e-commerce will witness exponential growth over the next two years. Efficient infrastructure development for e-commerce is a key component of the national strategy in terms of customs clearance, storage, packing, picking, shipping, and returns. Notably, Oman's customs department is among the fastest in the world, and we need to market this asset heavily.  We are actually working in close coordination with the General Directorate of Customs at Royal Oman Police to further improve processes to enhance trade facilitation. On the other hand, success of e-commerce and m-commerce depends upon the effective electronic payment systems and instruments. To this end, the Central Bank of Oman has deployed a payment gateway to support payments for online transactions using domestic debit cards. Similarly, Oman Post plans to collaborate with local banks as payment service providers (PSPs) and is also seeking to build a payment aggregator activity in order to be able to process online payments. </p><h4>What new products have you offered since the market was liberalized?</h4><p>Matjar and Ersal are two non-traditional products that we have introduced. Ersal is a commercial last-mile delivery arm that is a separate joint venture that aims to deliver cutting-edge projects. It uses the customer's mobile phone's GPS coordinates as a GPS location instead of the physical address, allowing faster deliveries. Since the introduction of Ersal into the market, the entire landscape of last-mile delivery has changed. Matjar is a consolidation shipment service from the US that makes it less expensive for people to shop from the US. Although there are similar services, we are the only company that delivers anywhere in Oman, allowing the most rural parts of the country to have access to international commerce. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does partnering with ASYAD group members fit into the overall strategy of Mwasalat?</h4><p>Mwasalat's strategy is to extend its service across Oman, and if there is no road network, then we partner with fellow  group companies such as the National Ferries Company. With them, we have two routes; one to Khasab via Shinas and one to Masirah. ASYAD's strategy is to align public services, unify synergies, and identify areas where we can work together and deliver one product to the end user. As a result of this strategy, one can now buy one ticket to go to Khasab, where previously they had to drive all the way from Muscat and then buy a ferry ticket. This will reduce costs and encourage people to use public transport. Oman is a large country, and previously it was difficult to travel from one end of it to the other. ASYAD is working to change that, and it plays a significant role in pushing many efforts to serve the public in a better way. Another example is Mwasalat's work with Oman Post, which uses our cargo and parcel service to help transport packages.</p><h4>What role can Mwasalat play for the future of tourism within Oman?</h4><p>We cover most of Oman, with many lines serving the primary tourist destinations. We manage three bus trips every day to Salalah from Muscat, and we cover all the areas in between. We have two trips to Duqm as well as to Sur, Jalan, Ibri, and Al buraimi. Equally important, we run three daily buses in Dubai to bring tourists to Oman. On our social media accounts, we have started to promote places of interest and tourist attractions in different parts of Oman to market bus travel as a cheaper alternative to flying.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges in covering all of Oman?</h4><p>The challenges are different for two types of services: city and intercity. For intercity, we are overcoming challenges by continuing to grow our fleet and expanding the number of routes offered. For city service, we now cover almost all of Muscat, and in phase two in early 2019 we will start Salalah and then Sohar. It will be similar to the service in Muscat, and the incremental approach is in line with our strategy to progressively cover all of the largest cities in Oman. By 2025, we will cover most of the cities in Oman by the city service, which are low-floor buses.</p><h4>How have you seen demand and growth for your service? </h4><p>We see growth on a nearly daily basis. For example, in 2017 we carried 4.5 million overall compared to 3.7 million passengers the year before. The daily average was about 12,000 in 2017, and at present, we are averaging 14,000 in the first half of 2018, transporting over 2.5 million passengers on city and intercity routes. This growth is due to two primary demand reasons: a cultural change and challenges in the economy that have pushed people to search for cheaper and more convenient options. On the supply side, we now have more routes, and there is more connectivity to other services, which push people to use public transport. The culture is changing around public transport. The end result will take a longer time, though we still see the numbers growing.</p><h4>What other efforts is Mwasalat undertaking to improve service?</h4><p>Mwasalat in 2018 will cover 99% of Muscat as per the strategy, and there will be one remaining route, though we do not see a demand for that route. Moving forward, we need to have more campaigns with the ROB in terms of private cars not parking in public transport areas, and we need to source shaded stops. We are partnering with the private sector in some areas where we need air conditioning. We have introduced two in Al Khuwair, and now we will have the first solar air-conditioned bus stop near Avenues Mall and another five on main roads. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do chartering and the brokering of vessels fit into OSC's strategy?</h4><p>OSC is the holding company that owns the vessels. The vessels, in most cases, are chartered to Oman Charter Company, which handles chartering activities on behalf of Oman Shipping. In the past, all of our vessels had long-term charters that did not require as much commercial intervention; however, once we shifted our VLCCs in house, we developed the chartering desk where chartering and commercial operations are carried out by Oman Charter Company. This change increased our activity by 15 vessels, so they are busy trying to identify and find cargo to transport. Moving forward, we are discussing our strategy with shareholders regarding how Oman Shipping will move forward. We will probably copy a lot of what has been done in the VLCC segment with in-house chartering, by replicating it on the bulk side, increasing our exposure to the bulk, and also moving into refined products. In addition, we have another subsidiary by the name of Oman Container Line that provides container feeder services. It currently has liner services and we are studying the possibility of expanding into other liner services that will complement these services and provide Omani ports with better connectivity. </p><h4>How does ASYAD's portfolio complement OSC's business?</h4><p>ASYAD has different portfolios of companies under its umbrella. Asyad's primary goal is enhancing logistics within Oman. The part where both companies can cooperate and where we can find the most synergies is enhancing container connectivity to Omani ports. Together with ASYAD, we are hoping to make Omani ports more attractive by providing them with better connectivity to the region by developing new liner services through our subsidiary Oman Container Line. </p><h4>How much growth have you seen in container shipments and how much of that is related to transshipments?</h4><p>We have generated more container flow on the back of a growing economy. Being an Omani company with better insights into what is happening in the country, we were able to capture that growth and provide our customers with an appropriate solution at a competitive rate. As a result, we have been capturing more market share because of our steady performance and reliability. Since we have increased our market share, we need to strategize how to add more value to the customers, such as integrating shipping with land-based transportation. At present, we are in the business of selling our slots (space) on board our vessels; our next step is to provide our customers a means to transport their goods on board our container boxes from their point of origin to their final destination.</p><h4>How predictable are the shipments of LNG and crude oil, especially considering the long-term contracts that define the sector?</h4><p>For LNG, contracts that were made prior to 2005 were quite straight forward as they were usually attached to a long-term contract of about 20 years to transport a specific cargo for a specific client. Our LNG vessels would lift cargo from a defined loading terminal to a defined discharge terminal, operating essentially like a floating pipeline. However, since then we have seen the LNG market moving more into the spot market.  Vessels are no longer tied to a specific trade as before but move depending where the market moves.  There are still possibilities to get a long-term charter, but modern long-term charters are more like five to 10 years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What damage to the port was caused by Cyclone Mekunu, and how are rebuilding efforts going? </h4><p>The cyclone caused significant damage specifically to the port's equipment, mainly because of flooding from the low-lying areas around the port. We had a lot of damage to our trucks and had to rebuild or repair many vehicles. On top of this, quite a few of the local fishing boats that came in for refuge during the storm sunk in the port. The issue is that they blocked some of the operational berths that significantly decreased the port's capacity.</p><h4>Which shipping sub-sectors does the port cater to the most?</h4><p>The Port of Salalah is a multipurpose port and is quite broad in its scope. The port comprises of a container terminal, a general cargo terminal (GCT), and a liquid business. The three separate business units are all managed as one company. We also do all of our marine services in house, which is not always the case as a lot of other ports sub-contract these services. Trans-shipment is the biggest part of the container terminal side of the business, as Port of Salalah is a major hub for shipping lines, specifically Maersk and MSC, the largest shipping alliance in the world. The Port of Salalah is the main hub for them to connect regional cargo onto their trade route from China to West Europe, the largest shipping route in the world. Our location allows these companies to access the hub with minimal deviation, enabling them to lower costs and maximize network efficiency. Although we manage local imports and exports for the Salalah market, the port primarily serves international trans-shipments. </p><h4>Has the port been used for humanitarian aid for Yemen?</h4><p>We are seeing growing demand for transportation from the port into Yemen due to domestic port restrictions and ongoing political unrest. The Port of Salalah is a natural option for the north of the country as it is connected to major trade routes. We are working more with aid groups such as the Red Cross and World Food Program to develop that route. The Red Cross has been operating in the Port of Salalah for the last two years and we have been working with them to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.</p><h4>Are you seeing an increase in refined or manufactured materials rather than raw materials?</h4><p>The main export from Salalah at the moment is dry bulk aggregates from the mining of limestone and gypsum. Oman has become the largest exporter of gypsum in the world, which comes almost entirely out of Salalah Port. We export over 1 million tons of dry cargo every month. Earlier, only raw material like gypsum was being managed, but we are starting to see gypsum board manufacturing and other value added processes which create more economic opportunities. Similarly, we are seeing ammonia, which is the byproduct of Salalah Methanol Company, and LPG being transported. Development in Salalah is moving along the value chain from just exporting raw materials to now exporting finished products. </p><h4>What advantages are there to operating under APM Terminals?</h4><p>There are over 70 terminals in our global terminal network, which enable us to bring a level of global standards, HSSE practices, and lessons learned from other global operations. Overall, operating under APM Terminals brings operational excellence so that the same programs and terminal operating systems are used across the board, creating global and world-class systems.</p><h4>How do you hope to continue growing the port's volume?</h4><p>We are almost back to full operational capacity and are confident we will exceed our forecast for 2018. In 2017, on the container side we achieved almost 4 million TEUs, marking one of the best years for us. In terms of gate cargo, we recorded 20% YoY growth on the back of local growth in the free zone, value added business, and operations in Yemen. The immediate goal is servicing the local customer and economy and then looking for sustainability and investments that will help us ensure healthy growth levels. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What progress has been made on the development of phase one of SOHAR Port South?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MARK GEILENKIRCHEN</strong> Phase I of SOHAR Port South, which comprises 40ha, is well underway and we hope to have it completed by January 2019. One of our first partners in SOHAR Port South will be the French multinational integrated oil and gas company Total S.A., who will construct and operate an LNG plant that will be utilized for vessel bunkering. The unprecedented demand for this type of LNG plant is due to new global standards regarding vessel emissions that come into effect in 2020. The regulations mandate that vessels that operate using heavy fuel oil will either have to install expensive exhaust scrubbers to minimize emissions, or switch to a cleaner fuel alternative, of which LNG is the frontrunner. The new Total S.A. facility located at SOHAR Port South will be one of the few LNG bunkering destinations in the region. This will be a major drawcard for global shipping companies looking for LNG bunker services at an attractive rate.</p><h4>How is SOHAR Port and Freezone diversifying its businesses?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MG</strong> SV Pittie's cotton yarn manufacturing plant and Liwa Plastics industries complex are significant investments at the port. Both facilities represent the continued diversification of SOHAR, and will individually generate tremendous opportunities for downstream activities in the textile and plastic sectors. We are actively working with our partner industries to identify the many possible downstream activities and subsequent opportunities, and are actively targeting related industries that can directly benefit from the many synergies and benefits offered at SOHAR.</p><h4>What are the main benefits of operating the port and free zone as one entity?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MG </strong>In most cases, ports and free zones operate in competition with one another. In our case we do not. We come to an agreement together with the client and determine the best location for their business. We want companies to be set up and based in locations that are best suited for them, and that is a fairly unique proposition.</p><h4>What is the competitive landscape like between Oman's different ports?</h4><p><strong>JAMAL AZIZ</strong> Currently, we cannot accommodate space for another refinery. However, there is a possibility of creating more area. The area could also be further developed to accommodate additional oil and gas businesses. In comparison to Duqm, we are approximately 10 years ahead in terms of available facilities.</p><h4>How has being a part of ASYAD benefitted SOHAR Port?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MG</strong> There are a few aspects where we can benefit enormously from other industries. If we were to look at safety, HR, training, or getting our people into other industries, then it is extremely beneficial for our managers to spend a few years working at Oman Shipping Company before re-joining us. It enables them to gain extensive and new experiences from the customer-end of the port. The fact that we can speak on behalf of most of the logistics industries provides us with a better voice when communicating with the government.</p><h4>What synergies are being most utilised between ASYAD's companies?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JA</strong> ASYAD is continuously committed to implementing Oman's Logistics Strategy 2040, under which there are four pillars: HR, technology, markets, and trade facilitation. We see the synergies between the pillars and executing them under the umbrella of ASYAD would be a better option than doing it singularly, enabling us to obtain quicker and more effective results.</p><h4>What is your strategy to improve trade facilitation and technology?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MG</strong> If we look at businesses at the port, they can be improved by attracting more investment, since most of the country's imports and exports already come via SOHAR. Liwa Plastics, once fully operational, will result in a huge surge in our container volumes. At present, we want to link our industries so that the output of one industry can be used as raw material by another. We have a department that strategically looks into these possibilities and initiatives. Our primary objective is to attract new business and industry to generate more activity and create sustainable job opportunities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do PART's offerings cater to the interests of all Omanis?</h4><p>PART has changed a great deal since its establishment in 2011 and has expanded its offerings significantly. We now have three new television channels—live events, sports, and culture—in addition to our general TV channel. We have also done a great deal in the radio sector. We have five radio stations—a general station, a youth station, the Holy Quran station, an English channel, and a classical music channel. Our television and radio offerings provide a bigger picture of the contemporary development process throughout Oman and its cultural identity. Our different channels and stations incorporate the different interests of the people and focus on Omani culture.</p><h4>How is PART expanding its digital presence?</h4><p>PART has also worked hard on the digital front. We have a strong mobile app that plays our radio stations and TV channels. We also put the TV programs we produce on YouTube and the radio programs on SoundCloud and are working to produce our own platform to stream our TV and radio channels. We also have a strong presence on social media platforms. We have interaction between our programs and our viewers and listeners through social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.</p><h4>What is the importance of providing quality TV and radio offerings to Omanis?</h4><p>On our stations and channels, we start with the basic principles of the Omani state, its cultural identity, non-interference in the business of others, the independence of Oman, and promoting the culture and development projects all over Oman. We have opened branches in the different governorates of Oman, from Musandam to Dhofar, to cover almost every event in Oman. People can watch their local developments on the TV and listen to it on the radio, and in this way they can see a reflection of themselves, their concerns, and their culture and identity. There are also many people outside Oman who tune in to Omani TV and radio through our applications and websites. The benefits are derived by both Omanis and non-Omanis. It is also about helping people retain their culture, which is an important goal of the state.</p><h4>What strategies does PART have to grow its international audience?</h4><p>Our primary audience in within Oman, though we are also present in the satellite and digital spheres, and we have many viewers and listeners from outside Oman. The international viewers who watch Omani TV are interested in the country or want to know more about our culture or economy. Some investors may also use our coverage to look into the investment horizons here. More than the audience numbers, we are interested in how people see us in terms of the credibility of our content. In 2015, the local National Center for Statistics and Information conducted a study about how Omanis perceive their radio and TV channels. As we expected, the large majority of people trust what we say. Our coverage is spreading, and more people are watching and listening to our channels; however, more importantly, the level of trust and our credibility are strong.</p><h4>What new television channels is PART working on?</h4><p>We are looking into opening two new television channels. One is a children's TV channel that would focus on producing content for children, but specifically from an Omani cultural perspective. We already have international and Arabic children channels, though the messages are not the ones we want our children to learn. The other new channel we are working hard on is a news channel, again to focus on Omani content, though addressing both the Omani and the external Arabic audience. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Al Madina helping to digitize government functions?</h4><p>A great deal of our projects are e-forms and e-governance; therefore, we are putting everything on the digital world map. We do this for the public sector and now see growing interest from the private sector as everyone seeks to go paperless. Through the National Records and Archives Authority, the government is setting certain standards for documentation, management systems, and related digitization activities to ensure everybody is compliant with their regulations.</p><h4>What solutions are your high-growth sectors demanding?</h4><p>A great deal of our growth is in the energy sector. They all need the IT solutions that incorporate dashboards and analytical solutions. They are moving everything online so that all data are there, and they can just generate reports to use for decision making.</p><h4>What trends have you noticed in the banking sector's digital needs?</h4><p>Traditionally, banks have kept their hardware and equipment extremely centralized, though I have seen a reversal of thinking over the past year. Before, banks would invest in equipment, keep it in one place, and then send other materials to remote areas. This can be challenging and does not suit many customers because of the time and delivery needed to send materials to faraway recipients. There has since been an effort to decentralize and have equipment at branches now. In the end, this is better service for the end customers.</p><h4>How have you seen the shift to e-payments in your markets?</h4><p>The future is moving in the direction of e-payments. Many African countries are fairly advanced in mobile e-payments, which benefits the telecom providers rather than banks, which is a major shift. Part of the shift to e-payments is out of necessity. For example, due to sanctions some countries do not have a credit card system so they use mobile payments; other countries do not have the infrastructure for point of sales so they also utilize mobile payment systems.</p><h4>What are Al Madina's objectives over the next 12 months?</h4><p>We are focusing on growing in our foreign markets. We are already established in a few countries and want to take on more responsibilities in these countries to develop end-to-end solutions utilizing our years of experience and knowledge. We also want to get better at dealing with our main challenge, which is communicating. English is not as common as one would think. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What sub sectors have the greatest potential within the Middle East?</h4><p>There is room for tech start-ups and apps that provide basic services, such as last-mile delivery and payments that other apps and platforms need to use in almost every country. A start-up will certainly make money if it can solve that challenge. Anything that has to do with food and basic life services also has potential. Successful companies that provide delivery services may subsequently be acquired by larger companies to gain better market access, not necessarily because of the depth of the tech involved, similar to Otaxi. There is room for such services, while investors like us will make a return, which is great for ecosystem development.</p><h4>Where do you see the future of tech start-ups in Oman?</h4><p>Tech start-ups should address problems that have the potential to grow to an international scope. We will not invest in any company that only serves the Omani market; it has to have the potential to become a company earning USD100 million. It needs to think of a big market size, solve an issue, and use deep tech. The deeper the tech, the better, which is where the future lies. For small countries, it is better to start with B2B, because the consumer base is not that large.</p><h4>What regulation changes could be made to encourage start-ups?</h4><p>There could be changes to the commercial law to allow share options for employees so that start-ups can be more flexible with salaries. The current situation is extremely complicated, which is why we register these companies at some point or at another offshore like in the Cayman Islands. Tech start-ups cannot pay large remunerations to their employees, and we would like the option of giving employees stock options. In the region, there is no concept of preferential shares; they are all equal and common shares. As investors, we want protection and demand superior classes of preferential shares. The current law does not differentiate, and if it changes, it will bring in more smart capital. We also need a bankruptcy law that limits liability both for the entrepreneurs and investors. We also want to see greater liberalization of the visa process in terms of smart visas so that it will be easier to bring in talent to the country.</p><h4>Does OTF work with regulators on behalf of the start-up industry?</h4><p>In order to operate, we were unable to wait for these changes to take place. The beauty of operating in a small country is that the government is extremely accessible. We benefited from many exceptions. For example, foreign investors must contribute a minimum amount, which tech start-ups do not have. To be given a license to operate, companies must also have a rent agreement, and we offered a co-working space so they could avoid that step. Right now, everything is done through exceptions rather than structural changes in the law, so there is still work to be done. The government has been receptive and responsive, though this takes more of our time.</p><h4>Looking forward over the next 12 months, what are OTF's primary objectives?</h4><p>We doubled our investments in 2018 in comparison to 2017, both in terms of the number of investments and the invested amount. We are extremely positive with that. In 2019, our investment will likely peak at its highest yet. In the first two years, we were working on internal operations, building our team and raising awareness while investing as well. Our two main objectives are to deploy most of our capital in 2019 and build up the strength of our new deep tech fund. Because of our investments in 2017, Oman moved up from 17th place in the Middle East in terms of tech total tech investment to number 10. In 2018, we expect Oman to move up again. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[                                    <h4>How have the services you perform changed over the years in reaction to market demands?</h4><p>Oman Data Park commenced its operations in 2012. We initially focused on core data center services, namely the colocation services that provide space in the data center for corporations to utilize in handling their hardware. Thereafter, we introduced an additional service, namely managed services, because of the market requirements of not only hosting hardware but also managing it on companies' behalf. Over the years, we have seen a demand for localized cloud services and large corporations around the world running cloud services, though none of them were localized. Oman Data Park seized the opportunity to provide cloud services within its data center. Subsequently, we introduced a security operations center that provides corporations with managed security. All these business services were gradually developed based on the demand created either by Oman Data Park or the international market.</p><h4>What security features do your data centers have that customers are requesting?</h4><p>There are several diversified security services at Oman Data Park. For example, we have the DMARC service that ensures emails are more secure from various phishing attacks occurring through emails. We also provide DDoS engine to our clients where cleanup of all denials of service attacks that might happen from other parts of the world. We built this engine around a firewall that prevents such denial of service attacks. We also provide internal and external vulnerability assessments on a 24/7 basis. We monitor their infrastructure to ensure it is secure from attacks. We have three data centers, and securing data assets is a critically important function done on a day-to-day basis. In our data centers, we host the data of six banks, oil and gas infrastructure, and other critical service infrastructure, which demonstrates their trust in the investments we made for data security. We also sell services to corporations that do not host their data within Oman Data Park.</p><h4>What can be changed for the IT sector to promote more international investment?</h4><p>One of the main aspects of attracting investment is relaxing the regulations here as much as we can. Second, we have to position our value proposition in an aggressive and direct manner. Oman has value propositions as a nation that others do not have. It is also geographically appealing to international submarine cables—many of the world's submarine cables today land in Oman before they go anywhere else. Such value propositions attract giant cloud service providers, and by better positioning these advantages as a nation, we can attract more investors. There still needs to be a strategized roadmap toward attracting investors in a more proactive manner.</p><h4>What are Oman Data Park's objectives for the next 12 months?</h4><p>We are extremely established in B2B with our corporate sales and corporate deals with banks and oil and gas companies. We are pushing the cloud services in the same B2B manner, and my intention is to have online cloud services fully automated at the same level as my corporate and B2B divisions. With the launch of our Version 2 cloud services in Duqm in early 2018, the cloud services steps that we have taken so far are automated. We are currently pushing this as the next strategic revenue engine of Oman Data Park in our 2021 plan, where we want to be within the top 10 cloud service providers worldwide. We have established a solid ground locally and are now focusing more on the cloud services that we provide today, which are automated and enhanced. Another angle we are working on is to establish and strengthen the ecosystem around us. A company that wants to leap forward rapidly needs to create an excellent ecosystem around it and engage with large players. We are already doing that and are closely engaged with Cisco and Dell EMC and will soon  be with Amazon. </p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is OBC coordinating infrastructure growth with Oman's public utilities?</h4><p>We have signed several MoUs that are focused on having better alignment with various utility providers, allowing us to be involved at the early stage of project development and consequently be a part of the major infrastructure rollout. For example, with the Public Authority for Electricity and Water, we are jointly working on the deployment of a fiber network along with water projects across Oman. This approach creates significant synergies; from one side savings are secured, while from the other, disturbance to citizens during construction is minimized.</p><h4>Are you on track to achieve your 2020 goals for coverage in Muscat and the country as a whole?</h4><p>Within Muscat, we are positive that we will exceed our originally planed goals for 2020. Outside of Muscat, since our rollout depends on other utility providers, we are committed to achieving our goals, though we cannot accurately predict whether we will achieve or exceed our targets due to several variables. Since fiber, compared to other utilities such as water, is easier and quicker, our initial project timelines in some areas may be affected; however, on the other hand, that approach generates significant savings. In cases where deployment is delayed beyond an acceptable timeline, we engage in so-called standalone deployment to secure fiber access for the wider public within an acceptable timeline.</p><h4>How does your relationship with service providers operate?</h4><p>As an infrastructure service provider, we work under the regulation of the Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRA), from whom we have been granted a license to build and operate a nation-wide passive fibre network. Our clients are three existing fixed line operators that are, at the same time, internet service providers (ISP), as well as some government institutions. We do not directly deal with end customers; that segment is under ISPs, while we play the role of a wholesale service provider. The biggest advantage of having the open access network used by the three ISPs is that the competition has shifted from infrastructure to services, where it should be. The government's aim was to create an environment where the end user has better options, quality, and prices without unnecessary investment, and we are pleased to say that the plan works.</p><h4>How does OBC's fiber network facilitate smart practices in government and industry?</h4><p>One of our main tasks is to enable the government to be smart, and part of our project is to directly connect the government entities with fiber optic. A great example of such an initiative is the project we commenced in 2016 with ITA to interconnect all the head offices of the government and connect them to data centers to have a parallel network dedicated to government services. So far, we have completed about 40-50% of the work and are eyeing completion in mid-2019. Given that the fourth industrial revolution is here, we need to plan wisely and take into consideration that OBC will serve multiple operators as well as services and platforms related to IoT and smart applications. Today, we are building an infrastructure that is beyond Oman's current requirements. Building this now is much easier than thinking how to upgrade it afterwards, as it is clear the fiber is and will remain a crucial connectivity technology. With this approach, we are directly contributing to e-Oman's vision.</p><h4>How does the regulatory framework support OBC's goals?</h4><p>The national broadband strategy depends on three main pillars: the regulation and reworking of the regulation to serve the future applications, stimulating demand, and building new and utilizing the existing broadband infrastructure, which is directly linked to the formation and mandate of OBC. From the beginning, the vision of the country was clear: to build an integrated infrastructure for future technologies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What incentives is ITA creating for international and domestic investment in Oman's IT industry?</h4><p>ITA aims to encourage and support entrepreneurship in ICT, particularly young Omanis. To ensure sustainable growth of the ICT sector, we focus on the development of SMEs and creating an environment of competition and coordination among them. ITA has made great steps in this field, and one of the important projects is the establishment of Sas centers for virtual reality and mobile apps development to provide the infrastructure needed for developing mobile applications, virtual reality, and augmented-reality content and related services. These centers work to feed the local and regional market with people specialized in the field by providing specialized training to Omani talent and encouraging them to be entrepreneurs in order to achieve economically valuable outcomes. The Sas Center for Entrepreneurship was established in 2014, and strategically aims to build the IT industry in Oman by nurturing and supporting start-ups in ICT. We provide technical and business-related training to incubate companies to prepare them for the real world and assist them in getting their first assignments while enabling them to coordinate amongst each other and create synergies. This in turn creates the industry clusters we are looking for, an attraction point for further investments in the ICT sector by local and foreign companies. Indeed, the stronger the local ecosystem of ICT companies, the better the Sultanate's opportunities for attracting serious foreign investment in the sector.<br>How does ITA integrate other utilities' infrastructure into its development of Oman's digital infrastructure?<br>The rollout of smart city infrastructure will be the strongest link, as these monitor and control utilities through digital technologies. Oman has greenfield initiatives such as Duqm, the planned Errfan city, and the trial we are conducting at Knowledge Oasis Muscat. However, this will be much expanded as we roll out e.oman 2030 Vision, a major drive for this infrastructure.</p><h4>How will the development of Oman's fiber-optic network provide future growth in the IT industry?</h4><p>One of the ultimate goals of the smart nation initiative in Oman is to reduce costs for all the stakeholders and increase the efficiency in delivery of services, utilizing and leveraging the information output effectively to enhance services and build on value-added services. Having high-speed connectivity in homes and businesses will allow consumer and business services that are currently limited by connection speed to enhance their productivity. Virtual reality and augmented reality applications will require high connection speeds when these access servers located outside the home and business. Cloud hosting and services offered on the cloud will get a boost as more data and services can be hosted on the cloud and accessed remotely. The more bandwidth we have, the more positively it will affect the number of e-services, supply, jobs created in IT, and growth of the overall sector in the Sultanate.</p><h4>What initiatives is ITA working on to further Oman's robust cyber security system?</h4><p>ITA provides a secure environment for users of electronic devices by offering high-quality security services and raising their awareness about information security. Two main divisions expend ITA efforts in this field: Information Security Division, which is responsible for the government entities security, and Oman National CERT, which is responsible for the security of the cyber space in Oman and public awareness in this field. The key services offered by ITA include networks and portals protection, internet access security, end-point security, information security operations, security assessment and IT security consultancies. In 2012, ITA launched the Arab Regional Cyber Security Center to create a safer and cooperative cybersecurity environment in the Arab world and strengthen the role of ITU in building confidence and security in the use of information and communication technologies in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has growth in the MNVO market impacted the telecommunications landscape in Oman?</h4><p>The two active mobile resellers Friendi and Renna together hold a market share of around 17%. The resellers have been effective in competing with mobile network operators in terms of price and packaging of consumer-preferred services. The mobile resellers have been successful in carving out niche markets for themselves by focusing on segments sensitive to pricing and making attractive offers on voice and data.</p><h4>How will the third operator license impact providers and customers in Oman's mobile market?</h4><p>The primary outcome of awarding a third operating license is to enhance competition in the mobile market. Consumers are expected to receive a range of benefits like coverage, competitive price, higher quality of service, and improved customer services. The license award would also make the existing operators innovate further and reach out to the consumers with improved services and price offerings.</p><h4>What changes need to be made to the telecommunications market to remain innovative and customer friendly?</h4><p>Implementation of the access and interconnection regulations requiring the publishing of wholesale offers by way of reference access and interconnection offers is expected to pave the way for the introduction of SMEs as internet service providers (ISPs) in the service provision of the bit stream layer. It would address the major issue of reaching out to customers in the last mile. TRA is also considering updating the passive infrastructure sharing regulations to streamline investment as well as promote competition in the services.</p><h4>What efforts are being made to further expand the fiber optic network in Muscat and the rest of Oman?</h4><p>Oman Broadband Company (OBC) is mandated to provide fiber access network for the greater Muscat area after inheriting the fiber access network from the government's Muscat wastewater initiative. As per the project plan, OBC would reach out to all properties in the Muscat area by the year 2021 in a progressive manner. OBC has also drawn up plans to provide similar access networks in other parts of the country working closely with utilities (electricity, water, and wastewater). It is expected that fiber access networks would service all metropolitan areas in the Sultanate by 2025 either through OBC or through other telecom licensees who work to complement each other's efforts.</p><h4>What consumer protection initiatives has TRA launched, and what consumer issues are you currently evaluating?</h4><p>TRA's website has dedicated and common resources for consumers to get to know various protection mechanisms available and familiarize themselves with coverage, quality of services, and pricing information. They are provided with the procedure to seek TRA's intervention when efforts to settle their grievances with the licensees fail. TRA has facilitated the channels of communication and reach to the consumers through active call center operations and digital connectivity. Furthermore, TRA has launched campaigns that interact directly with the consumer and raise greater awareness, such as Don't be Deceived and Be Smart. Moreover, TRA is currently preparing an upcoming regulation that will regulate and provide clear parameters about consumers' rights and obligations in order to facilitate the protection of consumers when it comes to their relationship with operators in the Sultanate.</p><h4>What are TRA's initiatives for the next 12 months?</h4><p>TRA will issue a license for the third mobile network operator soon. Implementation of access and interconnection regulations is in progress, and dominant operators are expected to publish their reference access and interconnection offers within three months of TRA's decision. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What legislative changes is the Public Authority for Mining planning in order for the mining sector to contribute substantially more to GDP?</h4><p>First, we have to focus on putting the right legislation in place. After two years of hard work, we are finally reaching the endorsement stage of the new mining law. The law will help attract investment in different ways. One of those is reducing the risk that the short license periods create. At present, the licenses are one-year renewable contracts but after the new law, they will be renewable every five years for up to 25 years and for the concession agreements, the tenure is for 25 years and renewable. This change will build confidence for sustainability from the investors point of view. If the site is bigger than 5sqkm, it is eligible to become a concession, meaning a bigger area and a longer period of time. Moreover, we are offering more clarity to legislation; the law is comprehensive and well detailed. Not only will it make the government and investors aware of the entitlements on both sides, it will define clear solutions in case there are any issues between investors and the government. Again, this helps build trust in investors that the sector is being regulated in a structured manner. Equally important, there is space in the new law to reflect Oman's economic changes in terms of royalties. The law stipulates the minimum royalty, but the absolute value will be determined by regulations, which can be adjusted as needed. The law itself calls for a competitive bidding process for allocation of quarries. By doing so, there is a fair chance for all players to compete for mining investment in Oman.</p><h4>How does the Public Authority for Mining stay in touch with all of the sector's stakeholders when formulating its strategy?</h4><p>We outlined the Oman Mining Strategy in 1Q2018, which presents a clear path for where we need to focus our efforts in order to maximize the exploitation of the sector's potential. The strategy also outlines the commodities that our efforts need to focus on. It is crucially important that we balance commercialization with the impact on the environment. Compared to other sectors, mining changes the landscape, and mining activities in Oman tend to concentrate close to where people live, unlike oil activity, which often takes place in the desert. Therefore, we are focusing on changing people's perception through the idea that mining should be carried out in a responsible way and is beneficial for the country. Therefore, we had many engagements with the stakeholder when we formulated our strategy, and they have been on board at every stage.</p><h4>What are the primary infrastructure investments needed for the mining industry?</h4><p>We have a great infrastructure in place for mining in general. For instance, we have excellent roads and large seaports located in different areas. However, some commodities are available only in remote areas. For example, about 300km from Duqm we have a large area that holds huge volumes of gypsum and limestone but the area lacks infrastructure and transport links. To overcome those challenges, we are collaborating with the Ministry of Transport and Communication to determine the optimal feasible means of transportation. One of the options is a railroad, which would serve many objectives, one of which is connecting remote communities. It would also promote local industries in Duqm and add value to the region.</p><h4>What role does the Public Authority for Mining have in investment attraction?</h4><p>Our objective is always to regulate the sector. We are not an investment arm; we leave that to other sectors of the government. We act in a way to make mining an attractive investment. We are enhancing the quality of our services to be able to promote and manage the sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ongoing-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where are your primary export markets, and where would you like to move to regionally?</h4><p>Primarily, our export market is within the Middle East, including the GCC and Africa, where logistics and transportation advantages for commodities such as our products are essential to compete and grow. Moreover, we take advantage of multinational companies to build our presence in more markets, creating and developing more products and getting into new areas. We are currently discussing with MNCs worldwide about the gap analysis, particularly in northern and eastern African markets, other Middle Eastern countries, and even Europe. With specific logistics advantages, cost of manufacturing, and import duties, AVOD might be able to penetrate, compete, and grow in these markets.</p><h4>Where do you source most of your materials from?</h4><p>We source from major distributors of crude edible oils around the world. The major distributors for palm oil and fraction of palm oils are Indonesia and Malaysia. For us, freight costs are competitive enough to allow us to import materials from there, process and add value here, and export and re-export to the MENA region. We bring in other products such as corn oil and sunflower oil from North and South America, which takes 45-60 days to reach Oman, though we have a great module of planning around. This gives us a cost-effective way of manufacturing in Oman. Economy of scales are crucial in commodity business; the more we produce, the lower the cost per unit, and the more we can compete in export markets. Furthermore, the more efficient we are and the better our value chain is, the more competitive we can be in export markets.</p><h4>How do you respond to market demands, specifically in the area of healthier options for your products?</h4><p>This is an ongoing process, and we respond to the needs of our customers through the value chain and identify that in all aspects. For example, at the time of development, the aspect of customers' needs and value obtained from the product are crucial. The second aspect is the health part, where because of the change in the nutritional awareness of end users, we have to be flexible enough to go in that direction without compromising in terms of cost, quality, or performance. All our products not only comply with local standards and specifications but also focus on the modern lifestyle and customers' needs and requirements, particularly when it comes to purity and lightness of the products, which add value as a healthier option for an end user.</p><h4>What technologies are you using within your manufacturing processes to make them dynamic?</h4><p>Our end-to-end systems allow us to add value in terms of system efficiencies, plans, and resources. In addition, the system allows us to plan exactly what products are required and what raw materials, packaging materials, and process to be sourced in a cost-effective way. We are proceeding with the fourth industrial revolution to bring in wireless detectors, where we can see the entire input that goes into products and productivity. Automation is key for success in this business, and that will increase our efficiency in the end. Information can help us predict future breakdowns of individual lines and give us the critical maintenance and preventive maintenance required for our operations. It provides added value to what we currently produce and adds efficiency to our operations. It gives us more information for the future as to how far we can plan ourselves. We have started to bring in such technology and implement it into our manufacturing units, moving from artificial intelligence to machine intelligence. We seek to automate the entire processes increasing efficiencies and outputs. This required a great deal of effort for us to predict the future and upgrade our systems and skills as well. We will be able to do it together, not only with technology but also with local Omani skills. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Bilfinger Tebodin's priorities reflect the trends the region is witnessing under an industrial and energy management point of view?</h4><p>The dynamics around us define and refine our priorities. The Middle East is transforming away from a traditional pure-hydrocarbons-based industry and using that natural wealth to diversify and build a future of efficiency and sustainability. Bilfinger is well positioned within these plans. Our century-long focus and expertise in both the worlds of CAPEX and OPEX give us the privilege to serve our clients along the entire value chain and support their efforts not only to build things better, but also to run and manage them more efficiently and sustainably. On the CAPEX side, we begin with an idea all the way to detailed value engineering and then onto the project to ensure that the money being spent results in the highest return of capital. On the other hand, the amount of money spent to maintain and sustain the industry is significant, and that is the OPEX cycle, where Bilfinger comes in with a century-long expertise in enhancing efficiency, increasing productivity whether per molecule, per ton of production or even per MW produced, extracting and creating more value from every barrel. To extract value from every barrel, one needs to have the holistic view starting with what you build (capital allocation), how you build (CAPEX optimization), and how efficiently and sustainably you operate those assets (OPEX).</p><h4>How do you project the recent asset allocation toward natural gas impacting the hydrocarbon industry, and where do you see the greatest potential on the digital front?</h4><p>The natural gas industry, and on the back of it the petrochemical and power sectors in the Middle East, have come far and relatively rapidly. However, available capacity came under pressure to the extent that allocations for petrochemical production growth became a stretch. New exploration, marginal fields, sour and ultra-sour, and even unconventional assets all came into focus, albeit at a higher production cost; however, there is an internal source of productivity and additional capacity that is not fully explored. That is what we call gas liberation. On the digital front, the energy and hydrocarbon industry have not really tapped into enormous possibilities here. The role of digital transformation starts in better designs and more efficient processes, but stretches on far beyond into the world of data; not just to acquire data but to structure and capitalize on it. That is where we at Bilfinger come in with our BCAP to help customer move from reactive maintenance, transition through predictive, and get to what we call prescriptive. This is where you squeeze the dollar from every barrel, molecule, or mega-watt.</p><h4>What would you define as the biggest challenge of the oil and gas industry in the region?</h4><p>For Middle East producers, blessed by the low lifting cost, the game is all around the cost of availability, reliability, and maintenance. This is where the equation is heavily stretched. As long as the oil price is around USD70-75, shale producers have a healthy cash flow and solid margins to service their debt and continue to drill. The same holds true for Middle East producers, even though the elements are somewhat different. At this oil price, the net margins are healthy, allowing the social cost and economic spending to continue at the right pace. The challenge comes when the needle drops to around USD40-50. That is where the social priorities prevail, growth for CAPEX freezes, and the entire ecosystem suffers. This familiar and somewhat cyclical scenario suggests continuous focus on cost reduction, efficiency, and productivity is more than prudent. 1% more efficiency, 1% more productivity, or 1% less OPEX translates into millions of dollars freed cash flow that could be reinvested in much more accredited projects. That is where one begins to appreciate the impact of true digital transformation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Sohar Steel Group grown since its establishment?</h4><p>We started in 1996 with Sharq Sohar Rolling Mills. We were only a small company at that time, generating 100,000 tons of steel per year before gradually increasing to 250,000 tons. In 2008, we saw a need to generate our own raw material and decided to open Sohar Steel. Sohar Steel mainly focuses on raw materials such as billets, which we use to produce rebars, and hot briquetted iron (HBI) and direct reduced iron (DRI), which we receive as scrap and as a raw material to get the billets. When the Omani economy started to recover, consumption stood at 1 million tons per year, and we decided to increase our capacity of rebars. In 2016, we started another rolling mill attached to Sohar Steel, and this generates around 500,000-600,000 tons of steel. Therefore, the group's total production increased to 800,000 tons of steel. Eventually, we merged both factories and rebranded them as Sohar Steel Group.</p><h4>Where do you source your raw material from, and what challenges do you face in sourcing?</h4><p>We mainly source our raw material from the GCC as well as locally. Unfortunately, in Oman this is one of the issues that we constantly face. The industry needs raw material; however, the raw material in Oman goes to other countries. This issue needs to be looked at by the government to protect local factories.</p><h4>What are your biggest operational challenges?</h4><p>One of the drawbacks for the industry is that electricity is not subsidized by the government, while gas prices have increased by 100%. Rent for the land has also gone up, and our production costs have subsequently gone up. The government should review all these tariffs it places on producers. </p><h4>Why are you looking to diversify your product offering?</h4><p>Rebar prices are variable. Sometimes, the rebar price is less than our operations costs and other times there are great margins. We are considering going into something new to diversify our portfolio so that we do not only depend on rebars or billets. We are currently visiting factories abroad to determine if our plans are feasible. This will be a downstream business that may add value to the Sohar Steel Group as well.</p><h4>Regionally, where are your customers located?</h4><p>We serve the construction industry across the GCC. Earlier in our history, we were supplying rebars to Oman. Later, we started supplying almost 30,000 tons to markets around the GCC. We generate around 60,000 tons of steel per month, which falls short of full capacity because of the shortage of raw materials. </p><h4>What are your primary objectives over the next 12 months?</h4><p>One of our objectives is to focus on Omanis and training, and our aim is to Omanize our factory. Instead of 45% Omanization rate, we target 60%, though this is something we are planning with the support of the government, because without its support we will not be able to succeed. The objectives are to diversify the portfolio for 2019, continue providing excellent service to our customers, and to open a training center in the factory. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Oman Cement Company expanded its capacity and product offering?</h4><p>Our first cement production was in 1983, and at that time we were only producing two types of cement—ordinary Portland cement and sulfate-resistant cement (SRC). In 1995, we added another line to increase our daily production by 2,000 tons, production for which started in 1998. In 2010, we expanded again by commissioning our third line with a daily capacity of 4,000 tons. Today, our total capacity is 8,700 tons of clinker per day. On the cement side, we have added another cement mill, bringing our total cement capacity to 10,000-plus tons per day. Annually, we have production capacity of around 2.6 million tons of clinker and a grinding capacity of 3.6 million tons. Our main cement product type is ordinary Portland cement, SRC, and oil well cement types one and two. Almost all our OPC and SRC are sold in the local market. Part of our oil well cement, however, is sold in Oman, and the rest is exported to various countries like GCC countries, Iraq, Kazakhstan, certain African countries, and recently Venezuela, though in small quantities.</p><h4>Is domestic cement production adequate to meet the demand?</h4><p>There is a gap between the demand for cement in Oman and cement supply from the local cement producers. Local producers only meet around 50-55% of Oman's demand for cement, while the rest is imported. There are only two companies in Oman that have fully integrated facilities for production of clinker and cement: Oman Cement Company and Raysut Cement Company. The remaining few local cement producers only have cement grinding units and rely mainly on imported clinker to grind and produce cement. Therefore, there is a potential opportunity in Oman to expand and set up new cement plants. This opportunity to grow the cement manufacturing industry is not only to cover local demand. Because of its geographical location and availability of inland raw material for producing cement, Oman can have a competitive price advantage in exporting clinker and cement to the African continent and other countries.</p><h4>How does Oman Cement Company differentiate itself from its competitors, both locally and internationally, to make its products more attractive?</h4><p>Our high quality and consistency in all our cement types and focus on customer service have been two main key drivers of our proposition in the local as well the international markets. Oman Cement Company was the first producer of cement in the country. Having started in the 1970s, we have been providing cement for building Oman over the years. This is a matter of pride for us. Today, Oman Cement Company's strength in the local market is not based only on high quality products, but also on building its image through strategic initiatives in social responsibility and in-country value (ICV). However, as known, cement is a price-sensitive commodity, and we cannot attract customers based purely on quality. The main challenge we face is being competitive in terms of both quality and price. In 2017-2018, we faced extremely aggressive price competition from imported cement as well as from the local producers; however, we were still able to maintain our market share by restructuring our price and reducing our production cost while maintaining our product quality to its high standards.</p><h4>What are your objectives for the next 12 months?</h4><p>Our objective is to retain our position as a leading cement producer in Oman and remain competitive in the local market and open new markets abroad, especially for oil well cement. Besides, our objectives for the coming year, which are part of our long-term strategy, will focus on building a strong knowledge team, reduce production costs through applying lean management, and improving efficiency of our processes and plant performance. As we also work on growth in our business, our project for setting up a new cement plant in Duqum will be one of the major objectives next year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key investments is Raysut making in its different operations around Oman?</h4><p>The first step is to increase our capacity in Salalah to grow our supply in North Oman. Although Raysut has always been present in the north of Oman through its terminals in Muscat and Sohar, it needs to expand there because north Oman is the biggest market. According to our estimate, it has a demand of 5 million tons per annum, growing at about 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). We plan to take advantage of that demand growth by investing in a grinding unit with a capacity of 2 million tons per annum in Sohar. We expect this to come on-stream in the next 18 months, which will make up for our exit from Muscat Port, which has been transformed into a tourism port. Our next area of growth is in Duqm, where we are considering investing in a grinding unit with a capacity of 3 million tons per annum, boosting Raysut's total capacity to 10 million tons.</p><h4>How are you investing to increase Raysut's exports and capacity of international plants?</h4><p>We are adding another 3 million tons per annum clinker line to address the export market. In addition, we are moving into East African markets, such as Somaliland and Eritrea. We are working closely with our sovereign fund in Oman to invest in those two markets, which altogether would add 5 million tons per annum to Raysut's capacity. We have already started investing in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania, where each facility will produce 2 million tons. Oman's presence is already strong in these markets, so it makes sense to extend that to manufacturing. By doing this, our yearly capacity will hopefully reach 20 million tons, up from our current capacity of 5.6 million tons. At present, the rest of the demand is met by other countries, including Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Raysut exports to Yemen and Iraq. Have you seen demand in those places increase as a result of rebuilding work?</h4><p>We have not seen that demand materialize yet, but the indications are there. Yemen has historically been one of our strong market; we used to supply 25% of our production to Yemen. That figure has declined primarily due to logistical issues, not because demand has fallen. There are long waiting times now in all the ports in Yemen, mainly because clearances are required, and priority is given to food shipments. Once a peaceful solution is agreed upon, demand will quadruple, and we are preparing our logistics channels for such a scenario. Several port handling facilities in Yemen are currently undergoing upgrades to accommodate modern vessels and discharge systems.</p><h4>How is Raysut adapting to increases in industrial cost drivers?</h4><p>The company's cost structure has doubled over the last three years, meaning our competitive cost advantage has declined. This is compounded by the global markets opening up, specifically markets such as Iran, Egypt, more recently Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. Suppliers in these countries are now at a cost advantage over a plant here in Salalah. The main reason for the cost increases is the withdrawal of gas subsidies in Oman and electricity costs doubling. Therefore, the main investments we are focusing on immediately are all geared to bring our cost structure back in line with global cement manufacturers; we have to invest in capturing losses in our process. The first one is waste treatment recovery, which we are investing in on an urgent basis. Another investment we are making is to enhance our coolers. Raysut has not reinvested in its plant over the past seven or eight years; however, it is vital in our industry to keep up with the latest technologies. Therefore, in-house, we are investing a significant amount of money to increase productivity, which will reduce the cost per ton and make us globally competitive again. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In recent global rankings KFUPM claimed the fifth position in terms of patents — with a total of 237 registered in 2018. Could you tell us more about your strategies in place to have this ecosystem where research leads to registered new ideas?</h4><p>After KFUPM completed development of its research infrastructure and processes, it embarked on developing an ecosystem for innovation that helps in translating research outcomes into economic impact. To achieve this, KFUPM planned to spread the culture of academic innovation at its campus. The plans included increasing awareness about intellectual property, providing training in patenting to faculty, researchers, and students, and stimulating them to innovate through recognition/reward system. Additionally, the university established a technology transfer system according to best practices of US universities, which included an effective invention/discovery disclosure system that linked every research activity with a patenting process. These are major factors behind positioning KFUPM among the world top universities in terms of number of annual issued patents. Research excellence, focus on KSA strategic technological challenges and needs, quality, and commercialization of research outcomes are other important aspects of KFUPM research system. With regards to research excellence, though KFUPM started by building its capacity locally through providing training to its faculty, it collaborated internationally on specific research programs with MIT, Stanford, Caltech, and Cambridge universities. Establishing Dhahran Techno-Valley (DTV) Science Park was for bringing to KSA some of world most advanced industrial expertise. Dhahran Techno-Valley (DTV) Science Park succeeded in attracting R&amp;D centers for some of the world largest MNCs in energy, petroleum upstream and industrial instrumentation, automation and control. This was a major approach towards strategically focusing KFUPM research and creating platform for collaboration with industries on topics of utmost importance to KSA. Creating impact out of research outcomes has been another area KFUPM gave special attention for in developing the innovation ecosystem. This is why the university invested in building a system and an environment for technology commercialization. The investments included building facility for innovation support in the DTV Science Park. The facility encompasses an incubator for the starting enterprises and a center for new product development/prototyping to support technological advancement and transnational research. The support involves also funds allocated for proof-of-concept projects to support technology development and seed funds for startups. These plans, efforts, and investments resulted in the creation a substantial innovation push manifested by more than 1,000 patents. Although the pace of technology licensing has been slower than the pace of patenting, licensing activities started picking up during the last two years. Out of the issued patents to KFUPM 100 plus patents were licensed. Recently the university signed seven licensing deals. The licenses were issued for three local companies, two for one of the companies in the DTV Science Park, and two for US- and UK- based companies. Low levels of investments in R&amp;D by the local industry has always been a major challenge. However, technology commercialization related activities are expected to grow rapidly in the coming period as local industries will start investing more in R&amp;D due to changes currently reshaping the Saudi economy. Vision 2030 is a major driver for making that happen.</p><h4>Originally focused on the extraction and processing of natural resources, you have expanded your scope across a range of programs including renewables. Could you tell us more about those? </h4><p>The KFUPM research agenda includes programs for both conventional and unconventional energies. Though KFUPM established the College of Petroleum and Geosciences with an aim to position it among the top petroleum schools globally, no less attention is given for the renewables and sustainability. The university has a research excellence center for the renewable energy and critical level of research activities exists in the renewables' field. In the same direction, KFUPM signed lately major agreement with King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KACARE) to collaborate mainly in the field of renewables. Additionally, the university has an advanced center for water and environment studies. The center caters for significant part of the country's applied research needs and services and Saudi Aramco is one of its major clients. As well, the university established an excellence research center for water desalination as KSA is one of the leading global consumers for the desalination technologies. One technology for purifying the severely contaminated waters and another technology for detecting water leakage are among the technologies licensed by KFUPM. A large percentage of the portfolio of KFUPM research outcomes—in terms of either publications or patents—is in the fields of renewables, water, and environmental protection.</p><h4>Since mid-2018, women are welcomed into the graduate programs at KFUPM, so could you tell us more about that?</h4><p>The decision for admitting women to education was made at the appropriate time. KFUPM is known for the quality of its education and the high level of discipline of its programs. These are among the main reasons that make KFUPM graduates well regarded in the job market. These institutional targets for KFUPM were never subject for compromise. The special nature of KFUPM education, which is largely focused on serving specific industries and economic sectors, was also another challenge when it came to admitting female students. However, the clear directions of Vision 2030 for the empowerment of women and the recent changes the Saudi economy has witnessed have contributed to the creation of several new opportunities for women in the job market. These were among the major drivers behind the timeliness of the KFUPM decision to admit female graduate students in 2019. KFUPM looks forward to offering more potential opportunities to women in education.</p><h4>What are the main goals for the coming years? </h4><p>Improving quality and environment for the undergraduate education is a continuous goal for KFUPM. Making sure that the university graduates have good number of job opportunities and fulfilling the current and future recruitment needs of strategic local industries and sectors is part of the plan. KFUPM had been for several decades a research-based university. However, recently the university started planning to become a research-intensive university. This will enable reaching to critical level of research activities that is necessary for achieving the university economic impact targets. Attaining this requires increasing the number of faculty, full-time researches, and graduate students, postdocs in addition to the funding levels by significant orders of magnitude. Our goals and plans also take account of developing a master urban development plan that comprises the university main campus and the DTV Science Park in addition to the land allocated for the business park. The major aim of this is turning of the current innovation ecosystem of KFUPM into an innovation district is similar to those of knowledge-based economic development regions surrounding the research-intensive universities in North America. We are hopeful this will contribute to turning KFUPM and its surrounding ecosystem into the world capital of energy technologies. We hope these plans will make KFUPM a role model for economic development in KSA, and an effective participant in attaining Vision 2030 and positioning it among the world's most reputable universities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of IOEC's technical and engineering capabilities in the area of offshore oil-related construction?</h4><p>As one of the largest offshore companies in the Middle East, IOEC has been working on the design, engineering, and construction of offshore projects for over 25 years. With many completed and ongoing jobs in Iran and a number of international offshore projects in countries such as India, Oman, Qatar, Egypt, Nigeria, Venezuela, and others, we have the upper hand in Iran's offshore oil. We completed the construction work of the South Pars project in eight phases, including laying transport pipelines. We are also a well-known EPC company in the Middle East. In terms of engineering, IOEC designs transport pipelines and offshore platforms. In addition to many engineering projects in Iran, we also completed the engineering of Iran-Oman pipe laying project about two years ago. IOEC can lay 3-4km of offshore pipeline per day. Furthermore, we have the largest pipe coating factory in Iran, whose capacity exceeds 3.5km per day. Some of IOEC's latest fields of development constitute E&amp;P activities, maintenance, and asset integrity management (AIM), as well as renewable energy-related works. IOEC was successfully selected as one of the 18 companies authorized to carry out E&amp;P projects in Iran's oil and gas fields. For the next step we seek to participate in international projects in the abovementioned fields. IOEC has extended its substructures and capacities by procuring the required knowledge, assets, and machineries.</p><h4>Which of your projects in recent years have been of national or international significance?</h4><p>Almost all of our projects are significant in terms of project work volume and importance, given that the value of some of them is over USD1 billion. For example, the 12th, 19th, 20th, and 21st phases of the South Pars were all megaprojects in the true sense of the word, with more than USD1 billion spent on each. We have also managed to add approximately 200 million cbm per day to Iran's natural gas production, which is a truly remarkable feat by any standard. Being able to install equipment of up to 4,500 tons, IOEC has notable potentials in different areas, such as laying pipelines and erecting offshore platforms; we have served our neighboring countries in their time of need. In addition, we have carried out projects in the Black Sea, Indian Ocean, Qatar, Nigeria, and Oman.</p><h4>How do you intend to expand your overseas presence?</h4><p>Currently, because of falling oil prices, conditions are far from ideal for offshore companies almost everywhere in the world. Given the present financial circumstances, we are inclined to accept international projects, particularly in our neighboring countries. We are hopeful we will be chosen by Oman to construct a gas transport pipeline there soon. We have selected some countries as our main target markets, including Oman, India, Iraq, Qatar and Nigeria. We selected Oman as one of our major target markets as there are many opportunities in the energy market and strong diplomatic and political ties between Iran and Oman. There are more possibilities to work in this market. There are also several development projects that are set to be launched in the coming years in Oman, including oil and gas field development, renewable projects, pipe laying projects, petrochemical plant construction, and others, and we want to win the related tenders and gain our clients' trust in Oman. According to IOEC's slogan “We make difficult look easy," and we completely believe in our capabilities and abilities to complete a project in a timely and professional manner. At the moment, we are in the middle of negotiations for more overseas projects to enter new frontiers. Having the most professional and qualified human resource is our main competitive advantage, and our most important purpose is to satisfy our customers by providing the best solutions and fulfilling our responsibilities in a timely, appropriate, and efficient manner. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What market need did Salalah Methanol Company see in order to create the ammonia project?</h4><p>Salalah Methanol Company was formed in 2006 by Oman Oil Company as a state-of-the-art methanol production facility. The feedstock for the production of methanol is dry sweet natural gas supplied by the Ministry of Oil and Gas through the existing pipeline systems. We have the underlying infrastructure and most of the manufacturing facilities required to produce ammonia already embedded within the methanol facilities. Ammonia was commercially attractive, allowing us to fund the project entirely from the refinancing of existing Salalah Methanol Company assets to fund the project without relying on shareholders' equity.</p><h4>How will you be connected to the Port of Salalah, and what does it represent for your eventual export markets?</h4><p>Three years ago, the Port of Salalah built a new liquid jetty, requesting all industries that want to export to shift to the new liquid jetty. As a result, the ammonia project and Oman Gas Company's Salalah LPG project will connect the pipelines into the liquid jetty and then to the ships. This is the facility that we are building right now, and there is a pipe rack that has been constructed and will finish by early 2019. This pipe rack will be used to lay down our pipelines into the liquid jetty to connect our facilities with the port.</p><h4>Who are the end users of your product?</h4><p>Our target market is the fertilizer industry. If we target small industries, we expect it to be costly, especially if we plan to export the entire product. The majority of the cost will be shipping related. Companies in the fertilizer industry that seek raw materials to produce urea or other types of fertilizers buy ammonia as a feedstock. With that in mind, our market is Asia, mainly India and China. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What specific initiatives can be undertaken in 2018 to promote the international competitiveness of the Omani petroleum industry?</h4><p>Most of what is happening now is about diversification, even in the oil and gas industry. Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) will enter the energy sector and harness new methods of generation, and we will see a greater focus on that moving forward. Miraah, for example, will use solar energy instead of gas for steam production, and we expect more such projects to surface. We will also see a greater focus on efficiency. In the last three or four years, we have been struggling to ensure that we are efficient and provide value to the government by reducing the cost of production. That has been one of the main focus for operators and discussions between operators and contractors: finding the best means of saving every dollar to reduce the cost of production.</p><h4>Looking at industry standards, how do you expect them to improve the operating landscape?</h4><p>It is mainly a focus on reducing costs. Looking at companies such as Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY), BP, PDO, and even smaller companies, they all have their own standards. As a result, contractors have to follow each one separately, which increases operating expenses. We move to ensure that we can contain costs by establishing common standards that are applicable across the sector. Thus, contractors will see their vehicles checked once instead of three or four times, and drivers will acquire a single defensive driving certificate so that they do not have to get them from all the major companies. We also looked at the heat stress index, as all drilling contractors faced problems due to the law requiring processes to be stopped between 12pm and 4pm, interfering with the fact that drilling cannot just be stopped. Summer 2018 will be the first time our new heat stress index standard, approved by the Ministry of Manpower, will apply across the spectrum. The new standard ensures that when the temperature reaches a certain level, rest periods are granted, and employees take turns to retire to air-conditioned cabins. We have also established a “drop standard," since there were many cases where dropping objects were causing safety hazards. We are working with subject matter experts on occupational health standards as well, which will hopefully be taken up by the government to be applied to everyone across the country.</p><h4>How is OPAL involved in the training of Omani engineers and technicians?</h4><p>There are two new private institutes here: Oman Institute of Oil and Gas (instOG) is a high-end petroleum engineering training body, while TPO is a high-end technician level institute. We have our own small center similar to TPO. BP granted us a technician training center in 2017, with the capacity to train around 100 high-end technicians. We have been working with the Ministry of Manpower for a few years to build up the local vocational colleges to an international level. Young Omani graduates who had graduated from technical colleges had to be retrained when they joined the oil and gas sector, which did not make sense and cost a great deal of money. BP built this training center at a high expense so that it could train 120 technicians and operators because the government schools did not produce the technicians that were needed. We are now tasked with working with those technical colleges so that they can be trained at a level that makes them ready to work with us straight away. We are working with the Ministry of Manpower to develop occupational standards for mechanical technicians, welders, safety officers, and logistics. The vocational training center assigned to OPAL as a pilot took on the second batch of 150 students at the end of 2018. The idea is not to rely on private colleges or private institutions; we want the government to be self-reliant in churning out the right caliber of technicians required for the oil and gas sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Takatuf involved in helping the oil and gas industry reach its target of supplying 5,000 new jobs to Omanis?</h4><p>Takatuf has been an ambassador for a new business belief where human capital is not just about investing in people and training them, but seeing them as strategic drivers of change. Takatuf was formed as a people consulting company five years ago, and in a short time, it has established a reputation for providing sound strategic thinking and effective human capital solutions. In this regard, we have deployed a number of these solutions to help many organizations in the energy sector in Oman achieve their hiring targets of Omanis. With Omanization high on the agenda, one of the key challenges that companies face is meeting the targets whilst being mindful of making it sustainable and effective. Omanization is not just about numbers, but about assigning the right people to the right roles and adding value to people functions rather than burdening it. Takatuf has identified two distinct types of Omanization. One is linked to growth and job creation as a result of progress. Second, for organizations that are not looking at an aggressive evolution curve, the challenge is to identify functions and roles that qualified Omani nationals can take to replace existing resources.</p><h4>What training do new Omani employees need?</h4><p>One of the core themes formulated in Vision 2020 was the development of human resources and capabilities of Omani nationals to keep pace with technical development, manage the changes therein with efficiency, and be prepared for the dynamic domestic and global environment. Being part of the Oman Oil Group, Takatuf shares this vision and national agenda. Takatuf is not just a consulting company, but a strategic investor in the human capital requirements for the nation. We have partnered with Petrofac to set up Takatuf Petrofac Oman Institute (TPO), a new purpose-built training institute in Oman. TPO will deliver a range of world-class, internationally accredited technical training programs, tailored to meet the needs of the industry. Similarly, we have partnered with Schlumberger to set up the Oman Institute for Oil &amp; Gas (instOG), a premier state-of-the-art institute dedicated to training and development of individuals in the upstream oil and gas industry. Aside of these business focused people development programs, Takatuf has also established a successful national initiative, the Takatuf Scholars Program, which is aimed at identifying and building the next generation of young Omani leaders through a global academic enrichment program. To date, the program has helped provide close to 350 graduates, with over 100 of them receiving international scholarships.</p><h4>How does the public sector compare to the private sector in Omanization advances?</h4><p>In well-established, government-owned organizations, Omanization is not a major issue; in fact, Omanis lead at all ranks. And it is working in these companies because they have put in enough effort to develop their people and make them ready to take those roles. However, the reality in some sectors in the private sector is not the same. The institutes that we built are expected to play a major role in providing highly qualified, competent, and job-ready local workforce that can fill the gap in the private sector as well as grow Omanization targets, especially in highly skilled jobs.</p><h4>In which sectors of the economy outside of oil and gas is there a need for training programs?</h4><p>As part of its economic diversification plan, the government has identified a number of key non-oil sectors to focus on in the next phase, including tourism, mining, construction, logistics, and manufacturing. Many of these sectors will require a competent local workforce to lead so they can achieve high Omanization targets at all levels, hence the importance of developing comprehensive solutions involving designing effective training programs, changing the mindset toward work, and, in some sectors, a regulation change. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[gaining-market-share]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Vanguard expanded its manufacturing capacity?</h4><p>Vanguard Engineering and Oilfield Services has expanded its manufacturing facilities by adding new equipment and machinery, which has completed the product cycle for us. This brought us new customers who look to do in-country value (ICV) for client companies here, but do not want to make such a large investment because it is not feasible for them. These multinational companies are interested in building their products in Oman with us because we can provide full service for their products from A to Z, ensuring that they do not have to split their manufacturing between various locations. Vanguard can provide them with a price-competitive turnkey solution; however, we still have to balance manufacturing with importing products. It is about maximizing the use and efficiency of our machinery to get a more competitive product out there because there is a great deal of competition in the global market.</p><h4>How does Vanguard differentiate its products and manufacturing processes to make the company more attractive in markets internationally?</h4><p>There are various segments, and it is difficult to talk in general terms. The strategy varies depending on the product type. When it comes to highly complex and technical products, there is less competition. When it comes to run-of-the-mill products and solutions, there is strong competition. In these cases, we just do parts manufacturing for bigger suppliers and act as their sub-vendors. This is easier for us than having to build a brand and going out to market it.</p><h4>How does the government promote local manufacturers like Vanguard?</h4><p>In many instances, it has sought to promote local manufacturing with offers and tenders being specific to locals; however, the government wants to achieve a balance and does not want companies to think that just because they manufacture locally they will win the business. Companies have to compete technically and commercially in whatever field they are. The government will give local companies preference depending on their ICV percentage, though it also looks at international companies' ICV efforts. Large international companies all have local offices and also meet a certain ICV percentage, and the government rewards them for those efforts. We are currently not able to have 100% local manufacturing, though we are gradually increasing that figure and gaining more market share, growing internationally, and getting more volume. Vanguard is still in the early phase of identifying and setting up the resources for doing all that technically and commercially.</p><h4>For which skill sets is it difficult to find qualified Omani staff?</h4><p>In the upstream segment and field-related activities we employ all Omanis. There is no challenge there because the skills are available. However, for technical jobs on the manufacturing and sales sides, that skillset is missing. There are thin margins in manufacturing, and the pay is significantly lower. It also takes four or five years for an engineering graduate to build up the specific skills. It is tricky and cannot be fixed overnight. The government and the industry know the challenges and seek to find different solutions. However, it is a long-term game, and we all have to work together. We have had discussions with certain colleges and have given suggestions to the Ministry of Manpower. One idea is to have a mandatory internship program for all students so they know what the industry graduates, and the minimum wage means they are not striving to obtain job skills to help them survive and compete in the workforce.</p><h4>What are your operational objectives for the coming 12 months?</h4><p>We want to consolidate our resources, which will give us better utilization of resources and cut down on communication time and bureaucracy. This is an aggressive move that will strengthen our team, bring it together, and identify more opportunities. Currently, different companies in the group deal in different markets, and we can replicate this experience and grow together. We have an aggressive plan to grow by 10 times. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of IOEC's technical and engineering capabilities in the area of offshore oil-related construction?</h4><p>As one of the largest offshore companies in the Middle East, IOEC has been working on the design, engineering, and construction of offshore projects for over 25 years. With many completed and ongoing jobs in Iran and a number of international offshore projects in countries such as India, Oman, Qatar, Egypt, Nigeria, Venezuela, and others, we have the upper hand in Iran's offshore oil. We completed the construction work of the South Pars project in eight phases, including laying transport pipelines. We are also a well-known EPC company in the Middle East. In terms of engineering, IOEC designs transport pipelines and offshore platforms. In addition to many engineering projects in Iran, we also completed the engineering of Iran-Oman pipe laying project about two years ago. IOEC can lay 3-4km of offshore pipeline per day. Furthermore, we have the largest pipe coating factory in Iran, whose capacity exceeds 3.5km per day. Some of IOEC's latest fields of development constitute E&amp;P activities, maintenance, and asset integrity management (AIM), as well as renewable energy-related works. IOEC was successfully selected as one of the 18 companies authorized to carry out E&amp;P projects in Iran's oil and gas fields. For the next step we seek to participate in international projects in the abovementioned fields. IOEC has extended its substructures and capacities by procuring the required knowledge, assets, and machineries.</p><h4>Which of your projects in recent years have been of national or international significance?</h4><p>Almost all of our projects are significant in terms of project work volume and importance, given that the value of some of them is over USD1 billion. For example, the 12th, 19th, 20th, and 21st phases of the South Pars were all megaprojects in the true sense of the word, with more than USD1 billion spent on each. We have also managed to add approximately 200 million cbm per day to Iran's natural gas production, which is a truly remarkable feat by any standard. Being able to install equipment of up to 4,500 tons, IOEC has notable potentials in different areas, such as laying pipelines and erecting offshore platforms; we have served our neighboring countries in their time of need. In addition, we have carried out projects in the Black Sea, Indian Ocean, Qatar, Nigeria, and Oman.</p><h4>How do you intend to expand your overseas presence?</h4><p>Currently, because of falling oil prices, conditions are far from ideal for offshore companies almost everywhere in the world. Given the present financial circumstances, we are inclined to accept international projects, particularly in our neighboring countries. We are hopeful we will be chosen by Oman to construct a gas transport pipeline there soon. We have selected some countries as our main target markets, including Oman, India, Iraq, Qatar and Nigeria. We selected Oman as one of our major target markets as there are many opportunities in the energy market and strong diplomatic and political ties between Iran and Oman. There are more possibilities to work in this market. There are also several development projects that are set to be launched in the coming years in Oman, including oil and gas field development, renewable projects, pipe laying projects, petrochemical plant construction, and others, and we want to win the related tenders and gain our clients' trust in Oman. According to IOEC's slogan “We make difficult look easy," and we completely believe in our capabilities and abilities to complete a project in a timely and professional manner. At the moment, we are in the middle of negotiations for more overseas projects to enter new frontiers. Having the most professional and qualified human resource is our main competitive advantage, and our most important purpose is to satisfy our customers by providing the best solutions and fulfilling our responsibilities in a timely, appropriate, and efficient manner. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the current market demand figures for industrial salt, and what are the primary uses of it?</h4><p>The global industrial salts market is expected to reach USD15.9 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. The rising demand for industrial salts with increasing penetration in wide range of application industries including chemical processing, water treatment, and agriculture is expected to drive market growth over the forecast period. Chlor-alkali sector in the chemical industry is a major consumer of salt for manufacturing of caustic soda and chlorine. Global industrial salt consumption is forecast to grow 1.9% annually through 2020 to 335 million metric tons, valued at USD14.1 billion. Steady gains in the Asia Pacific and Africa and Middle East regions, as well as in North America, will support market increases. The average price for salt across the world is forecast to rise 2% per year to USD42 per metric ton in 2020, rebounding from a low 2015 base. Through 2020, however, a more stable commodities market and increases in global demand in volume terms will boost gains. Byproducts of industrial salts are major industrial products such as caustic soda and chlorine; salt is used in many industrial processes including manufacturing polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp, and many other products. In the oil and gas industry, salt is used to increase the density of mud and soil, which creates a more safe and efficient drilling rig. Although salt may not be used extensively in offshore drilling, enormous amounts of salt are required to facilitate drilling on land. Pharmaceutical companies also use salt in the process of making capsules, as well as the production of saline solutions, which have widespread secondary uses. Saline solutions are not only useful for contact solution, but also for intravenous formulas. Salt use by the medical and pharmaceutical companies accounts for a large percentage of the total national industrial salt usage. The majority of the world's industrial salt is also used to de-ice roads and to create a safer driving surface, not only for the public, but for government use as well. 60-80% of globally mined salt is used to improve the safety of public transit in one capacity or another, though usually to reduce the freezing point of snow and ice. Salt is often spread on roads prior to inclement weather, allowing a surface layer of brine to provide further protection against ice.</p><h4>Outside of Duqm, which areas of your business have the most revenue growth?</h4><p>The oil and gas industry brought Al-Ghalbi International to its remarkable position in the last 19 years, and the oil and gas sector has played a key part in our revenues. The hard work of our professionally and technically empowered staff from the beginning of our organization has helped lift the organization further on its growth path and has placed the company in the good books of various clients in the industry.</p><h4>In the near future, what oilfield activities will be in most demand, and how does Al-Ghalbi intend to capture that business?</h4><p>Al-Ghalbi has made a strong stand among all major clients and operators in the oil and gas sector in Oman. We started with the maintenance sector and spread our wings into installation, construction, and quickly specialized pipeline engineering services. The core part, maintenance, will continue to be in demand even during slowdowns of further subsidiary sectors of oil and gas.</p><h4>What are your primary objectives over the next 12 months?</h4><p>Al-Ghalbi International seeks to diversify its business plans, enter into various sectors including ICT, advertising, media, publishing, facilities management, tourism, catering, and hospitality services, and create milestones in each sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will BHGE's operations in Oman change following the completion of GE's divestment in the company?</h4><p>GE's plans should have no impact on BHGE's operations. BHGE is committed to its strategy and to delivering for its customers. The separation will provide BHGE with an enhanced agility and ability to focus on leading in the oil and gas industry in Oman, as we have been doing now for decades. Historically, BHGE has had a strong track record in Oman. In addition, we are proud to increase the Omanization percentage to more than 85%, through our strong presence and strong government collaboration, resulting in skilled and capable local talents who are in a position to lead large-scale projects. Our history shows our commitment to Oman, which we intend on continuing and growing after our separation from GE in two to three years. This separation will take time, and both GE and BHGE are committed to an orderly process. The BHGE leadership team deeply values the benefits GE brings to the company but has been running a separate, publicly traded company with its own capabilities. We are not dependent on GE to succeed and are well positioned for growth on our own.</p><h4>How is BHGE's digitization sector impacting the activities of the oil and gas industry?</h4><p>Companies today are striving for ways to get connected to optimize their oil and gas operations. With only 3-5% of oil and gas equipment digitally connected, there is so much opportunity to spread technology, which will make the whole industry more efficient. By doing so, our customers can benefit from significant cost savings and increased maintenance effectiveness, avoiding unplanned downtime and maximizing equipment availability and production throughput. This is all done while reducing operational risks and improving safety. As a digital industrial company, we have many solutions that help drive efficiencies, productivity and better customer outcomes. Only BHGE has a full-stream capability: the portfolio, the technology and the people to radically transform the oil and gas industry and deliver unparalleled improvement in industrial yield for our customers.<br>How does BHGE support the oil and gas industry's efforts to improve production efficiency?<br>A vast majority of Omani wells require enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies to maintain and maximize production. Our portfolio of efficient, reliable and integrated EOR artificial lift solutions can overcome every technical challenge, and our experienced in-country engineering teams can advise on the best solutions throughout the lifecycle of the well and then keep them operating at peak performance to deliver the expected production rates and the lowest possible lifting costs. BHGE is the largest supplier of artificial lift systems in Oman, and we consolidate the whole process, as we are the only company that designs and manufactures each major component, so every part works together seamlessly and efficiently. This improves reliability and extends system run life in a range of demanding oilfield conditions.</p><p><br><br><br>What is BHGE's primary focus moving forward?<br>Service companies aspire to offer new technologies that deliver sustainable and efficient operations, and BHGE is the first and only full-stream company to bring together industry-leading equipment, services, and digital solutions across the entire spectrum of oil and gas development. Our focus is to invent smarter ways to bring energy to the world; our main strategy is to use our latest technologies and artificial intelligence to optimize costs and increase efficiency. The recent downturn and the disruptive approaches brought along, are redefining the shape of our industry. Oman is an important market for BHGE; we are leveraging our full-stream capabilities from upstream to midstream to downstream. This portfolio positions us to create new sources of value, improving productivity and project economics through integrated equipment and service offerings. In Oman, we are always striving to present the best service and innovative solutions that enhance production while efficiently controlling costs; this is reflected through our strong EOR technologies presence especially the latest artificial lift solutions ranging from ESPs to gas lift systems and others. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[four-main-pillars]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Oman Oil Marketing Company's strategy to diversify its revenue streams to reach 40% of local market share by 2025?</h4><p>Our strategy stands on four main pillars: navigating into near markets, growing through non-fuel revenues, exploring new investments, and optimizing our operations and managing efficiently new business models. We plan to increase our market share through having new customers and service stations and by increasing our sales per customer. Another of our focuses is engaging more with customers by continually studying what our customers need and want. We are initiating a company-wide transformation involving all our departments and using marketing and digital. Another of our initiatives is to grow in logistics through our bunkering business in Duqm, which will be essential for our expansion plans in other countries. Another key focus is on human capital. In 2018, we aim to develop and train more people through our OOMCO Academy, where we use coaching as well as internal and external training .</p><h4>What are your objectives for the next 12 months?</h4><p>We have a clear 10-year plan, though as we are a publicly listed company we cannot reveal the whole. We will develop across all fields, though our priorities depend on the level of market potential, our strategic vision, and the returns for shareholders. We believe in diversifying our services and exceeding customer expectations while leading the market through introducing new services to transform our service stations to hub of services, so our customers can enjoy a diversified offering. We have development projects both in Oman and other countries like KSA, in fuels and lubricants as well as non-fuel related developments in the field of our Ahlain convenience store, restaurants and various services. We also thrive on improving OOMCO internal processes to generate more cash flows for our shareholders and recruit/train the future Omani leaders through the diversity of our initiatives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Gulf Energy currently positioned in the market?</h4><p>We are well positioned in Oman as an industry-leading provider of integrated energy services and solutions and plan to increase our footprint in new countries and enlarge our customer portfolio. We are a customer-centric company; customer satisfaction is at the center of everything we do. We deliver fit for purpose technologies and solutions with best-in-class service. Today, we are growing and exporting our capabilities to the GCC with a major focus on Qatar, KSA, and Kuwait, where there is a huge growth potential and employment opportunities for Omani nationals. Gulf Energy has a solid foundation in drilling and production services, and we want to continue to expand our capabilities by adding more services. We have a strong partnership with many technology providers worldwide who want to introduce their technologies to Oman and the region through Gulf Energy.</p><h4>How are you working to increase your manufacturing capabilities in Oman?</h4><p>We believe in building local capabilities alongside our local partners. We continue to build up our in-country value (ICV), and this includes employing nationals as well as forming real partnerships with technology providers through joint ventures. One of the successful ICV stories from Gulf Energy is the fishing and milling tools manufacturing facility, which is becoming the foundation for future R&amp;D. The facility is equipped with the latest technologies and is run by local manpower, which localizes knowledge and services delivered. We are also working on a new manufacturing facility for cementing and casing accessories in Nizwa. Today, these products are imported, and the manufacturing capacity for this facility is expected to cover the needs of Oman and the region. All this will also create more employment opportunities for Omanis and open new horizons in manufacturing capabilities for Oman.</p><h4>How are you focusing on improving operational efficiency?</h4><p>Gulf Energy has been a player in supporting the industry and a force for efficiency. We work closely with our customers, improving operational efficiency by providing conventional and unconventional solutions. We are developing and providing the latest technology for our clients according to their requirements. We also want to create a high-performance culture to maintain a sustainable staffing profile in a bid to achieve and improve our operational efficiency. </p><h4>What are your plans and objectives for the coming five years?</h4><p>We have plans to export different types of solutions and new technologies to Oman and the MENA region. This is to enhance, improve, and resolve today's oil and gas technical challenges. In five years, we plan to make Gulf Energy the center of excellence for drilling services. We look forward to gradually improving efficiency by using the data we have collected over the several years we spent running this business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[leveraging-capabilities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key initiatives is STS undertaking to diversify its business offering?</h4><p>One initiative to diversify STS is our recent acquisition of Refrigeration Engineering International (REI), a specialist process engineering company with a global reach. STS decided to go down the process engineering route for a number of reasons. One is that it greatly diversifies STS' business and provides us with access to a number of different clients and geographical locations. Another reason for the acquisition is that it enables us to leverage our significant fabrication and manufacturing capabilities, and we see a strong offering as a group to provide process engineering and fabrication solutions together. The second key initiative we are working on is developing a piping well overlay facility in Ras Al Khaimah, which will be commissioned in 2Q2019. The facility will specialize in pipe cladding on a commercial scale. The main focus of that business is to improve our ability to serve our regional client base and market. The third initiative is through our recently acquired detailed engineering capability in Muscat. This has about 50 engineers in all disciplines. One of the main reasons we went down this path is that many of our clients demand a certain amount of engineering services from us. The fourth initiative is expanding in Duqm, where we are establishing a major asset to serve the downstream oil and gas industry there, which will be a significant segment in terms of investment over the coming 10 years.</p><h4>How key are joint ventures to STS' business?</h4><p>Our joint ventures represent around 40-50% of our business overall. There is one key benefit: knowledge. STS would not have been able to participate in any of the businesses that we currently have through our JVs if we did not have a strategic JV partner. One of the biggest mistakes organizations make in forming JVs is that they partner with entities that do the same things they do. With all three of our JVs, our partners have brought capabilities that we do not have to the partnership. STS brings the local market knowledge and know-how of finance, administration, and infrastructure, and our partners bring in their specialized know-how. These JVs are long term; they have been operating for at least seven years, with one in excess of 10 years. Having complementary capabilities is key in a JV.</p><h4>Which sub-sectors of the industrial sector is STS most involved in?</h4><p>Aluminum is one, which is an industrial metal manufacturing facility through our STAREF JV. Recently, we have been expanding our presence in the power sector. Our electrical and instrumentation group has been involved in power generation projects through the construction of power stations. We have worked with Finish group Wärtsilä and French company SUEZ (now ENGIE). We also have some involvement in the desalination industry. Generally, we try to stay in the oil and gas industry, though our industrial involvement is an opportunity to diversify our business and also leverage our capacities from the oil and gas industry. The requirements and standards in the oil and gas industry are extremely high, so it is not dissimilar to many of the standards and requirements for industrial projects.</p><h4>How important is the involvement of Omanis in the growth of STS?</h4><p>It is vitally important that we continue to train and employ Omanis into our business. STS currently employs 2,850 Omanis. Every year, we have an Omani Graduate Development Program. Another thing we are doing is opening a purpose-built training facility in 2Q2019. We have been training Omanis for years, and this has been spread over our various company offices, workshops, and other sites. This training center will be a proper designated facility and is 100% STS funded. Our shareholders want to reinvest in the market and help the general economy by training and developing young Omanis. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What new projects do you expect from the MoU Shell signed with the government of Oman?</h4><p>Today, we are looking toward a new chapter in our partnership with the Sultanate of Oman. The MoU covers upstream gas exploration and development, gas-to-liquids (GTL), LNG, and renewable energies, and we hope it leads to exploring and developing important new sources of gas. If so, it will pave the way to monetizing the country's natural gas sources, in particular, GTL. GTL in Oman would generate valuable revenue and create wider social and economic opportunities for Omanis in the process. The government has rightly placed emphasis on new energy projects that focus on economic growth and job creation and developing Omani talent and contributing to in-country value. Our company is keen to build on the things we have achieved with our partners in Oman. Throughout our history, we have experienced how strong partnerships are the bedrock for successful projects, benefiting our partners and shareholders alike.</p><h4>How is Shell using enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies within Oman?</h4><p>Our 34% stake in Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) is our biggest involvement in EOR, and we have had a long strategic alliance with PDO on EOR technologies. We have strategic alliances on a range of technical issues, but EOR is the centerpiece. PDO is interesting because it has chemical, thermal, and gas EOR. Oman is the only country that is using all three techniques at a full scale. There are another 19-20 pilot projects that PDO is working on, and we are helping with several of those. We are now looking at ways to make these techniques cheaper so that EOR technologies become more robust in periods of low oil prices. Soon, we will operate in Oman ourselves, with our 50% stake in block 42, though at the moment we are only involved in non-operated joint ventures.</p><h4>How does Shell work to improve production efficiency and cost efficiency within Oman?</h4><p>This is essentially the core purpose of our work in Oman. We seek to enhance the abilities of our joint ventures and make them even more world-class organizations than they already are. We leverage our global expertise and learn from our partners; therefore, it is a collaborative relationship. Our interactions cover the areas of people, technology, processes, and more. We bring in our Shell expertise and share knowledge with our joint ventures, and, where necessary, we support them in delivering improvement programs.</p><h4>What is Shell's strategy for reaching Omanization targets?</h4><p>One of the key drivers for putting together our proposals for the projects in the MoU was employment creation, and we want to maximize the number of Omani jobs. That is our objective, which is why we proposed a GTL plant and extending the longevity of Oman LNG beyond 2025. It is also why we are looking at renewables as an area that is particularly well suited to Omani SMEs. Shell Oman Marketing Company has been awarded for its Omanization efforts due to its rate of almost 90%. In oil and gas, the Omanization target is 90%, and both PDO and Oman LNG are on their way to hitting that. We are focusing on a solid set of programs for transitioning people into positions of technical independence. The Omanization targets focus on talent development. We have also been training SMEs on how to build their own companies and increase their employment numbers as a direct result of the contact they have with us.</p><h4>What are Shell's long-term commitments to Oman?</h4><p>We have plans in place for 20-30 years. We are proud of our history in Oman and fully committed to the country's future. We see the new business in block 42, the upstream gas and related projects in GTL, and renewables as setting a growth agenda for Shell in Oman. This growth agenda is aligned and integrated with Oman's own growth projections and perspectives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Refineries tend to create a great deal of economic value through the promotion of accompanying downstream industries. They are not a huge job creator in themselves, though refineries create many downstream industries to support the overall economy of the location, which is what a zone like Duqm is created for and is what Oman looks for. These downstream petrochemical industries will be incentivized to come to Duqm because of its state-of art infrastructure, tax advantages and advanced logistics that are already in place. With Duqm refinery, Oman's refining capacity will increase from 300,000bpd to over 500,000bpd, and the product mix will grow, further enabling large-scale petrochemical and added-value industries, and increasing exports. The Duqm Refinery complements and enlarges the landscape of the energy industry in Oman.</p><h4>How important is OOC's utilities company, Marafiq, for development in Duqm?</h4><p>Efficient, well-run utilities are essential for all industries. Investors need access to specific things in any industrial areas, such as utilities, access to ports, storage, and pipelines. Marafiq will provide all the utilities required for our projects in Duqm as well as other projects in the zone. We are working closely with the zone authority to ensure excellent coordination between our projects and zone's infrastructure projects as these projects are being developed at the same time. We are developing a well-integrated system at Ras Markaz Crude Hub, where very large crude carriers (VLCCs) can load and offload crude oil for the refineries. Refined exports are planned through the product terminal at Duqm Port. All investors will have access to this system and can share these infrastructure facilities, which is where the cost efficiencies come in.</p><h4>What are your plans to export downstream products that will be produced in the coming years?</h4><p>The refinery has been designed with a capacity of 230,000bpd with product mix based on intensive market studies and the ability to feed world-scale petrochemical projects. The size and configuration of the upcoming petrochemical complex will be designed not to compete but to fill gaps in the petrochemicals product range. The naphtha and LPG from refinery will be initially exported and subsequently processed within Oman to produce petrochemicals when the petrochemical project is commissioned around 2025. We need to plan out further downstream chemicals projects using the petrochemical products and attract Omani private sector to invest in such small and medium projects. We have been approached by many international investors looking for feedstock from the petrochemical project.</p><h4>Which energy sub sectors will you focus on going forward?</h4><p>We focus on three areas: growing the upstream exploration and production, developing and integrating the downstream—refining and petrochemicals—and growing the energy infrastructure business, which includes the power sector. In parallel, we are growing our trading activities globally. Downstream, Duqm Petrochemicals complex is expected to be competed by 2025, and there are two projects in Salalah: ammonia and LPG extraction that both are now under construction, and the Liwa Plastic project developed by ORPIC in Sohar and expected to commission in 2019/20. There is growing demand in the power sector and its associated infrastructure, as well as development in renewables, which OOC would like to play an active role in. In infrastructure on the oil side, we are investing in projects related to safe storage, pipelines, and gathering stations. To grow our companies, we need to know how best to position them in terms of market and feedstock access. Further down the road, we have to prepare the next generation of petrochemicals projects, which will be larger and more complex than refineries. We still need to find our niche in the market and the best product mix. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you determine when to divest in a holding?</h4><p>Al Anwar Holdings has long been driven by a philosophy that centers on creating sources of non-oil based revenue. Our board has been mandated by the shareholders to invest in certain sectors where we have scope of value addition in the processes or business. We are currently working to divest from National Biscuit, which represented a fantastic investment opportunity for us, but since the company is run by professional management under the able guidance of other shareholders, who are experts in the field, we had limited scope for value addition. The board typically reviews a company's future potential and how we can improve its value, which works well in limited sectors where we have expertise.</p><h4>Why did Al Anwar shift its focus to the financial services sector?</h4><p>Risk mitigation policy played a major factor. Each sector has its own underlying set of risk, which determines the level of investment risks to be taken by savvy investors. We have defined a range of reasonable risk for our holdings, and the financial services sector was the lower and upper limit for investment. At the same time, we also understand that the financial services sector has a leveraging impact with the economy, and therefore, we needed to focus on it. It was mainly about balancing certain sectors against others, and how we manage our risk portfolio. The board of Al Anwar Holdings is comprised of successful entrepreneurs and business leaders that make smart decisions toward sectors we can contribute in.</p><h4>What sectors in Oman represent the best hedging opportunity?</h4><p>There are many hedging strategies within, say, the industrial sector; however, we primarily hedge through diversifying the sectors we focus on. For example, we see excellent opportunities in education and healthcare. Oman is a big country whose demography is an advantage. Therefore, we see many opportunities to invest in various sectors to hedge our bets. Education and healthcare are two defensive sectors of the economy that in the long run will continue to contribute to society. The population is young, and there is huge potential for growth as more children go to school. </p><h4>What differentiates the Omani market from those in the rest of the GCC?</h4><p>The GCC markets are mainly driven by oil and gas revenue. Oman is different because it has less dependence on oil wealth. At the same time, it is not tax free for the corporate sector. Other neighboring markets tend to be more so, up until the beginning of 2018, when the UAE introduced its first VAT, a significant game changer. Oman has not yet introduced VAT and is waiting to see how it impacts the UAE. The other thing that makes Oman unique is its local population and its intrinsic need to diversify.</p><h4>How are you implementing your diversification strategy over the next year?</h4><p>We are setting up a new project in Duqm and constructing a new four-star business hotel that will be run and managed by Novotel. There will also be managed offices spaces for customers. We have recently invested in the education sector and are working to expand in this. At the same time, we are exploring the possibility of investing in healthcare. We aim to expand in hospitality, hospitals, schools, and other industries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the biggest challenges in establishing Thawani?</h4><p>Thawani was officially established in 2016 to create an entirely new market in Oman, not just a new application for payments. There is a big responsibility on our shoulders, as we are creating the foundations for the fintech market here. The idea was born more than eight years ago when we realized that our payment channels might not be able to support massive technological growth in the market, or new concepts and businesses, which were stalling e-commerce companies at the payments phase. We realized something had to be done in this regard and set about gaining an understanding of payments, payment networks, banks, and so on. We then built a strong business model to close most of the gaps we saw in Oman and the region. However, it was difficult to attract investors because there was no way for us to be licensed at the time. This issue is still being resolved today. Getting investors to believe in and support us was perhaps the toughest part of establishing this business. However, we managed to do it by being close to the regulators and investors, addressing their concerns, mitigating the risks, and creating a win-win situation. Being the first means we had to accept many challenges and risks.</p><h4>What is Thawani's revenue model, and how do you get merchants to use your system?</h4><p>We only have a per use transaction fee that we charge merchants; we do not charge anything else. To get merchants onboard, we made it easy for them to decide to use Thawani. There is no setup fee or contractual commitment. This helped us considerably because there are no upfront financial implications for them. They can use our platform whenever they want and stop whenever they like. For now, my focus is on merchant and customer acquisition. Every fintech company in the world dreams of going international right away, which is why they are never profitable. They just re-inject whatever money they make into supporting their growth. For the next five years, our main focus is on growth rather than revenue, although revenue is certainly important to us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much demand has the HSBC seen for its bank guarantee products?</h4><p>HSBC is focused on larger local and international players for its bank guarantee products, as many of them require performance and guarantee bonds. We choose to compete in sectors where we see positive growth. We are not deeply entrenched in the SME sector. There is a central bank-mandated 5% target for SME lending that few, if any, banks have managed to hit so far. However, this is not because there is a shortage of cash for the SME sector. Given that all banks have this target and none of us have hit it, this suggests there is more money than demand. We help SMEs in other ways, such as seminars with accountants and lawyers to provide financial, legal, and accounting advice. Through our CSR initiatives, we also help some small businesses in craft industries with environmental and education issues. </p><h4>How does HSBC attempt to better reach Oman's rural or under-banked population?</h4><p>HSBC has the third-broadest network across Oman. We have branches in fairly remote places, such as towns near the Yemeni and Saudi borders, and in Haima near the oil fields. Younger bank customers use ATMS and mobile, internet, and telephone banking more often. As a result, we have merged a few of our branches because there was not as much demand for them.</p><h4>How has the market received mobile internet banking in Oman?</h4><p>HSBC has had internet banking in Oman for many years. We were one of the first banks with a mobile banking app and the first to have an Arabic app. Offsetting a considerable drop in manual transactions over the last two years, digital transactions have grown quickly in corporate and retail alike.</p><h4>Are there an adequate number of banks for Oman's population?</h4><p>Banking services are readily available to nearly everyone in Oman. HSBC has 300,000-400,000 clients spread across the country and is one of two or three banks that have broad networks. If anything, Oman is overbanked—there are too many banks for the market, especially when we consider the presence of Islamic banking as well as the conventional banking sector. In terms of borrowing, most people have borrowed up to the hilt. This is why there have been discussions around several potential mergers. </p><h4>How have the banking industry and HSBC been impacted by the introduction of IFRS9?</h4><p>The initial impact has been positive. IFRS9 is an attempt to produce more consistency across the banking sector. However, because of the way IFRS9 is constructed, banks can take several different approaches to running models behind it for forecasting credit losses going forward. So, there is some inconsistency in the approach, which the Central Bank is aware of. HSBC takes a particular approach that is both global and conservative because there has been some increase in our provisioning. We expect this to continue into 2019.</p><h4>What regulatory measures could be introduced to further modernize the banking industry?</h4><p>The central bank has a new executive president, and only time will tell what his particular focus will be. He has had discussions with us and other banks and regulators, and he travels extensively and is well informed and connected, so I expect changes coming through and for him to continue the path of modernization set by his predecessor. The Oman Bankers Association has also highlighted a number of areas where some relaxation might take place. One example is the 6% interest rate cap on personal loans that has been in place for six or seven years. In this time, the cost of funding these loans has risen. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of your objectives and priorities as CEO?</h4><p>Our dynamic new vision, “To serve you better, everyday" marks a clear progression of the bank's commitment to customer service excellence. The customer-centric vision, values, and strategic pillars of the bank are focused on enhancing market leadership, efficiency, productivity, innovation, and agility by offering simplified and integrated banking solutions. Bank Muscat enjoys the unique positioning of stable leadership and a competent management team committed to sustainable growth. As of July 2018, Bank Muscat leads with over 35% market share and assets worth OMR11.6 billion. By enhancing co-operation with key economic sectors in the country, we will continue the successful journey to achieve more growth. Moreover, with outstanding Omani leadership at all levels, the bank has achieved close to 95% Omanization. By developing competent human resources and adopting cutting-edge technology, the bank continues to provide a 'best in class' service, marking its differentiation with innovative digital channels and products catering to all segments. The bank will also focus on strong asset growth and innovation to improve its operational efficiency, augment revenue, reduce risk, and enhance customer experience, all in sync with fulfilling its social responsibility.</p><h4>What are you doing to encourage your customers' transition to digital banking?</h4><p>The digital transformation can be seen in our huge network of ATMs/CDMs, mobile banking, internet banking, and 24/7 call centers, which provide convenient and secure electronic banking services. In a short span of time, mobile and internet banking channels have recorded massive success in terms of usage and customer adoption. Bank Muscat's mBanking achieved 62% growth in registration between 2015 and 2017, while internet banking saw 55% growth in registration from 2016 to 2017. The consistently growing number of customers reflects the high popularity of banking and internet banking channels. In line with the e-governance initiatives, electronic payments are fast becoming the preferred mode of secure payment in Oman. The bank has redefined tablet banking to proactively reach out to customers at their convenience, while the bank's customer service Twitter account @bankmuscatcare reflects the latest trends in banking to facilitate real-time communication with customers. There are a number of technological solutions we are embarking on that would further enhance the digital banking experience of our customers.</p><h4>From a cost-efficiency perspective, has digital replaced in-person transactions?</h4><p>Customer conveniece is the key driver of our digital initiative, to which cost efficiency is merely a supplementary benefit. The share of financial transactions at branches declined from 56% in 2013 to 16% in 2017, while the corresponding electronic banking transactions rose from 39% in 2013 to 68% in 2017. Streamlining and automating processes end-to-end has led to a significant improvement in efficiency and reduced turnaround times. Automation has helped the bank reduce average processing time by 75% and achieve 12% growth in volumes of retail payments. This is part of the reason Bank Muscat is recognized within the banking community for its innovative use of technology; it remains committed to being a leader in digital banking.</p><h4>Where has Bank Muscat seen the most revenue growth for its corporate banking services?</h4><p>Bank Muscat's corporate banking portfolio is well diversified across every industrial sector of the Omani economy. Bank Muscat has been associated with major syndicated financing programs across various sectors. Its clients include multinational and domestic companies engaged in activities across many sectors, including contracting, trading, power, water, telecommunications, oil and gas, aviation, shipping, airport and ports, gas and petrochemicals, real estate, and international trading. In corporate finance, Bank Muscat maintains leadership enabled by its expertise, innovative structuring capabilities, and sound due diligence techniques.</p><h4>What challenges do you face in extending financing to SMEs with your al Wathbah products?</h4><p>The SME segment forms the foundation of industrial, trade, and services sector in Oman, which is why Bank Muscat provides the required support to the sector through a comprehensive suite of tailor-made al Wathbah finance solutions and non-financial services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Additionally, the capital conservation buffer (CCB) has been implemented in a phased manner from 2016, meaning the total capital requirement (TCR) stood at 13.25% before this reduction. Banks have, however, been maintaining an excess capital buffer to deal with any uncertainty. As banks have to provide additional capital for any new loan depending on the risk profile,  credit growth could be restricted if banks find it difficult to arrange for additional capital. The need was felt to create additional space with banks for enabling the scope for accelerating credit growth in the economy. As such, the minimum CAR was reduced by 1 percentage point from 12% to 11% on April 1, 2018. As per the latest information, bank credit had grown by 7.5% on a YoY basis in September 2018, higher than the 6.4% in December 2017 and 5.7% in the same period in 2016. Nonetheless, it is too early to assess the impact of this policy on credit disbursement. Furthermore, this policy change has enabled an additional space for credit supply, but a pick-up in credit disbursement is also dependent on other factors, especially demand. As the economy has recovered from the contractionary phase, it seems that the demand has also started to pick up, and credit growth should accelerate in the coming years. </p><h4>What impact will the easing of lending requirements have on the banking sector?</h4><p>It is likely to have a positive impact on the banking business by enabling a disbursement of credit to potential new borrowers. However, we should also be mindful of the fact that easing lending requirements should not lead to an increase in delinquency rates; however, it is necessary to be prudent and maintain an optimal balance while easing lending requirements so that credit requirements of potential borrowers are met without jeopardizing assets' quality. </p><h4>Has there been an increase in lending to companies facing cash flow issues or non-payments on contracts, and what steps has the CBO taken to assist such companies?</h4><p>We understand the financial constraints faced by companies due to business cycle issues. As such, banks are encouraged to meet their legitimate credit requirements. CBO has also undertaken policy steps to ease the lending conditions for such borrowers. The extant guidelines on restructuring of credit facilities were reviewed to provide a helping hand to lenders as well as distressed borrowers, along with ensuring the long-term interest of financial stability. The specific provision of 15% on restructured loans, effective since 2015, was phased in with 5% for 2016, 10% by 2017, and 15% by 2018. Additionally, banks and FLCs engaged in various projects of government-owned entities, were allowed, as a special case, not to treat eligible loans as non-performing assets even if the past due period is 90 days or more. All these steps are intended to provide relaxations to banks so that fresh credit disbursements to the borrowers facing temporary cash flow issues due to macroeconomic challenges are not hampered.   </p><h4>What conditions allowed Oman to be considered “overbanked" compared to other GCC countries?</h4><p>We do not know whether Oman is considered “overbanked" when compared to other GCC countries. Nonetheless, it may be more appropriate to say banking outreach in Oman has considerably improved over the years. In fact, banks in Oman have reached out to the masses using various channels, including digital and mobile banking. This is a positive attribute of the economy with a large number of people being provided access to banking services, which they can use and leverage to contribute to economic activities directly or indirectly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Symtech used the success of its project in Sharqiyah for its ongoing projects? </h4><p>We completed our first off-grid project in Oman in October 2017 for the Outward-Bound Desert Centre in Sharqiyah sands. Designed by local design consultants 23 Degrees North, the centre makes substantial use of solar energy, treats and re-uses all water on site, and has already been nominated for and received several design awards. We have a number of ongoing projects, and our project pipeline now has a value of over USD50 million.</p><h4>Where is growth in demand for solar energy coming from?</h4><p>Our clients come from a wide variety of the Omani commercial and industrial sectors. The introduction of the Cost Reflective Tariff in January 2017 has resulted in commercial and industrial clients seeing an increase in their monthly electricity bills, and we have, therefore, concentrated on assisting clients who use more than 150MW hours of electricity to significantly reduce their energy costs by installing solar power at their premises. Typical clients include logistics companies that need to ensure perishable foods are kept at controlled temperatures and industrial clients who have energy-intensive processes such as desalination and cement plants. </p><h4>How economically viable is solar energy as a source of power in Oman?</h4><p>The promotion of solar in Oman and the transition toward a clean energy future has already begun. The Authority for Electricity Regulation and the District Code Review Panel have been successful in ensuring that the regulatory framework and technical guidelines are in place to support the uptake of solar in Oman, and various seminars have raised awareness within the local industry regarding the benefits of transitioning to solar. Oman uses natural gas for the vast majority of its energy needs, with over 97% of electricity coming from gas-fired power stations. Government subsidies mean that domestic consumers pay only one-third of the actual costs of their monthly electricity bills, a subsidy that costs the government over OMR600 million per year. This is clearly unsustainable given the lower worldwide prices for the oil that Oman produces. Solar power is the only renewable energy source that can keep pace with global energy demands. If we can harness just a fraction of the sun's power, we could transform our world from one that is driven by fossil fuels and threatened by climate change to one this is entirely fuelled by clean energy. From an industry level, the downward price of solar energy is encouraging businesses to make the transition to solar on a purely economic basis. Payback periods are becoming shorter as the falling cost of solar panels make the investment in solar energy more attractive. The Authority Electricity Regulation has an ambitious program named Sahim 2, which will eventually see one-third of the homes in Oman have solar panels installed on their roof. This will significantly reduce Oman's dependence on natural gas for domestic electricity production, while the gas saved can be exported at a profit. There is one more amazing fact about our star: solar power is the last energy source that isn't owned yet; nobody taxes the sun, you don't get a monthly invoice from it for the energy you receive.</p><h4>What are your biggest operational challenges?<br></h4><p>These center mainly around how we can assist local industry to first accept and understand how the transition to solar power can assist them in significantly reducing their operational costs and then enable our clients to secure funding at reasonable rates in order to finance their investment in solar power. We are partnering with financial institutions to be able to offer a turnkey service that includes financing for solar projects.</p><h4>How is Symtech expanding its regional presence?</h4><p>We have partnership agreements with renewable energy companies operating in Yemen, Syria, and Sudan, and we are committed to assisting our partners with their business via our solar partnership program. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-holy-diversion]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is be'ah controlling the damage caused by bad waste management practices?</h4><p>We used to have over 300 dump sites scattered across Oman which came in different sizes, some huge and some minor, with small quantities of waste that caused major environmental and health issues. When be'ah came into existence, its first priority was to control damage caused by the dumpsites and bad practices of handling waste. We decided we would have an engineered landfill in each governorate to replace the traditional dumpsites, and divert all the waste toward those engineered landfills. At present, there are eight under operation, and one is being finalized to be operational by the end of 2018. Our landfills are state of the art with engineered liners to protect from any seepage in the ground, and some of them also have industry-leading treatment units to treat the leachate that comes out of waste. Those engineered landfills are supported by transfer stations which are logistical hubs where waste is moved from smaller trucks to large semi-trailers, compressed, and hauled long distances to the landfills. We already have 13 transfer stations in operation and two more are expected to operate soon.  </p><h4>What role do private companies play in the waste management sector?</h4><p>We divided the country into nine different service areas for the management of waste and outsourced the contracts to private operators with relevant experience. The contracts include pre-collection, waste collection, and disposal. Our service providers are international companies with more than 20 years of experience in waste management in different parts of the world, including Portugal, Spain, and France. We are currently operating in eight out of 11 governorates as well as part of Muscat and aim to cover the entire Sultanate by the end of 2019. </p><h4>What are the challenges of balancing partnerships between be'ah and private companies?</h4><p>We manage all of these contracts with key performance indicators (KPIs) and do not dictate the number or size of bins; all that matters to us is that they meet the KPIs whereby there is no overflow of waste and no issues related to bad odor or insects. We have contract monitoring officers across the country with proper systems in place to monitor the operations and service levels. The initial challenge for both the operators and us is that we were entering an unfamiliar territory; the service level we expect is much higher than what was previously in place. A lack of awareness among residents is another challenge; Oman's demographics are remarkably different from other countries. At this stage, we are not focusing on separating waste but on making sure that waste is safely disposed and in the right manner through our collection systems. We expect these challenges and ensure we are ready to tackle them through efficient operations and awareness programs. </p><h4>Can you tell us about future and current plans regarding using waste-to-energy and renewable projects?</h4><p>We have set our internal target of diverting 60% of the waste that currently goes to landfills or dumpsites by 2020, and we increased that target to 80% by 2030. There are different options to divert waste. One option is to spread awareness to reduce the amount of waste produced, which is a responsibility of our community outreach team. Recycling is another option, but it requires a sustainable balance between the cost and impact on the environment. We are planning to incorporate five sorting facilities that will be responsible for diverting almost 10% of our waste. Next comes waste-to-energy projects; we have plans for a project to generate electricity by incinerating waste, which we believe is the most economically feasible approach. We did the studies, passed it to the government, and the government has floated a tender for a consultant to review the numbers. The study, which is being done by the Oman Power and Water Procurement Company, is expected to be finalized by October 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How well prepared is Majan and the electricity sector for privatization? </h4><p>The electricity sector in Oman is working to achieve and exceed targets as the regulations require. In the past few years, we have been responding to the electricity demand, and there have been significant improvements in terms of cost and delivery efficiency, as well as in customer service, where we have introduced improved modes of payment. Demand for electricity in Oman has been growing by  6-7% annually since the electricity sector's restructuring in 2004. Regulations have helped the sector perform efficiently and benchmark its performance with global benchmarks. The government is moving toward making a significant change in the market, allowing and positioning the private sector to assume a bigger role. This is within the framework and direction of the government's strategy. Privatization can take several different forms—through a strategic investor or IPOs. Electricity companies are ready in terms of their function and structure, and the transparency of their reporting and accounting. Overall, the sector is mature and well-structured enough to attract private-sector investment. </p><h4>What advantages come with strategic partners, as well as with public offerings? </h4><p>Strategic partners, regional or international, from a similar industry can bring values and improve efficiencies to gain knowledge. But having a strategic partner does not limit electricity companies from moving to a public offering—this is part of the privatization model. Depending on the market's reaction, a company can opt for an IPO straight away if the strategic partners are not showing interest and taking a significant stake. The group has undertaken a lot of studies, due diligence, and consultation to reach the level we have seen in recent times. Moving forward, we will continue to consult with stakeholders to make the best decisions in the market.</p><h4>How well prepared is Oman's distribution system to accommodate further growth?  </h4><p>The sector is publishing a seven-year statement that covers overall demand growth and projection. Based on that, OPWP consults with different authorities, and there will be consultations between the regulator and public authority for electricity and water. A comprehensive plan is being developed across the sector, and each company in the sector, whether related to transmission or distribution, will coordinate to meet the targeted demand. The regulator is the body reviewing and approving these plans to ensure that availability of electricity and security of supply are met without any disturbance or shortfalls. </p><h4>How have cost-reflective tariffs helped ease the load on the distribution system? </h4><p>Majan is mandated to serve Dhahirah, Buraimi, and the north Batinah region, which is home to the biggest industrial hub in Oman. The purpose of cost-reflective tariffs is to change the way electricity is used. So far, there has been a positive reaction from the customers, and there are no major difficulties between Majan and its customers. We have seen customers change operating modes of their plants to avoid the peak demand during summer, while others have managed to level their demand across the year and avoid periods with peak demand. The cost-reflective tariff is not just one tariff, but varies according to different seasons and hours of the day. The other side of the cost-reflective tariff is reducing the subsidy, and we have witnessed good results by reducing the subsidy for industrial customers.</p><h4>What was the biggest challenge in implementing the CRT?</h4><p>It was communicating with and advising customers about the cost-reflective tariff. To that end, there was an exercise before the implementation by the regulator that positioned us in a positive way. The driver at the beginning was AER because the body took initiatives and lead in communicating the government's decision. At the same time, it spent a considerable amount of time with distribution companies to educate them about the cost-reflective tariff, and distribution companies continued the campaign accordingly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-grid-to-build-on]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does MEDC work with power generation companies to prepare for increased electricity demand?</h4><p>Different parts of the industry play different roles in terms of accommodating growth and demand. In our context, we have a three-year business planning cycle based on new customers and demand information. We analyze demand trends both segmentally and holistically before determining our investment plans, which are also reflected in the annual three-year execution plans. Thus far, we are continuing our capital investment program, which in 2017 was close to USD127 million and aimed at accommodating growth in our customer base and demands to enhance the reliability of our supply.</p><h4>What strategies are in place to manage peak demand?</h4><p>MEDC will continue investing in the distribution systems in order to better manage peak demand. In addition to prudent investments, peak demand will be managed from a regulatory standpoint through a reform in the tariff structure whose new cost-reflective tariffs provide an incentive to consume electricity during non-peak hours by increasing the electricity tariff during peak demand times. There are also new mandates in terms of the efficiency of air conditioners entering the country and certain labeling requirements that mandate only highly efficient devices. These reforms started in 2017 and will gain momentum going forward. It will not only help manage the network, but also the seasonal impact.</p><h4>What other challenges do Muscat and Oman pose for electricity distribution, and what strategies do you have to overcome them?</h4><p>A challenge that we are constantly working to address is properly catering to customer expectations, especially since those regarding payment services and how they interact with service providers like MEDC are always changing. We are working on being more dynamic in order to better meet customers' needs. For example, we have launched electronic systems for various customer services, ranging from payment, call handling, and outage management systems, and MEDC has plans to increase the utilization of these services within current and upcoming years. From an operational standpoint, reaching peak optimization of the existing infrastructure is an ongoing challenge, though we have invested extensive resources in automated systems and better human resources to improve management. Another challenge is Oman's geography and climate. On the Indian Ocean side of the Arabian peninsula, cyclones have posed a continuous threat. We have experienced three cyclones since 2007, and each impacted our infrastructure in different areas. In terms of capability, organizationally, and structurally, we have already moved in terms of contingency plans to ensure greater resilience and move forward in the restoration processes. The results of this planning were evident during the Mekunu cyclone, when the entire country mobilized and every sector helped in a short period of time. Cybersecurity risks to infrastructure have emerged more recently and also become a great threat for our industry. We are working to strengthen our management framework and technical controls following a number of vulnerability assessments. </p><h4>What technologies can make the distribution system more effective?</h4><p>We are working to implement the smart grid as we speak. This involves many different technologies, including the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. These technologies use new solutions on the existing infrastructure to make the grid more efficient. In the last few years, MEDC has invested in smart metering as one of the first building blocks to improve the system. This is mandatory for customers using cost-reflective tariffs, which are commercial or government consumers. We started with high-value customers and are now in the process of taking it even further to the second segment of customers, those who can potentially move to the cost-reflective tariff. The realm of smart metering is evolving, and we will learn as we roll out how to get the best of this information to the benefit of customers and MEDC. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did DPC prepare the distribution system for cyclone Mekunu?</h4><p>Dhofar Power Company serves more than 110,000 customers throughout an area of 9,500sqkm, extending from Mughsail along the southern coast of Oman, some 50km west of Salalah, up to Jufa and Sadah, about 150km east of Salalah. The network also stretches into the Dhofar Mountains, 60km from Salalah to Thumrait. A large portion of this covers a sparsely populated, rugged, and often mountainous terrain, and provides vital power supplies to typically hard to reach areas of the region. In Salalah and its surroundings, the network is characterized by higher load density and major commercial, industrial, and tourism customers that directly impact the national economy. As for Mekunu, this was the most intense tropical cyclone to make landfall in the Arabian Peninsula since records began in the 1960s. The second storm to be named in the 2018 north Indian Ocean cyclone season, Mekunu developed out of a low pressure area and gradually intensified to reach peak-intensity as it made landfall near Raysut, Oman. Crisis management is a key consideration for a power company, and we are no exception. With protocols anticipated and procedures in place, the crisis management team was fully prepared for the arrival of the cyclone well in advance. As Mekunu approached, Omani officials evacuated hospitals and other areas and shut down Salalah Airport for 24 hours. For four days Mekunu battered Dhofar and dropped 62cm of rain, with Salalah recording wind speeds of over 100km/h. It is estimated to have done over USD400 million in damages as well as taken the lives of seven people.</p><h4>What other challenges does the region present DPC?</h4><p>An additional issue is seasonal rains, which make some mountainous areas unreachable during certain months. Indeed, some of the facilities in need of repair after Mekunu were located at mountaintops, and some of our heavy machinery broke during attempts to open up an access route. Fortunately, however, we have a robust network, and even when certain stations or transmission lines are cut off, other units can fill in. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The spot market trial run is expected to commence in early 2020. How will it operate?</h4><p>The first part of the market trial will comprise some simple scripted scenarios to ensure that all parties can perform their roles successfully in each of the market processes. It will involve the market participants and generation companies, with OPWP acting as market purchaser and operator together with the transmission company and regulator. The scenarios will then be progressively built up, so that the final part of the market trial is a full “dress rehearsal" for the market, with all market processes carried out as they would be in a fully operational market, except that no payments will be due. Detailed planning for the market trial will take place late in 2019 and the Authority for Electricity Regulation and OPWP will oversee the market trials.  </p><h4>The spot market is expected to go live in late 2020. Who are you expecting to be the first generators to sell their electricity on the market?</h4><p>Realistically, OPWP is not expecting the volume of power sales settled through the spot market to be initially high, as most generators will continue to be covered by their long-term power purchase agreements for some time. Auto-generators with spare capacity may choose to opt into the spot market. Some currently contracted generators will be reaching the end of their PPA terms shortly after the market starts, and selling on the spot market is one option for them. Finally, OPWP is developing new forms of PPA for future procurement that will allow a portion of the generation plant output to be sold under the contract and a portion under the spot market.</p><h4>How are power generators expected to change once they are producing for the spot market?</h4><p>The spot market is about short-term signals that reflect what is happening in the power system at the time, and we expect that generators' behaviour will react to these signals. So, when supply is tight, prices will be relatively higher and generators will have incentives to ensure they are available and able to generate in those periods. Experience elsewhere has shown that generators may find innovative ways to allow their plant to be operated more flexibly when they have the incentive to do so. Producing a stream of transparent spot market prices is important for helping generators identify opportunities to optimise their plant operation. </p><h4>In terms of OPWP's role as market operator, how will you prevent bid rigging or collusion?</h4><p>The power sector regulator, the Authority for Electricity Regulation (AER), will take the overall role in policing generators' market behaviour and is in the final stages of amending generation licences for the spot market. OPWP's Market Operator department will have a role in collecting and analysing the day-to-day market data for AER. Generator offers into the spot market are required to be cost reflective, and a code of bidding practice should be developed prior to market start.</p><h4>OPWP recently invited bids for the consulting services on a WTE project. What is the plan for developing WTE projects as a viable power generation model in Oman? </h4><p>With a view to better utilizing the solid waste generated within the Sultanate, OPWP in coordination with Bea'h has explored the development of a waste-to-energy project in Oman. We first conducted a techno-economic feasibility study for the project, which is now under review by AER for approval. The study examined the various technological options and recommended the most suitable technology. Based on this, the solid waste generation in Oman is sufficient for setting up a WTE project in excess of 100MW. Subject to government approval, the project should be commercial by 2Q2023. </p><h4>What is OPWP's role in encouraging alternative energy projects?</h4><p>The broader goal is to achieve 10% renewables by 2025, for which OPWP is committed to implementing 2,650MW of solar, wind, and WTE projects by 2024. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How well-positioned is Oman to meet increasing power demand?</h4><p>Oman's interconnected power system is in a great position because of the way the sector is set up in terms of load, generation, and our annual plans that project increases in demand going forward. Oman Power and Water Procurement Company (OPWP) publishes seven-year statements containing its future projections that help determine when we need new generation plants. In terms of installed capacity and projects for the near future, we are doing well.</p><h4>What are the primary challenges in distributing electricity to rural parts of Oman?</h4><p>The entire country is now connected with electricity. Through the main interconnected system and the rural areas system, we have 99.9% coverage. The job is done in terms of coverage; it is now just a matter of maintaining it by ensuring we have adequate capacity in the system. The main challenge is to optimize costs in rural areas. There is a great deal of dependency on diesel for generation, and electricity companies in rural areas are working on alternative solutions. These might include the use of renewables under a hybrid model, or interconnection with the main system where it is economically feasible. However, these proposals present challenges in themselves. In the case of renewables, energy sources are not all available all of the time, so it is necessary to create hybrid systems integrating renewable and conventional generation sources. And in the case of rural connections to the main system, sometimes an area is just too far away to connect, and the cost of infrastructure is not justified by the savings in diesel costs.</p><h4>Which of the Nama Group companies is most involved in the integration of renewables into the system?</h4><p>Most of Nama Group is involved in some way, though OPWP has been tasked by the government with helping ensure that by 2025, 10% of the electricity consumed in Oman will be from renewables. This has given us the mandate to enhance the utilization of renewables in the grid. OPWP as the main power procurement arm in Oman has already kicked off a number of projects, and there are others in the pipeline aimed at achieving this capacity. These include wind and solar projects, and there is another project lined up based on obtaining energy from waste recycling. The second company focused on this agenda is the Rural Area Electricity Company (RAECO). The regulator in Oman has also introduced a scheme to encourage people to place solar panels on their rooftops. This scheme is making progress, and all our distribution companies are required to support people looking to install such systems.</p><h4>What technologies are being introduced to make the distribution system more efficient?</h4><p>Our focus at the moment is on automated meter reading, such as smart meters. This is together with pre-pay meters and using IoT technology to help us with data analytics that will make the system more efficient. Smart meters are for customers who consume more than 150MW per year. This includes commercial, industrial, and government accounts, though it does not include residential accounts.</p><h4>How have the cost-reflective tariffs changed the power model in Oman?</h4><p>Cost-reflective tariffs have had an impact on consumers' consumption behavior. The entire purpose of the cost-reflective tariff is to reduce peak load. All utilities providers worldwide invest large sums of money to meet peak-hour demand, and if that peak demand can be lowered, it saves money and reduces the strain on the system. As a result of cost-reflective tariffs, we have already seen consumers shifting power consumption away from those times. The strategy is beginning to work, though it takes time for consumers to understand and adopt this new approach. They have to adjust their machinery and optimize their behavior to shift away from peak consumption because it now hits them economically if they consume during peak times. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since its founding in 2007, how has the strategy of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs evolved?</h4><p>MECA adopts an adaptive management approach that proactively responds to changing requirements for the protection of the environment and human health, while strengthening economic competitiveness. MECA strategies are formulated according to these principles, but still allow for flexibility in their adaptation. Our strategies have evolved to strengthen efficiency, effectiveness, and robust environmental protection through legislative and procedural actions. In the meantime, new strategies have been developed to facilitate private sector compliance, while reducing its economic burden. In a nutshell, MECA is continuously updating its strategies to effectively contribute to the sustainable development of Oman in coordination with other government, private sector, and social stakeholders. </p><h4>The ministry is pushing an initiative to bring international standards to Oman in the use of shopping bags. What impact will this have on the environment?</h4><p>The ministry has been working in coordination with the relevant bodies to reduce and contain the harmful impacts of plastic shopping bags, which have a negative impact on bio habitats, marine environments, land, and underground water. Actions are underway to develop regulations on procedures for the import, production, and circulation of plastic bags in the Sultanate, thus limiting their use. Each of these actions will minimize the risk to ecosystems, food chains, and public health.</p><h4>How does this initiative reflect the need to coordinate with other ministries in pushing for environmental standards?</h4><p>Oman's environmental policy and regulations set coordination and cooperation as the cornerstone of environmental protection where everyone is responsible. Accordingly, the initiative concerning plastic shopping bags is no exception. In this regard, every effort is exerted to ensure the participation of all stakeholders in order to cover all social, economic, and environmental aspects of our actions.</p><h4>What efforts is the ministry making to encourage investment in renewable energy technology?</h4><p>The ministry recently launched its Climate Mitigation and Adaptation Strategy in which renewable energy attains special importance to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. MECA is also formulating a National Policy for the Energy Sector, a project under the national initiative on diversifying economic activities with Tanfeedh. This tackles environmental aspects of the sector, including reducing dependency on fossil fuels and encouraging renewables with supporting regulations and standards. Together with other government actions, these efforts should encourage investment in renewable energy.</p><h4>What problems will Oman's environment face in the next decade, and how is the ministry working to fix them?</h4><p>In relation to nature, Oman's environment faces desertification, land degradation, reduction in vegetation, drought, degradation of some coastal areas, and a loss of biodiversity in certain wildlife species. We also face the negative effects of climate change. In order to address these, the ministry is working on human development, conducting awareness campaigns, building partnerships with local communities, drawing on international expertise in various environmental fields, and updating its national strategies on climate. </p><h4>What are the ministry's objectives for the next 12 months?</h4><p>Our main objectives include continuous efforts to raise environmental awareness across all levels, strengthen protection of biodiversity, support cleaner technologies in all sectors, mainstream our sustainability paradigm in every sector, strengthen human resources, enhance environmental monitoring and databases, and give more support to scientific bases of decision-making. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[we-think-long-term]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Khimji Ramdas been able to capture growth in the shipping sector?</h4><p>Growth in this sector has been focused around Sohar Port, which has become the entry point into Oman. Duqm is coming into its own, but it will take some time before it becomes a commercial port. At the moment, Duqm has received a great deal of bulk cargo related to Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), be it pipes, rigs, etc. It receives many vessels coming in for repairs or transformations at its dry docks. Sohar has also matured, chugging along fairly well and having become a decent hub for the steel and petrochemicals industries that have grown around it. When industries such as plastics and textiles come, the port will start to receive more shipping lines. Khimji Ramdas has also benefited from growth in Sohar by being involved in waste management. We are doing hazardous waste collection, and have recently signed an agreement with Sohar Port to collect sludge and waste from vessels and dispose it in an environmentally friendly manner. We are also becoming providers of environmental and waste management solutions to the port and hope others will follow the example of building local capacities to provide marine services at other ports. </p><h4>What services does Khimji Ramdas provide in Duqm?<br></h4><p>In Duqm, we do tug services through a PPP venture since the government has outsourced tug operations. When Duqm was being constructed, it needed tugboat services for dry-docking, product carriers, and oil tankers. We bid for those tenders and did a JV with Ocean Sparkle Limited, the largest operator in the region and present in more than 20 port cities in India. It has an impeccable record in providing marine services. We were successful in our JV bid and brought in our boats. We were initially only operating within the dry dock area, though the commercial Port of Duqm (PDC) has started contracting our boats. </p><h4>Why are you interested in education, health, and community well-being?</h4><p>The only unwritten rule at Khimji Ramdas is that we do not invest in education or healthcare for profit. Thus, since we wanted to support the community, we decided to engage with those areas through philanthropy, and have been doing so for many years in Oman. However, it was never institutionalized, formalized, or focused on in any way. Finally, we came up with the idea of creating a CSR arm that would do all the things we were still missing in terms of developing a strategy. Eshraqa is our CSR arm, but runs as a separate, independent organization. The easiest way to start was to invest in the areas of health and education. We took our profits from the business and invested into those sectors for non-profit use. The other area we focused on is community wellbeing. Health and education require the wellbeing of the community to start with. We started by empowering women; we run many schools in Oman and India, and when educating women, children naturally become more educated. We give women the power to make their own decisions and become business owners, helping the next generation in turn.</p><h4>What role does entrepreneurship development play in Eshraqa's strategy?</h4><p>Being an entrepreneur in Oman is nothing new; it was simply forgotten for a while. This is why we seek to inject entrepreneurship into the system from an early stage, lest we miss out on grooming potential employers and depend only on the government. We need children to understand entrepreneurship, become successful, and employ non-entrepreneurs. Being a 150-year-old company, we think long term by considering what the next generation will need. We want to take our skills and knowledge as a company and put them into play. Under our wing, we took a professional training institute to help the Ministry of Manpower train Omanis to get employed and create the Eshraqa Entrepreneurship Academy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

We have helped to create and safeguard thousands of jobs across the Sultanate, spanning manufacturing, tourism, agriculture, financial services, and IT. However, without the continued support of our government partners and our wider private sector stakeholders, Ithraa would not be the award-winning organization it is today. Likewise, we have always been fortunate to attract an outstanding team of professionals, all of whom have served Ithraa and Oman well over the years. Today, Omani firms export to over 135 countries and, in 2017, exported USD8.2 billion worth of non-oil commodities, up from USD6.21 billion in 2016. And as of June 2018, Oman's non-oil exports were recorded at USD5.07 billion. Exporting is great for Omani business, workers, and jobs. Put simply, when Oman exports, Oman prospers. Targeting middle-class consumers in Asia and Africa as well as in Europe and North America is crucial to putting Oman's economy on a solid footing. Helping businesses penetrate these markets is what we excel at. Exporting is fundamentally a decision driven by local businesses. However, firms attempting to close an export sale can face hurdles, including lack of market information, challenges obtaining export financing, and strong competition from foreign companies. This is where Ithraa's staff and services play such an important role. We help Omani businesses assess export opportunities, from developing a plan, identifying buyers and markets, and advising on regulations to managing logistics. Our goal is to provide everything an ambitious company needs to succeed in today's global economy. Up to 2017, FDI stood at USD24.19 billion compared to USD20.95 billion for the corresponding period in 2016, a rise of USD3.23 billion, a growth rate of 15%.</p><h4>Which sectors will be important for Omani companies?</h4><p>There are a number of sectors that are growing at the moment, from logistics, manufacturing, tourism, and fisheries to mining. We are constantly encouraging companies from different sectors to go international with their products. Currently, our major export markets include China, India, the UAE, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, the US, and Qatar, but we are also encouraging current and potential exporters to consider markets in Africa—Ethiopia, for example. We see significant potential in Africa for Omani manufacturers. We have also spent a great deal of time working on India. It is one of the world's fastest-moving economies, forecast to grow 7.2% in the 2018-19 fiscal year. However, it is a market that varies widely across its many different regions and states and is one that is taken seriously by Omani companies that are seeking to expand and go international. Interestingly, business opportunities have now stretched beyond the traditional business centers to emerging cities such as Chennai, Nagpur, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Pune, and Jaipur, to name but a few. Supporting Oman's growing export community are our ports, free zones, and industrial estates. In particular, it is important to highlight the important role Madayn, the Special Economic Zone Authority Duqm, Sohar Port and Freezone, as well as Salalah Port and Salalah Freezone are all playing in helping take Oman's ambitious economy forward.</p><h4>Where does Industry 4.0 factor into Oman's manufacturing scene?</h4><p>Today, Oman's manufacturing sector is being driven by social media, mobile technology, analytics, and cloud computing. Many believe our manufacturing sector could be on the cusp of a major breakthrough with the move toward Industry 4.0 (4IR), a revolution that has the potential to transform the way Oman-made goods are ordered, designed, manufactured, and delivered. According to a 2015 Accenture report, by improving productivity, reducing operating costs, and enhancing worker safety, 4IR could add USD14.2 trillion to the global economy over the next 15 years. At the heart of this revolution will be smart factories, using technology to change global supply chains and production lines, bringing a much higher level of automation and digitization to their operations. Local manufacturers will use AI and self-optimizing and self-configuring machinery to complete complex tasks, delivering superior cost efficiencies and better-quality goods. Local manufacturers realize that the most obvious benefit of 4IR is the opportunity to increase production yields and reduce waste. Anything that affects yield, such as downtime or equipment failure, is a blow to any company's bottom line. Data that can inform an Omani manufacturer of problems with yield, alerting workers to fix equipment that is about to fail, or otherwise highlight pending issues is the perfect use of 4IR. There is undoubtedly a need to raise awareness of the potential, as well as the risks, of 4IR across the economic spectrum. While larger Omani companies in oil and gas and manufacturing are embracing new technologies emerging from 4IR and re-adapting business models, micro-businesses and SMEs are not always familiar with these. Technical staff in new and established enterprises, as well as managers and policymakers, need to be trained in order to understand the implications and opportunities of 4IR. This is a space we are working on. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Many of TRC's projects are completed in partnership with private companies. How does this relationship work in terms of funding and operations?</h4><p>Since its inception by the Royal Decree 54/2005, TRC has been keen to establish partnerships with various sectors; thus, it has representatives from the government, private, and academic sectors on its board. These partnerships have been clearly reflected through the preparation of the National Research Strategy, which helps define the research hurdles and challenges and how to overcome them. TRC's partnerships with the private sector aim to encourage their contributions to the Sultanate's overall research ecology. In recent years, TRC has collaborated with the private sector on a number of joint projects, such as the Ejaad Platform, which acts as a bridge between the industrial and academic sectors. </p><h4>What are the goals of Innovation Park Muscat (IPM), and from where does it attract the most investment?</h4><p>Due to its proximity to Sultan Qaboos University, various research centers, the Public Establishment for Industrial Estates, Knowledge Oasis Muscat, and Muscat International Airport, IPM has a crucial role to play in regard to the creation of an enabling environment for researchers and innovators in the Sultanate. IPM promotes entrepreneurship and innovation in the targeted areas, providing an enabling environment for research and innovation in order to contribute to building a knowledge-based economy and strengthen synergies between the government, academia, and the private sector. It also aims to create new job opportunities, create added value for these companies' products, and attract local and foreign investment in the targeted areas. Although initially focused on four key areas—energy, food and biotechnology, health, water and environment—most of the investment received so far by IPM is from oil and gas. IPM has attracted companies from this sector, including SMEs, to invest in research and development. Many interested parties from international markets have also shown interest in conducting research and development here. Through IPM and more broadly, TRC works closely with the oil and gas industry.</p><h4>How have these partnerships benefited the oil and gas industry?</h4><p>IPM focuses on four key sectors, of which oil and gas is the pioneering sector for investing in strategic partnerships such as the Oman Institute for Oil &amp; Gas (instOG) and Enhanced Oil Recovery Institute (EORI). The current major operational development in IPM is instOG, a joint venture between Takatuf Oman and Schlumberger Oman. InstOG has invested in a 12,000sqm area of IPM and is focusing on capacity building in the oil and gas industry, signing 25-year renewable contract for career development programs for petro technical professionals. These will certainly increase the capabilities of Omani professionals in the industry. </p><h4>How does the Oman Research and Education Network (OMREN) system work?</h4><p>OMREN enables the use of next-generation research networks and services among the research and education community in Oman. This will effectively contribute to the development of innovation, research, education, and international e-collaboration. A strategic partnership between a consortium of higher education institutes and the ICT service provider, OmanTel, OMREN members benefit from the advanced network technology and related infrastructure in Oman and around the world. In addition, they gain access to an ever-growing list of services and collaboration activities designed to meet OMREN's vision and mission. OMREN's partners are constantly investing in enhancing its telecommunications networks, developing smart technologies and innovative solutions that support high-speed communication networks, and linking educational and research institutions to simplify the exchange of information.</p><h4>What changes does the higher education system in Oman need? </h4><p>Oman's education system is beginning to promote research and innovation among students and academics. It is important to increase the budget allocated to research at higher education institutions, to direct this research toward national priorities, and to focus on research collaboration between academia and industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[leading-the-economy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which sectors of the economy are you seeing the most promising SME growth?</h4><p>Current government plans have identified promising economic sectors for SMEs in line with our future vision. The youth are constantly encouraged to invest in basic sectors such as tourism, industry, logistics, and information technology in order to increase employment opportunities and minimize Oman's dependence on oil revenues. As such, they contribute largely to gross domestic product, consumption, job opportunities, investment and exports, and social justice. SMEs are also able to lead the national economy with the smallest capital. In line with these trends in promising sectors, the fund is keen to finance programs in tourism and industrial and commercial agencies in order to support youth innovation, stay abreast of the current economic trends, and promote economic diversification. In order to maximize these, the Al Raffd Administration Board has its sights set on 30 projects for the coming year that will contribute to the advancement of the national economy.</p><h4>How does the Al Raffd Fund work in partnership with other SME-promoting organizations such as Riyada and Sharakah?</h4><p>We help finance SMEs through partnerships and memorandums of understanding that are coordinated to ensure maximum transparency. </p><h4>How can technology make Omani SMEs more competitive with larger companies and regional SMEs?</h4><p>The use of modern technology is absolutely essential, especially to smaller firms. Their ability to cope with intense competition is entirely related to their use of technology, whether in management, organization, or marketing. It also plays a significant role in manufacturing since it ensures the quality of the product and service being provided. The more modern the technologies employed in SMEs, the higher their competitiveness and ease with which they are integrated into the global economy. </p><h4>In manufacturing, what incentives are needed for SMEs to be created, and for large companies to buy their products?</h4><p>The Sultanate attaches great importance to this sector. The Small and Medium Enterprise Development Symposium was held in February 2013, which approved a number of incentives for establishing SMEs, especially in the industrial sector. These included allocating plots for agricultural, industrial, and commercial purposes; requiring companies executing large projects to allocate at least 10% of the tender value to SMEs; giving priority to enterprises whose headquarters are registered in the governorate where the project is implemented; and allocating reasonable plots in different governorates for building business centers and incubators for SMEs. As for purchasing SMEs' products, the foregoing symposium also recognized that SMEs are entitled to 10% of governmental tenders, which gives them continuous opportunities to provide their products and build working relations with various government agencies, not only in industry but in every sector. The fund has developed a special financing program for industrial projects with a financing ceiling of OMR200,000 through streamlined procedures and free guarantees. It also provides business contracts in the industrial sector for those with high operating costs. SMEs can also start their business with large companies by providing them with high quality products and services that enable them to compete. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the National Competitiveness Office work within NCSI?</h4><p>In the past year, Oman has moved up 14 spots in the World Economic Forum's Competitiveness Report, a major achievement for the country. This is due in large part due to the NCSI's National Competitiveness Office. The office is a committee that was created by the cabinet and is a combination of ministers and the private sector that have been tasked with improving the ease of doing business in the country. The office's aim is to continue to encourage foreign investment in this market. In practice, the committee works to make sure processes are not complicated for investors and the private sector, while also ensuring that unnecessary procedures are removed. The Competitiveness Report and the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business ranking are both important benchmarks that we use to keep Oman's policies in line with what the most advanced and competitive economies are doing. The National Competitiveness Office is working to continue improving Oman's ranking in these reports and expects to see more achievements in the coming years. </p><h4>Why has competitiveness become a focus of NCSI's operations?</h4><p>The oil price drop in 2015 changed the government's approach to developing the economy. The government has worked to increase the country's revenues through the promotion of non-oil sectors, especially those identified by Tanfeedh. To promote these sectors, the government worked to incentivize investment and increase competitiveness and the ease of doing business. Our role is to track the progress and advise on how laws can be changed to promote competitiveness.<br>What is NCSI's role in promoting trade with other countries? <br>We are trying to lay the groundwork to enable the private sector to better utilize data. The best way to do that is to make it readily available. Manafeth is a platform NCSI has developed to do just that—to publish and make available online trade data detailing Oman's imports and exports. From that data, it is helpful for businesspeople to focus on where the market's weaknesses are and help them identify new areas of business to open. Enabling the detailed data, with specific categories, opens possibilities for both companies already in Oman and those interested in entering the country. One of the most important benefits we are seeing is that Manafeth's data allows local manufacturers to monitor the moving demands of the market. Highly imported items are now more easily identified, which will lead to higher local manufacturing. There  will soon be a mobile application to access this data. It is a branded platform that we want to encourage. </p><h4>How has the NCSI worked to improve its census data?</h4><p>We have introduced and are continuing to improve the e-census. Previous censuses focused on statistical data that gave snapshots of a specific time. This new e-census moves more toward sustainable and moving data; it is not a snapshot, but live, updated data. We have built a huge database for this information. The census actually talks about how to link data to talk to each other, bringing it all to one hub. This methodology will help the government craft policy, and companies conduct business. Regarding business, the e-census will enhance market knowledge and allow companies to make better decisions. It can provide extra information that a new business may need regarding demographics and what options are available. We have seen how important big data is for companies worldwide, so we are doing the same for companies operating in Oman. </p><h4>How important is it to establish an effective address system in Oman?</h4><p>Having a physical address is important everywhere in the world. When it comes to business and tourism, people need an address for where they want to go. Once the address system is in place, many SMEs will start to work much better. This is why NCSI is leading the effort to complete a national address system by 2020. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most meaningful investments to come from Tanfeedh Phase II's focus on the fisheries and mining sectors?</h4><p>
	With over 3,000km of coastline on four different bodies of water, the Arabian Gulf, the Sea of Oman, the Indian Ocean, and the Arabian Sea, Oman's fish reserves are among the largest in the world. The government continues to invest significantly in the sector and is keen to encourage private sector participation as well. Over 90 initiatives and projects have been identified for the sector as a result of Tanfeedh Phase II labs, covering catches, aquaculture, and processing and exports. The investment value of the projects will amount to OMR1 billion, which will triple the sector's contribution to GDP by 2023. The initiatives and projects will create around 8,000 job opportunities for nationals by the end of 2023. The percentage of private investment will amount to 93%. To accelerate investment patterns in the mining sector, a specialized committee was formed to oversee the implementation of Tanfeedh Phase II outcomes. Over 43 initiatives and projects were identified with a total investment value of OMR813 million, which will triple the mining sector's contribution to GDP. These initiatives are expected to generate around 1,660 jobs for Omanis and raise total annual mining production from its current 100 million tons to 147 million tons by 2023. The private sector will account for 99% of total projected investment.
</p><h4>What regulatory changes have been made within the Phase II sectors to encourage growth and investment?</h4><p>
	Oman is building an investor-friendly legislative environment, with no restrictions on repatriation of capital or profits, and key incentives, advantages, and measures to ensure transparency, clarity, and stability in policy and regulations. A new Investment Law will soon be introduced to enhance the business environment and create a climate conducive to the planned role for the private sector in the development process. A number of incentives to encourage investment were already in place, including custom duty exemptions on imports of plant equipment and raw materials, corporate tax holidays for up to 10 years, export credit insurance through Export Guarantee and Financing Agency, 70% automatic foreign ownership, and 100% foreign ownership for specific projects and economic zones
</p><h4>For fisheries and mining, how does the council balance commercialization with the need to maintain Omani employment and control over resources?</h4><p>
	SCP believes that commercialization, if managed properly, has the potential to increase income, enhance social equity, and strengthen the security of local people. Therefore, SCP is formulating policies and institutional changes to provide the necessary incentives to develop partnerships between industry and community groups and local government bodies to ensure that commercialization can also sustain employment and livelihoods for rural and urban Omani people.
</p><h4>How does the council balance the advantages of foreign capital with the need to encourage Omani participation in financing and ownership activities?</h4><p>
	While the country's oil revenues have contributed toward its rapid economic growth, the government has actively pursued development plans focused on diversification, industrialization, and privatization of the economy with the aim of attracting foreign capital. Joint ventures between foreign investors and private Omani investors are being encouraged and set up through SMEs. The attention is on the supply side, with SMEs acting as agents of commercialization and with Omani participation. SCP seeks to institutionalize the use of FDI, public-private sector collaboration, and PPP models to enable both foreign and local investors to work cooperatively toward national sustainable development and greater Omani participation in financing and ownership activities.
</p><h4>
	How does the council collaborate with the private sector to meet the most pressing needs and changes within the business community?
</h4><p>
	The government recognizes the increasingly important role of the private sector in export-led growth, and thus views the sector as an important partner in achieving economic growth and prosperity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

These require high standards to ensure they meet future needs of heavy trucks and equipment moving from the port to the factories in Duqm and elsewhere. The corridor infrastructure will have electricity, communications, and gas infrastructure in a common place for companies to use. In addition to infrastructure development, SEZAD's role involves supervision and licensing, for which we have completed all the legislation, including licensing, environmental and construction permits, and registrations. Any investor applying for a registration will know what they need to submit. SEZAD's third role is monitoring and compliance. We have to ensure that registered companies do business according to our rules and regulations. TATWEER, which we fully own, has taken over the management part of the project and reports back to SEZAD on the situation of projects, obstacles, and other types of project management. </p><h4>How important is air transportation for Duqm?</h4><p>Air transportation is an important step for us. When SEZAD was established, the only one way to access the area was via road, though now it is accessible via road, sea, and air. Now that the airport is completed, there is a daily flight, except on Fridays, from Muscat to Duqm through Oman Air. The passenger terminal has an annual capacity of 500,000 passengers. </p><h4>What efforts is SEZAD making to attract investment in fisheries?</h4><p>Within our master plan we have created a fishing industry, which includes a fishery harbor already under construction. According to the original plan, the harbor will be ready and linked to the industrial area. A consultant has been assigned to formulate a master plan. This is all important, not only for local fishermen, but also for the vessels catching in international waters that then use our harbor. The company has a plan to have a fishery in Duqm so that international fishers can also make use of what they catch in international waters. In this area, we already have three factories in operation that buy fish from local fishermen. </p><h4>How important is the port's geographic position?</h4><p>Duqm is in a strategic position, with open access to the Arabian Sea and close proximity to the Indian Ocean. The port was designed because of its strategic location, which is one of the selling points we use to promote the area. Oman also has excellent relationships with its neighbors and has established the border accordingly. Being secure is important for business. </p><h4>How important are Chinese and Indian investment to SEZAD?</h4><p>All investors are similar. We have been everywhere, including the US, Brazil, Europe, GCC, China, and Singapore. India is close to Oman, and China has huge investment resources, not to mention Oman is now part of China's One Belt, One Road initiative. We have a successful heavy industry with an Indian investor who will start operating by early 2019, which will attract even more Indian investors to Duqm. China has become one of the developers within SEZAD, so we help it market its projects in China. We focus on these two markets, but still consider other countries and encourage investment from all over. Our area is huge, covering some 2,000km, so it is good to have competition between countries. The Chinese projects also enhance the appetite of other countries to come and do the same. </p><h4>What are SEZAD's objectives for the next five years?</h4><p>We have 2,000km of land and have created a master plan for 40% of the total area. Our objective is to accommodate international and local investors. Our five-year action plan from 2018-2023 is segregated into two different parts. One is the development of the region and the other is marketing; the infrastructure is already there. The remaining 10% has been contracted out and will be completed by 2020. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your priorities as Her Majesty's Trade Commissioner? </h4><p>I have responsibility for the GCC plus Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Pakistan. As one of nine of Her Majesty's Trade Commissioners, the creation of our role signals the renewed importance that the UK places on global trade and this region in particular. As the UK leaves the EU, we are very focused on building independent trade relationships globally. My remit, drawing on my private sector experience, is to promote UK exports to this region and attract regional investment to the UK. I also cover trade policy and our export credit agency UKEF.  Within the region, the GCC is clearly the biggest priority. Total trade in goods and services between the UK and GCC was GBP40 billion in 2017, a 14.8% increase on 2016. Most notable is the increase in total trade in goods and services between the UK and Oman, which grew 92% YoY to GBP3.14 billion in 2017. My priority is to partner with governments and businesses across the region to really understand how we can support their diversification and transformation agendas with innovative solutions from the UK.</p><h4>How do GCC states fit into your efforts to grow trade ties with countries outside the EU?</h4><p>Although we are leaving the EU, we are not leaving Europe and will continue to have a significant trading relationship with our European partners. However, we will have a renewed focus to look beyond Europe and strengthen ties with the GCC. Our Prime Minister has been clear that she is looking for the “strongest possible trading relationships between the UK and the Gulf." We have established a working group, the UK-GCC Trade Working Group, to look at the details of our future trade relationship and at market access issues to improve free-flowing trade that will complement the region's diversification agenda and improve opportunities for UK firms to take advantage of the increasing breadth of the Gulf economies. GCC countries have ambitions to develop diversified and sustainable economies away from oil, each with their own detailed vision to deliver that. There are four key areas of transformation in which we are getting actively involved: technology, life sciences, healthcare, education, and infrastructure. These sectors are a great example of how UK capabilities can help strengthen economies and diversify resources. Ultimately, post-Brexit opportunities will allow us to build closer ties between the UK and the Gulf region. </p><h4>What role will public-private partnerships play in the UK's investment strategy in the GCC?</h4><p>The UK is one of the biggest investors in the Gulf. UK Foreign Direct Investment in the GCC is around GBP10 billion, according to 2016 data. This is driven by the huge opportunities that have arisen from reforms put in place by regional governments to drive the ease of business, such as recent rule changes in the UAE around business ownership and more flexible visas. KSA's Vision 2030 and the UAE's Vision 2021 are also providing ample investment opportunities across a number of sectors as the countries look to diversify away from oil. Our Secretary of State for International Trade, Liam Fox, places real importance on Overseas Direct Investment. We see trade and investment as a way of driving mutual prosperity and want to see British companies contribute to the development of regional economies. In terms of PPP, the UK is home to one of the world's largest and most experienced PPP markets, which has allowed the public sector to access private sector skills and expertise. UK companies have a track record across a range of sectors and can be a prime source to inform national diversification plans, particularly in the areas of education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The UK can play an important role across all these sectors. For example, UK universities are setting up across the GCC to help develop the skills of the next generation, and UK hospitals and clinics are partnering in the region to help tackle some of the critical healthcare challenges. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Romania working to enhance its diplomatic and economic relationship with Oman?</h4><p>My official visit to the Sultanate of Oman expresses the renewed interest of the Romanian government for the development of bilateral relations between our states, both in terms of political dialogue as well as economic and trade relations. This visit is the first direct contact at the level of our government's leadership since the establishment of diplomatic relations between Romania and the Sultanate of Oman. As you know, there is a long-standing friendship between our countries. On May 1, 2019, we will celebrate 45 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two states, which gives us the opportunity to boost our bilateral relations by opening the Romanian Embassy in the Sultanate of Oman, a concrete testimony of our interest and support. </p><h4>Why is Romania's economy well matched for investment partnerships with Oman?</h4><p>As the investment sector contributes significantly to the economic prosperity of our states, it should be stressed that the Romanian government aims to work with the authorities from Oman to identify the most appropriate ways to increase trade and investments in both countries. From an economic point of view, Romania can be considered a success story. In recent years, our country has registered some of the highest economic growth rates in the EU, over 6% annually, making it one of the most attractive destinations for business people. At the governmental level, we also encourage the participation of foreign investors in public-private partnerships (PPPs). I take this opportunity to invite you to study the PPP projects and to assure you the support of the executive to jointly capitalize on the full potential of the Romanian offer.<br>Which sectors are best suited for growth in trade between Romania and Oman?<br>There is significant potential between Romania and Oman to improve the volume of trade. We are particularly interested in developing strong relationships in areas such as energy, agriculture, transport, infrastructure, IT and cybersecurity, health, and education. </p><h4>From an investment standpoint, how else can you collaborate?</h4><p>There are solid premises for Romanian-Oman bilateral collaboration through involvement in joint projects in third markets, especially in the Arab world and Africa, where Romania enjoys a great reputation in areas such as road and oil and gas infrastructure, hydrotechnology, telecommunications, and high-voltage lines. Romania will also take over the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union in January 2019, during which time we will continue the same opening policy to the region's issues. It is clear that Romania and the Sultanate of Oman will be able to develop pragmatic and beneficial collaborative relations for both countries, and I look forward to seeing the outcome of all the steps we have taken and will take in the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Brand Mexico]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[javier-lopez-president-ceo-ipsos-mexico]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why should countries be concerned about how they are perceived as a brand?</h4><p>Perception is a reality in any product or service. Generating loyalty can take years of work, while destroying a good image can take just seconds. The brand of a country matters. In fact, when the brand perception of a country changes, it has an impact on investment, business retention, etc., as well as determining whether companies can continue to develop projects in the area. We conduct studies for both government and private organizations to measure the impact of Mexico, as a brand, and thus as an entity in the world. When Mexico is perceived as a transformative and innovative economy, it reflects on the spirit of doing business and on that of entrepreneurs, investors and employees. Mexico is a country that is sensitive both to change and to the emotional impact when perceived as not being on the right track. For example, our indicators consistently show that Mexicans tend to be happy and optimistic: Mexicans' expectations are always higher than the world's average regardless of the problems that exist in the country. However, it takes more than just good intentions to solve Mexico's problems. In fact, it is necessary to lay some foundations and be realistic as it is rather naive as a country considering the economic conditions that is competing in. The Mexico brand goes beyond a tourist and investment destination. This subject must arouse passion if someone wants to invest in or come to this country. Therefore, we conduct a study to see what the first thing is that comes to people's mind when talking about Mexico. This is a worldwide study, whose results—regarding perception—in places like Asia, the Middle East or Latin America tend to be positive, while in Mexico tends to be negative, since it is related to crime and the external perception, which ultimately impacts on investors' opinion. Despite the good perception towards tourism, food and the Mexican friendliness, we have to do something, as a country, to reverse the negative image that is affecting business investments.</p><h4>Why is Mexican openness to innovation one of the country's biggest added values?</h4><p>The great advantage of Mexico, as a market, is that Mexicans are open to innovation. They are keen to consume and try new things, which makes it an easy market to launch new products and services. For example, Mexico, which used to be one of the countries with the lowest smartphone penetration, is nowadays one with highest penetration levels. Another example, for many years, we were a country where internet penetration was low, but its levels suddenly went up. As a result, there are several signs that indicate that this is an avid market of technology and innovation; however, it is also a market where more than 56% of people live in poverty. Much is missing to generate the consumption capacity that would make Mexico a world power. Mexican consumers were once much less demanding in terms of their satisfaction level, but today Mexicans demand greater quality in products and services. An example of that is that regarding technology and physical products, quality is important. Moreover, the penetration of social networks is one of the highest in the world. We are one of the most important markets for Facebook, YouTube, and Uber. No wonder why mobility companies, such as Didi, have arrived to Mexico. The Mexican economy used to be a very closed one, but even then, people avidly consumed American goods. Yet despite its proximity to the largest market in the world, access to those products was complex and contraband was rife. However, borders were opened even before the global era and Mexico became one of the countries with the highest commercial openness and with the largest number of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in the world, ratifying treaties with the US and Canada. Although there is clear demand in the country to eliminate poverty, social dynamics demand that services have a rapid entry into Mexico instead. For example, people can be poor, use the public transport and still have smartphones. In other words, they are willing to make those expenses to store their music instead of buying pirated records. On the other hand, the dynamics of younger generations make these physical borders disappear because they like the same music, have access to the same demands, see the same content on the Internet and have access to the same information, even if they have different living conditions. Mexico is not a buoyant country but an emerging one with a critical base for this type of product that allows people to keep growing.</p><h4>How is technology transforming the way market research is done?</h4><p>Some years ago, it used to be easy to ask consumers their opinions about a product or service through questionnaires or during 40-minute focus groups. Market research took four or five weeks to be done. Nowadays, daily dynamics make these old strategies impossible and we have to resort to new techniques to obtain information. The best non-invasive technique to obtain information is the mobile phone. Note that this does not imply asking directly but rather an examination of habits. Non-invasive research techniques are also important, since it is possible to see, hear and feel what people are doing without having to ask any question. Ipsos invested last year in a facility, called Ipsos House, which is located in Mexico City. Ipsos House is a public space in the most important avenue of the City, where users can walk through different spaces and in which various types of services and businesses are recreated in an experiential manner. Users are invited to participate and then their responses are measured. By observing a target market, we generate more information than if we directly ask for it. After a period of observation, we get real information about their modes of consumption through neuro-marketing techniques such as facial coding, implicit response, Human Behavioral Sciences, and Neuroscience. The latter is a way to generate data that can be complemented with accumulated information in social networks. Yet, the important thing is what it can be done with such information. Therefore, companies like Ipsos see that information, process it and provide a robust and thorough consulting as companies can sometimes make decisions based on false information. The new information industry depends on several factors, since it has become increasingly difficult to investigate consumers, which is why non-intrusive techniques are vital and complemented with traditional research techniques. Additionally, big data must be the only thing obtained in a general manner and needs to be analyzed and structured for its use; otherwise, there is a risk of having information without knowing how to handle it.</p><h4>What projects is Ipsos collaborating in?</h4><p>Ipsos is the largest market research company in Mexico and the third largest in the world. Virtually, all consumer products companies are our clients. We have a very important presence in the automotive sector, mainly regarding Brand Loyalty and Customer Satisfaction research, as well as the After Sales follow-up. This helps carmakers to obtain better data for new vehicle design. For example, since virtual reality is currently a new component in our research techniques, it can be simulated the most detailed and specific car, with which people can indicate whether they like a particular feature or not.  Therefore, everything implies that research and the generation of data is transformative.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the company's performance and operations in the last 30 years?</h4><p>I set up my own business with the help of an experienced estate agent in 1987. We were mainly a residential estate agency, and it was the first foreign business in Portugal catering mainly to Anglo Saxon buyers who wanted to buy real estate in Portugal. When multinational Healey &amp; Baker made an offer to buy the business, I initially declined as I was satisfied with my independence and things were going well. Around the same time, other multinationals set up in Portugal, and I saw the power of the name and the support of the back office in terms of marketing and HR. I realized I would not be able to compete by myself, and thus changed my mind in 1991. Since then, Healey &amp; Baker (which in turn was later acquired by Cushman &amp; Wakefield) has been extremely helpful, particularly to our business and clients. We became a more professional organization, with many international clients. The whole reason behind setting up a business in Portugal was to service international clients of Healey &amp; Baker with an interest in Portugal for retailers, corporates, industrial players, developers, investors, and so on. We became a completely different business with a high focus on professional services such as valuation, property management, and more, though with a continued focus on transactional business. The support of an international organization and everything that comes with it—the brand, recognition, and client list—is incomparable.</p><h4>What are the secrets behind your success, as evinced by winning Best Real Estate Consultant in Portugal in the Euromoney Real Estate Awards 2018?</h4><p>I was pleased with that award, as it is a form of recognition by clients and peers. There are two things that I try to instill in the almost one hundred people in this office. The first is “clients first.“ We look at the long term, and if there is a quick deal that is not in the best interests of our clients, we will not do it. The other guiding principle in this business is collaboration, because the world is increasingly more complex and large deals will always involve more than one person, department, or skill. One of the other dogmas in this business is to cooperate and seek the opinion of others. We will sort out the fees, and that is never a problem between people or departments. It is about giving clients the best service available by drawing upon the expertise of individual people and departments.</p><h4>Cushman &amp; Wakefield was exclusively instructed to sell some Caixa Geral de Depósitos properties in Lisbon. What other projects is Cushman &amp; Wakefield currently working on?</h4><p>The CGD building in Baixa is one of our flagship instructions, though it is a bigger portfolio with land in Porto, the Algarve, Palmela, and Lisbon, so there is more than just selling the headquarters building. We do a great deal of office leasing work; one of our biggest ever transactions was the forward sale in early 2018 of a building that has yet to be built in Expo for Ageas, the insurance company. We are active everywhere, including industrial and retail, especially stores on the high street. We are extremely active in Porto as well. One area that we specialize in is the sale of supermarkets, which is a popular investment medium because they offer usually long leases and attractive returns. It is also not a sector of retail that is under threat. At the moment, we are selling a dozen supermarkets or hypermarkets for Sonae.</p><h4>What trends do you see in the real estate sector, and how do solutions shift according to demands and needs?</h4><p>We must look at that according to the sector, because it is not the same for stores as it is for warehouses. There is a real boom in shopping centers in Portugal, which has some of the best malls in Europe. Another trend is that the high street has become extremely active. The lease legislation that changed in 2012 significantly contributed to this, as did tourism and the arrival of luxury retail. We have a database of all retail deals for the last few years, and 60% of retail transactions are in the food and beverage sector. It is a truly active sector. In terms of investment, we see a completely different set of buyers when compared to the previous peak in 2007. The two main classes of players then would be Portuguese and German property funds, plus  the odd UK, Dutch, and German non-fund player. Today, we see a wide range of nationalities buying all different asset classes -  from extremely opportunistic hedge funds from the US to core players and German funds that will pay high prices if they can buy something which is secure, newly built, on a long lease, and so on. In between, there is a whole spectrum of risk premiums. They are many opportunities for the more adventurous investors and those looking for scale.</p><h4>What is your vision and priority for the coming year?</h4><p>Portugal did a great deal of work on the fundamentals as a result of the structural reforms imposed on it. This was to get public finances in order and reduce the deficit; however, in the longer term it has made Portugal more competitive and stable; removed the privileges of certain classes and professions; made the labor law more flexible, the state smaller, and the judicial system faster; and improved the lease law, which is extremely important for our industry. The structure of the real estate market is much healthier, as it is less dependent on bank finance. There will be a crisis, though no one knows when it will hit; however, Portugal is much better prepared today than it was 10 years ago.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the year 2018 in terms of business prosperity and economic output? What are some of your most recent developments/acquisitions you can report on?</h4><p>Dubai has continued to make excellent progress in implementing its vision for the Emirate's future prosperity, with the provision of world-class healthcare and education both key to this. As the only publicly listed investment company focused on education and healthcare in the GCC, based here on the Dubai Financial Market, we at Amanat are proud to have played our part in this ongoing progress. In 2018, we were highly active in identifying and securing high-quality assets in our chosen sectors, education and healthcare, including here in Dubai. The acquisitions we have made in the past year in Dubai reflect our support for the government's agenda and the confidence we have in the market dynamics here. In particular, we have acquired Middlesex University Dubai and the real estate assets of North London Collegiate School, both attractive assets that tap into the continued demand for high quality education at both a K-12 and higher education level. As a result, we ended 2018 having deployed almost 80% of our paid-up share capital, a significant milestone in our growth.</p><h4>What recent economic and market trends have you noticed in Dubai? How have these changes influenced the way Amanat Holding has been investing?</h4><p>Amanat continues to benefit from the compelling market trends in our chosen investment sectors, education and healthcare. In education, the government has put a knowledge-based economy at the heart of its vision; this is supported by positive socio-economic dynamics including a growing population and improving affluence which is driving an increase in enrollment. In healthcare, the need for services aligned to demographics, together with an increasing specialization of provision (for example around chronic lifestyle diseases including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), remains key to increasing demand. Overall, our investments are well placed to benefit from these trends, supporting confidence in our investment strategy and ambitions. Other initiatives from the government, for example, the Dubai Health Authority's Health Investment Guide, which it launched in 2018, are also important in shaping our views on investment opportunities in Dubai. This is because we seek to become the investment partner of choice in healthcare and education, helping to deliver high quality services aligned with the Emirate's requirements.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges investors are facing in the Dubai Market?</h4><p>Volatility in oil prices since mid-2014, and the ensuing effect on the economy, has impacted Dubai's main bourse index and liquidity in the UAE's stock markets, which are still seeing much lower average trade values. Additionally, rising interest rates in the UAE have also affected investor costs when it comes to accessing funds. That being said, the government is addressing these challenges, for example, by approving the largest federal budget in the country's history, with more than half allocated for education and social development. The fiscal year of 2019 will have a balanced budget of Dh60.3 billion, an increase of 17.3% from this year's Dh51.4bn budget, which also prioritized community development and education. Education will receive Dh10.25bn, 17%, and the Healthcare sector will receive Dh4.40bn, or 7.3%. So, whilst we recognize that there are challenges, we also believe that there are a number of interesting opportunities arising from this backdrop.</p><h4>Amanat Holding specializes in investments around health and education, why did you select these specific sectors? How are these sectors evolving in Dubai?</h4><p>At Amanat, we are focused on collaborative investments that make help improve people lives. We are on a mission to enhance people's prosperity, physically, intellectually, and financially. On a practical level, our team benefits from a wealth of expertise in our chosen sectors of healthcare and education. We aim to leverage these strengths to empower our portfolio companies to create long-term sustainable returns and a lasting legacy. We are also aware of the fact that the challenge for both the healthcare and education sectors is to continually enhance and adapt their offerings in an ever more demanding environment, underpinned by technological advances and growing demographic pressures. We perceive this challenge as an opportunity for Amanat to add significant value and support continual improvement. We firmly believe that Amanat has the potential to become a game changer in healthcare and education, not only in the UAE but at an international level.</p><h4>How is increasing digitalization and specifically AI transforming businesses and operations in Dubai?</h4><p>Dubai has demonstrated a strong commitment toward the development and implementation of a digital-first economy, including through AI technologies. Whether this be through the launch of smart pharmacies or the use of AI in the classroom, the government is working together with businesses to lead the way in this arena. We expect that the digital transformation agenda, and specifically AI, will significantly increase the competitiveness of companies by driving efficiencies, enabling them to streamline their operations and better address their customers. This is especially relevant to labor-intensive sectors, including healthcare, where we should see exciting gains from AI. In light of this, Amanat continues to explore and address opportunities in AI across its investment portfolio to ensure our businesses can benefit from this potential.</p><h4>How would you assess the way businesses in Dubai are reacting to initiatives to increase diversity and inclusion?</h4><p>The UAE as a country is fully committed to fostering diversity and inclusion and this is a clear strategic priority for more than half of UAE organizations as it enables them to be more competitive. Over the last few years, Dubai has made great strides in driving forward the diversity and inclusion agenda. The public sector, in particular, has shown its commitment to supporting and empowering women in the workplace. The private sector is also closely following suit through targeted initiatives including mentoring programs and flexible ways of working.</p><h4>What are your main goals and objectives for 2019?</h4><p>Born out of Dubai and the UAE, Amanat's strategy is to invest in attractive healthcare and education opportunities across the GCC and beyond. To date, our portfolio has primarily been focused on the top two regional economies of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and we recently expanded our geographic footprint to Bahrain, where we acquired a leading healthcare asset. In 2019, we have plans to expand our footprint to take advantage of opportunities, both close to home in the UAE and beyond the Arabian Gulf. Looking ahead, Amanat will continue to invest in businesses that are distinctive, differentiated and competitively sustainable, where we can build long term value and the investment landscape for education and healthcare in Dubai is ideally aligned with these criteria, supported by initiatives such as Dubai Plan 2021.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the cardboard and paperboard industry developed in recent years?</h4><p>The paper and cardboard industry faces new challenges in Ecuador due to the global trend of saving resources and the digital era. The packaging sector generally grows based on the growth of the population, and the future is promising because of the extensive use of packaging by large shopping chains. Ecuador is a large consumer of cardboard because it is a leader in the export of bananas. In 2017, 326 million boxes were used for bananas and this is on a growth trend. The cardboard industry enhances its presence and usefulness, since it is considered a biodegradable product that is in favor of the environment.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your customers?</h4><p>Technological changes are part of the industrial development, and this leads us to be innovators in a consistent way by providing our customers with a different product with added value. We work in different sectors: banana, shrimp, converter, floriculture, industrial, non-traditional, fishing, and folding. The paper and cardboard industry is broad, and it has the privilege of knowing what happens in different sectors of the economy. When the economy is activated, there is a higher consumption of boxes. Our technology allows us to have products manufactured with excellent materials, excellent service, and extremely competitive prices. To guarantee the excellence of our products, we have an integrated management system that guarantees our processes. Thanks to the commitment and dedication of our team, we have acquired ISO 9001: 2015, accredited by the Ecuadorian Accreditation Service (SAE) and the National Accreditation Board ANSI-ASQ (ANAB) of the US; OHSAS 18001: 2007, the Occupational Health and Safety System, accredited by the National Accreditation Body of Colombia (ONAC); Business Alliance for Secure Commerce (BASC), which generates a culture of safety in all processes related to the logistics chain; FSC chain of custody, a certification from the Forest Stewardship Council that guarantees our products come from responsible forest management; and SMETA (Sedex), an ethical trade audit based on four pillars: safety and health, labor standards, environmental management, and business integrity. Additionally, we have implemented SAP software, which provides us with real-time updates to search for solutions that are aligned with the most important trends in the industry and allows us to make better decisions and be strategic in the business.</p><h4>How do you approach sustainability in your production?</h4><p>Sustainability is one of the strategic pillars of the company. We work with materials that take care of the environment and are sustainable in the long term. In addition, we support and encourage the circular economy and we have optimized management of our resources. As part of this initiative, several technical areas will use solar energy in the new plant. Our products are inspired by future generations who are more aware of the need to be organic. We are a socially responsible company, and we are working on projects aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that directly influence our business with the mission of contributing to the development of the country by generating value in education and sources of employment.</p><h4>What is your vision for 2019?</h4><p>We are in the process of industrial transformation, where technology and innovation are paramount axes in our company. The group is investing USD30 million in the construction of a new plant with cutting-edge infrastructure and German machinery, increasing our production capacity significantly. We are talking about Industry 4.0, where robotics and artificial intelligence play a significant role in our processes. This investment will generate positive benefits for national development. Our industry will continue with an expansion plan of technological development, increasing technical capacity, and generating work sources. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[carlos-sanchez-general-manager-bmi]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why do international giants like BMI choose Colombia as the next step in their expansion? </h4><p>BMI chose Colombia because it was looking for a market that has opportunity to grow. The Colombian market has a lot of potential in life and health products, where BMI is focused so this is a big opportunity for us to develop. The individual penetration in Colombia is low; hence, we believe we have great opportunity to make an important impact.</p><h4>How does BMI see its role in the development of the market from a consumer perspective? How will it leverage its experience as an international market leader to develop the insurance market? </h4><p>The company has been more than 45 years working and focus in individual products, protecting Life and Health of the people. We want to bring that experience to Colombia. We are specialized in these products and it is a major opportunity to develop this market in Colombia. Colombia needs more companies focused in Life Insurance to develop the personal market.</p><h4>What lead to the decision to start a new company instead of acquiring something existing? </h4><p>The process to acquire businesses in Colombia is difficult and competitive. We chose to start a new company because that way we will have control from the start. The company has made it clear that we also do not want to develop any other business lines, we want to keep our focus on life and health insurance.</p><h4>What is BMI going to bring to this market?   </h4><p>We bring the experience of more than 45 years in the Latin American market. We are leaders in Ecuador and developing markets like Costa Rica and Guatemala. We have a lot of opportunities and characteristics in those markets that we bring to Colombia. We can leverage the capacities that we have in other markets by bringing them here.</p><h4>What role do you hope Colombia will play in BMI's global portfolio?   </h4><p>Each market where BMI is, has good experiences for Colombia as Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Ecuador. The Ecuadorian market is a good example as a blueprint for our operations. We are going to take the experiences from there and grow in the Colombian market similar to how we are there, but we hope only faster. In five years, we would like to be in the same places as Ecuador, that is our goal to developed the personal market.</p><h4>What other international markets is BMI looking to expand to in the near future? </h4><p>For now, Mexico and El Salvador are the closest.</p><h4>What do you consider to be the potential for new players entering the insurance market in Colombia vs. other markets BMI is looking to expand into? </h4><p>For BMI, Colombia has one of the best markets in the region for developing insurance products. The low penetration, respect to the GDP, the positive perspectives in terms of economic and political stability make Colombia as a good market to developed and invest.</p><h4>What is your strategy to capture a market share in the market segment that BMI is targeting?</h4><p>We are working on three strategies in a short term. First, we have to do a lot to positioning the brand in the Colombian Market as a Personals Insurance Companies. Second, we need to develop the independent sales force with specialized training and excellent incentives. We are working to develop the right tools based in technology to support their business. We believe agents are fundamental in BMI's strategy. Third, we need to design products that cater to the customer's needs. The base are going to be the Segments. The concept of the family and life products must be maintained and updated to take them to mass market. We have to focus on that and of course in the marketing strategies for the company.</p><h4>What are some of the specific needs in Colombia? </h4><p>We have to analyze and adapt to the local market our main strategies but in general the structures are the same as we have been working in each local market like in Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. We have developed efficient processes and we have to bring the best practices there and apply to Colombia.</p><h4>How does BMI plan to attract and develop the best human capital? </h4><p>We need to work to attract and develop the best employees and of course the best sales force. We are focus to develop the different skills of the people, focus in customer service and efficient processes as our promise of value. In the other hand, we have an independent sales force that works for multiple companies in the market. We have to develop those strategies and tools so that they choose our company over other companies. The training, incentives that we built for them dictate if they will choose you or not. But the main strategy is to focus on service. In order to be successful, a company has to develop the best service and processes as well as technology and incentives. At the same time, it is important to train salespeople regarding what differentiates BMI, what is our promise of value.</p><h4>What can we expect from BMI Colombia in 2019 and beyond? </h4><p>I have a clear objective, to get the company to be recognized in 2019 as the specialized company in personal insurance. Whenever there is a necessity to purchase a personal policy like health and life, we hope BMI is the answer.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Thinking ahead]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[walid-el-hindi-ceo-imkan]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do your key projects reflect the current demand in the market, and how integral is your research strategy within the scope of what you do?</h4><p>The research element is a core value proposition at IMKAN; all of our projects begin with comprehensive research that looks at different verticals such as, design, sociology, technology, law, economy, fashion, food, and more. Our portfolio demonstrates forward-thinking and place-making projects. The Artery, for example, was born from the need for a parking structure that allocated a certain number of spaces by code. Our research team predicted future trends in parking by studying the social behaviors, habits and inhabitants commuting in thriving cities. We found out that parking structures are now less considered as recurring revenue assets. While globally the use or purchase of new cars is falling as a result of carsharing trends and technologies such as Uber and Careem. It is imperative to think ahead and much differently, to satisfy current requirements while also meeting future trends that will soon become a reality. Hence, we developed a hybrid space that is so flexible that we can convert the entire asset into something purposeful for the community. It is structured in such a way that allows for dynamisim, doubling as both an event space and parking garage. It has become an asset that gives back to the community and is more than just parking. It is The-Artery, the pulse of the entire Makers District development that feeds it with life, buzz, and soul.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the environmental impact of such structures?</h4><p>Interestingly, I like to refer to  New York City as one of, if not the most sustainable city in the world because its footprint is so small. A concentrated high-level population in a small space means greater efficiency -  such as utilities as an example. This is a different concept of sustainability. The cliché of real estate development is how we can achieve certain ratings for energy efficiency. We tend to forget something important: if you do not create an asset that generates life, you miss the point. One can have the most incredible building; however, if it is unoccupied or cannot be run efficiently 24 hours a day, it will have an impact on the environment. What is truly sustainable is building something that is utilized as much as possible. When one has a development that is active all-day long, and people are using it, it is a much more sustainable model. European cities are pulsating with life around the sections of town where there is retail, F&amp;B, office, and residential; the space is fully used. Abu Dhabi, is home to business districts with buildings that have restaurants under them, and they all work well during lunchtime Sundays through Thursdays; however, at other times they are underutilized.</p><h4>What needs to happen in Abu Dhabi to rewire the way developers think?</h4><p>I would invite the city to look at its current hybrid of neighborhoods. There are neighborhoods such as Khalidiya where there are retail and shops on the ground floor and offices, residences, schools, and so forth above them. I would argue that this is the most vibrant neighborhood in Abu Dhabi today. Whether people might want to live there or not is a matter of choice; however, it is a great use of space. Through our research we understand, such vibrant neighborhoods are extremely successful, though they could benefit from a new approach. The buildings may not have been designed as efficiently as buildings in Europe, for example, perhaps there wasn't much consideration given to the sidewalks, or the amount of landscaping could be increased. If we embellish this, we could have a beautiful new city center for Abu Dhabi. Everywhere in the world, such neighborhoods are the “golden" sections; the architecture can't be beat, the atmosphere is unique, and it is where people want to be. However, if the proportions are wrong, it will struggle to succeed. In my experience, the balance of usage and scale, along with well-defined streets and sidewalk width and the right amount of landscaping and trees, is the recipe. If we put all these ingredients into a bowl, we will have the perfect meal. Perhaps Abu Dhabi currently offers more of one ingredient than the others.</p><h4>When you approach a design concept, what is your strategy to enrich communities and promote social cohesion?</h4><p>We like to add an aspect of psychology to our research, and this is what helps us tremendously. The basis of everything we have worked on thus far is social interaction. Looking at the example of the Makers District, we are working to build nodes of interactions for people. The more we create such nodes, the higher the rate of success for these developments. Everyone I meet, whether a client or prospective partner, asks how much something costs per square foot. I would flip the question by asking;  what the rate of return on the investment is. Let's consider why certain places in Abu Dhabi today have a waiting list, while other places are half empty. The half empty places are significantly cheaper and possibly even half the price, while some prefer to wait in line for space in a different community or area. It is the same formula of scale, greenery, services, amenities, and how they all come together. This is a formula that takes years to develop through research and studying. However, once it is perfected, you do not give it to anyone else.</p><h4>How can disruptive technology such as AI help in the creation of these environments?</h4><p>These tools are a great asset to us. We have already engaged with a 3D printing firm out of Paris. New technologies also assist us in the public realm, which will make our work financially more efficient while providing invaluable data. For example, there are now microchips that can be inserted into concrete pouring. It is being used as a tool that can be scanned with a smartphone to collect data such as time spent in that zone, amenities, and so on. This is the type of technology we seek to integrate into our developments. 2019 will be a big year for us as we are providing many tangible proof points through the delivery of our first few projects. For the first-time ever, we will show off examples of some of the tech we have been talking about. We will hand over three projects in Abu Dhabi in 2019 as well as projects in Cairo and Morocco.</p><h4>What is your assessment of diversity and gender parity at your company and in Abu Dhabi generally?</h4><p>Some of the best ideas come from uninhibited minds, and we fully embrace this. When one enters into the business world and dives into the mindsets and realities there, certain restrictions come into play; people are prone to say “No, it is not possible. It is crazy, and it will never be approved." However, uninhibited brains and young students or youth coming in do not have such restrictions. We could bring in 100 ideas, and 95 of them might be unfeasible or commercially unviable. However, five of them could work and could be turned into something special. Getting these 100 uninhibited ideas is not possible without a young, diverse team. They feed the company with the vibe and the soul we need. In our research department, we have many interns from all over the globe. We have graduates from Cornell, Harvard and New York University to name a few. They bring a great deal of value to our organization, and not just in terms of fresh ideas, but also in keeping us close to the pulse to future generations. In the future, in 10 years' time, they will be our customers. More than 65% of the population is under the age of 30 in this region. Being in touch with the youth is integral to our strategy, and I hope to continue embracing that vision going forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Serving both business and leisure travelers, how do you position Pine Cliffs Resort within the hospitality industry?</h4><p>Looking back at its 25 years of history, Pine Cliffs Resort was positioned as a leading destination for the leisure and family market, also due to the continuous investment and enhancement made to the resort. These efforts have been recognized, and several distinctions were awarded throughout the years, the most recent being the World's Leading Luxury Leisure Resort, Portugal's Leading Family Resort, and Portugal's Best Spa Resort. Pine Cliffs, with its wide range of facilities, is the perfect destination for individuals and family leisure travelers who are looking for well-being and lifestyle programs, offered at our brand-new Serenity Spa. It has received recognition worldwide and was recently awarded with the Best Luxury Wellness Spa Award in Europe. Due to the recent expansion of the property and the launch of two new products—Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites and Pine Cliffs Gardens—we are now a global player in the corporate and incentive market, benefitting from the global sales offices and loyalty programs for individuals and corporate accounts. In addition, Pine Cliffs Resort is the only Marriott property with these extensive and diversified facilities in Europe, which makes us unique.</p><h4>What are your unique offerings, and how can people utilize your premises for special events?</h4><p>The resort's location is unsurpassed, standing on a spectacular clifftop overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. To top that off is the beauty of the hotel's impressive Portuguese architecture with a perfect combination of the Algarvian and Arab influences. Another unique feature is our beautifully manicured gardens, which offers a great space for special events such as weddings or product launches, namely top of the range bikes and cars. Guests can also enjoy a tennis match at the well-known Annabel Croft Tennis Academy as well as our gold course, which is amongst top 50 in Europe, or enjoy a stunning beach that was elected by TripAdvisor users as the best beach in Portugal and the 12th-best in the world. For our fit-fans, the fitness center “Pine Cliffs Goes Active" offers a range of individual and family activities with personalized service enabling guests to recharge energies.</p><h4>What is the breakdown of guests at Pine Cliffs Resort?</h4><p>Pine Cliffs benefits from a diverse geographical source of business, with the main feeder markets being the UK, Germany, and other European countries. There has been an increased interest out of Russia, the Middle East, and emerging markets, which have also played an important role in the local market over the recent years. There is a great diversity geographically in terms of the types of leisure guests. We can see families enjoying the resort as well as more leisure travelers with interest in sports, well-being, and lifestyle culture. In the business segment, the Algarve remains a unique destination either for incentives or using the destination for product launch events.</p><p><br><br><br>What is your assessment of the tourism sector in the country and of the hotel market in the Algarve specifically?<br>Portugal will continue its healthy growth process, mainly in cities such as Lisbon and Porto, as it enjoys a privileged position among the top three safest countries in the world. In 2018, a similar trend is expected in the Algarve region, but with a softer demand growth because competitive markets such as Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia, and Greece are gaining share of the global tourism market.</p><p><br><br><br>What are your main priorities for 2019?<br>Considering the geographical diversity, we strive to improve our offers to the various demanding holidaymakers coming to the Algarve. We will continue to focus our position in the market with the newest additions in the resort—Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites and Pine Cliffs Gardens. Together with our parent company, United Investments (Portugal), S.A., we will further enhance the overall existing facilities that will contribute to reinforcing the prestigious image of the resort. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[An All-in-one Destination]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[an-all-in-one-destination]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the Tourismo Centro de Portugal do?</h4><p>Our strategy, whether from the point of view of the domestic market or the external one, is based on five main axes. First, we are a cross-selling destination between Lisbon and Porto, an international affirmation that gives us world heritage sites and destinations that are highly differentiated when it comes to nature tourism, Serra da Estrela, and the sea. We not only have heritage and culture, but also many activities related to surfing and supertubes, not to mention a growing number of activities like cycling, walking, and religious tourism, in particular Jewish tourism. These five axes—touring, surfing, walking, cycling, religious, and rural tourism—are what we're staking our strategy on to attract new markets such as Brazil, Canada, the US, and Asia.</p><h4>Over 20 million tourists now visit Portugal on an annual basis. How has this affected the country? </h4><p>We calculated there were nearly 6.5 million overnight stays in 2017, with growth coming mainly from Brazil, the Netherlands, Poland, and the domestic market. Key points that influenced this were the visit of the Pope in 2017, which generally brings a million visitors, the centennial celebration of the apparitions of Fatima, and the impact of social media on surfing and Nazaré played its part. It is worth remembering that for the centennial celebration of the apparitions of Fatima, some of the most important markets were South Korea, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, Brazil, the US, Poland, and Israel. </p><h4>How do you describe a typical guest who chose Portugal over other countries? </h4><p>Families with small children, especially those who like cycling, walking, surfing, and windsurfing, are increasingly choosing Portugal as their preferred destination. Notably, in 2019, central Portugal will host a world surfing championship that will only bring more. </p><h4>How do you assess the future of eco and rural tourism in Portugal?</h4><p>Central Portugal has one of the largest levels of rural tourism, and we have several examples of sustainable and environmentally responsible tourism. There is an eco-hotel whose whole process is made up of sustainable facilities and whose pest control, for example, is managed internally by frogs. Portugal has more than 70 river beaches with blue flags, one of which, Mira, has the longest standing blue flag in Europe. Similarly, there is a significant number of beaches with golden flags, which refers not just to the quality of the beach, but also the environment and water. A number of these beaches are located in isolated rural areas.</p><h4>What is a typical itinerary for a more high-end visitor?</h4><p>Central Portugal is not characterized by the existence of large hotel chains; our core is 'small is beautiful' and related to small family units and intimate friendships. When we talk about Areias do Seixo Hotel, Casas do Cor Hotel, H2O Hotel, or Vista Alegre, these are places where the customer is greeted as a family member and where the owners perform or oversee all services. Brands such as Vuitton, Maserati, and Vogue have done catalog for these hotels. Casa do Cor is a typical example. Another example is Marialva, which is situated in a village in the heart of the Serra da Estrela and is managed by the daughters of the owner. Portugal's best bet for the medium- to high-end segments is in this segment of small units with high levels of service. </p><h4>What are your goals for the coming year?</h4><p>We want to reinforce our attraction and our activities related to Catholic and Jewish tourism, such as Santiago de Compostela. We are working with partners such as Spain to coordinate actions aimed at distant markets. For example, we have already worked with it on a heritage appreciation strategy. Moving forward, we want to be seen more as the heart of Iberia and less as the center of Portugal. Altogether, we are repositioning our international approach. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is tourism as a strategic activity for the Portuguese economy?</h4><p>Tourism has been making a contribution to the economy in several ways. At present, it represents 12.5% of GDP, more than 50% of service exports, and almost 20% of goods and services exports. In 2017, we registered growth of 9% in terms of arrivals, breaking the 20-million mark, and saw a 19.5% increase in revenue of the 15% in 2016. Tourism is certainly expanding, and we see that expansion especially during low season and to more undiscovered regions such as Algarve and Madeira. The highest growth rates were recorded in the regions of Alentejo, the central zone of Portugal, and the Azores. The future is challenging; however, the sector looks extremely promising at the moment. Many Portuguese companies are investing in tourism and diversifying their activities; in addition, many external agents see Portugal as a country with an attractive tourism sector.</p><h4>What are some of the institutional capacity-building mechanisms to promote the industry?</h4><p>We follow specific values within our organization and employ about 600 people. We support the private sector by funding projects and providing training with a country network of 12 educational institutions, from which around 3,000 students graduate every year. The unemployment rate in Portugal is less than 8%, as tourism created 55,000 jobs in 2017 alone. We also have a department that advises investors in Portugal and takes care of all tourism-related statistics. We work closely with all regions, city councils, and trade associations to help them develop their products, either by investing in specific marketing actions or by working directly with them to attract tour operators, travel agents, or newspapers.</p><h4>How do you allocate your budget to prioritize areas that bring the most benefit and do you work closely with regional tourism promotional entities?</h4><p>We are one of the main players funding tourism promotion, and we work with them especially in three areas. The first has to do with accessibility, so that tour operators, travel agents, and airlines get to know our infrastructure. The second has to do with international marketing with actions such as familiarization and press trips. For example, in 2017 there were around 33,000 international news articles on Portugal. The third has to do with structuring the product, which is a basic part of a destination-selling strategy. Our focus is to develop joint strategies of branding through international fairs, workshops, and roadshows in the 21 tourism outbound markets where we have representatives.</p><h4>What have been some of the crucial differentiating factors behind Portugal's record tourism arrival numbers in 2017 and 2018?</h4><p>There is a set of factors, and the first has to do with connectivity. The investment that has been made in terms of attracting airlines and tour operators and promoting the country as a whole is delivering results. The second has to do with positioning Portugal. In this regard, the attraction of large events has been extremely effective. For example, we will host the Eurovision Song Contest in Lisbon, with 40,000 people, and the third annual edition of Web Summit, with 70,000 visitors. We will also have 60,000 people from all over the world gathering in Lisbon for the Aga Khan Foundation as it moves its office to Portugal. In 2017, we supported around 66 conferences and congresses focused on diverse fields. Portugal is already on the top 10 International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) event organizers in the world.</p><h4>What would be your final personal message to encourage people to come and discover Portugal?</h4><p>You cannot skip Portugal. We do not only say this because of the landscapes, gastronomy, and beautiful heritage buildings and UNESCO sites. Visiting Portugal is a 360-degree experience. There are things that set us apart from other countries. We are the third-safest country in the world and have the second-best road network in Europe. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Atlantica University was created 23 years ago. What have been its main achievements and goals?</h4><p>Four years ago, the Carbures group decided to invest in Atlantica University to develop a training and research project through the creation of new studies to enhance the fundamental know-how of Carbures: engineering, aeronautics, and materials. The model has changed radically during these four years because it integrates the company's vision within the university; our differentiator is the company-university model. The company is the manager of research and training. The requests, orientation, and structuring begin at the company, in such a way that the university is an instrument that goes hand in hand with the company. Training that is not supported by a company and does not cover the company itself will produce good professionals but not practical theoreticians. The connection with the company allows us to establish programs and curricular units close to the company's reality. An example is the creation of the School of Engineering, which in turn has three areas of focus: aeronautics, materials, and management and production. Carbures needed to focus on the creation of future engineers of the company. To that end, we created an alternative program of studies adapted to the company through operational stays: co-regular practices. All students at all levels pass through the manufacturing plants of Carbures and Airbus in Spain twice a year. The convergence between Airbus and Carbures needs engineers and complementary studies, and we can create a different professional role in that regard. Through this, the students develop an experience that is unique in Portugal.</p><h4>Do aeronautics students go to Spain or local companies?</h4><p>A large percentage of the students go to work at Carbures because they have a theoretical-practical background that offers different things. The model encourages the approach of the company to the university, fosters differential and operational training, creates a cycle of training for Carbures engineers to be trained through Atlantica with up-to-date information, and creates a feedback cycle because the curricula of engineering are made from the real needs of an engineer in aeronautics or composite materials. This model encourages technical professional competence as well as the transmission of knowledge. Moving forward, we will start another line of research with the Carbures Foundation to develop concrete products in the area of composite materials. The Atlantica University is an instrument of the company to cover its social, welfare, and specialized training areas, which in turn allows the university to grow with specialized training as well as new know-how and real knowledge transmission.</p><h4>What projects have been developed with other international institutions?</h4><p>The Atlantica University has signed agreements with other institutions during the last four years. The fundamental driving force for the development of new agreements is the Carbures Foundation. The Carbures Foundation intends to promote and strengthen the Carbures brand, which was born in the university. We created a consortium between Carbures, Carbures Foundation, and Atlantica for the applied engineering in aeronautics and materials. This consortium opens the possibility of developing research delegations of Atlantica in the US to generate applied research agreements and partnerships. </p><h4>What percentage of local and international students does Atlantica have? </h4><p>We have around 2,300 students in total, and international students make up 30% of that. While Spanish and French students are common in the health area, Italian students have higher presence in the area of engineering and management. Moreover, we have students from Tanzania, Gambia, Angola, Mozambique, and Brazil. </p><h4>How does your partnership with Berkley work?</h4><p>This project was awarded to us by a Spanish company that has an agreement with Berkley. Students can spend four to fifth months doing their master's degree in Berkley and choose their desired course. At the end of the program, students can work in a company of choice in Silicon Valley for a year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you describe the main achievements and milestones of the institution?</h4><p>Although the university was established shortly before the revolution, it started operating properly after the revolution. This is important, because the founding fathers and mothers were Portuguese academics who had been working mainly in Europe and the US, bringing their experience to Nova University. This is reflected in the university's international standing; soon after its foundation, international conferences and meetings started taking place in the university, and various joint cooperation agreements were signed with other international institutions. Another important differentiator of Nova University is the close proximity between students and faculty members. One of the university's milestone is shifting from a public university to a public foundation. Being a public foundation requires us to raise 50% of the required budget through private means, which gives an idea of the university's relationship with the business community and competitive research money. This status means that many laws that apply to public universities do not apply to us. Therefore, we can hire an academic and offer a private contract, which means we can differentiate salaries and offer different clauses concerning teaching and research roles. Equally important, this allows Nova University to take advantage of its revenues and use it to hire talented international faculty. At present, there are only five such universities in Portugal. </p><h4>What are some of your main partnerships with the private sector, and how have these evolved over the years?</h4><p>We have institutional relations and protocols with almost every corporation that matters at the national level. Similarly, we have formed interesting relationships with several international corporations. Nova University is a comprehensive university with a business school, law school, medical school, a science and technology school. Different companies collaborate with different schools in several areas of joint interests. Interestingly, we recently started to develop an idea for collaborative laboratories. These labs are created with the goal of alleviating sustainable development bottlenecks within corporations. In order to overcome these bottlenecks, firms can either hire more people and do it in-house or partner with universities and create collaborative labs. These labs have an agenda set by corporations, and the solutions are collaboratively developed with academics. In Portugal, there are 11 collaborative labs, and we participate in nine. The idea is to allow these collaborative labs to help the development of regions that are not under the direct influence of the big cities. One of our labs is focused on agriculture, the Mediterranean diet, plant diseases, and plagues. </p><h4>Which educational factors are contributing to the falling unemployment in Portugal, and how do you help graduates find jobs in their fields? </h4><p>There are several factors that influence the decline in the unemployment rate. Some of it has to do with the level of education of young Portuguese people. In terms of helping graduates find jobs, all our schools have a student placement office with highly skilled non-academic staff that helps students find jobs. Moreover, the university prepares students to have contact with the labor market long before they graduate. This is part of how we reformed the university based on the Bologna process. Additionally, we have people from corporations participating in our regular courses at all levels. Furthermore, since Nova University enjoys international recognition, we have also had a great deal of success placing students at an international level. Our students travel through exchange programs for instance, and we make sure that our partner universities abroad can provide connections with local universities. </p><h4>What are Nova University's goals and priorities?</h4><p>We are a young university, but we have several research groups connecting with international research groups and overseeing substantial projects. We have research partnerships with top-ranked institutions such as Oxford, Cambridge, and Imperial College. Between 2003 and 2018, 50.4% of our research was in collaboration with other universities. This is a huge percentage, and it is more indicative of our international profile than many of our other statistics. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you describe the main achievements of the institute?</h4><p>The university was founded in 1967 as the fourth university in the country overall and the first not fully founded by the state. It was founded through an international agreement between The Holy See and Portugal. One of our schools, the school of theology, is accredited by the Holy See, and all other schools teach civil subjects and are accredited by the national agency. There are four major areas of achievement. First is the innovation of the cycles of study, relating to new subject areas that we introduced to Portugal's education sector. For example, Universidade Católica was the first to introduce a management degree. It was also the first university to enter the Financial Times rankings and to date, the university continues to lead the rankings. Another area that was introduced by Universidade Católica in Portugal was biotech, by creating the first school of biotechnology in the country. We are celebrating its 35th anniversary with an investment of USD50 million in partnership with Amaris, a US-based company from San Francisco, to create a joint project in the field of renewables. Similarly, the university is renowned to create an international track of education in law with LLM degrees in English and is the only university to date to provide this qualification with the US and the UK model. Another important driver of our success was internationalization. At present, we have 29 degrees that are fully taught in English, including management, economics, biotech, culture studies, creative arts, media and communication, political science, and law. The third element of our success is the success of our alumni. Universities do not exist on a self-referential loop for the development of faculty and the institution; they exist because of students, and we want to train these students and turn them into leaders of tomorrow. </p><h4>Universidade Católica has a broad variety of offered courses. Are there any new courses planned? </h4><p>We are planning a new degree in medicine and are organizing our offerings in life sciences. Additionally, we have new projects for dual undergraduate degrees, having already introducing a dual degree in law and business at our Porto campus. We are expanding this model now into management, bio engineering, law, and psychology.</p><h4>According to The Financial Times, Universidade Católica has one of the top 20 best MBA programs in Europe. What have you integrated in your offerings to strengthen competitiveness levels?</h4><p>The executive masters' degrees are one of our flagship programs. Universidade Católica has been involved in executive education since the business school was created, and ithas the trust of the Portuguese market and companies. The programs are now expanding to an international level, becoming more ambitious and attracting international students and companies. We have an extremely ambitious program with Sands China that is being taught in both Lisbon and Macau. Similarly, we have programs with the Keller School of Management and Business Education, Sloan, MIT, and Nova University. Our strategy is focused on expanding our attractiveness to international companies that are considering Portugal as a hub for investment. </p><h4>What did it mean for the university to win the Order of Public Instruction, and how does this contribute to its goals for the coming years?</h4><p>It is a recognition of Universidade Católica's contribution to the development of Portugal's social, economic, and cultural dimensions. It is a recognition of not just what we have done in the past but also much more of what we can do in the future. We have three goals for the future: our ongoing infrastructural development, launching the first private medical school project in Portugal, and digital transformation via an initiative called Católica 4.0. This will overhaul not only the IT infrastructure but also create a truly intelligent campus with machine interaction and give us more robust information through big data. Notably, we will also introduce an increasing scale blended learning, enabling our students to be more mobile. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you please give us an introduction to the company and its main achievements?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SÉRGIO REIS SOARES</strong> IVI was founded in 1990 in Valencia and was the first European clinic exclusively dedicated to human reproduction. It rapidly became a field reference and marker leader in Spain. The intention was to eventually become global leaders both in terms of clinic results and research, and the clinic started global expansion in 2003 with IVI Mexico and then Portugal, Chile, Argentina, Panama, the Middle East, the UK, and Italy. Another large step in terms of global expansion was the merger with the Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey in May 2017. Eight clinics have already opened in the US, and business is going extremely well. We started in Portugal just before the 2008 crisis, and with a great deal of effort, we have become market leaders in Portugal. An important shift occurred in 2016, when the Portuguese population started to feel some economic relief. Thereafter, 2017 and 2018 were especially great. We were in a privileged position and invested in developing research at IVI Lisbon, as we wanted this center to generate scientific knowledge.</p><h4>What kind of help do you see from machine learning?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SAMUEL DOS SANTOS-RIBEIRO</strong> At present, machine learning is a huge topic. It first started in the field of oncology as an attempt to predict who would respond to a specific type of chemotherapy or have a higher chance of survival. We are attempting the same in assisted reproduction exploring multiple avenues. The first approach is trying to determine accurately whether an endometrium is receptive prior to embryo transfer. A second is in the development of algorithms that can continuously assess embryo development. This latter strategy will have a substantial translational application into every day clinical practice if we are able to accurately film the whole developmental process of the embryos produced, as we need to evaluate many different characteristics that an embryologist may not be able to detect when assessing at specific timepoints only. In Portugal, those who can perform research have the means and patients but lack the general know-how to perform it. To that extent, we purposely did not initiate many of the projects we had planned and are, instead, collaborating with other national centers on having more site performing research. Our ongoing projects with private funding started in 2018; at the same time, government-funded organizations are also keen to finance research.</p><h4>What is your interpretation of the current health sector in Portugal?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SRS </strong>Though we have had an improvement, health services still suffer from limitations. Sometimes there is an 18-month wait for treatment at public units, and not everyone can afford private treatment. Even though we are unable to change the economic situation, we are trying to provide high technology medicine at the lowest possible cost. We also see challenging situations in terms of education, as the general population has little information regarding reproductive health care in terms of life habits that may have an impact on future reproductive performance. We have been trying to spread this information via webinars, campaigns, and courses. In terms of social responsibility, for years, IVI has been offering absolutely free cryopreservation of the eggs or sperm of patients who are about to begin oncological treatment.</p><h4>What are your main priorities and goals for 2019?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SRS</strong> One of our priorities is the patient experience program, which we are investing in significantly to automate many of the steps from the moment the patient enters the clinic. There are a number of stages during the process that can be simplified, and our goal as always is to improve in terms of the clinical outcome and care that is given to the patient, not only technically but also in the human sense. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Grupo Germano de Sousa was established more than 43 years ago. Can you describe the main achievements and activities of the company?</h4><p>For more than 40 years, we have placed ourselves at the service of our patients. The company's initial focus was on hematology, biochemistry, microbiology, and immunology. In 2009, we built a lab in the field of genetics. After that, in 2014, we shifted our building from Lisbon to our present location due to the increasing business operations that demanded more space. In the field of oncogenomic, the study of genes and malignant tumors, we have developed a highly skilled team since 2015. During this time, I invited three high-performance researchers to work with us in oncology. This area is extremely important because the main goal of our study is the type of mutations and fusions of genes found in both solid and liquid tumor biopsies. Therefore, our studies can help our fellow colleagues perform better diagnosis and therapeutics. It is an important achievement of our company's history because it was the pioneer in Portugal for liquid biopsy. We also study predictive risk in cancer, namely in breast, prostate, and colon cancers, among others. A percentage of the global population will definitely have cancer, and we are attempting to stop it in its early stages. The future is now and we are extremely pleased with our contribution in the precision medicine model.</p><h4>You are collaborating with the medical faculties at Universidade Católica Portuguesa and Universidade Nova de Lisboa. Could you please explain the details of these collaborations? </h4><p>In terms of teaching, we are connected to medical and biomedical students with a positive relation in laboratory medicine. Grupo Germano de Sousa has considerable influence on the future physicians of Portugal since it collaborates with Universidade Católica in a post-graduation laboratory medicine course and with Nova Medical School in immunology course. Notably, we have connections with other research institutions and foreign laboratories. Our company is known for its high-qualified doctors specializing in each area of clinical pathology, anatomic pathology, and genetics. We also have an active participation in international research groups.</p><h4>Do you have collaborations with other laboratories around the world? </h4><p>At present, the group is more than a network of clinical pathologies laboratories across Portugal. It is also a research center and a partner for institutions around the world, with whom we share clinical and technological knowledge in a wide variety of areas such as genetics, autoimmunity, molecular biology and oncological diagnosis. In terms of the group's future, we want to do better in Mozambique, where we already have a partnership. Moreover, we analyze biological products that come from labs in Spain, Angola, and Saudi Arabia, and we are currently partnering with laboratories in northwest Africa.</p><h4>What are the main challenges for growth for private health companies? What are the main priorities for your group in the next coming years?</h4><p>We have 10 million Portuguese people, and only 30% are treated by private health companies. Our purpose is to make diagnosis available for every patient that needs a good healthcare support. Innovation, quality, and precision have always been our motto. Therefore, we will continue with developments and challenges in medicine. We will continue to invest in modernity and diversity in terms of techniques and equipment to keep up with the latest requirements in medicine. We understand that science and medicine only really progress when technological development is combined with a deeper respect for human values and professional ethics. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the implementation of the national healthcare scheme in Portugal?</h4><p>Portugal has made significant progress in both reducing mortality rates and increasing life expectancy at birth in the last 40 years. The introduction of a universal immunization program and the expansion of healthcare services along with improvements in general living conditions have led to reductions in infant mortality rate and a steady increase in life expectancy. Today, Portugal is among the countries with the lowest infant and maternal mortality rates. Over the last 40 years, there was also a shift in the epidemiological features of the Portuguese population, with the increase of non-communicable diseases, namely cancers, circulatory diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and mental and behavioral disorders. The Portuguese National Health Service (NHS) has contributed to better health status through solid health gains. Nevertheless, as a new era approaches, the challenges to be faced and addressed by the NHS are different and more complex than ever before. For the next 40 years, the NHS has to find innovative and efficient ways to continue to provide healthcare to the population.</p><h4>How do you assess the synergies between public and private healthcare facilities?</h4><p>In Portugal, the private sector always played a role in the provision of healthcare services in specific areas. The relationship between the public and private areas is of complementarity though also to some effect competitive; in fact, the Basic Law of 1990 envisaged a competitive relationship between both sectors. Traditionally, the private sector provides care in some of the most lucrative areas and where the public sector fails to provide full or timely coverage, as is the case of medical specialist appointments, elective surgery, and medical exams. In the last two decades, the provision of healthcare services by the private sector has shifted from small medical cabinets, geographically spread, and more abundant in urban areas to variable size, well-equipped, high-quality clinics, and small hospitals where medical specialists are concentrated and specialized, and medical exams are readily available. This happened alongside the increase in the percentage of the population covered by a voluntary health insurance, estimated to be 20% in 2014. There are great examples of the relationship between the private and public sectors in the provision of care, such as the dental voucher, where the government contracts with private providers for specific oral care screenings and treatments for vulnerable groups of the population, or the provision of specific services in community pharmacies that are privately owned and well spread throughout the country. These services are aligned with the national health priorities and programs, namely at the primary healthcare level. Despite the great examples and the existing relationship between the private and the public sectors, there is a need to better define the boundaries between the two sectors, increasing transparency and clarifying funding and stewardship roles.</p><h4>How do you envision attracting investment into the medical equipment and pharmaceutical sectors?</h4><p>The Ministry of Health is always focused on attracting innovation into the health system, responding to patients' needs, and training. We will maintain and encourage the adequate access of medicines and medical devices for citizens and professionals' safe and rational use of new health technologies, fighting waste, and contributing to the sustainability of the whole system. For example, we have successfully introduced policies for the introduction and stimulation of generic and biosimilar medicines, making them accessible to the population and at the same time improving citizens' access to therapeutic innovation. NHS also ensures the availability of the latest scientific and technological state-of-the-art medical devices and differentiated products that save lives or significantly improve the quality of life of patients. While improving the access to these innovative products, we have to ensure the health system's sustainability, improving the definition and uniformity of the products' characteristics, adjusting the acquisition processes to the effective needs of the institutions, and improving market surveillance and traceability, for example. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the company's milestones and achievements in the last few years?</h4><p>We are part of a family business group that has concentrated its efforts in the edible oil sector in the last few years and become one of the largest olive oil companies in the world. At present, we have direct operations in seven countries across four continents, and we export to more than 70 others. We employ more than 1,300 people and own the largest private olive grove at more than 15,000ha. Our mission is to bring olive oil to everyone, and for that we execute different strategies in different markets.</p><h4>How have you expanded your presence internationally?</h4><p>The international expansion of Sovena began in 2002 with the acquisition of an company in Spain, a market that made perfect sense because it was the world's leading producer of olive oil. From there we began to develop the export business. We acquired an olive oil brand with a strong reputation in Brazil—Andorinha—and today we are one of the biggest companies to operate in the olive oil business in the country. The US market represents about 10% of global consumption of olive oil, so we considered being strategic there with a local physical presence. Thus, in 2005, we acquired a position in a company—East Coast Olive Oil—and we are currently working with major US-based retail and full-service chains. In order to achieve greater control over the olive oil value chain, in 2007 we took an important step in our strategy with a focus on olive groves. At present, we have 15,000ha divided between Portugal, Spain, and Morocco. Sovena has become one of the largest companies in the world in the olive oil business and is the largest packer of oils and olive oils in Iberia. To accomplish this, the company's industrial units in Portugal, Spain, the US, and Tunisia played decisive roles.</p><h4>Do you plan to enter other new markets?</h4><p>50% of our revenue comes from Portugal and Spain, while the other half comes from around the world. 2018 will be a successful year, with group turnover of around EUR1.5 billion. Our base is in Portugal, but we view ourselves more as an international company. For example, we are the largest player in the French market and are growing our presence in important markets like Germany. Other countries that do not traditionally have high olive oil consumption levels, like China, are also our targets. We have a JV with an important local group in China, and in the midterm, China will be an important market for the consumption of olive oil.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your strategy of combining your global scope and local presence?</h4><p>In Portugal, we are extremely focused on our brands, Fula (vegetable oil) and Oliveira da Serra (olive oil). The same goes for the Brazilian market, where we are present with our olive oil brand Andorinha. In Spain, we are developing other brands, like Soleada and Fontasol, while in the US, we have a local presence with our brand Olivari. The consumers in these various regions have different expectations, which is why we tailor our operations to each specific market.</p><h4>What measures does the company consider to be eco-friendlier in its operations?</h4><p>In 2019, we will have one more annual sustainability report, and as we are a diverse company in terms of operations, we have had different projects in different areas. We are in the process of developing more recycling and reuse processes. The agricultural project of the firm is an important project in terms of its eco-friendly strategy. The amount of CO2 that we capture from the atmosphere via our 15 million trees is extremely significant. This is the main driver of our work to reduce our footprint, though we have operations in many other areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of the evolution of Nestlé Portugal?</h4><p>The evolution of Nestlé Portugal is in a certain sense similar to the growth and evolution of Nestlé as a global company. Nestlé started in Portugal with a dairy business in 1923, and from there, the company evolved organically and through acquisitions, launches, and new categories to become the multi-category, multinational multi-brand company it is today. Nestlé has developed several local brands and products to answer the Portuguese consumers' needs. These include brands and products that became local jewels like Cerelac, Nestum, Mokambo, and Buondi, together with international products such as Nespresso, Nestlé Purina, and Nestlé Health Science. Food is a significant part of our portfolio and history, though we are also keen on the dimensions of health and wellness.</p><h4>Where do you see opportunities for the population to become healthier?</h4><p>We want to enhance the quality of life and contribute to a better future. Becoming healthier is a broad ambition because it is multifactorial; it is related to the food you eat but also to your lifestyle. Nestlé produces food and beverages that aim to improve the quality of life of individuals and their families. Moreover, we constantly strive to provide consumers with the best nutritional solutions, choosing the best ingredients, applying the latest scientific knowledge to the formulation, and providing solutions that are convenient to suit the different needs of each consumer according to age, physical condition, personal taste, and lifestyle. Reducing sugar is one of the areas we are active in across all categories; in Portugal specifically, we have been working extensively on significantly reducing the amount of sugar across our portfolio. Between 2013 and 2017, Nestlé reduced 2,750 tons of sugar from its products, equivalent to 11 billion calories. Similarly, we have reduced salt and saturated fat and developed a gluten-free product range as well as a bio/natural range of products across categories.</p><h4>How do you contribute to the social development of healthier foods?</h4><p>Being the most relevant food company, it is our duty to inspire people, share our knowledge in nutrition, health and wellness, and lead discussions about food. Since 1999, we have been working together with the Ministry of Education to enable teachers from pre and elementary schools to teach basic nutrition concepts to students. Nestlé was also a pioneer in developing and introducing new labeling schemes aimed to provide consumers with better nutritional information that help them make informed choices. Another aspect are the partnerships we have been developing with our clients to broadly spread educational messages to the consumers about balanced diets; these partnerships are fundamental as Nestlé alone does not have the means to solely impact its millions of consumers. Nestlé is highly active in supporting government efforts to improve the nutritional quality of foods, advocating for the improvement of nutritional profile of products and for the establishment of high standards across the food industry. </p><h4>How would you rate the level of human talent in your sector, and what are your strategies to retain the best talent?</h4><p>Portugal is increasingly becoming an active market and as a result, there is tremendous competition in terms of recruiting talent. At Nestlé Portugal, we have a low level of turnover as compared to other countries. Working at Nestlé is the opportunity to drive the market growth and be part of a company that provides state-of-the-art nutrition and takes good care of Portuguese consumers' preferences and nutrition needs. Our people will drive the change and help shape the future by participating in innovative programs such as “Fora da Casca," developed in partnership with Nova Business School. At Nestlé, people can enjoy a digital environment and a flexible way of work that allows a better work/life balance as well as other benefits like educational support, medical assistance, and health and wellness guidance, among others. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[breaking-barriers]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps has FIPA taken to foster the competitiveness of the local food industry?</h4><p>The food and drink industry in Portugal currently sees turnover of about EUR16 billion per year. FIPA represents about 85% of the entire food industry; we have branch associations, large national companies, and multinationals. We are a lobbying organization, and our main goal is to deal with stakeholders in government, non-profit organizations, and other associations. We have several ministries to deal with; in the past, we worked closely with the Ministry of Agriculture, though now we also work with the ministries of health, economy, environment, and finance on various aspects. Our networking is our greatest asset. We are recognized as the voice of the sector and follow all the developments.</p><h4>How does FIPA enable the food industry to capture a greater international market share?</h4><p>There are two major issues for our federation, and one is the competitiveness of our sector. With that in mind, our main pillars are innovation and exports. The global financial crisis hit certain sectors hard, and they realized the only solution was to grow exports. The boom in exports came after 2012, and in the last five years exports have grown by over 10% annually. It is not only about selecting products and exporting them; there are also trade barriers and logistics problems that need to be resolved. To that end, FIPA was extremely engaged in devising a strategy for the food and drink industry in Portugal to boost exports. We are engaged with the national competitiveness cluster that provides all the tools for international fairs, deals with trading issues, and picks our companies in an organized way. Notably, FIPA created what we call technical scientific mediators to create a link between universities and companies to transfer knowledge and solutions.</p><h4>What are some of the biggest competitive advantages of Portugal's food industry?</h4><p>Portugal has great raw materials in areas such as vegetables and fruit, for example. We have excellent technology in our factories and modern processes. When we entered the EU, we needed to adapt to new regulations and were behind many countries in Europe. However, today our new factories are world-class in technology. We have great human resources, and our universities offer outstanding education in the food industry and agronomics. As a small country, we have the creativity and know-how to take advantage of excellent raw materials; it is vital to have a great end product. </p><h4>What are FIPA's top objectives and priorities for 2019?</h4><p>We are pleased that Portugal is emerging from the crisis and recovering. We are currently dealing with several important issues. We have a major challenge with competitiveness and are working to ensure a more competitive food industry. However, there is instability in policies. For example, fiscal and labor policies are not predictable. If we want to grow with confidence and attract more foreign investment, we need to improve. One of the main challenges for FIPA is asking for more predictable policies. What is important is to be part of the dialogue on nutrition and creating an environment where dialogue can thrive. Our second-biggest challenge is being part of the evolution in society regarding consumer behavior and nutrition. Third, we have to maintain the reputation of FIPA and the industry. Sometimes, a negative perception about us is cultivated by health professionals, nutritionists, doctors, and more recently politicians. The fourth challenged is sustainability. Portugal and Europe as a whole will face more challenges regarding sustainability, packaging, pollution, and waste. We are dealing with the main circular economy, and it is a big challenge for us. We need to know what to do about food waste, packaging materials, logistics circuits, and reducing our carbon footprint. Addressing all these challenges will bring greater competitiveness to our industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[obada-awad-ceo-partner-time-entertainment]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major achievements of the past year for Time?</h4><p>The main achievement from 2018 was a quadrupling of everything we did from the year before. It is a challenge now to keep the same momentum. This presents an interesting challenge, and we have the chance to achieve it. In 2017, we had many firsts to report; the first ladies in stadiums, the first female dancers on stage, and many more. It was a year of building up our presence and setting new standards. In 2018, we took business to the next level in terms of quality, exposure, and names. This was an important step in the right direction and it made the market even bigger. The government was keen to support the private sector with investment. Companies are becoming increasingly specialized in certain types of entertainment, such as shows and festivals.</p><h4>Does the new content resonate with audiences?</h4><p>The challenge is to produce content accessible to the entire population. We are moving in the right direction and older generations know more now. Maybe they do not know specifics, but they can identify brands and know what is good and bad. For example, Cirque Du Soleil is a well-known international brand; there are some who do not know it, but they see that it goes far beyond simply being a circus. This variety and enhancement in quality is enlightening people. They feel and know the difference.</p><h4>How have you gone about creating your own projects?</h4><p>One of our KPIs in 2018 was to develop three new IPs, and ultimately we now have five. We also worked on getting international players to understand the market dynamics. We now have JV operating here. We are no longer simply creating IPs, but shows from scratch for Saudis with an international partner. There are investors who believe in the market potential, and now international companies feel the same and want a presence here for the long term. Many companies are investing in Saudi, and we are forming partnerships across many spheres.</p><h4>How are you marketing yourself as the go-to partner?</h4><p>Entertainment is a big focus for companies here. With the announced mega project underway, there is a vision to develop whole areas at once, with a significant demand for all related industries. They may call us to go work with them on developing a new concept from scratch. Our service is to analyze and help them develop ideas. There is solid collaboration between the government and private sector.</p><h4>What is the largest potential project in the near future?</h4><p>Something we want to do is create a permanent show for Saudi Arabia. This is a long shot, but we are working with big names to develop something of permanence. We are also working to develop a resident show with a new format that can be adapted, so that there can be three or four different shows, such as a show for the kids in the morning, or something for wider audiences, and then other shows in the evenings. This is a format of resident show that has been tried and done in other countries. The ultimate goal is to make these venues a hub for not only Saudi but the wider world. We want to bring in the next big thing in entertainment. We were behind for many years, and instead of just catching up, we want to be the innovator. If we do that, then we will become a destination. We can compete with Dubai, Singapore, and Macau, in our unique Saudi flavor and become a family entertainment destination. There is a big market we can serve, and we have all it takes. When we see an opportunity to add value, we are very proactive and with that attitude we move forward.</p><h4>What may we expect in 2019?</h4><p>We have signed some very big projects for 2019 and we want to develop more. There is something happening in the government there will be seasons organized by the highest level of the government where each city or area will have the attention and focus for a certain period. In each season we will focus on different aspects, for example classical music, marine activities on the Red Sea, or culture. Each area will be unique in terms of its offerings. It is creating a whole new ecosystem. If people want to visit Saudi Arabia they have a yearlong agenda.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dino-varkey-ceo-gems-education]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is GEMS Education and what is your reach in Dubai?</h4><p>We are the largest education provider in the world and, in Dubai, 48% of our schools are rated very good and outstanding compared to the market average of 21% as per the School Inspection Reports by the Knowledge &amp; Human Development Authority (KHDA). In Dubai, we continue to grow and expand and, currently, we have 124,000 students across 31 schools and 7,400 teachers among our 18,000 employees. We are a multi-price-point and multi-curricular group, which is critical in this market, offering the American, British, International Baccalaureate (IB) and Indian school systems. We cater to the ambition and aspiration of all demographics in any country that we operate in and deliver quality education for all.</p><h4>What is the current situation in Dubai in terms of education?</h4><p>Dubai is the best example globally of a K-12 education market, with the majority of schools in this system represented by the private sector. Dubai offers choice and diversity that you do not see in other markets; elsewhere there is the predominance of a homogenous public education system that does not cater to the ambition and aspirations of the people. In other markets, typically, you see expensive schools that are inaccessible to most of the population or charitable institutions that are not sustainable. In Dubai, you have choice for families with annual fees as low as USD2,000 to as high as USD35,000 per year. Due to the exceptional education system in place, parents are able to send children to MIT or Harvard from across this wide range of school portfolios, with the high quality of education their children gain. Consistency of student qualifications, character development and educational outcomes are evident across our portfolio. Today, the UAE is the largest market in the world for private K-12 international schools and is two and a half times the size of the same market in China. The top-five cities in the world in terms of private K-12 enrolment are Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, and Sharjah.</p><h4>How is GEMS increasingly integrating innovation into its education programs?</h4><p>At GEMS Education, the idea of innovation and technology has always been an important part of our approach. When I talk about innovation and technology, it is less about hardware and software and more about creating an ecosystem within our schools that give students the ability to dream and make their dreams a reality. That is what our schools are about; we enable our students to unleash their true potential through innovation and technology.</p><h4>In what ways does GEMS assist students in realizing their ambitions?</h4><p>In 2018, GEMS Education launched elite scholarships through which 10 students will receive full funding to 10 of the best universities around the world. We are conscious that families and parents are price sensitive, especially given the high cost of education abroad. We have set up a UniConnect Programme of partner universities that come in and provide scholarships for our students. At last count, we recorded over AED750 million worth of commitments from partner universities. In 2018, 400 pupils benefited from university scholarships, which was only possible due to our size and our scale that we leverage for the benefit of our students.</p><h4>What initiatives do you have to give back to children who would not usually be able to receive this sort of education?</h4><p>To date, over 4,000 students received scholarships and concessions within the GEMS network. We support the government on a number of initiatives, such as Dubai Cares, which is a major education-non-profit relationship, as well as His Highness' Scholarship, which supports local Emirati students. GEMS purpose and mission is to provide quality education to every student and learner no matter where they are in the world. We have great projects in Ghana in collaboration with the UK Development Agency, and we have had an incredible impact so far. Moreover, GEMS Education has set up a central studio in Accra and is serving rural village schools across Ghana. Every day, we have expert teachers teaching 3,500 Ghanaian girls three subjects a day; English, mathematics, in addition to a role modeling empowerment programme. It started with 3,500 girls and has now reached more than 8,000.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[jason-pok-hooi-loong-ceo-attarat-power-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief overview of APCO and its project?</h4><p>Attarat Power Company (APCO) is constructing the first oil shale mine mouth power plant in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Located at Attarat um Ghudran, around 110km south-east of Amman, the Project will be the first to commercially utilize Jordan's abundant oil shale reserves and will significantly reduce Jordan's reliance on imported oil and gas. As a country with over 30 billion tons of oil shale, Jordan has one of the largest reserves in the world. APCO, the project company, is 45% owned by YTL Power from Malaysia; 45% by Yudean International, a Chinese state-owned company; and 10% by Enefit, an Estonian state-owned energy company. We have been working on this project since 2006. This project used to have two distinct aspects: oil extraction and power generation. The project started with the oil extraction project after Enefit won the tender and signed a concession agreement with the Government of Jordan. Enefit invited the Jordanian authorities to visit Estonia, the Jordanian saw that Estonians also using oil shale to generate electricity. As electricity is more critical for Jordan, we have carved out a piece of land to develop the power project. We started drilling to gain a better understanding of the resources and applied for the necessary permits and licenses to start the construction of power plant. After negotiations regarding the tariffs and ran the EPC contract tender, we signed the final agreements in October 2014. Then, we had to take care of financing, which was very challenging as the project requires over USD1.6 billion in debt financing, which is above all financing for all IPP projects in Jordan. We attracted Chinese lenders to finance the project as we are using a Chinese EPC contractor. We also had support from the governments of Jordan, China, Malaysia, and Estonia to put this project together. Finally, we started construction in March 2017, and two units of the power plant will hopefully be ready by end of 2020. The total capacity will be 554MW (gross).</p><h4>How did you bring the Chinese investors onboard, and what makes this project strategic for bilateral relations?</h4><p>This is an extremely strategic project for Jordan and is also the first time that an oil shale project has been project financed. In other countries, oil shale projects are using corporate financing. We convinced Chinese banks that this is a strategic project for Jordan and had to negotiate with the Jordanian government to facilitate the incentives and protection to this investment. Moreover, 95% of Jordan's power generation depends on imported fuels, which is worrisome in a turbulent region. However, Jordan has an abundance of oil shale resources that have yet to be exploited. The Chinese side wanted to support the Chinese contractor and the equity partner within the framework of the One Belt One Road initiative. There were many challenges, as banks tend to scrutinize a project before financing; however, this project received favorable assessments from technical advisors, insurance advisors, and finance advisors.</p><h4>With one of the largest oil shale reserves in the world, what is the potential in this, and what could it mean for Jordan?</h4><p>Oil shale can be used locally in Jordan because, unlike Estonia's, Jordan's oil shale is relatively easy to extract and abundant. Once we kick start this project, the financing of future oil shale projects will be easier. When we wanted to start, there was no proof that we could succeed, and we had to work hard to convince the lenders about the viability of the project. Jordan's shale has unique characteristics, and it had to be analyzed and tested by boiler manufacturer. Future projects, however, will have precedence.</p><h4>What role do innovative technologies and sustainability play at APCO?</h4><p>We use proven technologies that are previously executed in Estonia. We use Estonia as a model because it has worked on oil shale for over 100 years. We have adopted the circulating fluidized bed (CFB) technology, which is suitable for the combustion of low calorific value fuels such as oil shale. This technology has been in use since 2004 and has proven to be reliable and has reduced levels of CO2 emission in Estonia. Given Jordan's climate and the scarcity of water in this location, we have also minimized the usage of water by implementing air-cooled condensers. Power plants in other regions in Jordan are provided with water and fuel; however, we are in the desert and need to drill our own wells, extract our own oil shale, and develop our own infrastructure. In addition to being mindful of our water consumption and CO2 emission, we also engage the local community actively.</p><h4>What will be the next step for APCO?</h4><p>At this stage, the main focus of the company is to get the plant operational and make sure we will finish on time and within the budget. Moreover, it is important to foster a solid relationship with the local community. Other projects in Jordan have made mistakes in this regard, and we have learned from their experiences. Not only do we employ the local population and train them, but we also let them add value to the project. Currently, we are in the construction phase, and we have about 2,000 people working on site. We have also created many indirect jobs throughout the supply chain including in cement, steel, petrol, and diesel fuel. We have hired over 700 Jordanians, 200 of whom are from the local community. Even though we are here as foreign contractors, we are keen to recruit from the local labor force. Once the power plant becomes operational, we will have 500-800 people working onsite for the power plant and oil shale extraction.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>This project is particularly challenging, as we are working in the desert and have to support a few thousand people working there. We will reach the peak of construction soon and look forward to the exciting moment, in early 2019, when we reach the oil shale layer. It will be a historic moment for Jordan, because it will be the first oil shale mine in the country. The energy sector in Jordan is exciting, and more renewable energy projects are coming up, which is great for the country. However, renewable energies cannot be stored for later use. As such, national grid management will become tricky, and there will be a need for base load plants to strike a balance in the national grid. There is some uncertainty regarding the political system, and many factors that can influence this project. For Jordan, this project will boost investments, create jobs, and kick start the oil shale industry. So far, the project has progressed as scheduled, which is a major feat given its massive scale. With an investment of USD2.1 billion, it is the biggest investment in the country's energy sector. Upon its completion, the power plant will be the second-largest oil shale-fueled power plant in the world and it will have the biggest mine in Jordan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Western Union in the UAE]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[hatem-sleiman-regional-vice-president-middle-east-pakistan-afghanistan-western-union]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What recent initiatives has Western Union been working on?</h4><p>In the UAE, digitization of all sectors has seen a big spike in the past few years and continues to be so. Customer expectations are constantly changing in response to the digital environment. These expectations of speed and connectivity have been carried over to their consumption of “digital utilities“ - from the moment one lands in the airport to the payment infrastructure and many other services required, to bring greater convenience to customers. We recently collaborated with Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), so customers can conveniently collect their security deposit refunds at Western Union locations across the United Arab Emirates and around the world. In addition, we signed a MoU with the Arab Federation to look at how we could help create an Arab-centric approach to e-commerce. More recently, Western Union announced it will collaborate with Amazon to provide a new payment option that allows customers to pay in person, in local currency, for their Amazon purchases, available initially in 10 launch markets and to be extended thereafter. Our outlook for 2019 is extremely promising.</p><h4>What makes Dubai and the UAE unique, and what are the key differences between your markets and the other Western Union markets?</h4><p>In the Middle East, each country has different dynamics, portfolios and customer behaviors. The UAE, to be specific, is unique for many reasons. It is one of the most multi-cultural and globalized countries in the world, with a strong need for cross-border money transfers to support children studying abroad, send gifts to family and friends around the world or support families and loved ones back home. It is also the regional hub for foreign currency exchange, sending and accepting large monetary transfers from the Middle East, Asia and Europe. Approximately 140 money exchange houses operate in the UAE, a country with a population of about 9 million people. There is a strong presence of diaspora communities from surrounding nations including Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, other African countries, as well as many Asian and South Asian nations including Philippines, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, who send remittances back home on a monthly basis, presenting a large market opportunity for Western Union. Also, the UAE government has played a key role in driving and fostering innovation in all fields. They have done a tremendous job in the past 10-15 years in terms of government investment, improving its infrastructure, attracting FDI and making the UAE a great place to work and live. UAE's willingness to keep innovating to maintain its position as a desirable location is one of its biggest strengths and sets it apart from other markets.</p><h4>How has this influx of people expanded the remittances market in the region?</h4><p>According to the April report from the World Bank, global remittances rebounded in 2017 after two years of decline. Overall remittances grew 7% to USD613 billion from USD573 billion in 2016, and an even greater increase of 8.5% in remittances going to developing countries. Growth of over 4% is expected in 2018. The influx of people is the backbone of our growth over the past years. Saudi Arabia and UAE were among the top ten destination countries for international migrants in 2017, according to a World Bank Report.  Additionally, Saudi Arabia and UAE are in the top 10 remittance sending countries globally.  The ambitious growth plans of countries in the region, with strong infrastructure development, continues to draw on talent from around the world, driving the need for cross-border money transfers.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges for the region and your sector?</h4><p>Digital technology is transforming the world, and FinTech and digitization are on everyone's radars. Our focus in the past few years has been around providing the best possible customer experience, network expansion for customer convenience. Today, Western Union has the largest network of agent locations with over 525,000 locations in over 200 countries and territories. Currently, digital transformation is our top priority. It wasn't easy and we're not stopping; we've transformed ourselves into one of the fastest-growing digital money transfer firms in the world, spanning 50 countries globally with our digital services, four of which is in the Middle East. We launched westernunion.com in Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and Kuwait, and the UAE will be launched soon. Lebanon and Jordan will follow next. The challenge we face is to accelerate this digital growth amidst the current regulations in place around money transfers. e-KYC (process for electronic customer profile verification online, post registration) is one of the initiatives we are working on, and we continue to cooperate with regulators to implement this initiative; this will make for a better customer experience for digital transactions. Western Union continues to explore new technologies that can bring a greater degree of efficiency and automation to the process of end-to-end customer identity, moving away from paper-based systems. Regulations need to be adapted to the digital transformation, to ensure customers' have the best digital experience.</p><h4>What advice would you give to the investment community that is considering entering the Dubai market for the first time?</h4><p>The UAE has made fundamental innovations in the past years and has simplified the process of investing in this country. The safety of the UAE and its pro-business environment that encourages investors are key to the success of the country. Dubai's infrastructure development makes it a great place to work and live.  When it comes to money transfer and remittances, this is a growing and changing industry, and one must always be ready and willing to adapt to new changes that will inevitably occur.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the company's performance and operations in the last 30 years?</h4><p>I set up my own business with the help of an experienced estate agent in 1987. It was the first foreign business in Portugal catered mainly to Anglo Saxon buyers who wanted to buy real estate in Portugal. When multinational Healey &amp; Baker made an offer to buy the business, I initially declined but as other multinationals set up in Portugal, I sold the company to Healey &amp; Baker (which was later acquired by Cushman &amp; Wakefield). We became a completely different business with a high focus on professional services such as valuation, property management, and more, though with a continued focus on transactional business. The support of an international organization and everything that comes with it—the brand, recognition, and client list—is incomparable.</p><h4>Cushman &amp; Wakefield was exclusively instructed to sell some Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD) properties in Lisbon. What other projects is Cushman &amp; Wakefield currently working on?</h4><p>The CGD building in Baixa is one of our flagship instructions, though it is a bigger portfolio with land in Porto, the Algarve, Palmela, and Lisbon. We do a great deal of office leasing work; one of our biggest transactions was the forward sale in early 2018 of a building that has yet to be built in Expo for Ageas, the insurance company. We are active in numerous sectors, including industrial and retail, especially stores on the high street. We are extremely active in Porto as well. One area that we specialize in is the sale of supermarkets, which is a popular investment medium because they offer usually long leases and attractive returns. </p><h4>What trends do you see in the real estate sector, and how do solutions shift according to demands and needs?</h4><p>We must look at that according to the sector because it is not the same for stores as it is for warehouses. There is a real boom in shopping centers in Portugal, which has some of the best malls in Europe. Another trend is that the high street has become extremely active. The lease legislation that changed in 2012 significantly contributed to this, as did tourism and the arrival of luxury retail. We have a database of all retail deals for the last few years, and 60% of retail transactions is in the food and beverage sector. In terms of investment, we see a completely different set of buyers when compared to the previous peak in 2007. The two main classes of players then would be Portuguese and German property funds, plus the odd British, Dutch, and German non-fund player. At present, we see a wide range of nationalities buying all different asset classes—from extremely opportunistic hedge funds from the US to core players and German funds that will pay high prices if they can buy something which is secure, newly built, on a long lease, and so on. In between, there is a whole spectrum of risk premiums. These are opportunities for the more adventurous investors and those looking for scale.</p><h4>What is your vision and priority for the coming year?</h4><p>Portugal did a great deal of work on the fundamentals as a result of the structural reforms imposed on it. This was to get public finances in order and reduce the deficit; however, in the longer term it has made Portugal more competitive and stable; removed the privileges of certain classes and professions; made the labor law more flexible, the state smaller, and the judicial system faster; and improved the lease law, which is extremely important for our industry. As a result, the structure of the real estate market is much healthier, as it is less dependent on bank finance. There will be a crisis, though no one knows when it will hit; however, Portugal is much better prepared today than it was 10 years ago. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the construction and real estate sectors for the Portuguese economy?</h4><p>The current advancements in the real estate sector hold great importance for the Portuguese economy; it has been completely transformed, especially over the last four years. Portugal needed a facelift by rehabilitating historical buildings and constructing new ones. The change in the sector has produced new jobs on a daily basis. It is vital to maintain the dynamism we are seeing today in the market. </p><h4>What have been some of the major projects that Temple Global has undertaken in recent years?</h4><p>It has been a journey where we have invested in several sectors. Although its core business is within the real estate sector, Temple Global is originally a family business that was established over 50 years ago. Around 20 years ago, we became one of the first Portuguese groups to look into China, after which we acquired a license for a cement factory. We stand out in the real estate sector on the back of our past and future projects. We have earned our credibility because we position ourselves in the market with the highest quality standards. We work with the best construction companies in premium locations, and we try to reach high-profile clients with top products. In terms of the rehabilitation work, Temple Global was the first company to undertake it. It was only in 2012 that Lisbon's regulations allowed for faster and more dynamic rehabilitation.</p><h4>How has Temple Global maintained its role as a pioneer in the sector?</h4><p>Due to our network across the world, we are able to study other market models and techniques and implement them in Portugal. The location of projects is another crucial part where we excel through our contacts and expertise; by working with the best construction companies, we have developed strong partnerships.</p><h4>In your dual role as CEO of Lince Capital, how do you work to capitalize on investment opportunities in the real estate sector?</h4><p>Due to continuous learning and expansion, the company is subdivided into three different groups. One is services, which provides everything associated with real estate, along with two management companies that set up real estate and private equity funds as investment vehicles. Since these are regulated, tax efficient, and guarantee a certain security to investors, they are the best means to conduct real estate business in Portugal. Then, there is a development group that works on future growth and market trends. The key to this subdivision within the company is that all the companies operate independently. Such a setup also allows us to act quickly in case of a recession.</p><h4>What sector or sub sectors of the Portuguese real estate market present the best opportunities for future investment?</h4><p>Previously, the Portuguese market did not fully open itself to foreign exposure, new ideas, and new businesses. Portugal is in a unique group of countries that offers a great quality of life that is affordable. In addition, the country has recently attracted an increasing number of tourists. We are also eyeing great potential in spreading the concept of co-working spaces in Portugal because of the large number of small- and medium-sized companies. Instead of paying for a huge space, co-working spaces enable companies to adapt to their needs and avoid spending unnecessary capital. Portugal offers a vast number of opportunities; however, similar to all other markets, investors must know who they are working with and how to market their final product.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Temple Global's performance over the next two years and what are the top priorities?</h4><p>There are instances when international capital leaves the market after reaching some success; Portugal has a low capital retention rate, and this is a gap that Temple Global strives to fill. With our two management companies, we want to build a strong management group—one that is a solid asset manager. We want to establish Temple Global as a Portuguese developer that can truly compete with the international capital and companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[jack-of-all-trades]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on the performance and main highlights of the company?</h4><p>Odebrecht's successful trajectory in Portugal started in 1989, when it acquired Bento Pedroso Construçíµes. Since the 1990s, when Portugal was experiencing a boom in terms of infrastructure development, we have been involved in the construction of landmarks such as the Vasco Da Gama Bridge, the Gare do Oriente Station, nearly 500km of roads and highways, approximately 10km of metro lines, several underground stations in Lisbon and Porto, and 150km of railways, as well as important hydroelectric power projects, such as Alqueva Dam, one of the biggest dams in the Iberian Peninsula that created the largest artificial lake in Europe and an irrigation network covering 110,000ha, and the Baixo Sabor Dam, an iconic project recognized not only for its engineering and design, but also for Odebrecht's efforts in terms of sustainability and preserving important archeological findings. Since its foundation, Odebrecht has worked on several other projects, including industrial infrastructures, water and sewage treatment plants, and airports.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Portugal's performance among the group's portfolio?</h4><p>Apart from its successful trajectory, our operation in Portugal represents an intangible asset in terms of providing highly qualified human resources for Odebrecht's operations in other countries. Over the last 20 years, engineers, managers, and people with different qualifications have been assigned to projects in the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The professional capabilities of Portuguese people aligned with their adaptability to different environments and conditions make them indispensable resources to the company's global operations. </p><h4>What projects are you currently working on, and do you have anything in the pipeline?</h4><p>Except for the Baixo Sabor Dam and Baixo Tejo Highway, which are still under the period of guarantee, and, therefore, require a certain level of activity, we are 100% concentrated on competing in the new public tenders to be launched in Portugal, such as those for the construction of metro projects in Lisbon and Porto. Due to the technical challenges inherent to such projects, we believe that Odebrecht, a world leader in metro and tunnels excavation works, possesses the required experience and expertise to submit competitive technical and commercial proposals.</p><h4>What is your strategy to maintain your high quality of human talent?</h4><p>We seek to conquer new construction projects, either in Portugal, where our focus is on public tenders, or Africa, where we maintain permanent offices in four countries—Ghana, Mozambique, Angola, and South Africa—and are highly active in terms of business development and assessing opportunities in new markets such as Zambia, Tanzania, and countries belonging to Southern African Development Community (SADC). If we are successful in our business development efforts, the Portuguese workforce will play a pivotal role in the execution of future projects.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for 2019?</h4><p>The main goal is definitively to win new construction projects in Portugal and Africa. The quest for backlog is a constant challenge to a contractor. Particularly in relation to Africa, our plan is to consolidate our operation in East Africa, in countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, where the construction sector has been growing at a steady rate of more than 7% a year over the last decade or so. In order to compete with Chinese companies, whose stake in construction sectors across Africa reaches more than 60%, establishing a local and effective presence across the region is of paramount importance. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do PTPC and Cluster AEC maximizes innovation and boost the overall competitiveness of Portugal's construction industry?</h4><p>In Portugal, people have excellent ICT skills and must be brought into the construction sphere. PTPC is in talks with other partners in the ICT field to add value to construction. We not only think about the physical part of construction, but also the information connected with infrastructure. We intend to work with companies in the ICT and communications systems sector to enter the field of smart structures. For example, it is possible to place sensors to monetize and measure functions and generate information. AI and the IoT are extremely relevant in this context. We are doing everything we can to extract the appropriate profit and contribute to society through the use of technology.</p><h4>How do you work to ensure the best possible synergies between associations, technical institutes, and private players in the construction and infrastructure sector?</h4><p>PTPC's starting point was major construction companies, though it also rapidly brings in designers, consultants, universities, start-ups, SMEs, and various associations. We look beyond the construction industry and create relationships with companies from other sectors such as ICT companies and their cluster in Portugal. We work with many players also outside the construction sector as well as associations and public entities.</p><h4>How do you boost sustainability in the construction industry to minimize the impact on the environment?</h4><p>Sustainability is a crucial issue for the construction sector. Our industry is the number-one consumer of natural resources from the outset of any building project, and we are directly or indirectly responsible for around 40% of CO2 emissions. Sustainability is not something new for the construction industry; it is part of its DNA. If we want to be competitive, it is essential to make excellent use of natural resources, recycle, minimize waste, and use less energy in construction. We have to be sustainable; this is the number-one issue for the construction industry.</p><h4>What are the objectives behind the PTPC proposed think tank?</h4><p>We are in the process of developing the idea and are producing a proposal to discuss with the government. Infrastructure development is vital for the country and should be prioritized. We are involving many experts from PTPC and Cluster AEC to make the proposal interesting, including information for potential investors about the value and feasibility of possible projects.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the performance of Portugal's economy?</h4><p>Regarding long-term investments, the infrastructure sector is promising. We have a great deal of activity in the real estate sector and prices are booming, mainly in Lisbon and Porto. However, there is also significant potential in tourism in other parts of the country. The government rightly wants to increase investment in industry in general, and such investments are essential because we do not want to have an economy based solely on tourism. At present, Portugal is ready to receive more investment in industry because it has an excellent transportation network and digital connectivity.</p><h4>What are some of your top priorities for PTPC in the coming years to continue to support the construction industry's development?</h4><p>We need to work more with architects because PTPC is a managing entity of Cluster AEC, which leads in architecture, engineering, and construction. Another focus is being up to date in digital technology and having a digital attitude. We need flexible companies that can respond to their clients' needs. This means we have to work with start-ups in a different way to help our companies during this digital transformation. This disruption is both a challenge and an opportunity for our industry and we have to open it up. We are focused on Industry 4.0 and on the circular economy and have to apply all our expertise to this. Universities are working closely with PTPC, which we are also pleased with. We have all the conditions to succeed, including a country with excellent potential, and are extremely ambitious with our plans. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones of CHEP Portugal since its establishment?</h4><p>In Portugal, we have the same approach that we utilize in any other country. We entered the country 25 years ago and were the first ones to bring the pooling system to Portugal. We offer customers a service that is more efficient, sustainable, and secure than the rest of the competition. We started as pallet providers, but subsequently realized our customers have a much wider variety of needs. Sustainability is also key, and we emphasize it in all our operations. In Portugal, this has been the main strength that CHEP has brought to the market.</p><h4>What is the importance of Portugal for CHEP's global activities?</h4><p>CHEP is in over 55 countries, and the volume and revenue of its Portugal chapter are no longer small. From a logistics perspective, Portugal is a challenge that offers certain knowledge developments that can be applied across the entire logistics chain. The dense network we implemented in Portugal allows us to quickly respond to our customers' demands, which is why there are many small transport companies with local knowledge. We can enter spaces using a system that other companies cannot due to their size. Thus, Portugal has been contributing to CHEP's understanding of how a global company can work effectively at a local scale.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of innovation in the sector?</h4><p>CHEP is part of the Brambles Group, which has invested over USD10 million in BXB Digital, a company that Brambles created to develop technologies and analytics to benefit the business. By investing in BXB Digital, the group is focusing on the future. As a market leader and a point of reference, we want to lead the supply chain revolution by using the IoT, big data, and other digital technologies, contributing to the improvement of productivity and driving the competitiveness of the market. The supply chain and logistics sectors have a gap in terms of technological innovation, which CHEP wants to fill.</p><h4>What measures has the company taken toward an eco-friendlier future?</h4><p>In terms of sustainability, our business model is heavily focused on recycling. By sharing and reusing our products, customers reduce the need for natural resources and the generation of CO2 and waste. We also offer innovative sustainable solutions to our clients, like Carbon Neutral products. We measure the carbon footprint savings that a specific customer achieves by working with CHEP. For the remaining CO2 emissions, we have partnered with Natural Capital Partners who provide projects that capture the same amount of CO2 generated in our customers' supply chains, which can then be compensated with different actions. 100% of the timber used in our European pallets comes from certified sources (FSC or PEFC Chain of Custody certified).</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities heading into 2019?</h4><p>The main goal is to make sure our customers and potential customers understand how CHEP is able to help grow their business. The past five years have been the most revolutionary in the industry, and we are still only at the beginning of the supply chain revolution. Due to this transformation, there are still players in the market that do not know what CHEP is able to provide. We need to make sure our team has the right resources to truly underscore what we can deliver to customers. CHEP looks at customers' needs and the needs of the broader industry, which allows it to continue feeding transformation. For example, our 'blue-click' quarter pallet is a simple yet revolutionary transformation that has allowed us to truly change the way the industry works promotions instore—inclusively, our assets can be intelligent to the point of receiving and sending data in real time and interacting with end-customers. On top of this, our Collaborative Transport Solutions are revolutionizing the way our customers and partners move their goods in Europe. CHEP has extraordinary vision and has demonstrated that it seeks to look out for communities and peoples, as well as the planet. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Yilport and its key milestones?t</h4><p>Yilport is a part of the Yildirim Group in Turkey, which is a major player in several fields and sectors, especially fertilizers, mining, and shipping. Robert Yuksel Yildirim founded Yilport when he started port management with several ports in Turkey in 2004 and 2005. That was the beginning of the company's port management operations and over the years, several acquisitions have taken place, starting with ports in Norway and Sweden. The company also has a port in Malta, and more recently, the group expanded to Portugal by acquiring a company that has a total of eight terminals in Portugal and Spain. Moreover, we also have a presence in Peru, Ecuador, and Guatemala. The strategy of the group is to grow, and the model is to be among the top 10 terminal operators in the world by 2025. Currently, we are ranked number 12.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the Portuguese market? </h4><p>The Portuguese market is growing every year and our terminals are well placed to serve the gateway market. Therefore, we support the growth of our terminals and international commerce.</p><h4>What advantages does Yilport have in Portugal, and what sets it apart from the competition? </h4><p>The Yildirim Group acquired the portfolio three years ago and created a regional office that enabled it to invest in equipment, yard, land, ports, and systems. Most of the terminals we took over were in need of renovation and new equipment. Our immediate challenge is to modernize the infrastructure and update the equipment, in line with our philosophy to look after our customers and cater to their developing needs. This is further supported by new IT systems, which will ensure good communication between all actors, such as shipping lines, ports, custom authorities, clearing agents, and end users. By operating as a single business unit, we share the best operational, financial, technical, and safety practices; safety is high on our list of priorities. Notably, the group has seven ports in Portugal and offers its customers a chance to come to different ports and get accommodated in different ways. We have created a global operation center, through which we can maximize service quality for each customer and deal with one single system. This will improve efficiency and provide us with better opportunities to offer better services. </p><h4>What are the challenges of investing in Portugal's blue economy? </h4><p>It is not an exceptionally difficult process compared to other parts in the world, but it still requires detailed planning and good collaboration between all the parties to get the best results. We have excellent relationship with our various stakeholders, such as port authorities, municipalities, the central government, and several banks and institutions.</p><h4>What are your human resource requirements in Portugal, and how do you tackle it? </h4><p>We are quite a young organization that has grown tremendously over the last three years. The group has a large team in Turkey that is still growing and developing experience and expertise. We require people working in the organization to be quick learners, and to that end, we have established strong development and training programs. There has also been a recruitment drive for senior positions so we can have a mixture of young talent and people with experience. Overall, enthusiasm for the company is quite refreshing and motivating. </p><h4>What measures need to be taken to become more eco-friendly? </h4><p>We have a strong drive to make each terminal as environmentally efficient as possible by developing an operation with modern eco-friendly machinery and automation.</p><h4>What is your vision and main priorities for the coming year? </h4><p>We have a strong focus on improving safety measures and procedures and implementing new financial and HR systems as well as a new operating system to manage the ports. Importantly, the fundamentals of the business and the port value propositions are strong. What is important is to spend time with customers and find some good solutions to ensure they want to come back to our terminals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the highlights of DHL's Portugal operations? </h4><p>DHL has been in Portugal since 1982. At that time, the operation began with half a dozen people, but as the need for DHL's services grew, so did our operations. At present, DHL grows in a consistent and well-established way, maintaining an infrastructural network that allows us to be increasingly effective in what we do. After 36 years in Portugal, the company has grown from half a dozen employees to 500 specialists working directly with DHL. </p><h4>What can the group learn from the Portuguese market?</h4><p>In 2017, we grew by approximately 23%, and we expect double-digit growth in 2018 as well. It is difficult to grow more than 10%, but we are on a strong growth path, much of it because of start-ups and e-commerce, both of which have turned out to be great engines. On the other hand, traditional industries such as automotive, textiles, and footwear also continue to spur our expansion.</p><h4>How do you expect logistics to evolve through the digital revolution? </h4><p>With globalization, logistics will be increasingly present due to the rise of the B2C segment. Similarly, as e-commerce becomes rampant, transport companies, especially international transport ones, will play a larger role in the whole process. We are highly committed to having an increasingly digital response. For example, at the level of our customer service, we are investing to ensure that customers have a digital experience with DHL, and that all functions that allow customers to interact with us through a smartphone are efficient. Moving forward, our focus is to fulfil the needs of the market. </p><h4>How would you characterize the current transportation segment in Portugal?</h4><p>There are companies that are slightly further ahead than others, and DHL is at the front as the company that has perhaps invested the most in technology. At the same time, there are companies that are continuing with a large technological deficit, and the market will eventually filter those out in an almost natural way. </p><h4>What are your human resource requirements, and how do you retain your talent?</h4><p>I was appointed CEO in March 2018, and it is extremely important to me that the company be approachable and invest the necessary means to provide specialized training to people in order to retain them. We have been investing in creating an excellent working environment. Based on that, our aim is to provide career opportunities to our people, either because they have a great academic curriculum or because they have demonstrated results within the company. </p><h4>What are DHL's main goals and priorities for 2019? </h4><p>In the short term, our challenge is to build a platform at Lisbon Airport. We have signed an agreement with ANA and are currently in the licensing phase. DHL's commitment is around EUR40 million for a 25-year contract with ANA, with the possibility of extending it up to 40 years. It will be a challenging project because we will be implementing the best technology; this is also a clear signal from the group that Portugal is a country that is starting to support all the investments it is making. In Portugal, the biggest investment we have planned is this one. We do also have smaller projects with the purpose of remodeling or expanding other facilities here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[second-to-none]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of Netjets' milestones in its 22 years of operations in Portugal? </h4><p>In hindsight, establishing Netjets in Portugal was a highly successful decision, as evident from the fact that the company's entire operations are now run from Portugal; the synergies we have had here have been outright fantastic. At present, all our aircraft are registered as “CS," which is the Portuguese registration. The local talent has been equally paramount to our success. Ever since we started our operations in Portugal we have felt at home; the country is receptive to internationalism and the Portuguese speak foreign languages eloquently and are very hospitable. Our European operations and training center are based in Lisbon, and at present we have around 500 employees working here.</p><h4>How would you assess the European business environment? </h4><p>The private aviation concept was born in the US, and it is a common business tool there. Although the US is the pioneer and leader of the industry, Europe is close behind. Over time, people have come to understand that if a company wants to be quick, efficient, and capable of reacting at the pace demanded by the business world, it needs a solution such as ours. Quite remarkably, even though shared ownership is currently a popular model across various industries, NetJets pioneered this concept introducing this approach in the aviation industry over 30 years ago. </p><h4>What strategies does the company want to develop in the medium term? </h4><p>We are well established in more mature markets, and there is huge demand in terms of market penetration in smaller economies as well. Similarly, NetJets is the perfect solution for companies looking for a robust and reliable travel solution. Our work is to continue growing our market penetration in Europe. There is a natural maturity cycle, and some European countries have yet to reach the level of acceptance this type of service has witnessed in countries such as the US or Brazil, where executive aviation has become a necessary tool. However, we still see huge growth potential in Europe for NetJets. <br>How do you recruit human talent in Portugal? <br>Approximately 60% of the staff members in the office are Portuguese. We try to hire the highest level of talent among our crew members. All pilots join NetJets as Co-Pilots and are required to have a minimum of 1,500 hours experience under their belts. Moreover, the company requires captains to have over 3,000 hours flight time, and our training is double that of the industry standard. So, we not only try to recruit the right people, but we give them all the tools to remain the best in aviation. Importantly, our pilots only fly one aircraft type because we want their reactions to be instinctive and for them to be fully knowledgeable of the aircraft they are flying.</p><h4>What's your outlook for the Portuguese and European aviation sectors, and do you have any expansion plans? </h4><p>Portugal is going through a special time. Of late, all the right pieces have come together to create a special opportunity, and Portugal has launched some initiatives that have made the country appealing internationally. Indeed, the country is very innovative and forward thinking. Some of the highlights are the start-up movement we are currently witnessing, the government's actions and initiatives, and the welcoming nature and openness of Portuguese people to other nationalities and cultures. Moving forward, we are curious to see how changes across Europe will affect Portugal. Rest assured, the opportunity for growth is there. We are already witnessing growth.</p><h4>What is the global value of this market?</h4><p>We are now the safest and largest player in the global market. We have 700 aircraft worldwide, which makes us the fifth-largest airline in the world, but because we focus exclusively on private aviation, we are the biggest in the sector. These figures allow for a genuinely attractive alternative to the solutions available in the market; we offer all the guarantees and advantages of owning a private plane, but with none of the inconveniences. Added to which, we guarantee an available plane within 10 hours, have an unwavering focus on safety, and very demanding service expectations, each of which are possible thanks to the economy of scale we have created through 50 years of experience. We stand second to none in the industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[tapping-into-the-dream]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major transformations and milestones has TAP seen in the past few years?</h4><p>TAP Air Portugal was owned by the state until 2015. Due to restrictions in the European framework, it was not a profitable company, and the state could not capitalize it. Between 2009 and 2015, Portugal had a tough time, and after the bailout of 2011-14, we had a difficult task convincing investors we were worth investing in. Conversations surrounding the privatization of TAP solidified in 2015 because of Portugal's agreement with the troika of the IMF, European Commission, and European Central Bank (ECB). TAP was subsequently privatized, and the shareholder agreement was reconfigured so the state could remain a shareholder. TAP is a successful example of a public-private partnership (PPP) in which 50% is owned by the state and 50% by private shareholders. It is a company that is extremely dear to Portuguese people; everyone feels as though they are a partial owner. This ensures a great environment and atmosphere within the company. It is also great outside because it leaves no room for rumors and creates a calm environment for the company to operate in. Since the privatization, we have been pursuing an ambitious strategic plan that includes renovating and expanding our fleet, reaching a lot more destinations, whether in Europe, North America, South America, or Africa, and, consequently, carrying more passengers.</p><h4>Can you provide an overview of your key routes and new aircraft?</h4><p>Our fleet is currently composed of 90 planes, and the plan is to have 120 or 125 in four or five years. We have also added many new routes. We have an important position in Latin America, mainly in Brazil; we are the most important European carrier connecting Europe to Brazil and have roughly one-third of the market. We serve 10 destinations in Brazil and will serve 12 in one or two years' time. We will also significantly expand our operation in North America and are more than doubling our destinations in the US. In Canada, we fly to Toronto. We will also expand in Africa and Europe. From 2019, we plan to fly to Washington, Chicago, Tel Aviv, Montreal, and San Francisco. In Europe, we will fly from Lisbon to Tenerife, Dublin, Basel, and Naples, and from Porto to Brussels, Lyon, and Munich. In the coming years, we will have plenty more destinations. TAP is growing significantly, and we are benefiting from and contributing to Portugal's global popularity. We are experiencing growth pains and need to recruit more pilots and cabin crew and order new planes. There will also come a point when we will need better infrastructure, as we have already been and will continue to suffer from bottlenecks in the airport, since we are responsible for more than 50% of its traffic. There are plans to expand Lisbon Airport by opening a new terminal in 2021, but until then we need improvements in the current infrastructure (facilities, parking for planes, runways, among others), as we want to continue to grow and transport more passengers. In 2017, we reached a new high of 14.5 million passengers, and in 2018 hope to achieve 16 million. We are growing at a great pace, but need the infrastructure to become more productive.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for 2019?</h4><p>We seek to continue to grow with quality and better serve our customers. That is what we are most focused on, and with the arrival of the new aircraft, our onboard and airport service will be much more efficient. This will spare customers a great deal of trouble and bureaucracy. We will also look at technological advances where necessary. We are on the right track. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Grupo Impresa evolved, and what are some of its milestones? </h4><p>There is Grupo Impresa and there is SIC, the company's most relevant part, thanks to the country's thriving TV business. Impresa as a holding was launched 45 years ago in January 1973, but first started as a newspaper, Expresso, that began during the Portuguese dictatorship. At the time, it was a huge risk to use free speech, and there was a lot of censorship. Fortunately, a year later, Portugal became a democracy. In the 1980s, we were able to buy some magazines and became a publishing company in the 1990s. SIC was launched in 1992 and became the pioneer in its industry. Although it wasn't launched as a start-up due to its large and expensive launch, it was a pioneering operation as the first privately held TV station in Portugal. We had to be disruptive in terms of the way we operated, and due to our efforts, the channel quickly became the leader in the market in terms of ratings and shares within four years. Although we lost our leading status after maintaining it for five to six years, we are still leaders in commercial targets: the most affluent families turn to our channel, which is extremely important because they possess the purchasing power that advertisers want to tap into. </p><h4>What strategy do you have to refocus the business on audiovisual and digital segments?</h4><p>We had a large publishing business up until the end of 2017. When I became CEO in March 2016, the strategic plan in place was ending; therefore, I decided to hire a consultant to help us develop a new plan. One thing we had always felt was that the publishing business in particular, in Europe, the US, and Australia, is difficult. We had 14 publishing titles, and decided to sell all of them except our original newspaper, Expresso, and a music magazine. We decided not to sell it because we wanted to capture the younger target market; however, we stopped printing it and converted it to an entirely digital publication. It was hard to sell off our titles because it meant losing 200 people and 12 products; however, we had to do it because the contribution of all these brands combined was insignificant to our EBITDA. Expresso is an oasis here in the publishing business; it has a 36% share of the advertising market in Portugal. It has the largest circulation in Portugal, although print sales are falling. We will not close the paper version, although our growth is focused on the digital version. We are well ahead of the rest of the market, selling 25,000 digital copies of the newspaper every week. We sell 86,000 of Expresso's weekly publications.</p><h4>Impresa closed 1H2018 with EUR2.5 million, 30 times higher than figures in 1H2017. To what would you attribute that success?</h4><p>It has been over 20 months since the 2017-2019 strategic plan was put into place, and so far, it has produced tremendous results. Selling the publications was important, in addition to reducing our fixed costs. Similarly, we had some programming cuts due to shows that were not getting a good return on investment. We had no opportunity to increase the return because many of them were foreign programs, such as Brazilian telenovelas. They were successful in the past in our programming slots, but consumers habits have since evolved. Another reason was our increase in advertising revenue, which related to our performance and ratings. It also had to do with the World Cup in 2018 as we had some of the matches alongside RTP. We developed new entertainment and news shows around the World Cup, and advertisers were eager to work with us. </p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>There are different challenges we face. For starters, we have competition from international players; given that the media landscape is now global, there is no level playing field because the rules that apply to established media players in the past don't apply to Netflix, Google, or Facebook. Nonetheless, local quality content is something that we are investing in, not just in terms of telenovelas, but in news and other fiction. When we start developing fictional products, we are always thinking about how they can be exported abroad—stories with a global appeal. For Dubai, for example, we have to edit and need to make sure that certain content is adapted according to local preferences. We are doing it systematically rather than ad-hoc. Our main goal is to move into our new building, an historical milestone since it means SIC will be in the same building as Expresso, something that has never happened in the company's 45 years of history. Our goal is to create synergies in different areas, improve operations, and boost creativity and motivation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some key achievements and milestones for the company in Portugal?</h4><p>Our first key milestone was that we were the first and only core banking software firm ever founded in Portugal. Another key achievement is that two years after our inception in 1988, we became an international firm. From the beginning, we have been focused on pursuing an active international expansion.<br> </p><h4>What are the main directions and areas of focus for the group's R&amp;D efforts?</h4><p>There are a variety of focuses, including the Internet of Things, digitalization, AI, cybersecurity, and many other areas. Our aim is to continue working actively in these areas and continue our investment in order to capture the opportunities that arise as these technologies become more widely implemented. </p><h4>How would you assess the company's financial performance?</h4><p>In Portugal, we have been doing extremely well for the past several years, and this is also true globally. If we were to dissect our latest turnover levels, we have to remember that even though Asseco PST is based in Portugal, more than 50% of its revenues come from overseas. Besides Portugal, we also have operations in Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Sío Tomé and Prí­ncipe, Namibia, Malta, and East Timor. </p><h4>Which line of banking IT services generate the most revenue?</h4><p>If you look at our entire portfolio, you see that we are an end-to-end provider for banks. Some of these banks have been with us for a long time, and we provide products and services that range from core banking systems to internet banking and mobile apps. Establishing and running the core banking systems is naturally an area of heavy investment, particularly because regulation has a large impact on this area, and there are constant changes occurring. Digital transformation projects have also become a very important part of our offer and a significant source of our company revenue.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in the IT sector in Portugal?</h4><p>We have witnessed several changes in the Portuguese tech sector over the last five years. Big players have all moved into the country, which puts a huge demand on talent. The fact that the Portuguese economy is not producing as many software engineers as the market demands only increases this pressure. We were originally founded in Funchal, Madeira, and we still keep our main software development center there. We have around 150 employees in Funchal and approximately 200 in Lisbon. As far as opportunities are concerned, in Portugal, like in many other western European countries, there are many opportunities related to digital transformation projects. GDPR has also been a great opportunity this year. In the financial sector in particular, there will be opportunities in fields related to open banking and PSD2.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the talent evolving through Asseco Academy?</h4><p>You have to remember why we created the academy in the first place. This was focused more on the Portuguese-speaking markets we operate in rather than Portugal itself. While there is a shortage of qualified talent in Portugal, there is an ever-greater shortage in some of the other markets where we also operate. We decided to create the academy in order to engage with the sector as best we could in order to promote the available talent. This enabled us to help more people qualify so more opportunities could be developed. Overall, we consider this program to be an excellent success. </p>]]></richbody0content>
