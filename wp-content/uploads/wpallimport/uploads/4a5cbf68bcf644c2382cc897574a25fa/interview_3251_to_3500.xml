		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief synopsis of Accenture's operations in Portugal? </h4><p>We provide professional services from strategy and consulting to technology and intelligent operations, leveraging digital in all these areas. We work in the vast majority of the biggest national layers across every industry. We are 3,000 people with a strong focus on the local market, while leveraging the export opportunity of services to our international clients. In fact, Portugal has a unique position in terms of talent and competitiveness to explore global markets.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Portuguese market for Accenture? </h4><p>We are a mature but small market in terms of business size for Accenture globally, though strategically we are extremely important due to our increased global relevance, namely by exporting digital and technology services to our biggest clients worldwide. We also have a significant presence and penetration in the local market. The Portuguese economy is improving, and positive signs are helping our business growth. Therefore, Accenture has a unique opportunity to help organizations be more efficient and effective by addressing the digital paradigm. It is clear now that digital is a reality. Today, it is not possible to transform or create businesses without thinking in digital and technology from the get-go.</p><h4>The company leads the strategy, consulting, digital, technology, and operations services market. How have you done this? </h4><p>Our DNA is based on innovation and value creation. We incorporate digital into everything we do across the value chain to improve organizational performance. Transforming companies into digital and intelligent organizations is our focus. Accenture is a case study in its own digital transformation, having created new offerings, solutions, and services that became 60% of the global company's business. During this process, our market cap increased by more than 10 times.</p><h4>Aside from providing analytical software and consulting services, what other industries are you planning to target in the near future?<br></h4><p>Our strategy in this market is to work within the biggest organizations in Portugal, providing an end-to-end service, from strategy and consulting to technology and operations, always leveraging digital. Today, we are working with 70% of PSI20 companies. Though we have good opportunities to continue growing in banking, retail, and transportation, we have also a strong competitive position in the communications and energy industries. </p><h4>You are partnering with Microsoft for the 'Building the Future' summit in Lisbon. How important is this? </h4><p>Today, Portugal is at the forefront of innovation and the start-up ecosystem. Web Summit will be in Lisbon for the next 10 years, and that's a very good example of how innovation is ballooning across Portuguese organizations. Thus, having a good ecosystem of start-ups and digital native enterprises with a good entrepreneurial skill set can make an important difference to start incubating businesses from Portugal. These are intelligent organizations that think globally for international markets but are based in Portugal and powered by Portuguese talent.</p><h4>Why were you chosen as the top employer in Portugal for the third year in a row? </h4><p>It's a strategic priority to be a company of the best talent. The culture of meritocracy we have attracts many talented people. Additionally, an increasing amount of people want to be a part of something with a sense of social purpose. Working at Accenture means you want to make the change happen and actively contribute to improve the way the world works and lives. We also have been named the top company on the Thomson Reuters Diversity &amp; Inclusion Index, which recognizes the 100 most diverse and inclusive companies in the world. Diversity is a source of innovation, creativity, and competitive advantage and creates a workplace where everyone feels equally accepted with a real sense of belonging. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Holistic View]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-holistic-view]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a short overview of the evolution of HPE?</h4><p>HPE is a new company, founded in 2015, as a result of a spin off, though we have the values and DNA of the “old" HP, with 75 years of innovative culture. The advantage of creating a separate company was that we'd accelerated our time-to-market and optimized our portfolio, from the edge to the cloud (including IT infrastructure, software, and services), which gave us the ability to focus on our value proposition of helping customers in their digital transformation journey. The company was well received by the market, and customer satisfaction is increasing in line with growth. We are in great shape, and I'm confident of a strong performance in the 2019 fiscal year.</p><h4>What makes the local market unique, and which of HPE's solutions generate the most sales in Portugal?</h4><p>Portugal is a mature country in terms of technology, and we have many early adopters. We can lead new initiatives because of our skilled workforce and disposition toward technologies. We have the right scale to be considered a country for pilots, because the costs are not that high if something goes wrong. So many companies are considering Portugal as a great location to create their competence and innovation centers. We started in the private space, though now the public sector is also open to investing. HPE offers IT solutions from the edge, to the cloud and the core, including servers, storage, and networking infrastructure, as well as software and services. We need to address solutions, because customers do not have the time or resources to assemble and maintain all their infrastructure. They want to receive easy-to-use packaged solutions that include hardware, software, and services, and that's what we deliver. We keep our datacenter solutions sales strong and had a great double-digit growth in the edge area (i.e. everything that is not in the datacenter) since the reinforcement of our networking portfolio with the acquisition of the company Aruba.</p><h4>How would you assess HPE's financial performance in Portugal?</h4><p>We are growing across our entire portfolio. We have the largest market share in servers and see growth there. We also see a great deal of growth coming from our Aruba acquisition, which creates double-digit growth in our networking area. In terms of storage, we are growing in the enterprise space. We have a solid presence in the SMB segment and are capturing market share with our new storage solutions. The growth in storage was also double-digit, while services also had strong results. Our strength with all of these offerings is the combination of our portfolio. We are only ones to have the edge-to-cloud strategy. Edge is everything that is not a data center, and with the Aruba acquisition, we have a strong portfolio. 75% of data does not go to the data center; it stays on the edge. We partner with Microsoft, ICP, and SIS to accomplish our AI products. We are dealing with extremely powerful IT solutions services.</p><h4>What about the cloud? Are the Portuguese customers moving to public clouds?</h4><p>Some customers will “stay" in their data centers due to the cost-benefit relationship. It is easy and secure to store data internally. For others, public clouds could be the best approach, such as with start-ups, new lines of business, or special projects. We see a multi-cloud environment in the future, both on private and public clouds that we call hybrid IT. Customers will have a different approach, with internal clouds with some automation and fast provisioning, as well as different public cloud providers. In fact, Portuguese customers are already approaching us to help them get a holistic view of all these clouds, independently of whether they are internal or external to the data center. They are also very interested in new ways of consuming IT, besides the public cloud. HPE is a pioneer in this area with its flexible capacity and GreenLake Solutions: we offer customers the possibility of a cloud like a consumption experience, but with the datacenter on the premises and the associated advantages of more control and security. Basically, we want to help customers to reduce risks and costs without lessening security. It is about increasing efficiency and access. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[axians-portugal-and-its-integration-into-one-of-the-top-50-european-groups]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you please give us an overview of the evolution of Axians Portugal over the past two years, since the acquisition of the Novabase division? </h4><p>We have recently finalized our integration in the group. Being part of VINCI world is more than just assimilating procedures, tools, systems, organization, or metrics; it is absorbing its culture, a culture of decentralized operations network with a great deal of autonomy in local business units, a culture which is extremely different from other large corporations that are much more centralized. VINCI is one of the 50 biggest companies in Europe, which means, we have operations in several areas, such as airports, highways, construction, concessions, and so on. Therefore, working in Axians under the VINCI Energies “umbrella" brings interesting synergies for ICT, as various opportunities can be addressed within the group. Our current step on this onboarding program is joining the VINCI innovation networks'. It's been a smooth and very successful process. That said, in two years, we have won two innovation prizes at VINCI Energies so far. Actually, our integration in VINCI is such an accomplishment that we use to say that we have no longer employees but shareholders. VINCI has a program which transforms a typical employee into a shareholder and this is done by investing along with people. Thus, more than 60% of VINCI employees—almost 200,000 all over the world—are shareholders. 41% of Axians Portugal workers own VINCI's shares already and we believe this figure will grow. We are an extremely strong group and we do have ambition to grow. Our main focus is the people who work with us and their well-being, though. </p><h4>What does your portfolio of services and solutions include?</h4><p>We go from on-premises ICT to the cloud and hybrid. We are also on top of the main hot topics like cybersecurity and privacy, Artificial Intelligence and bots, and have had several achievements in those areas, mainly in Banking and Insurance. We are also very strong in sectors like Public Administration, Education, Telco, Energy and so many others. In the Industry sector, for instance, we are working for fast improvement. In fact, we have started to invest a lot more in this field since last year.</p><h4>VINCI Energies has plans to boost your presence abroad. In terms of internationalization, what are your plans?</h4><p>We prefer to see international business in a different way: not as country A or country B, but in terms of the activities, solutions, and services that we can provide to customers. We always start with them: if we have three or four large customers, then, we can set up a local company to develop out of that. We do not see other countries or the world as a small village; we face each customer as a large country. In certain countries, we've started with some great clients, and after a while we have set up a company locally to develop that further. We supply services from Portugal to different cities remotely, such as Munich, Brussels and Luxembourg, among others. </p><h4>What is the main challenge of doing business in Portugal?</h4><p>The main challenge is to find skilled people. The market here is growing; at the same time, international opportunities are increasing as well. We should think about bringing excellent opportunities to Portugal, which to me is another huge challenge. I would like to introduce a concept—augmented productivity. When we do not have enough people available, we must “empower" the existing pool of talent with software, machines, bots and automation, to the end of having more efficient use of people's time and talents. Qualified people should focus on valuable activities and all those activities that can be automated should be automated then.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2019?</h4><p>To seek talent inside and outside the company. This is truly an endless task. Overall, the future leaders, given the increasing pace of change in this DX economy, should focus on their moral intelligence, on top of their emotional and cognitive skills. Fostering solid values through education is the way to build relevant and long-lasting human relationships, for all that matters. For all other (minor) things, the market will dictate the path we shall take. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-world-connected]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Huawei's main operations and business lines in Portugal?</h4><p>Portugal was one of the first countries for Huawei when it entered Europe. In 2005, we built Huawei's first 3G mobile network in Europe, in Madeira. Afterward, we continued to support the telecom operators to build 4G &amp; 4.5G and Fiber-To-The-Home networks, as well as submarine cables providing best-in-class telecommunications service to Portuguese consumers and enterprises. In the future, we will work on a connected intelligent world with three features: All Things Sensing (sensing the physical world, mapping it to digital signals); All Things Connected (all data will go online); All Things Intelligent (big data and AI will power our new applications, making all things intelligent). These advances will not be possible without leading ICT technologies, as ICT infrastructure will be the foundation of our future intelligent world. This is where Huawei seeks to add value.</p><h4>Huawei will launch the MateBook series in Portugal. What are your expectations from the launch?</h4><p>Traditionally, the laptop business is a ready sales business because there is already enough competition; however, when we entered this segment, we brought in many new ideas and innovations because Huawei is an expert in connectivity and the cloud. We have given the laptop business a new concept. The MateBook X is a powerful laptop that also has an elegant appearance and excellent features. It is extremely slim and has a long battery life, making it extremely convenient for business people.</p><h4>Can you provide further details on Huawei's project with Altice to deploy 5G networks in Portugal?</h4><p>5G is a hot topic. Over the past few decades, we mainly sought to improve connectivity between people to people in the 2G, 3G, and 4G eras. With 5G, we are now extending that connectivity to machine to machine. This will bring significant changes in the way we live and work. 5G will bring ultra-high speed of up to 20Gbps, and its ultra-low latency will enable concepts such as autonomous driving. It will also allow us to connect millions of devices; however, it is important for the entire ecosystem to work together in creating a 5G environment. This includes telecom operators, solution providers like Huawei, and governmental entities like the Portuguese regulatory authority, ANACOM, as well as all different vertical and industries partners. Many enterprises will be able to combine their industry knowledge and data with ICT to reshape the way they produce and deliver their services. We are already working with our partners in Portugal and have launched the world's first narrow-band IoT smart meter in the utilities segment. We are also working on smart water meters, smart parking, smart agriculture, smart waste management, and more. All these first require an extremely fast 5G-infrastructure network, as well as excellent collaboration in the whole ecosystem.</p><h4>Are you partnering with Portuguese companies to develop your smart solutions?</h4><p>Yes; for example, the world's first narrow-band IoT smart meter is a design collaboration between Huawei and Janz, a Portuguese meter company that has many years of experience in the power meter field. Using Huawei's IoT smart chip, meters can be connected to service providers like EDP. They can constantly transmit power usage data and detect any power failures; therefore, the service provider can manage the energy supply in the most efficient way. All this came from the innovation we did with our local partners. We have connectivity and cloud experts and, moving forward, need to work with partners that have expertise in other industries, such as utilities, manufacturing, transportation, tourism, and others. It requires a great deal of collaboration in the whole ecosystem to make these ideas work. For example, at the moment cities around the world are becoming smart and embracing a digital society to drive economic competitiveness and sustainability for the future. The digital platform will be the engine powering the smart city development by enabling the integration of big data, cloud, edge computing, AI, and IoT technologies, which are the foundation of a smart city. The development of a smart city, namely the integration of all these digital technologies that improves city governance and intelligence, could be a highly complex project. However, Huawei's digital platform is highly efficient and open to facilitate collaboration with its Portuguese partner's ecosystem, as it will be they who customize the 'smart brain' based on each city's different development requirements. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights since you were appointed as the company's CEO? </h4><p>Altice was known as PT before it was acquired in 2015. One of the most important things for us with the new team was to change the way we were communicating or being perceived in the market. We increased our levels of communication and recognition in the market since we are leaders in almost every segment of the industry. That was one of the key challenges we tackled, nine months after which our recognition and communication levels showed tremendous improvements. On a more business-related level, we faced continuing and new challenges. Since 2015, the company has invested heavily in infrastructure for fiber-optic deployment and mobile network enhancement, and continues to invest in infrastructure development.</p><h4>The mobile sector is being led by MEO with 7.9 million out of 10.3 million mobile customers. What is your strategy?</h4><p>Altice's key strategy is to maintain a high ratio of investment in infrastructure because overall growth cannot be achieved unless we invest heavily in infrastructure development. Altice Portugal is the number-one investor with EUR1.2 billion invested over the last three fiscal years. It is due to our investments that our mobile network can cover 98.5% of the Portuguese population with 4G, a high number for European standards. Equally important, the same infrastructure enables 70% coverage for next generation 4G+ services; however, we want to be recognized not just for our investments in infrastructure but also for our high quality of service. To that end, we are enhancing customer experience and driving initiatives that allow people to have self-service and digital approaches to customer service interactions. In addition to that, our initiatives are focused on providing the best content, applications, and solutions for the B2B market; we aim to create a system that can be scaled for large enterprises and SMEs. Portugal's business segment is largely comprised of small companies, so we cannot simply replicate a service offered to a major Portuguese bank for a small accounting shop.</p><h4>Altice is working with Huawei to make Portugal the European 5G leader. What can your customers expect from Altice in this regard?</h4><p>We have divided the country into north and south and are working with Huawei in the south and Ericsson in the north. With both of them, we have established two individual programs, collectively named the Road to 5G. The project has a head start, as the current infrastructure covers 70% of the Portuguese population with 4G+, paving the path for an easy transition to 5G. We are now experimenting with technologies and CPEs with Huawei. Notably, we conducted the first live demo with live 5G equipment in 1H2018, and it was a huge success. The company is looking forward to the implementation of 5G on a national level. However, we are not as eager to implement 5G as regulators, governments, or technology manufacturers because we invested around EUR100 million in modernizing our mobile network in 2016 and first need to capitalize on that. We see 5G as a natural evolution that will come along in time and do not expect to have live commercial services before 2022. 5G is not about having more capacity—4G is sufficient for present demands—but about addressing a different set of challenges, such as density and the number of devices that can be connected within 1sqkm. I do not expect 5G to be massive for retail customers; it will be a good evolution for new sets of businesses that would incorporate the Internet of Things and Machine to Machine communication. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent can ICT boost the competitiveness and modernization of the Portuguese economy?</h4><p>The IT and ICT sectors are revolutionizing and disrupting every industry. The question is not if ICT will disrupt business, but when and how much it will change some particulars of the market. For example, in the last seven to eight years the media and entertainment sector in Portugal lost 40% of its advertising revenues. Digitization is basically a revolution; if we talk solely about technology-related transformations, we have had the agricultural, industrial, and now digital revolution. The difference is that the digital revolution transforms business and society in a much shorter timeframe than previous revolutions, which took hundreds of years. The first part of the digital revolution was the appearance of computers that could take over support functions for businesses. However, the real revolution started in the last 20 years when businesses were completely transformed due to the exponential growth of several variables brought about since 1958. If we applied this same rate of exponential technology growth to, for example, the automotive industry, a car that could travel at a maximum of 60mph in 1958 would reach Mars in a matter of seconds today. Things that were impossible 20 or 30 years ago are now easy as a result of the computing power to do them.</p><h4>What impact did opening up APDC's membership to other sectors of the economy beyond media and technology companies have on its membership base and activities?</h4><p>APDC could not close itself off from other sectors because IT and communications technology is transforming these areas as well. It is extremely important for other players and sectors to talk with us. In addition, most of our members' clients are in other sectors, not just in ICT and media. The response we have had is extremely interesting. At our last congress in 2017, half the delegates and companies were from our sector while the other half were from others. This is a huge transformation for us. Now, we plan to give associate status to companies in other sectors that want to network with our members.</p><h4>What is the importance and objectives of APDC's annual Digital Business Congress?</h4><p>This is an annual event with around 2,000 participants, typically high-level decision makers from a range of sectors. It is a crucial event where we discuss and review trends and the scope of the transformation taking place because of IT. We also have an exposition part to the conference where companies have a presence, including IT and ICT start-ups. We have an entrepreneurship chapter within APDC as a channel for communicating with these start-ups. In turn, start-ups use such events to look for investors and to keep up with developments in their field. They also look to APDC as a connection to corporations through specialized events.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about APDC's initiatives to help people compete in this new digital environment?</h4><p>Skills are critical for this new environment, especially digital skills, which is why we are cooperating with the Portuguese government on its National Digital Competences Initiative (INCoDe.2030). This is a government program to empower Portugal with more IT knowledge and capacity across the entire population. The challenge for Portugal is not so much on the offer of IT services, since we already have a great network and many IT services; the problem is that usage is still low. Only around 60% of Portuguese people use the internet daily, and 26% do not use the internet at all. This 26% either lack the necessary IT skills or money to buy basic IT equipment. In the case of skills, we have to rectify this limitation to ensure we not only have enough trained personnel in the country for IT-related jobs, but also for the population at large. I am currently the Chairman of the Forum for INCoDe.2030. Our mission is to create instruments for evaluation and give visibility to this initiative on an annual basis. We held the first conference in 2017 when it was launched to publicize the program and explain its aims. Each year the forum analyzes what INCoDe.2030 has achieved that year. The program also has an Executive Coordinator appointed by the Minister of Science. Regarding APDC's Digital Academy, our associates needed a mechanism to train their own people, and in 2017 we prepared the courses and are now starting to sell them. These include short crash courses for executives who want to understand concepts like artificial intelligence. The other courses are for training company personnel. These programs are more structured and last around 600 hours. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights and achievements of your mandate to date?</h4><p>There has been an effective process of European convergence since 2016. Our notable accomplishments include growing the budget allocation for public higher education institutions by 10% between 2016 and 2019 from EUR1.002 billion to EUR1.105 billion, with the total number of students growing by 5% between 2015 and 2018, from 356,000 to 373,000 in the public and private sectors. The number of students enrolled for the first time in public and private higher education institutions grew from around 87,000 in 2014/15 to more than 103,000 in 2018/19, including more than 9,000 students in short vocational cycles. In parallel with the implementation of the Study and Research in Portugal program, the number of foreign students increased by 48% from 2014-2015, representing about 50,000 students and 13% of those enrolled. Funding for the Science and Technology Foundation (FCT) increased by 24%, from EUR490 million in 2016 to EUR621 million in 2019. The number of new PhD grants supported annually has grown from 971 in 2015 to over 1,600 in 2018/2019, in parallel with the implementation of the Scientific Employment Stimulus Program, which includes the execution of at least 5,000 more doctoral researchers' contracts until the end of the legislature. As well, the number of social scholarships in higher education has grown from around 64,000 in 2014/15 to more than 80,000 in 2018/19.</p><h4>How do you see Portugal's regional and global leadership in the IT start-up culture?</h4><p>National short, medium, and long-term strategies for the development of digital skills were set out through the National Digital Skills Initiative, so that by 2030, approximately nine out of 10 citizens are frequent users of the internet. We also increased the number of IT experts in companies by 50%. These strategies include, among other aspects, providing support to creative communities in the area of inclusion and close interaction with the local and regional administrations; supporting teachers in the progressive and systematic modernization of the education system working closely with the Minister of Education and related central and regional administrations; establishing regional networks of qualification and digital specialization, namely through partnerships between polytechnics, local administration, and companies in West-Leiria, Cavado and Ave, Nordeste Transmontano-Bragança, Castelo Branco, and Setúbal-Palmela; the establishment of a national AI strategy, with the specific involvement of the public administration, R&amp;D centers, and companies; and the development of advanced forms of computing, including the creation of the Minho Advanced Computing Center (MACC).</p><h4>What is the balance between the private and public higher education sectors?</h4><p>The number of doctoral researchers in companies conducting R&amp;D activities benefiting from fiscal support has increased by 30% since 2015 and by more than 10% between 2016 and 2017, showing a clear fiscal policy in support of R&amp;D and innovation. The number of R&amp;D companies benefiting from financial assistance to hire doctoral researchers has increased by 37% since 2015, including some 290 companies in 2017. The hiring of researchers by companies grew by 11% between 2016 and 2017, while the number of researchers in the active population grew to 8.5% in 2017 compared to 8% in 2016 and 7.4% in 2015. The number of full-time researchers in higher education has grown by 9.5% since 2015. In addition, the territorial densification and institutional diversification associated with a polytechnic's valorization and modernization strategy, as well as an innovation strategy and to support the growth of more and better jobs, included the creation of 21 new collaborative laboratories in 2018 under the scope of the Interface Program, after an international evaluation and collaboration between companies, R&amp;D units, and higher education institutions. This includes a five-year public investment of around EUR50 million aimed at stimulating economic and social development in all areas of knowledge, from agricultural production to digital transformation of industry, and including critical sectors such as cement, production food, space, or forests, considering critical technologies such as AI. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[fourfold-and-forward]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you provide an overview of Altran's operations in Portugal?</h4><p>Altran entered Portugal through an acquisition of four companies, based on its aggressive, growth-based strategy to invest. Intrigued by Portugal's environment, we began a strategy of convergence and merged all the companies in 2005. It stayed like that until 2009, when Altran in Portugal established a consolidated brand, and I assumed the role of CEO. In terms of our evolution in the market, we have grown fourfold in the last couple of years. We did this time by investing and diversifying in several sectors. For example, we invested heavily in the telecoms engineering field. At present, Altran is recognized as a leading company that has partnered with different vendors and telecoms operators. Our success allowed us to create a good footprint in the financial sector and public administration, with specific solutions customized to our clients' requests. When we talk about the local market, telecoms, media, financial services, and public administration are the chief sectors in which we are present. Our second major boost came from our pioneering of the group, starting with a near-shore initiative that began in 2013. We innovated because we started proactively working with some of our colleagues in other countries and delocalizing some projects. Our colleagues sell the projects in each country, and depending on the client requirements and maturity to localize, we distribute the work between the engineering processes and on-site and off-site activities. We were one of the first entities in the group to push this traction. As a result, we have nearly 700 engineering consultants dedicated to our international projects, and in Portugal the company has more than 1,850 consulting engineers. The company has almost 2,000 employees after taking into account the management and support functions; we have 700 employees in our global engineering center and 1,150 people in the local market. </p><h4>Altran Portugal has university ties with Universidade NOVA de Lisboa's “Big Data Academy." What is this, and have you any other similar projects in the pipeline? </h4><p>We have a relationship with polytechnic universities and academia in general. When we entered the world of complex solutions and pioneered that domain, we saw it was critical to push the integration between the industry and academic ecosystem. More than recruiting recent graduates, we need to improve the process and cooperate with universities and polytechnics to customize the content to ease the integration of students into the professional world. With that in mind, we set up our internal academy, co-designed academies with universities and polytechnics, and worked with Universidade NOVA de Lisboa in the domain of complex analytics. We are also working with two polytechnics, Instituto Politécnico de Castelo Branco and Politécnico da Guarda, on designing content around software testing. The target is to customize tailor-made content together with industry players to allow students to enter the professional ecosystem at an early stage. Recently, we co-designed a telecom engineering course with Politécnico de Castelo Branco that consists of 1.5 years of theory and six months in the company. The world is innovating fast, and in order to help the unemployed population keep up with the changing world, we are co-developing a nine-month IEFE training program with the Institute of Employment and Professional Training. In the future, more companies will require skills rather than a degree. Of course, there needs to be a mix of certified skills while retaining the title of specialized professional. That is why we have been pushing for different formats, the first being training academies, since they complement sub-skills from different ecosystems. Despite all our initiatives over the years, we want to do more and build on levels of certified professionals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does AED Portugal provide a platform that facilitates networking between the strategic industries of aeronautics, aerospace, and defense?</h4><p><span></span>Partnership (EACP). We also signed MoUs with other European clusters in Hamburg, Bavaria, Seville, Galicia, and Toulouse, among other relevant players. It is essential for us to attend main events around Europe.</p><p><span></span><strong>JOíƒO ROMANA</strong> We set out together with local clusters to support our networking efforts. At the recent ILA Berlin event, we planned B2B meetings beforehand, including a networking agenda among the Portuguese and German clusters. Such efforts apply to aeronautics, space, and defense. Joining the European Space Agency in 2000 gave Portugal a gateway to the industry. Back in 2000, there were less than 10 active companies in space, but in the last 10 years things have totally changed, and national investments in science in the last 20 years are now paying off. In defense, Portugal also has a long tradition of building capability in cooperation with NATO. In the scope of the European Research and Innovation Programs (FP6, FP7, H2020), Portugal has a record of significant achievements in aeronautics (Clean Sky), space, and ICT. As a consequence, we now have companies that are world leaders in satellite ground control systems, providing most of the control systems for the global geostationary satellite market. It has been a remarkable progress. In aeronautics, similar progress took place, only faster and with a stronger economic impact. In fact, in 10 years Portugal has grown from a young MRO player to a mature medium-size supplier of most of the existent OEMs in the world market. The key push factor for the aeronautics boom was the decision of Embraer to install two facilities in the south of Portugal back in 2006. Everything has changed in the last 10 years, with many international aeronautic companies moving to Évora from Brazil, France, Spain, UK, and elsewhere. This exponential growth has left behind many gaps, which we are currently mapping. Training, the certification of SMEs, better supply chain structure, and a need for clustering industry for sizeable contracts, are several that have been identified.  </p><h4>What value addition is needed to accelerate the process going forward?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JR</strong> Presently the number of highly educated PhD students working in industry is residual (less than 5%), which tells us there is still a long way to go in terms of innovation and knowledge transfer in the industry. We are also in the early stages of the process of bringing players together for increasing critical mass and addressing larger contracts. Technologically, the potential is high, with research centers and industry developing beyond the state of the art. Such centers are interesting enough to attract a wave of young professionals to the field. </p><p><span></span><strong>JC</strong> The facts speak clearly: there are over 26,000 PhD students in our university, only 700 of which work in industry; we still have a long way to go.</p><h4>What have been the most successful initiatives to raise the overall visibility of Portugal's aerospace sector and promote its internationalization?</h4><p><strong>JR </strong>We have recently raised funds for 2020 from national and European programs to develop a strategy for 2022, build the respective action plan, and fund internationalization activities around the world. These add to the cluster's membership fees. As a result of this combined funding we can now address Europe as well as Canada and the US. It goes without saying, these activities keep us extremely busy and keep our momentum going. </p><p><span></span><strong>JC</strong> We also have also set up strategic objectives for the next seven years. The first is to double the present share of the Portuguese GDP to 3%. Another is to promote Portugal as an innovative destination and become a main player in these areas. This means we must participate in large events around the world and broadcast the competitiveness of Portugal among companies that seek to invest.</p><h4>What spillover effects in other high-tech sectors does the AED cluster have? How does this contribute to the overall competitiveness of Portugal's economy?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JR</strong> That is definitely happening. We see more mature industries, such as the automotive cluster, which is increasingly interested in joining the aeronautic and aerospace sectors. We also receive many IT, metallurgic, and automotive companies looking for opportunities in aerospace. The Portuguese metallurgical industry has a contribution of about 30% to our GDP, meaning there is huge potential out there, especially for hard metals, machining, and tooling. The qualifications and certification are a huge barrier to new comers, given that other sectors are less stringent than aeronautics. This is something that needs to be further paved in the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Globally, the company is present in eight markets, with more than 25 brands. Can you elaborate on your parent company's structure, operations, and achievements?</h4><p>Our company is part of the Bergé Group, which is based in Spain and present in eight markets. In Europe, we have a presence in Portugal, Spain (including the Canary Islands), and Finland. In South America, we have a presence in Chile, Peru, Argentina, and Colombia. We are a distribution company, representing 26 brands in our current portfolio. We also have some retail operations, but most of our dealers are independently working as our partners. At present, we manage more than 500 dealers in eight markets. Our aim is to distribute 150,000 units in these markets by end-2018. In Portugal, we have four companies: the distribution of Mitsubishi and Fuso is managed by one company, the distribution of Kia and Isuzu in two others, in addition to a company that provides services for all companies. Our yearly target for the Portuguese market is 12,000-13,000 cars.</p><h4>How important is the Portuguese market for the overall group's operations?</h4><p>It is highly important for several reasons. It was the first operation outside of Spain and has grown significantly; about 30-40% of our European activity is now in Portugal. It is also vital because Kia and Mitsubishi are very relevant brands for Bergé in Portugal. </p><h4>The Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV recently had a successful launch. How would you assess the shift of conventional vehicles to electric ones?</h4><p>We represent Mitsubishi in five markets: Chile, Peru, Spain, Portugal, and Finland. Mitsubishi was the first company to introduce the PHEV technology into the market and made a huge effort doing so. Recently, a number of brands have been entering the European market with new technology. Initially, companies that wanted a green footprint were interested and became early adopters, but there was also a lot of lack of knowledge about the products and their usage and reliability. Now that customers are starting to understand the benefits of these technologies, it is becoming easier. Our volume has also significantly grown, and should continue to do so. These represented 7% of sales in 2018, a number we hope to double in 2019. European regulations being implemented in our market are also accelerating the adoption of PHEV technologies. </p><h4>Is Mitsubishi developing better solutions for electric cars?</h4><p>Mitsubishi is a strong partner in the Renault-Nissan Alliance, the group with the biggest sales of electric vehicles in the world. A lot of solutions are being developed within this, and Mitsubishi will participate in these and enjoy the efforts of the Alliance. With Mitsubishi and Fuso, we have quite a strong business in commercial vehicles based on the pickup and Fuso trucks, which represent almost 40% of our volume. Electric vehicles will progressively increase their share, though Mitsubishi will also remain focused on SUVs and pickups.  </p><h4>In 2017, the truck division of Mitsubishi and Fuso had a positive impact on the Portuguese economy. What future developments are in the pipeline for this plant?</h4><p>Fuso has a plant in Portugal and is part of the Daimler Group. It produces the product that we sell in Europe and also exports special projects to the US as well as several countries in Africa. In Portugal, Fuso is highly relevant because it has had an industrial presence for a long time. Portugal is home to Fuso's biggest market share in Europe, and we are proud to represent the brand and succeed with it. We have been selling cars for over 35 years and have sold more than 80,000 trucks in the market. Looking to the future, Fuso has been leading the development to make urban trucks 100% electric, and we have been participating in this project. At present, we are testing 10 vehicles as a part of Fuso's global project, which is testing cars in New York, London, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Tokyo. The electrification of urban trucks has huge potential to have an impact on cities. </p><h4>Was the Lisbon city hall looking for an electric tender, or did you seek them out? </h4><p>We wanted to test the vehicles, and the government was keen to participate in the project. The technology is still not being sold commercially but it is keen to participate and have these cars as soon as possible. It came onboard as soon as we explained what we wanted to do. The fact that this leading technology for trucks in Fuso is being produced in Portugal is also relevant for all parties involved in the project.</p><h4>What are your priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>Our market has now come back to pre-crisis levels, and we are mature in Portuguese terms. We are optimistic for 2019, but are aware that it will not be significantly different than 2018. Within our portfolio, we see several opportunities to consolidate and grow our business, and that is what we will be focusing on in the coming year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the key achievements of Renault in Portugal?</h4><p>Having given birth to the automotive sector in Portugal, Renault has a strong history here. When the government decided to create an automotive industry in Portugal in 1977, Renault was chosen and built the first modern car manufacturing plant in the country, in Setubal, south of Lisbon. With this, we also created the entire ecosystem of the car industry in Portugal. At the time, Portugal was not a part of the EU, meaning we had a competitive advantage with tariffs. We rapidly grew a strong market share and built a strong dealership network. Since then, we have always had a larger presence than our competitors. When the market opened in the late 1980s, we lost our leadership (between 1992 and 1997) for a few years, but we were able to regain it in 1998 and never relinquished it again: Renault has been the market leader for 20 years in a row, and soon to be 21. Though we subsequently closed the Setubal plant, we still have an important plant in Cacia in the north, where we build gearboxes for the whole Renault-Nissan Alliance, some 700,000 a year with the help of 1,500 employees. This makes it the second most important automotive plant in Portugal. Renault has a full presence in Portugal with our plant, a national sales company, a financial services company, called RCI, and a retail company, Renault Retail Group, with facilities in Lisbon and Porto. We are leading in the market of personal and light commercial cars. Clio is the most sold car in Portugal and has maintained that status for six years since its launch in 2012. We currently have 22 dealers and almost 50 points throughout the country. </p><h4>How do you assess the shift from conventional to electric vehicles?</h4><p>It is a structural trend all over the world, but it is true that the Portuguese government has decided to push the electric ecosystem. The results are already impressive: Portugal is already the fourth electric market in Europe, accounting for 1.4% of total sales. We are ahead of most European countries, thanks to a tax incentive system for electric cars, especially for fleets. Renault ended 2017 as a strong leader in the electric market, with almost 50% of market share, ahead of even Nissan. </p><h4>The Renault-Nissan Alliance dates to 1999. How is this relevant to Alliance 2022?</h4><p>The Alliance was born almost 20 years ago, and still has room for more synergies. That starts with platforms and industrial parts. There are so many engines, gearboxes, and car platforms that we share with Nissan, Infiniti and, in the future, Mitsubishi, which recently joined the Alliance. What is key now is the capacity to invest in technology: We are in a changing world, mirrored in the automotive sector. Maybe the next 10 years will have more changes than the last 50. We are about to have a deep change with electric cars, autonomous drivers, and connected services. These new technologies require a lot of investments. We are pretty sure only the big players will be able to invest to continue to have the best offer. As such, the Alliance, now the largest carmaker in the world, is in a perfect position to do so. </p><h4>What are your priorities for the coming year? </h4><p>2019 will be a significant year for Renault Portugal because we are renewing important models. The most important will be Clio; later in the year will come Captur. We will launch the new generations in 2019. We are also talking about new technologies coming to the surface more quickly. There will also be a renewal of other brand pillars with new technologies, especially electric cars. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-symbiotic-affair]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main factors behind the growth of the automotive industry, and how has the sector evolved in terms of employment and value addition?</h4><p>The cluster represents 6% of GDP and is an important part of the GNP, with over EUR11 billion. It employs over 75,000 workers and contributes approximately 16% of value addition in Portugal. A small number of companies have an important share, representing around 20% of the exports of Portuguese goods. The cluster is made up of 1,000 companies, including many large ones. There are five automakers, a pool of companies that are manufacturers, some 400 companies related to molds, and another 400 companies making components for the automobile industry. Of this entire pool of companies, 98% of production is exported. The automobile industry in Portugal is growing because the component makers to the sector have grow 7% per year for the last five years, which is more than in Europe, whose industry grew much less. The destination of Portuguese exports is mainly European, especially Spain and Germany, because Germany is the largest automobile producer in Europe, followed by Spain. There is also South America, which is a growing market, Mexico, and Brazil, where Grupo Simoldes has made an important investment. </p><h4>What trans-sectoral synergies does the cluster benefit from?</h4><p>The automotive sector stimulates R&amp;D and helps the scientific ecosystem by promoting a series of innovative projects. The auto industry is a partner of the scientific system, not only universities but also polytechnics, similar to Europe. We need to ensure an easier flow from universities to the auto industry in terms of R&amp;D. The automotive market is rapidly evolving, and we need cars that respond to those needs. But the industry's timing does not necessarily match the timing of universities, so it is a learning process we are still developing.</p><h4>What success stories exemplify the sector's potential?</h4><p>Our success is connected to our capacity to do well; it is not just about pricing and costs because these international companies are looking for more than that. There must also be competitive advantages. When it comes to human resources, this is related to the quality of our development and ability to industrially transform any project. All these well-qualified people and companies can respond to the challenges from the world's largest automotive players. They benefit us and make Portugal a target of interest in terms of global automotive industry investment. Some of our costs are lower than Europe's, though this does not make a difference. Portugal might sometimes have a lower level of productivity in comparison to certain countries; but the productivity of our auto industry is almost double that of the rest of Portuguese industry. This means we have companies that are extremely competitive, as a result of which we are able to grow 7% per annum. The capacities that do not vanish with time are technology, expertise, and a commitment to quality production.</p><h4>What is Microplasticos' role in producing high-precision plastics for advanced industrial applications?</h4><p>Microplasticos is able to meet the more complicated challenges from clients and invests a large amount of knowledge into projects. It can manage from the very conception of an idea, all the way to actually transforming it into a viable project. For a long time, Microplasticos has invested in R&amp;D; hence, we are capable of responding to clients' needs and try to be the best at that, which is our core business. We produce a wide variety of components and try to be better than our competitors. Our competition is in Europe, so we must focus on our competitive advantages and stay one step ahead with technology. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the Portuguese textile sector currently represent for the economy?</h4><p>The textile sector is of crucial importance; it represents 10% of total industrial exports from Portugal and more than 15% of employment in the manufacturing industry. The most important thing, however, is that the sector is counter-cyclical to other first-world countries. From 2008-2009, GDP shrank by about 20%. However, since 2009 we have increased exports by 50% and employee efficiency by 50%. These figures are extremely important because we are not operating in a protected market. We grew significantly outside of the EU in the first 10 years after the crisis. We went to Russia, South America, Asia, and the GCC, for example, as a result of the reaction to the fall in consumption in Europe in 2009. We have a gap of about EUR200 million between production and turnover. Basically, we produce all the products we sell, and it is necessary to have the most efficient processes and generate more value per article per square meter. This is the current situation of the sector in Portugal.</p><h4>How has the sector worked to set itself apart from its competitors around the world?</h4><p>First of all, Portugal has a flourishing textile and fashion culture and a strong and consolidated industrial experience, demonstrated by the way we preserved the industry in the last two decades. Second, we have a strong scientific and technological system within the industry. Well-known textile institutions and companies from around Europe now send people to study here. Finally, we have completely changed the way we do business with textiles related to management systems and practices. Many Portuguese companies offer a lead time of two weeks currently, which is amazing for any sector. We also developed product development and innovation as a current component. In 2005, Portugal basically used to sell “minutes" of industrial transformation, including machine time, energy, and labor, while today almost all the companies develop and design the products they sell. Now, we offer fashion solutions, and customers understand that we can play a part in developing their collections. This is a completely new approach. We have also focused a great deal on technical development and created new applications for the automotive, defense, and health sectors, among others. This was important in distancing ourselves from emerging economies, where labor costs are often extremely low. </p><h4>Which areas of the sector have potential in the coming years?</h4><p>There are certain other subsectors that are extremely important for us. Automotive, sport, and protective equipment applications are on top, a clear nexus between technology and design. Sports clothing or protective equipment is also fashionable, and materials must improve performance. The link between technical materials and fashion is vital. We are extremely involved in the development of fabrics as advanced devices and sensors.</p><h4>Which subsectors of the textile industry are likely to attract the most investment and development in the future?</h4><p>Most textile companies in the country are owned and operated by Portuguese. We have many people capable of driving new companies and partnerships. If we have the right financing for companies, then we are well positioned. Our past experience with international companies was not successful, because they came mainly to exploit differences in labor costs and would leave at the first sign of difficulty. Had the textile sector belonged to foreign banks or investment partnerships during the 2008-2009 crisis, the industry would have definitely closed down. Fortunately, the industry is in the hands of Portuguese families, and they have a different mindset about the companies. Portuguese industrialists are more willing to invest in the sector when times get tough. Family ownership was the secret to Portugal's success during the difficult years. Recently, several foreign companies came to Portugal to invest in the sector, now motivated by the excellence our country offers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the company's evolution in the last 12 years and its milestones in Portugal?</h4><p>This business started 12 years ago in Europe. MEDICARE saw the potential to launch a health service, and we offered a product based on the no-purchase commitment. Our customers tried our products, and if they liked it, they bought it. We catapulted the company to great success and will close 2018 with a billing of USD50 million. We have a commercial DNA; our focus is on selling, the quality of our service, and the loyalty of our customers. It is more expensive to sell products than to retain customers. We have a portfolio of 220,000 clients. We are consistent in the market. MEDICARE has many services: health for people, animals, health food products, and car insurance. We are a versatile company with different products that meet all the needs of people today.</p><h4>MEDICARE recently launched insurance products for the automotive segment. What was behind this decision, and how have the results been so far?</h4><p>MEDICARE did an 18-month study to identify a business area with strong growth possibilities and identified the automotive sector as poorly serviced and in need of a different product. We thus decided to launch an innovative product in Portugal. It is not an insurance service, but a discount product. MEDICARE does not cover the risks of insurance; however, we look for people who offer services like clinics and hospitals. MEDICARE has over 200,000 clients, and we offer them our clients in exchange for great discounts. We guide our clients to those services. We have agreements with the best providers of health or car services. The clients pay a monthly service fee, though we do not have any internal financial connection with the provider. We merely channel our clients to the best discounts.</p><h4>The company started its internationalization process in 2014 with Spain, Angola, and Brazil. How is each market evolving?</h4><p>Spain is a difficult market. We faced some initial setbacks because healthcare is excellent there. The fact that our company was Portuguese did not benefit our entry into the market, and the results were not the same as in Portugal. We had a smaller investment, though we sought to make sure we did not lose any opportunities to serve in Spain. In Portugal, there are more than 50 products like MEDICARE, although they are smaller, and there are also similar products in Spain. We want to consolidate our current businesses overseas. Our focus is on maintaining what we have already built. Spain and Portugal are extremely important for us, and Angola will also be important.</p><h4>What is your strategy to attract and retain the best human talent?</h4><p>MEDICARE is attentive to human talent and seeks to make everyone in the company feel that they are differentiating elements. I want them to feel satisfied with the firm. We typically work with human resources companies, and they bring us the employees. We have an inbound and outbound contact center. We have a great deal of internal work in these areas. If we have a specific career path, we contact the universities, and they send us students. We have many internship programs. We want employees to see the company as a place where their careers can grow; therefore, we have programs that allow interns to experience different departments, allowing them to understand the different areas, the synergies between departments, and their possible career paths. This is a strategy to retain our talent.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>We are focused on the final customer; we are on the internet and are on television daily selling our products. We are very close to our customers through our ambassadors and other forms of communication. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on MDS's evolution and milestones over the course of its history in Portugal?</h4><p>MDS is currently a multinational company specializing in insurance brokerage and risk consultancy. This would not have happened without investment to build team expertise and skills, developing a solid, respected brand, shareholder backing, establishing solid partnerships, and pursuing a long-term vision. Innovation has been the staple behind our performance for over 30 years and will be our guide for the future. It has been a long journey that started with 17 employees in 2000. MDS Group now employs 700 people all over the world. We are the market leader in Portugal, one of the largest players in Brazil, and have a direct presence in Angola, Mozambique, Spain, Malta, and Switzerland. We founded a global brokerage company, Brokerslink, in 2004 and have a major stake in the business. With over 18,000 insurance professionals, Brokerslink has established itself as one of the major brokerage companies in the world. In 2017, we achieved our status as a Lloyds' broker, giving us direct access to the London market. This brings advantages to the Portuguese market, as there is now a partner that can place risks with leading emerging risk experts. In line with our group strategy, in 2018, we launched the Risk Consulting Group (RCG). Formerly known as Herco, RCG is set to become an international player within the risk management consultancy sector. RCG provides services from enterprise risk management, risk analysis and loss control to fleet and health risk management, cybersecurity, and more. MDS Re, our reinsurance unit, has become an especially important area to develop, having a strong focus on Europe and Africa. The group is also home to HighDome PCC, a Protected Cell Company and captive insurer/reinsurer based in Malta.</p><h4>How is it possible to further innovate in the insurance sector, and what is MDS doing in this regard?</h4><p>MDS has a great track record in innovation in the Portuguese market, and we are excited about ongoing developments today and our fundamental role in them. For example, we pioneered the introduction of new business lines, namely: affinities, risk consulting, captives, environmental insurance, and cyber risk, plus new business models, such as wholesale and retail distribution. Digital transformation is one of our strategic priorities, and we have been investing in equipment, software, and teams. This has allowed us to redefine our customer relationship parameters. This can be seen with Proximity—an online platform with a user-friendly interface that lets companies manage their insurance portfolio anytime, anywhere, in a secure manner. Another is our innovative online FlexBen solution, which streamlines the administration of flexible benefits and gives employees full autonomy to manage their individual insurance benefit plans and other support services.</p><h4>What is your vision, and your main strategies for 2019?</h4><p>MDS has been performing extremely well. However, we aim to grow even more. We want to be a key player in the market, leading by example in terms of size, quality of our team, resources, international reach and technological assets. We are a living, ever-changing company, always on the lookout for opportunities. This could be through mergers and acquisitions, specifically with technology companies that can bring value to the group as a whole. This was the case with 838 Soluçíµes in Brazil, where we acquired a majority stake. 838 is pioneering tools to automate benefits and flexible benefits management. This followed the acquisition of a stake in FlexBen, which operates in the same sector. Brazil still presents excellent development opportunities, and we will pay attention to this area. Risk consulting is another strategic focus for the group, which is why we have consolidated operations at RCG. We are quick to identify new risks and challenges and are ahead of the game when it comes to developing products and solutions for them, for example cyber risk, environmental and climate change, longevity, health management, and others. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Building on the QAIA]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[kjeld-binger-ceo-airport-international-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you sum up the major milestones over the past year for AIG?</h4><p>The company was founded in 2007 with the sole purpose of bidding for the Queen Alia International Airport (QAIA) concession. This consortium, consisting of six diverse shareholders, won the bid by a margin of less than 1%, so it was an extremely tight competition. The company undertook the construction of a new terminal at QAIA, and the first phase of the construction was inaugurated in March 2013 and the second phase in September 2016. Between 2007 and mid-2016, the company invested around USD1 billion in a new terminal structure. The consortium evolved over time, and in 2017, shareholders started thinking in consolidation terms. Some wanted to exit, and others wanted to increase their holding. Within the last year, Aeroports de Paris (ADP) acquired 51% in AIG, Meridiam, also from France, acquired 33%, ASMA Capital from Bahrain acquired 12.25%, and local investor Edgo Investment Holdings disposed of half of its shareholding down to 4.75%. This has been the most important milestone because this consolidation means that there is a strong shareholder focus on operations rather than financial engineering and investments. ADP is among the biggest airport operators in the world, and it handles more than 250 million passengers per year globally. Now AIG is a subsidiary of ADP, which marks a new era for the organization. Not only is this a huge milestone for AIG, but also for Jordan. We have both outgoing and incoming investors walking out with smiles on their faces because they feel they have made a great deal. This deal is a major milestone in FDI in Jordan, because when private money comes into the country, it has a different weight. Another achievement is crossing the 8-million passenger mark, which is the result of approximately 7% average annual growth in traffic since the inception of the concession in early 2008. In August 2018 alone, we handled more than 1 million passengers. This is remarkable growth for a country like Jordan, especially when we look at the competitive landscape, which includes Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, and Istanbul. We are surrounded by extremely large players, and yet our growth has not slowed down over our 10 years in the country.</p><h4>How did AIG achieve this success?</h4><p>AIG brings the money, constructs the infrastructure, maintains it, and rents it to users, which includes all the stakeholders. We make sure all the stakeholders are all aligned and have common goals. These common goals are hammered in granite in our vision: to always be among the 20-best airports in the world among its peers. Our peers include airports that handle between 5 and 15 million passengers. We are working extremely hard to align everyone in this direction so we can maintain our position. In 2016, we were number three in the world, and in 2017, we were second best in the region. We stand a great chance of being the best in the region this year. We are also focused on developing our market and welcome the initiatives from the government with Ryanair. I have always been a strong opponent of high taxes on travel, airlines, and passengers, because they are detrimental to the development of countries. In Jordan, this is a big hurdle. With Ryanair, the government is testing the waters for the model of waiving the JOD20 special tax on each passenger to determine how this could translate into higher GDP and more jobs. The equation could work and needs to be evaluated for the long term.</p><h4>How would you assess your environmental efforts and becoming the first carbon neutral airport in the region?</h4><p>When we inaugurated the new terminal, we started a focused approach on reducing our carbon footprint. Airport Councils International (ACI) has a carbon accreditation scheme with levels 1, 2, 3, and 3+. 3+ is essentially carbon neutral, and we are the only airport in the Middle East that has achieved 3+ status. We achieved this without the solar plant we are planning to inaugurate, hopefully, next year. We will inaugurate a 10-MW solar plant, which will contribute 50% of our electricity consumption on an annual basis, and this will reduce our carbon footprint by a great deal. We also recycle rainwater and gray wastewater for irrigation purposes. We are experimenting turning organic waste into fertilizer. Jordan has done a great job over the last five years in these areas. Renewable energy is a major deal in the country currently, and projects are being inaugurated across a variety of areas. The entire investment community in the nation can benefit from these developments.</p><h4>How are you working to further develop the nation's tourism and transportation sector?</h4><p>QAIA does not aspire to compete with the big players in the Gulf, because this would not take us anywhere. We have ambitions to maintain a high level of origin &amp;destination traffic (O&amp;D), because this is what the country really needs. It needs inbound tourism and business. This is where our business has the highest margins as well, so we are strongly motivated to support additional O&amp;D. This is largely related to route development, which is all about giving airlines incentives to start routes into Jordan. We have a much larger potential to develop new routes thanks to our partnership with ADP. This is a strong development, and it will catalyze new growth all across Jordan.</p><h4>What more needs to be done to further develop Jordan as a transportation hub?</h4><p>There is one thing that is extremely important for making Jordan a transportation hub, and that is the land-based transportation in the country. Highly efficient, land-based infrastructure supports our business. We want modality because with this comes development and growth. One of the most important investments that can be made in Jordan over the next 10 years is a railway connection between Aqaba and Amman that travels through the airport. I also support this vision of connecting the Gulf all the way up to Turkey via Syria and Iraq. Indeed, this is a major investment, but hopefully we will see greater interest from for instance Asian countries to support Jordan in developing these projects. Geographically, we are well positioned to become part of the distribution hub for Africa, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa. There is a strong opportunity for us going forward, and to support this, it is extremely important to have the modality between the container port, land transportation, air freight, and so on. The potential is there, and the dynamics may work to Jordan's advantage moving forward. It comes back to the fact that the investment climate in Jordan is fairly positive and developing strongly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do your platforms enable your clients to overcome complex IT challenges?</h4><p>We were launched as the tech investment arm of SONAE Group in early 2016, building on a strong track record of launching tech companies and helping them grow internationally through organic growth or acquisitions. We have done acquisitions, namely, in the US, Brazil, the UK, and Ireland. We invest in three main areas: technology retail, telecom retail, and cybersecurity. Tech retail and telecommunications tech are easy to understand because the main assets of the group are mainly in those two areas. Cybersecurity started in 2013 when we identified it as a critical area, and we built up significant expertise throughout this period. Our main goal is financial returns; it is in fact our only goal. Being in a group with such a dimension, we explore the linkages of the portfolio companies and SONAE Group's businesses. We try to leverage our assets as much as possible, even as a key differentiating point as an investor.</p><h4>What have been the crucial factors behind SONAE IM's presence in 13 countries?</h4><p>It depends on the companies: These countries correspond to the footprint of the companies we control, but a significant part of our investments is also in minority stakes that are present in additional countries. The rationale is typically to expand to core geographies that in some cases work as hubs. It applies to the US, Brazil, and Mexico, and our offices there cover North America and South America. In the Asia Pacific, we are present in Malaysia and have a small presence in Australia that allows us to cover the region. Regarding cybersecurity, we have various offices around Spain and Portugal. We are also present in Mexico City because we need to follow the customer. Most of our customers in Spain are in Mexico and Latin America, so we naturally need to go there. It is a different approach to when one does technology, which results in international expansion.</p><h4>What corporate synergies does your company gain from being part of the SONAE Group?</h4><p>The main asset we leverage from SONAE starts with reputation; being a part of SONAE is an added value for us, not only in Portugal, but globally. Although SONAE is not that well known in the US, when we start to describe it, people begin to understand the group, and this certainly brings value. For a small country such as Portugal, being the biggest employer in terms of relative size compared to the country is extremely significant. In terms of assets, we leverage the expertise of the group in retail and telecoms. We liaise with the teams in this business and know the technologies we should invest in. We know their main pain points, and they know the dream technologies that could help them better do their job. These are the kind of interactions we have with them; we cross that with the market size, competitive landscape, and filter and select two or three technologies. For bigger investments such as cybersecurity, one thing we did was partner with NOS in Portugal to sell cybersecurity solutions through S21SEC. This is a strategic partnership that we are replicating in Spain, for example, with another operator, though it started here.</p><h4>What are some of your top priorities for the coming two years?</h4><p>Our priorities lie along the lines of what we have been working on recently: to continue to find the best investments available, nationally or internationally. In terms of economic exposure, we are more than 50% exposed to the international market. Portugal's economic boom is a critical factor, but more in the sense of attracting talent and investment to the country. It is critical in early-stage investments to attract international investment since the local market is not large, and those companies need help to expand internationally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Payment Partner of  Choice]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[payment-partner-of-choice]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see SIBS' portfolio evolving in the midterm?</h4><p>SIBS has expanded into other areas that are less typical for a payment processer, namely anti-fraud services. We have one of the lowest fraud levels in Europe, which is due to our strong team and the fact that we developed specialized capabilities in terms of infrastructure. We monitor security issues 24/7 across the payment touch points, which is a unique service. We have also developed a card production factory that personalizes more than 15 million cards every year, the highest in the Iberian Peninsula. We also developed process-outsourcing capabilities related to account opening. We differentiate ourselves in this business through our automation and support structures.</p><h4>In terms of internationalization, what is your strategy to position SIBS as the payment partner of choice in other markets?</h4><p>We have also developed and strengthened our international footprint. We started these efforts roughly 10 years ago, and are now present in three of the top five African markets, including Nigeria, Algeria, and Angola. Our largest footprint is in Angola. In these geographies, nationwide payments are processed with our proprietary software. In 2018, more than 330,000 POS terminals with more than 2.2 billion transactions will be processed through SIBS' proprietary solutions. We have been taking an active part in developing the competencies and core systems of the national payment entities. We also operate in eastern Europe, namely in Poland, where we have been present since 2008. We are growing in this market, growing by 40% in 2017, double the market. This is a core area of growth focus for us, and we want to continue to invest. All in all, we have been delivering on our mission, which is to be the preferred partner in payments with the most innovative, convenient, and secure payment solutions.</p><h4>How do you assess the company's financial performance internationally?</h4><p>We have been growing. We started our international operations in Angola 16 years ago. The European market in particular has been consolidating and accelerating from a set of domestic markets to a broader European one. We want to take part in this progress and consolidation. Our European approach began in 2009 in Poland, and with the recent acquisition of Paytel we took an even larger step in this direction. At present, international activity represents approximately 9% of the company's operations, and our target is to increase that to more than 15% by 2023.</p><h4>What does MB WAY reaching the 1-million-user mark mean for the company?</h4><p>This was an important milestone for both the company and country. This is particularly true when we take into account that more than 65% of these transactions are worth less than EUR25. That we are able to provide such a convenient user experience allows us to develop more digital customers. When we launched MB WAY, there were 700,000 mobile banking users, whereas currently there are about 1.7 million. MB WAY played a major role in developing this base of users and creating new digital habits. We are always evolving, and we recently launched two new features: the ability to request money and split bills. More importantly, we are deploying QR code payments in the POS system. This will allow consumers to have the same experience across different terminals and operating systems and use mobile payments in stores in a physical POS. This is also a more intuitive user experience for customers. In 2019, we will continue to evolve in every way, developing new use cases. It is a growing trend where people only need their mobile phone to bank. We are also developing a new feature that will allow people to interact with the ATM using only their mobile phone. One can already withdraw money without cards; by the end of 1Q2019, users will be able to use any of the same 60 functionalities with their phone. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you give us an overview of the evolution and main milestones for Millennium bcp?</h4><p>Millennium bcp is the only private-sector bank listed on the Portuguese Stock Exchange. This clearly marks us apart from other Portuguese banks. We currently have a well-balanced balance sheet in terms of funding and lending; we went from having a loan-to-deposit ratio of 164% to having more deposits than loans today. Second, we currently have a much stronger capital base of 12% up from 4%, and want to continue to grow this ratio to obtain a larger capital base. Our non-performing loan (NPL) figure was previously close to EUR13 billion; it has since fallen to around EUR6 billion and falls by EUR1-1.5 billion every year. Moreover, we have increasing volumes of new loans and businesses. There were several years when we did not grow our customer base in Portugal, although we managed to increase it in Poland and Africa. In 2018, for the first time in a long time, we had a net gain in customers and new opportunities. Our main challenge is to continue to grow our customer and business acquisition on a sustainable basis. We also want to work on the profitability of Millennium bcp, because we have an excellent cost-to-income ratio of 46-47%. However, we have to maintain and improve it in the future to ensure our capacity to generate capital, reduce NPLs, acquire more business and customers, and invest more rapidly in the digitization processes. We need greater digitization both for our processes and to change the way we connect with our customers.</p><h4>What is your strategy to keep growing and strengthen your position in dynamic markets like Mozambique and Poland?</h4><p>Our approach is to focus on our key, core markets, which are basically Portugal, Mozambique, and Poland, as well as Angola through a partnership. Our objective is to maintain a solid capital position in all these core markets, along with a quality balance sheet, while growing our customer base. This is a common strategy for all the key markets we are present in, though some adjustments are necessary in each market because not every country is in the same position in their financial cycle. In the Portuguese market, we have a critical mass as the largest private sector bank in the country in terms of business volumes. In Poland, we have around 5%—and growing—market share in what is considered a large market. In Mozambique, we are the key foreign bank in the sector, and in Angola, we are one of the top three private-sector banks with our partner there. We did a merger two years ago and are now better prepared for the future than before. We are extremely comfortable in the markets we are in.</p><h4>In 1H2018, Millennium bcp reached a net profit of EUR150 million, a 67% increase YoY. What are the reasons for this?</h4><p>The measurement we use is cost-to-income, which refers to our operating profit for our business size and cost base. A cost-to-income ratio of about 46-47% means one has an excellent operating profit ratio. In the past, a high level of impairments affected this figure, and we still have a high level in 2018; however, the level is lower than before, and our profits have increased. The main tools to maintain and develop our profitability are an excellent cost-to-income ratio and a solid operating profit base, coupled with normalizing our impairment level over the coming years. We are doing this very consistently, with decreases in our NPL book. We have also seen our business and customer volumes increasing since 2017. In 2018, we gained in net terms more than 300,000 customers, more than 100,000 of which were in Portugal. On the other hand, we also expect to see a normalization of interest rates. Together, these factors give a reasonably good perspective for 2018 and 2019. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[shoring-up-the-economy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your perspective of Portugal's transition from recession, austerity, early exit from the EU/IMF bailout, and return to growth?</h4><p>The economy started recovering in 2013, reflecting a gradual recovery of domestic demand and strong export growth, on the back of an improving external and financial environment. One remarkable characteristic during the adjustment period and ongoing recovery was the behavior of exports. Portuguese exporters have been gaining market share in external markets since 2008. A notable dimension of the export performance has been the services sector, especially tourism. Exports' share of GDP increased from around 30% in 2008 to close to 45% in 2017, which signals an important restructuring of the economy. The economic recovery was also supported by strong investment growth, in particular business investment. However, public and housing investment has lagged behind. The economy has been able to maintain a surplus in the current and capital account and also in the goods and services account. These developments have contributed to a gradual improvement in the international investment position, which is still negative. The economy underwent a strong and unprecedented fiscal consolidation process. The general government deficit stands currently at a historically low. Public debt as a percentage of GDP has also initiated a downward trajectory but remains high and considerably above the euro area average. This reinforces the importance of meeting the commitments under European fiscal rules. Moreover, the reduction in the indebtedness ratios of firms and households, together with positive developments in the banking system, has made the Portuguese economy more resilient to shocks.</p><h4>What were some of the measures taken by the Bank of Portugal to help the country return to greater macroeconomic stability?</h4><p>In 2010, the bank initiated a comprehensive strategy to address the challenges faced by the banking sector. This strategy was broadened in the context of the 2011-14 EU/IMF Economic Adjustment Program. Our most immediate concerns were to ensure banks' access to liquidity and the reinforcement of their capital ratios. At the same time, banking supervision became significantly more intrusive and forward looking, and the regulatory environment was considerably strengthened. The country's full participation in the banking union, and particularly in the Single Supervisory and Resolution Mechanisms, can be seen as a natural corollary of this much more demanding strategy that we have consistently been following since mid-2010. Major progress has been achieved over the past eight years. Portuguese banks are now increasingly robust, as evident by stronger liquidity and capital positions, reinforced shareholder structures in major banks, and improvements in asset quality. The banking system recognized over EUR33 billion of credit impairments while the biggest banks raised over EUR20 billion of equity. Regarding asset quality, while economic growth has certainly been beneficial, the ongoing comprehensive strategy to reduce NPLs is also bearing fruit. NPLs have decreased more than EUR13 billion since the peak in June 2016. Equally important, deposits have been quite resilient, showing that depositor confidence has been preserved. In addition, banks have continued to fulfill their role in financing the economy.</p><h4>How do you encourage banks to further strengthen their balance sheets, improve overall asset quality and liquidity, and reduce the level of non-performing loans?</h4><p>While developments in the banking sector have been encouraging, banks' adjustment efforts will have to continue. The ongoing challenges are four-fold: improve profitability, review the existing business models, reinforce governance models, and embed technological advances in retail banking. Improving profitability is a priority. Amid still-low interest rates, further progress on cost reduction is needed. This is even more pressing in view of the stricter regulatory requirements and the digitization trend. Moreover, banks need to continue to deliver on the targets agreed in their NPL reduction plans. The sustainability of banks' business models, risk management controls, and internal governance processes are key to guaranteeing the soundness of the banking system. These elements are closely monitored and challenged by the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Bank of Portugal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps have you been taking to modernize and maximize the efficiency of EDA's operations?</h4><p>Some 10% of EDA belongs to Energí­as de Portugal (EDP), and we have strong links with it. The government's plan was for EDA to have a strategic partner as one of our stakeholders so that the advances in the energy industry elsewhere would also be passed on to the Azores. In addition to EDP, we try to cooperate with other companies and bring state-of-the-art practices and technologies to the Azores in various ways. Although we are geographically small, we constantly work to improve quality and introduce as many innovations as possible. The Azores has 246,000 inhabitants and users. We produce about 800GWh year-round and need to do this in a way that preserves quality and processes that are state of the art.</p><h4>How does EDA support the overall development of the Azores and its economy?</h4><p>We do so by providing excellent service. We do not set the price of the tariffs, which the Energy Services Regulatory Authority (ERSE) regulates. We provide a great service for our clients that meets their needs, continue to improve the quality of what we do, and put in place best practices and state-of-the-art systems and processes.</p><h4>What steps are you taking to rationalize the utilization of electricity?</h4><p>One such step is efficiency; we work to have our clients on the best tariffs possible so that they use energy at night instead of consuming it during periods of peak day demand. We do promotions for these tariffs and provide incentives for using equipment that is more environmentally friendly, for example, electric systems that heat hot water for homes at night when electricity demand is lower, which is also preferable to having a gas water heating system. Customers are given a discount when purchasing such equipment and can pay over a four-year period.</p><h4>How important is renewable energy to EDA, and what role will it play in the company's future?</h4><p>In 2017, renewables accounted for 37.5% of our energy on the grid. Most of this was geothermal while the remainder was generated through our hydropower plants and wind farms. It is possible to increase this figure to 40% in 2018. In the near future, we want to increase the capacity of our geothermal plants by adding 9MW at our plant in Sío Miguel and 6MW in Terceira. This will give us a higher penetration of renewables on the grid. It is possible to have more than 50% renewables on the grid within four years; however, we need to solve the issue of how we store energy generated at night. We may be able to replace some thermal units with battery storage, and there are several studies ongoing at the moment to look into this issue.</p><h4>Do you anticipate any opportunities for joint venture partnerships or investors in the future?</h4><p>We are working with several companies. However, we can proceed without any problems if new investments in storage are feasible because we know exactly what to do in terms of geothermal energy. First, we need to solve the problem of storing energy between midnight and 8am, when consumption is low. The challenge with renewable energy is that we cannot export it as one would on the mainland, for example, whereby Portugal exports to Spain or France. Here in the Azores, each island is isolated. Once we solve the storage issue, we can increase our renewables to 50% without help from other parties and use our own funds and investments.</p><h4>What steps are you taking to safeguard the islands' natural resources?</h4><p>Our goal at EDA is to be in harmony with nature. We want to significantly increase our renewable energy capacity in the islands, though we want to do this with care. This includes preventing high CO2 and other emissions that pollute the environment. We also want our clients to understand that the best protection for the environment is to save energy and use it carefully. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you give us an overview of the evolution of WavEC?</h4><p>WavEC started in 2003 as a spin-off from the Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) to foster industrial development in wave energy. Currently, we have three business areas: wave, offshore wind, and ocean technologies, including offshore aquaculture. WavEC now has about 25 people, of which 10 have a PhD, while the others have master's in engineering, environmental sciences, and biology. About 60% of our income comes from R&amp;D projects, meaning there is a strong R&amp;D base to our work. The other 40% make up services that we render to companies, demonstrating that we work on real problems that the industry faces. In both cases, about 85% of the income comes from outside Portugal. Our R&amp;D projects are mainly European-funded projects, while our services to companies are from everywhere.</p><h4>Is WavEC partnering with more private or public entities, and who are your main partners?</h4><p>We do both. The mix in the private sector has changed over the years due to the evolution of the sectors. One of our main clients over the last two years has been Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN). We have also been working with EDP on various projects, not only in offshore wind, but also on floating solar photovoltaic (PV) cells for dams. Our main partner internationally in recent months is the Carbon Trust, a UK state-owned company that fosters the development of low-carbon industry in the UK. Another important international client in 2018 was Gas Natural Fenosa, for whom we undertook an in-depth review of the offshore deep-sea wind and wave energy market and technology. On the research side, we have many partners; one important one is IST in Portugal. However, we also partner with universities and research centers, such as the University of Edinburgh, University College Cork, École Centrale Paris, and Delft University of Technology.</p><h4>What does the outlook for Portugal's green energy market look like?</h4><p>There has been some turbulence in the internal market with pricing, which creates instability. However, in the longer term the outlook is positive for Portugal's green energy market. Portugal has great potential for testing and demonstrating the marine renewable technologies due to our strong electricity grid and significant number of parts and shipyards close to the coast. We also have other necessary infrastructure and relatively mild climatic conditions, which is an opportunity to test technologies developed for open-ocean coasts. Portugal should make itself an attractive place for such work to be carried out, which would also create an opportunity to engage the industry in the supply chain. Portugal should bet heavily on making the country attractive for the demonstration phase and see how the technology evolves before we invest significantly in producing the units. If we are talking about energy production, we must go for cheap energy and develop that technology; if we are talking about innovation, marine renewable energy is extremely interesting.</p><h4>What are the key targets for WavEC for the coming year?</h4><p>We want to maintain our activity in wave energy. Our target in that area is to test the first full-scale prototype for Corpower Ocean in Portugal. We are also working with WaveRoller, a Finnish wave energy technology company, to take these same steps here. It would be interesting having two technologies tested here because that would create synergies and help us develop critical mass in terms of the supply chain. Similarly, it is important for us that the WindFloat Atlantic project goes ahead as planned, because this will increase the critical size of marine renewable energy activity in Portugal. We are also working with international partners to expand our offshore wind services offering in the North European market. We also expect to have a stronger presence in Portugal's offshore and onshore aquaculture industry in the coming year and to reinforce our presence in the Norwegian offshore aquaculture market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>How does the company currently contribute to Portugal's energy mix through its installed capacity of wind farms? We began in Portugal and Spain, which today are two important markets, and have been developing from the beginning. We represent around 24% of the Portuguese installed capacity. Renewables not only reduce our import bill in terms of energy, but also have an important impact on local communities. Traditionally, renewable energy is located in areas with low levels of development, and the wind industry has been able to distribute income to those areas. An important part of our portfolio was linked to an industrial cluster in Portugal. About 10 years ago, there was a competition wherein developers not only had to build wind farms but also bring together an industrial cluster. Today, there are more than 1,000 people linked to that. It is important because this electrical production not only supplies the domestic market, but most of this production is exported. Our work in Portugal not only has a direct impact in terms of balance of payments and population, but also developing the industry itself.</p><h4>EDP Renewables plans wind farms throughout the construction, development, and operation of the project. How does this meticulous process enable your company to fully maximize the value of your assets?</h4><p>This is not a short-term activity but something we need a long-term view for. If we want to extract value, we have to go through the entire value chain, from the identification of the country and place to the kind of renewable energy available. We also have to obtain permits, which are extremely important. Renewables are important; however, they also have environment impacts that have to be mitigated. Subsequently, we focus on the optimization of the layout and construction, as well as operation and maintenance throughout the entire project. In the past, things were different, and we were just focused on production and generation. Today, we have to know how to sell in the markets and be able to manage market risks and have a better forecast of the wind. This enables us to be better prepared throughout the entire value chain.</p><h4>What is your company's commitment to world-class engineering and construction standards?</h4><p>The plants we build should be first-class plants. We do not build plants to have the maximum amount of MW but efficient. Wherever there is sun or wind, we must be available in order to generate power. Having a high quality of construction and first-class management is extremely important. Construction is just the first phase. We also need excellent operation methods; otherwise, we do not extract value. Before, developers externalized everything. We are increasingly internalizing activities to take care of what is going on in terms of operation. We have increased the quality of our work as well as the yield.</p><h4>What have been the key factors contributing to EDP Renewables' successful international expansion?</h4><p>Our core markets were Portugal and Spain, and we decided to go abroad to export our experience throughout the entire value chain. We began with France, though the big jump was with the US. Today, the US represents about 50% of our total capacity and has been the most dynamic market. We are proud when we go abroad to act as a local company. We have centralized expertise; however, when we go out to the field, we act as locals. Therefore, we are not seen as a foreign company. It is important that we do not have an obsession with centralization but with efficiency, respect, and understanding the local market. Today, Portugal represents no more than 15% of our EBITDA. Spain is still important, though the US is one of the most important areas in terms of growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of your role in promoting renewable resources for electrical production?</h4><p>When we established this association 30 years ago, our objective was shaped by the fact that all electrical business production, transport, and distribution was owned by the state through EDP since 1976. The sector was subsequently opened to private investment. The role of the association remains essential to unifying the different investors in the system for the production of electricity. We want Portugal to have a higher share of renewable electricity in order to support the reduction of CO2 emissions and fight climate change. The companies that are members of APREN represent 93% of all renewable power installed in Portugal and on average produce a little more than half of the electricity consumed throughout the country. We work to find solutions for our sector and address technical and fiscal problems concerning the environment and electricity production. We started from a system that basically involved feed-in tariffs and transitioned gradually to one determined by the market.</p><h4>What are some of the factors behind Portugal's successful development of wind energy?</h4><p>We still depend a great deal on hydropower, which fluctuates between dry and rainy years. 2017 was a dry year, where we got only 42% from renewables, while the year before was a wet one, with 64%. The government realized we had to move away from fossil fuels for two main reasons: we do not have oil, gas, or coal, and we are too small of a country to have a nuclear power plant. By developing renewables, we avoided expending hard currency to buy something to burn. This has been extremely successful in terms of minimizing CO2 emissions as well. The other main fact was the use of the feed-in tariff policy. This was important to bring us a step forward to where we are today. Compared to other countries, we have not made retroactive changes in recent years. Now, we are doing things the traditional way, as well as moving toward a market-oriented remuneration of the system. We do not seek subsidized tariffs; rather, we want stability for investors as well as reduced costs for consumers. Neither of these two things are certain based on the current policy.</p><h4>What potential do you foresee for Portugal to engage in energy produced by waves and ocean thermal energy conversion?</h4><p>These are essentially what we call marine technologies. In Portugal, we have potential in the next 10-15 years to use two marine sources that have the best prospects in Portugal: offshore wind and waves. Marine-based electricity is important to develop, though it is not as important in terms of Portugal's supply of electricity because the adoption of these technologies is still far off in the future. Marine is extremely expensive compared to onshore. In the south of Portugal, there is double the amount of sun radiation of central Europe. However, if the growth in demand for electricity matures beyond our expectations, we will have to make use of marine technologies. We have excellent conditions to study, develop, and test offshore marine technologies, especially in waves and wind.</p><h4>How does APREN participate more broadly in terms of European energy policy monitoring and implementation?</h4><p>We do it through the four associations we belong to: the European Renewable Energy Federation (EREF), which is similar to APREN at the European level and has all the technologies; Wind Europe; Solar Power Europe; and European Biomass Association. We also have excellent connections with the European Parliament and Commission because we have been active for many years and have developed a great rapport with them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the private sector in advancing the Portugal's agenda to become a clean energy country?</h4><p>One of the things we have seen during this mandate is a growing awareness by companies that change is coming, and sooner than they expected. I am glad to see more industries in Portugal placing decarbonization and the circular economy at the front and center of their business models. Several sectors are investing in R&amp;D and thinking about new business models that first reduce costs and second guarantee materials for their future, the while striving to emit less and preserve local jobs. For me, that is sustainability. And, last but not least, high-tech start-ups are redirecting their solutions toward fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals. One clear example was the great success of the Govtech competition by the Ministry of Administrative Modernization.</p><h4>What have been the main highlights and achievements of your mandate to date?</h4><p>We started our mandate based on three integrated policy areas that are fundamental to guaranteeing long-term prosperity: decarbonizing our economy, valuing the territory and its habitats, and striving for a more circular use of our resources. As of now, all these strategies are being deployed in the field: The National Program for Territory Ordinance (PNPOT), the National Plan for Circular Economy (PAEC), and the National Roadmap for Carbon Neutral Portugal 2050 (RNC2050). To make the third happen, we have our Environmental Fund, which has been crucial to financing the integration of these principles among municipalities, companies, and citizens.</p><h4>What are the main advantages of investing in the green energy sector?</h4><p>Portugal has a trifecta of highly valued assets, such as the sea, sun, and wind, and I would risk a fourth: skill. We have an extremely high-value industry both in hardware (e.g. metalworks) and software (e.g. electronic systems). It is not by chance that we attract companies such as Siemens, which benefit from experienced PT companies like A. Silva Matos and others; however, the green energy sector is also made of smaller projects. Take the bio-economy, for example, in which we have an enormous potential for development. We certainly have a solid and growing pool of companies and competences, from north to south of the country: CIIMAR in Leixíµes, BLC3 in Oliveira do Hospital, Católica School in Porto, and companies like SilicoLife and A4F.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions and goals for the ministry in 2019?</h4><p>In 2019, we will continue moving forward with our main orientations, chiefly in decarbonizing the public transport sector. The most evident effort will certainly be in continuing the expansion of the subway lines of Oporto and Lisbon. But there is another area in particular that we want to focus on, and that is financing. Having the right mix of public and private financial support is crucial in guaranteeing a safe and just low-carbon and circular transition of our economy; there is a lot to tackle. It is impossible to expect that public funding alone can support this. On the other hand, we have a financial system that is still very much focused on short-term and linear forms of value. That, in general, runs away from innovation and environment-based solutions and deems it risky. The commission is working on a taxonomy for sustainable finance; the European Investment Bank is pulling out all the stops to support projects on circular and bio-economy; and the next Cohesion Fund will demand an allocation between 65% and 85% of support to smart, sustainable (low-carbon and circular) projects. We have 12 years to come to a full stop on the climate breakdown of our natural system. I am confident in Portugal's resilience and ingenious drive to tackle these challenges. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of Semapa since its founding?</h4><p>We are an industrial group with three main businesses: pulp and paper, cement, and environment. The group acquired Secil, the cement company, in 1994 and Navigator, the pulp and paper business, in 2004. In the meantime, the group also became one of the first players in renewable energy in Portugal, which was subsequently sold to Babcock &amp; Brown. The environmental business (ETSA) was acquired in 2008 in the context of Secil's incineration strategy and subsequently followed an independent path. Currently, Navigator is our main business, with EUR1.6 billion in revenue, and Secil is number two, with around EUR500 million in revenue. Throughout the years, we have been one of the most significant industrial investors in Portugal. At Navigator, we have invested in some of the bigger and more efficient paper plants in the world, and we have built an international portfolio that allows us to benefit from diversification effects. Since the rebirth of the group in the 90s, our shareholders' returns have been in the range of 19% per year, which is significant.</p><h4>What have been the main challenges of doing business in Portugal?</h4><p>We are an international, export-oriented group, and our challenge as a business is to maintain our competitiveness in this context. Although most of Navigator's assets and operations are based here, the company exports more than 90% of the pulp and paper it produces. We are the leading office paper producer in Europe and also export to the US, Africa, and the Middle East. Our main raw material is wood, where we compete with pulp players from the southern hemisphere. Keeping enough wood supply in Portugal is of the utmost importance to us and to an industry that represents one of the biggest and higher value-added export industries of the country. We are actively engaged with all our wood suppliers to ensure the sustainability of their forestry practices, and currently more than 60% are already certified. This number is increasing every year. We need, therefore, to make sure the government and regulatory authorities recognize this and do not introduce unnecessary restrictions. Navigator is also expanding into the tissue market as a growth option. Energy competitiveness, among others, will be a key ingredient of success. In cement, most of our production is outside of Portugal, though we still have a sizable operation here, exporting a significant part of its output. Again, energy competitiveness is key and is not evolving as it should. Another critical factor is the evolution of the CO2 Emission Trading Scheme in Europe to ensure a level playing field vis-í -vis non-compliant countries.</p><h4>What future developments are in the pipeline for Navigator at the international level?</h4><p>We have a distinctive global leadership position in office paper. We will continue to grow this business by constantly improving our throughput. Beyond that, we have been exploring two routes. One is to invest further in pulp-producing capacities by modernizing and increasing the capacity of our plants. We recently finished an investment in our Figueira plant of about EUR80 million to increase output by 70,000 tons. We are also exploring the tissue route. It is a growing market, which uses our hardwood pulp, and we aim to replicate the successful integration strategy pursued in office paper. In 2015, we acquired a company in this space and recently concluded a EUR-120 million investment in the construction of an integrated factory in Cacia. The view is that we will be able to develop a particularly competitive position to serve some markets. Value creation needs to take precedence from growth for the sake of it. We also have a long-term, forest-based bet in Mozambique. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your agency's role as a strategic partner in providing both technical and financial support to Portuguese enterprises?</h4><p>IAPMEI is a public institution under the Ministry of Economy. Our role is to promote competitiveness and growth and ensure the best policies regarding industrial activity are in one place. The aim is to reinforce innovation and entrepreneurship as well as investment in enterprises, namely SMEs. In Portugal, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises represent 99.9% of the economy, much higher than the European average. Micro enterprises employ less than 10 workers, and these comprise 96% of the Portuguese economy. The average number of employees is eight, and SMEs represent 80% of job employment and 63% of added value. This means we have to give SMEs a great deal of attention. Therefore, we pay attention to financial issues beyond normal banking activity with commercial entities. We are the financing partners of other means of financial support for SMEs other than commercial activity. That is mostly when there is a market failure. SMEs have difficulties getting to the market, so we have a system of mutual guarantees supported by the state and a set of financing activities with credit lines and supporting investments.</p><h4>What steps do you take to devise the best policies to foster entrepreneurship and innovation for companies in the local business community and industry?</h4><p>We are consulted for new legislation proposed by others than IAPMEI, and we pay special attention, concerning the potential impact taking into account SME characteristics. In terms of political support, we propose the creation of structural incentives for investment and lines of credit for certain activities to promote innovation, entrepreneurship, scaling up, or the concentration of companies. We also take into account the fact that we are the ones that manage the system of certification of SMEs, following the European rules for classifying. There are other ways in which we can offer assistance in addition to financing. One of the most important is providing management capabilities for entrepreneurs. We have an academy where we focus on training enterprises in terms of capacity and entrepreneurship. Another department promotes special support for the three enterprise cycles. We accompany the developments from the pre-start-up idea phase to the scale up process until they grow into a normal enterprise.</p><h4>Could you tell us about your agency's strong representation in strategic clusters?</h4><p>The clusters are one of the most important things we intend to give increased attention. Clusters have already been formally created in Portugal, and they can improve collaborative efficiency by bringing together companies' knowledge, academia, institutions, associations, and public entities. We already have 20 recognized clusters, and IAPMEI is in charge of formally recognizing them. Thse 20 clusters already involve 2,100 different associates, more than 1,800 SMEs, and many micro enterprises. Crucially, there are always other major players in these clusters that have a pulling effect. The aeronautics cluster is witnessing fantastic development in Portugal. We have been involved in the creation of a development of a project together with Brazil, implementing a new kind of airplane from Embraer. This company already has two factories in Portugal and is growing the different players in the cluster, be they technological centers or parts suppliers. Even universities that develop courses and prepare people for work are involved in it. The idea is that there is critical mass combining different actors, which will result in greater end results than if they were to work alone. Then, they are able to organize events, exchange ideas, and create projects where they can have special conditions for mutual support. One of our biggest hopes is that the implementation of clusters will help the development of the Portuguese economy and give us a greater economic advantage. </p>]]></richbody0content>

COTEC is a network that brings companies together. We are not focused on any one sector or specific level of company development. From the outset, we looked to create synergies between SMEs and large companies as a key mechanism to promote economic growth. We now see a growing interest from larger companies to address the innovation problems they need to solve, and they believe interaction with SMEs with specific skills from other sectors may bring in additional expertise that can help. Working with the government also plays a major role, and Industry 4.0 is a great example of identifying innovation barriers to be overcome.</p><h4>To what extent can a culture of innovation act as a catalyst for job creation, and what impact can it have on supporting SME development?</h4><p>Our growth potential is in moving SMEs to different stages of scale and impact in terms of turnover or employment. From that perspective, we demonstrated a strong correlation between innovation and the ability to manage these processes with a proprietary maturity framework called Innovation Scoring. We also demonstrated the growth potential of SME companies. This would have a growth impact on the national economy of 0.5% of GDP. Innovative SMEs create more and better-paying jobs and play an important social role since they distribute more profit across society. This growth model supported by innovative SMEs is a sustainable one, both in terms of business growth and achieving quality employment. SMEs in the COTEC network are on average smaller and stuck in that trap between size, scale, and level of innovation. They have many opportunities to grow but simply do not have the resources or financial capital to address those opportunities.</p><h4>What initiatives have been the most effective in achieving COTEC's core objectives?</h4><p>For example, Portugal's aerospace cluster has been evolving for 100 years. During this time, a number of companies active in maintenance, transport, injection-molding, and metals have entered the market, and it has grown a great deal over the past decade. For this cluster of activities, Portugal is in an extremely selective club of aeronautic manufacturers. There are almost 200 companies in Portugal working in some way; however, this is just one example, and there are many more. We need to stimulate a cluster of activities in order to extract the growth potential because most are highly capital- and knowledge-intensive and able to provide quality employment. We can identify several clusters, including food, the agro and pulp and paper industry, tourism, and health as having excellent prospects for new growth and investment.</p><h4>What image you would like the international investment community to have about Portuguese innovation?</h4><p>In the last 25 years, we have been building an international case to have the appropriate talents and capabilities in different areas. We have well-positioned universities that are training researchers and professionals in management and engineering with one of the best engineering faculties in Europe, and the best proof of the way we train engineers and managers is the success of the Portuguese abroad. A number of sectors have been transformed into innovative businesses, and we are now able to use not only the supply capabilities, but also have markets and business that can use those innovative capabilities. What we need is external investment to boost and consolidate these areas of high-value activities. More investment will have not only a direct effect but a multiplying one, because the country is ready to grow on the next-generation demand. We already have the connections between the companies and universities that supply the source of knowledge; however, we also need a great and international partner network. COTEC may help bring together and activate those cross-country networks of innovation with what we call entrepreneurial discovery, which is not only about the business people and entrepreneurs but the scientists, technicians, and companies that supply technologies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you define CIP's role in the context of business in Portugal?</h4><p>The global economy is going through a series of rapid changes, demanding that organizations adapt to new challenges in the business context. CIP interprets these challenges and finds the best solutions, thus acting as a beacon that guides companies. CIP must focus on finding the answers to these new challenges. We represent 140,000 Portuguese companies and are the largest employers' confederation among 70 associations. The diversity of the companies we represent provides us with a deep knowledge of the day-to-day activities and needs of our companies, replicating best practices that have worked for other companies in need.</p><h4>What are Portugal's current competitive factors, and what needs to be done to improve them?</h4><p>We have an excellent communication network, great highways, and young people who are highly qualified. However, we still need to improve the qualification of our human resources, because it is through knowledge that differentiation among countries will prevail. Incorporating knowledge to create innovation will allow us to differentiate ourselves in the highly competitive global economy. In addition, more structural reforms are needed. The wealth of the country does not support the dimension of the state we currently have. Portugal must improve the qualification of its human resources and free the state from activities that consume a great deal of the wealth generated in order to transfer the surplus to the economy. We must stimulate the improvement of competitiveness factors by reforming tax and reducing bureaucracy so it is less stifling. If the state manages these points, then companies will be able to perform their roles far better.</p><h4>What is the importance of strategy in terms of Portugal's efforts to change its industrial profile theme?</h4><p>The country cannot be based on services alone; we must also have an industrial base. The weight of industry in the economy must increase, and this can be reached with a well-defined strategy. Portugal must bet on sectors such as aeronautics or the maritime sector. The country must also look to traditional industries such as footwear and textiles, where we have excellent examples. Portugal must define its strategy and business model to diversify and improve. The country must know what it wants and what it can do; we have excellent examples in the metallurgical and metal-mechanics industry, where we are increasing sales and exports. There are great successes in the aeronautics industry, where Embraer and other companies have come to Portugal. Then, there is the automotive industry, where we are attracting companies through clusters that provide components to the sector. Portugal must define industries and, within these, aggregate and develop strategies, promote reforms, and fiscally encourage possible ways to invest. We must attract productive investment and bring more national and foreign investments that will bet on internal production, substituting imports for internal manufacturing, and developing more industry than what we currently have. The weight of industry in Portugal's GDP has fallen in the last 20 years, and we must return industry to the center of our economy.</p><h4>What are the priorities for CIP in the coming year?</h4><p>We will continue to demand that the government look at our internal politics and our role in Europe and the world. We want the government to promote reforms that must be undertaken. We need fiscal stability, and our fiscal policy must be more predictable. We cannot change the fiscal framework every year; there must be an attractive fiscal policy toward investment. It must allow predictability for investors and ensure that taxes will not change in the next five or eight years. The reform of the state must allow the economy to set itself free and entice stimulus so that it can benefit. We need a more efficient legal system with less bureaucracy in order to benefit economic agents. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Portugal's economy has seen five years of unprecedented growth. How has an anti-austerity policy mix contributed to this?</h4><p>The government used anti-austerity measures to unleash society's existing growth potential by following responsible and moderate policies. The first major impact of this was to boost citizen and consumer confidence, which was also reflected in the confidence of investors. These generated an atmosphere of certainty and led to an acceleration of this growth, far above the EU average. Our investment grew by 13% in 2017, the biggest increase in 18 years, mostly in private investment, both Portuguese and FDI. Second, we instilled stability into the public accounts. With more growth, we have more revenue and reduced unemployment, which reduces the costs of unemployment benefits and social security. We also sent a clear message about fiscal stability in our three approved budgets: we have no need to drum up revenue by hiking taxes. We succeeded through better management and by harnessing the opportunities created by economic growth to reduce the debt burden, while maintaining fiscal stability. This reduction of the deficit—to 1.3% in 2017, well below our ambitious targets—works as a guarantee of our ability to retain this fiscal stability, as we will not have more urgent needs in the short or medium term.</p><h4>Is fintech becoming a priority area for the government, and how do you envisage technology-based economic development in the long term?</h4><p>We see technology as a key factor for the evolution of the country. In terms of innovation, we have launched three different programs. One of these was Startup Portugal, which streamlined fiscal rules and instruments of venture capital, matched funds to co-invest with foreign investors in technology firms and created a network of incubators. In terms of fintech, we see many start-ups going from strength to strength, with some firms already securing significant investment. The latest example was Finzay, a leading firm in cybersecurity that won an injection of EUR50 million. Another development is that fintech has allowed banks and financial organizations to reorganize their production and services all over the world. Certain large financial institutions are moving key departments, such as cybersecurity or application development, to Portugal. We see two forms of movement: new firms experiencing rapid growth and investors and incumbents eyeing the market with interest. The Web Summit, held in Lisbon, helped to considerably draw attention to the Portuguese ecosystem.</p><h4>How will Portugal capitalize on its image as an attractive hub for relocating companies?</h4><p>We see many businesses moving to Portugal in different areas. There are new investments in terms of industry, namely in machinery, aeronautics, and the automotive industry, coming mainly from France, Germany, India, China, and the US. We have several banks creating large pockets of jobs in shared services in Portugal; there are engineering companies that have built R&amp;D centers and many software companies investing here and growing fast. This has translated into an almost 11.9% increase in our exports in 2017 and a strengthening of our industrial capability because of nearshoring. One of the main attractions of opening shop in Portugal is our robust and diverse talent pool. It is a great opportunity to find engineers, software developers, people who speak different languages, people from the finance sector, managers, and people with different competencies.</p><h4>What impact has qualified labor had on Portugal's export mix?</h4><p>We have seen considerable diversification. This used to be more centered on traditional sectors such as footwear, textiles, and clothing, though we have since seen a shift toward the machinery, automobile, aeronautics, and pharmaceutical industries. Even traditional sectors have become more focused on high quality with flexible production: producing more value with less people. Parallel to this, there has been a significant increase in technological services. 10-15 years ago, there were half a dozen software firms exporting; however, today the market has blossomed. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>It has become somewhat of a cliché, but a necessary one, to recall the Treaty of Windsor of 1386, which makes the Portugal-UK relationship thelongest-standing diplomatic alliance in existence between two countries in the world. More importantly, the relationship is still strong and vibrant. The ties between our countries are deeply rooted in culture and anchored in the vivid and growing communities of Portuguese here in the UK and British expats in Portugal.</p><p>As we prepare for Brexit, I want to recognize the invaluable contributions both communities provide to their country of residence. Both must be respected. Those who moved on the premise of freedom of movement should not be uprooted by Brexit. We must turn Brexit into an opportunity for both our countries to deepen our special relationship both politically and economically.<br>The important thing now is to minimize the negative consequences of Brexit and develop a relationship as close as possible with the UK. The European project is one of peace and progress, but also of opportunity. And it will continue to be. British businesses will continue to cross the Channel in search of profit, as will our own. Portugal has for centuries been a preferred destination of the British on the Old Continent. The UK is our largest source of tourists, our fourth-largest export market, and our fourth-largest source of FDI. That preference continues to this day. British investment in Portugal grew at a faster pace than EU investment in Portugal over the past two years. And over the last year, it multiplied by five. In the wake of Brexit, many companies have chosen Portugal to be their second home in Europe.</p><p>These are the dividends of a special relationship nurtured over centuries, and they pay both ways. Today the opportunities for investing in Portugal are even greater because we are committed to the European project and are a living symbol of recovery from economic, financial, and social crises. Portugal is growing faster than Europe. Employment and investment growth are double the average of the EU and unemployment is falling faster than in any other eurozone country.</p><p>GDP grew by 2.7% in 2017. This growth allowed for a 0.9% public deficit, the lowest in our democratic history. Primary surplus was 3% and public debt fell more than 4 percentage points of GDP. We have left the excessive deficits procedure, and our sovereign debt is no longer junk-rated. Our current account balance is in surplus. Stabilizing the financial sector was a key priority for this government. Today, confidence and resilience are back to the financial sector and country.<br></p><p>In innovation, we are going above and beyond. Through December 2017, we approved support for almost 3,000 collaborative innovation projects worth almost EUR600 million. Recently, we launched six collaborative labs that bring together businesses and researchers to set priorities for the research agenda. We also issued new funding for sector-level technological centers, which have been the driving force behind innovation and entrepreneurship in traditional sectors.</p><p>In Portugal, you will always find a friend of Britain and British businesses, not to mention a safe harbor and fertile ground for your investment. Indeed, to British businesses I say—by opening in Portugal you can have a two-in-one; Brexit in the UK and Remain in the EU by investing in Portugal. Just as history proved before there even was an EU, and just as we will prove together after Brexit, Britain and Portugal can grow together. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The reform of the UN requires the commitment of all member states. Maintaining the status quo is a way of gutting multilateralism and multiplying risks, conflicts without prevention, underdevelopment, and the violation of human rights and human dignity. Not reforming the Security Council with a broad-based consensus is to ignore the geopolitics of the 21st century, which requires, at the very least, the presence of the African continent, Brazil, and India.</p><p>Our view of the world situation and of the role of the UN explains our positions on so-called regional questions, but which are global in scope. Let me now dwell on some that are of special relevance to Portugal: The strengthening of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), currently presided by Cabo Verde, to be followed by Angola, whose contributions to stability and development I wish to highlight. CPLP enjoys magnificent cooperation with the UN and pursues the goal of seeing the Portuguese language—one of the most widely spoken in the world—adopted as an official language of the UN; the steps taken in Guinea-Bissau in preparation for elections in November; the growing importance of the African Union, its key uniting role for peace and sustainable development, the intensification of the partnership with the UN and the historic step of the “Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship" between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Our wish is for the elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo to be held in a safe, free, and fair manner and that the results will be respected by all; the important developments on the Korean Peninsula opening positive prospects for complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization and demonstrating the commitment and courage of the parties involved; and the signing of the Maritime Boundary Treaty between Australia and Timor-Leste under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the UN.</p><p>Unfortunately, certain parts of the Middle East and the Maghreb continue to show signs of permanent political, social and economic instability. In Libya, the international community must unite to assist with the humanitarian and security situation and the creation of a solid state. Yemen remains the scene of one of the greatest humanitarian crises today, especially affecting the most vulnerable, women and children. Only negotiated political solutions, through the mediation of the UN and respect for international humanitarian law, will be able to reverse this increasingly tragic situation. Equally tragic is the humanitarian crisis in Syria, with one of the largest flows of refugees within and out of the region.</p><p>Here, also, only a substantive, inclusive and UN-mediated political solution will tend to ensure effective and broad-based international support for reconstruction, in the absence of which there will be apparent, sporadic and transitory agreements, but not the lasting peace. In any case, stabilization and peace in the Middle East will only be possible with the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Common sense demands the resumption of a credible negotiation process, addressing all the final status issues, including the question of Jerusalem, and leading to a practicable two-state solution based on coexistence by Israel and Palestine in peace and security.</p><p>As mentioned by Secretary-General António Guterres, true patriotism is only complete with cosmopolitanism. Portugal believes that multilateral action, political dialogue, and diplomatic wisdom are the only possible route to harmonious coexistence between nations and peoples. A short-term view or views, however appealing they may appear to be, are just a flash in the pan, which does not last, will not last, and will not solve the world's true problems: development, justice, security, and effective respect for the rights of those who are the reason for our mandate and our presence in this General Assembly.<br>As Nelson Mandela said: “A fundamental concern for others in our individual and community lives would go a long way in making the world the better place we so passionately dreamt of." This is the noble mission of this institution; it is also the reason for Portugal's deep commitment to the UN. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major or achievements did Avianca reach this year?</h4><p>It has been a year full of challenges. On one hand, we worked to recover our operation and service after the longest pilot strike in aviation industry, which took place last year. It went all the way to the supreme court of Colombia on three different occasions, and on three different occasions the ruling was in favor of Avianca. This year has been dedicated to recovering the operation from these difficult times. By the end of October Avianca had recovered 100% of its operation post illegal pilot's strike, requiring no further wet leases and with resumed capacity deployment that today is in line with what we vision for Avianca's network moving forward. On the other hand, in terms of fleet acquisition and expansion plans, in 2018 Avianca's fleet renovation plan included the incorporation of 10 new airplanes: five A320s with Neo technology, which are 20% more fuel efficient and 50% less noisy, two A330-300, the largest ones of the fleet, two 320CEO and most recently the thirteenth Boeing 787- 8. The last one is assigned to European routes, particularly to the flight: Munich — Bogota. Therefore, Avianca Holdings S.A. and its subsidiaries have a consolidated operating fleet of 190 aircraft. In terms of connectivity, we also extended our network to new cities, such as Munich and Chicago from Bogota and Orlando and Chicago from Guatemala and El Salvador. In the south, we inaugurated the Lima-Mendoza direct flight to serve northern Argentina. We have also undertaken efforts to improve our efficiency and reduce our costs, mostly by using technology to improve the productivity of our staff. Therefore, understanding that digital transformation goes beyond the use of technology and that it is also a matter of leadership and corporate culture is a key step. Several processes have been implemented to keep the airline in the forefront, such as defining new structures and processes.</p><h4>What does it mean for Avianca to be a regional leader, and how do you work to maintain this position?</h4><p>Our strategy has two streamlines. The first one is to connect all Latin America to the rest of the world. We are doing this because we have a strong presence in Central America, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. The idea is to serve all countries, and we do that today with the exception of Venezuela. Currently, we operate to 15 destinations in North America and four in Europe. In addition to this, we just signed a strategic commercial agreement with United and Copa Airlnes to basically integrate our network between North American and Latin America. The benefit to the consumer will be that we will plan together, serve the markets together, and coordinate our services across the region. Another part of our strategy is to compete through an exceptional service. At the end of the day, there are only two aspects that make a difference: service and on-time performance. We have chosen service as our leading differentiator. Before the flight, during the flight, and after the flight. In terms of customer service, we do not charge for bags, we provide food and drinks on board, we have VIP lounges in most airports where we operate, and we have a loyalty program that rewards passengers in different ways. Equally important, Avianca has an advanced call center, which receive all our customers inquiries and are able to solve issues seven days a week in Spanish, English, Portuguese and German. It is all about the experience for us, and we are proud that we have been selected several times over the last years by TripAdvisor, Kayak, Skytrax, and many other companies as the best airline in Latin America.</p><h4>What is Avianca's approach to finding new routes inside Colombia?</h4><p>The first approach, which is the typical approach, is to listen to people and get to know where would they like have a new flight. they would like. In addition, there is a big demand from local governments and professional associations of connecting their cities with the rest of the country and the world via Avianca. The second source is a close analysis of the traffic in the country. We research where people are going and why, and through this approach we have learned about where people want to go. For instance, we learned that people wanted a direct flight from Bogota to Sincelejo in northern Colombia. Thus, we did a route analysis and worked together with local authorities to evaluate the possibility to make this happen. As a result, from October 12, Avianca operates a new direct flight to this city and the load factor has been above 85 percent since it started. Nowadays, we fly to 24 cities in Colombia, and all major cities are covered. There are only a few additional routes that can be operated. Therefore, we realize that smaller cities are not necessarily well served and we decided to do look for an alternative to operate within these destinations. Next year we will launch a specialize airline for regional transport within Colombia, which will operated on ATR fleet. We are in the process to have the final already have the approval from the authorities and then we will start the operations. Probably, we will have 15-20 aircraft dedicated to regional air transport.</p><h4>Can you tell us about new services you are evaluating for Europe?</h4><p>Avianca is thinking about adding a second frequency to London, if the airline can get a slot for it. Regarding to new routes, Zurich looks attractive as the next destination in Europe due to its location in center Europe. Moreover, the airline is also considering Rome and Paris. In terms of partnerships, Avianca is strengthening its partnership with Lufthansa in order to reinforce its presence and connectivity in Europe.</p><h4>What can we expect from Avianca in 2019? </h4><p>We will continue working hard on our current path. We will continue our renovation fleet plan, by adding eight new aircraft in 2019. It is important to notice that our fleet is the youngest in the Americas, with an average age of six or seven years. To maintain that, we will be decommissioning some older aircraft. For comparison, United and American airlines have a fleet with an average age of 12-14 years. In terms of service, we will still working on improving our on-time performance, thus itis the number one indicator of customers' satisfaction. At the moment, our completion rate sits at 98%, which is just short of the world class rate of 99%. We aim to achieve 99% but it is not as easy as it seems. Our OTP rate, which is how often you land within 15 minutes of your advertised time, is around 78% while the world class rate is 85%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Over 5,000 Tank Containers]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[martin-sack-managing-director-leschaco-mexicana]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main supply and demand trends in the Mexican chemical industry that impact your business? </h4><p>As a logistics provider, there is a positive increase in demand from the chemical industry to import products. However, this is not good news for the chemical industry itself, as it would prefer to have fewer imports and more exports to reach a more balanced business portfolio. We are fairly pleased with the current scenario and see it as a great opportunity to further grow our business within the chemical sector. On the other hand, we also would support more balanced import and export volumes. Leschaco is a rapidly growing medium-sized global player with an own fleet of +5,000 tank containers which we operate on global basis. Right now we have more tank containers being imported than exported which makes the whole operation not always profitable.</p><h4>Why is there such a lack of production in the country? </h4><p>The country does not have the infrastructure it needs to meet demand. The government has not given enough support to motivate investment. However, the country is in the first steps of undergoing a transformation. It will take some time to see the fruits of this effort as private investment continues to seep in. Step by step, there is a chance to transform Mexico and strengthen local activities and production. This will imply better times for the chemical industry when it comes to more production and increasing the focus on exports.</p><h4>What challenges did you encounter when you first entered the market in Mexico? </h4><p>We entered the market 20 years ago at a point where we already had a wide range of international experience in other markets. Leschaco always had a specific expertise in the correct handling and shipping of chemical products, reason why we also focused on this vertical from the very first beginning. Besides our international transport services, we started to offer door-to-door concepts, including domestic services like customs clearance and inland transportation. Another focus was the development of highly specialized employees as the chemical business requires specific technical knowledge. We believe that our people represent our main competitive advantage, therefore we continue investing heavily in their development and well-being. Right now we are one of the main players in Mexico when it comes to the transport of chemical products. One of the main challenges consists in a fast-changing environment in our business. Digitalization is one of the top issues all around the world, end-to-end visibility is getting more important for all our customers as well. In Mexico, the trucking services are of a mayor concern,  involving the lack of equipment, truck drivers and the increasing number of cargo robberies.</p><h4>What other sectors represent an area of opportunity for your company? </h4><p>Besides consumer goods and pharmaceuticals, the automotive sector is a big opportunity for us, and we are already doing quite some business in that field.  Almost all renowned manufacturers of automobiles and automotive parts operate production plants in Mexico and the new Free Trade Agreement USMCA will strengthen the industry in the region.  With regard to new services and products, it is important for Leschaco to expand with contract logistics in the Mexican market. Warehousing and domestic distribution will complete our door-to-door logistics portfolio, becoming a real one-stop shop solution for our customers.  In addition, we will invest heavily in manpower and technology to install a control tower functionality in Mexico, offering our customers an advanced level of end-to-end visibility and proactive decision-making.</p><h4>What should the new administration prioritize when it comes to investing in transport infrastructure?</h4><p>The new administration needs to take care of inland transportation. As already mentioned, the market faces a lack of truck equipment and truck drivers. Smaller companies can´t afford investments in new equipment, also due to the increasing number of assaults and robberies on the Mexican highways and related higher costs for insurances. At the same time, the railway infrastructure needs a great deal of expansion and investments, something what is not happening. We are not moving enough by rail; if we could do that, we would have less problems with trucks. The new government announced heavy investments in the south of the country, for instance in the so called “Maya Train,“ but I personally fear that there won't be enough financial resources to push other, even more important projects. The cancellation of the construction of the new Mexico City airport is also not in line with  logistics needs, shipping by air will get more and more complicated in the upcoming years. The port infrastructure has received important investments, the new port of Veracruz will be inaugurated during this year, an important milestone for the expected growth in the Gulf region. On the other hand, we are facing more and more congestion at the Pacific, especially the port of Manzanillo urgently needs a convincing expansion plan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Indigenous Participation]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[caroline-ogbonmide-chief-operating-officer-makon-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the 2015 interview, Oluseyi Makinde stated that Makon Engineering and Technical Services Limited operated in an environment dominated by foreign companies. Has your clientele changed as indigenous companies like yours increased their contribution to the industry?</h4><p>Increased participation of indigenous companies in the oil and gas sector is a government initiative through the local content philosophy (Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board) however, progress has been slow as pointed out by Engineer, Oluseyi Makinde. For Makon, our clientele has remained essentially the same over the past years. SPDC novated some of the contracts, one of which was with Eroton Exploration and Production Company Limited, and another was Nigerian Petroleum Development Company with ND Western as Joint Venture Partner. The composition of our clients is still skewed towards International Oil Companies and local indigenous Exploration and Production players. We bid for projects with both local and international companies, for example we are working hard to be part of major players for Nigeria LNG's Train 7 project, which would be a major deal for us.</p><h4>Last year, Makon's Managing Director, Oluseyi Makinde, told TBY he expected 2018 to be a good year for indigenous companies once all debts had been repaid. How was last year for Makon Group?</h4><p>2018 was a better year for us at MAKON. I understand by my training that debt is cheaper than equity, therefore we utilize debts as a tool for business growth. We are committed to keep servicing our debt.  2017 was a rough year, where we could not conclude many of our projects due to cash call challenge, but in 2018 we made remarkable progress with projects such as Egbema NAG/AG Gas plants, Ughelli East, Ughelli West and Utorogu Gas Projects (3Us) which will remove flares from different flow stations. We also progress NLNG Central Control Room upgrade project near completion. We ensured very consistent and steady growth. Previously concluded projects such as Utorogu NAG2 for ND Western/NPDC JV which delivers 150 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscfd), are kept up and running among other projects</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your projects?</h4><p>Our major projects involve installation of gas handling and processing plants. Nigeria flares a lot of gas which is a drain on the economy as well as being hazardous to the environment and lives, therefore the decision to reverse this trend. We have contributed significantly in this regard. We have the Utorogu NAG2, 150MMscfd natural gas handling and processing facility, the Bonny AG, 5MMscfd gas project, and the Adibawa AG, 5MMscfd gas project. Other projects such as Alakiri Non Associated Gas, Egbema Associated Gas and Non Associated Gas processing plants and Ughelli East, Ughelli West and Utorogu Plants are in process at different stages of completion.</p><h4>To what extent does gas factor into your operations? </h4><p>At the commencement of our operations, we started with metering contracts, we have since scaled up as an EPICOM company with our foot print majorly in the building of gas plants; we are twenty one years this year in the Oil and Gas Industry. The shift from being an Automation, Instrumentation and Controls company to an EPICOM is as a result of the vision of the pioneer Group Managing Director, Oluseyi Makinde, whose ambition is to have an organization that can be benchmarked to international standards, true to that dream, MAKON is ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 &amp; OHSAS 18001:2007 certified.  </p><h4>How challenging has it been to deal with high interest rates and inflation rates?</h4><p>Our contracts are denominated in naira and dollars. For the dollar component, interest rates are near single-digit, and we try not to be particularly exposed to naira because rates can be volatile.</p><h4>Going forward, will debt continue to fund further growth? </h4><p>Like I said earlier debt is cheaper than equity, so we will still depend on debt for our operations, as a private company we endeavor to be prudent to keep our cost at reasonable levels. I will not be able to disclose to you if we are considering being listed on the stock exchange right now.</p><h4>How do you assess investment sentiment and activity in Nigeria's oil and gas sector?</h4><p>There is a lot going on in the industry. The government is determined to reduce the burden on its cash calls; this is made clear in the budget assumptions, and we expect that the move will result in public private partnership in a bid to self-fund projects.  I feel excited by this move because it would afford creativity in our approach to business. That's why we see much on the horizon for us, making time for strategic thinking and paying attention to what the government has planned for the rest of the year. There are so many upcoming projects in gas, which is our area of focus. Moreover, Nigeria still has an estimated 165 trillion standard cubic feet of gas including 75.4 trillion standard cubic feet of non-associated gas. We certainly have ample opportunity for our operations within the country.</p><h4>What contribution do you make to reducing gas flaring in Nigeria? </h4><p>Enormous, from the listed plants built by us we have a cumulative reduction of 300mmscfd of NAG and 15mmscfd of AG per day reduction in gas flare.</p><h4>What's your expectation for 2019?</h4><p>I foresee a bright future. Our slogan is “consolidate and expand," and we are looking to complete three major projects in 2019, with the possibility of signing on additional contracts. We want to ensure better brand visibility. We currently have a very good and strong brand which we intend to leverage on for better growth. We have a very strong workforce with tremendous competence in-house. We will also seek strategic partnership in areas where it is considered necessary. We are a local company with a global perspective.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Future is Golden]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[kerim-kemahli-cfo-nurol-holding]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Nurol Holding diversified its operations over the past decade?</h4><p>Since its creation, Nurol Holding's diversification has followed Turkey's economic growth story. For example, the group diversified into tourism when the tourism industry was just beginning to bloom, and invested in an investment bank in the early 1990s as the banking and finance sector was experiencing growth. Over the past 10 years this strategy has changed because of the inherent problem with such policy. We thus adopted a more strategic mode of planning further diversification, as evidenced in our defense sector investments. Nurol started its involvement in the defense sector in 1989 through a joint venture with a US defense company then known as FMC, which has since been bought by BAE, which remains our partner. At the time, the Turkish armed forces wanted to develop a fleet of armored personnel carriers called the M113, which FMC agreed to produce in Turkey with Nurol. That partnership eventually became known as FNSS, of which Nurol is currently a 51% shareholder with BAE holding the remaining 49%. That project was extremely profitable, and at that time Turkey was starting to push growing the indigenous defense industry to the top of the national agenda, so we began to further expand our presence in the sector. First, we set up another 100% Nurol subsidiary, Nurol Makina (Nurol Machinery) to create components for FNSS. In time, Nurol Machinery started its own research and development and began producing its own vehicles as well, under the understanding between FNSS and Nurol Machinery wherein FNSS would produce tracked, 8x8, and 6x6 vehicles and it would leave the field for 4x4's for Nurol Machinery.</p><h4>Outside of vehicles, how is Nurol further involved in the defense sector?</h4><p>Turkey has been and remains a big purchaser of international defense products, but it has long been growing its indigenous industry to maximize local content, including armor. Before we decided to enter the armor sector we invested around USD100 million into R&amp;D to design and produce armor that is around 60% lighter than traditional steel armor. Now produced under a third defense company, Nurol Technologies, our armor uses boron carbides and silicon carbides ceramics joined together to make plates which are lighter, and more durable and protective. It is chiefly used in body armor, but it has also been a big success when used in armored vehicles as well as civilian vehicles because of the need to be light so as not to change the performance of the vehicle. Only the US, China, and Germany have this technology, and we have been able to sell it so far to 27 countries. Those three companies make up the majority of our defense business, but we are also beginning to work in the aerospace industry. Turkey has begun a program to build its own indigenous fighter jet program, known as the TF-X. The government has mandated BAE UK to do the concept design, but has also required that the jet be as locally produced as possible, which will further develop the broader aerospace industry in Turkey. As a result, we set up a subsidiary in Turkey where we will design such software as the flight, fuel, and landing management systems that can go into that aircraft. The subsidiary, BNA, is a joint venture with BAE, which has been operational now for two years. Since the TF-X program is a long-term proposition, in the meantime BNA is looking at work in the civilian aviation sector as well. BNA wants to produce software for Turkey's civilian helicopter and civilian training airplane programs, and is now bidding for the electronic systems for those civilian programs.</p><h4>How quickly is your defense sector business growing? </h4><p>In 2017, 32% of our turnover was from defense-related work, and in 2018 it rose to 34%, while for 2019 we project it at 46%, and reaching as high as 60% in 2023. Along with growth in our mining business, our defense business will continue to become increasingly important for turnover, while our construction business will remain at more or less the same turnover levels as today. Construction accounted for 58% of turnover in 2017 and fell to 51% in 2018, not so much because of the pickup in the defense business, but because our mining turnover was just beginning. In 2019, construction turnover will be reduced to 37% and then by 2023 we expect it to decline to around 23% of our turnover.</p><h4>When did you begin exporting defense products?</h4><p>After we fulfilled the original order for M113s, the Turkish army no longer had a need for additional armored vehicles. Either we were going to fold the company because it had no business, or else look for export markets, and so we made two decisions at that point. One was to push for export markets and the other was to develop our own wheeled vehicles to meet the growing demand for them in lieu of tracked vehicles. Meeting the second goal, we started developing our own 6x6 and 8x8 vehicle production capabilities. We were extremely successful in developing these products, which has been evidenced by our export growth. No army just says I want to buy an FNSS product or a Nurol Machinery product, they get the whole range and test them in their own environment. Our vehicles had been tested against all of these different products in the market, and we continue to win business because our vehicles are just as good, if not better than anything else in the market in their own category. We were extremely successful with that, and grew the export market by basically providing the best product available at the best price. FNSS has sold products to Oman and Malaysia. Meanwhile, with Nurol Machinery, which produces our 4x4 vehicle, we have been hugely successful in the African market.</p><h4>Do you work with other countries to help them develop their own indigenous defense capabilities?</h4><p>Yes. Just like Turkey, Indonesia also wants an indigenous defense sector, so it was required for a local company to be involved in the development of the medium weight tank program they sought. When we became partners with the state-owned defense manufacturing company, the product was developed here in Turkey with additional assembly taking place in Indonesia. We have a similar model with Oman, which wants a certain level of localization, albeit to a lesser extent. In general defense sector companies do not prefer to have manufacturing facilities outside their own country as there is considerable confidential R&amp;D involved. Sometimes the customer requires it and you have to find innovative ways to share what you can of your business in order to secure the contract, which is why we have these local activities.</p><h4>What other markets are you looking to expand your defense business into?</h4><p>The European market would be really exciting for us. Defense is a strange business and you never know where the demand will come from next, as it is usually depends on areas of conflict. At the moment, we see that Africa need considerable defense products to better equip themselves against terrorism threats, and currently have underdeveloped vehicle fleets. These African armies are keener on the 4x4 vehicles, so Nurol Machinery focuses on that continent. For FNSS, we are looking at the Latin American and South East Asian markets. Because our partner is BAE USA we have to be aligned with USA defense policy, which has restrictions on whom they can sell to. In addition, BAE has its own land platform, and FNSS focuses on markets where BAE is not active. Nurol Machinery doesn't have such a non-compete clause with anyone and can go anywhere.</p><h4>Looking to mining, what is the status of your precious mineral mining operations?</h4><p>Our gold mine in Lapseki is already operational and producing between 5,000 and 6,000 ounces of gold per month. Our feasibility study had projected the mine producing around 4,000—5,000 ounces per month, and so we are exceeding our own forecast. This is the first mine in Turkey that entirely abides by international standards, and the project financing is from a consortium of banks including EBRD, which has strict environmental and social impact policies. Our other gold mine is in Ivrindi and is expected to be operational within six months as we are 70% complete in our investment. These two mines use different types of technologies; one uses tank leaching and the other heap leach. In short, tank leaching requires you to put ore in a tank and treat it with certain chemicals to extract the gold, where the heap leach technique, depending on the geology, is where you dump the ore across a vast area and then sprinkle the chemicals on top. The heap leach technique requires a lot more tonnage of ore processing  to obtain the same volume of gold. That said, our Ivrindi operations are expected to produce around 10,000 ounces of gold per month using the heap leach technique. For our mining operations, our production costs (including financing costs) are at about USD550 per ounce, so at today's gold prices that equates to a minimum 55% EBITDA margin, which is excellent. The 2018 turnover with only six months of operations of the smaller facility was USD57.59 million, and this year will rise to over TRY1 billion. The mining share of the total business turnover in 2018 was only 4%, and will rise to 9% in 2019 and 14% in 2020. This is while defense business sales are exponentially growing, so you can see the impact of the mine business on total turnover.</p><h4>What are the most exciting construction projects you are working on?</h4><p>We have our construction business largely involves infrastructure projects. On the contracting side our biggest project is the Istanbul to Izmir motorway, where we are also the 27% investor and consortium leader of the PPP toll road project. This involved building the world's fourth longest suspension bridge of around 2.7km in total length. The motorway project also has Turkey's longest motorway tunnel, which took us 2 years to drill, which is 10 years less than Turkey's second longest motorway tunnel took. This is an USD7 billion project, for which the consortium took out Turkeys largest ever project finance loan just shy of USD5 billion. At the moment we are around 85% complete, with completion expected by October 2019. Overseas our biggest business is in Algeria where at the moment we are building two irrigation dams and a highway between Ouzou and Tizi. Our total contract value in Algeria is around EUR1 billion, and increases every year as in Algeria they have a system of starting the project small and then raising it by a certain amount each year. In the UAE we mainly have high rise building contracts, and are involved in several interesting projects in Dubai, plus certain infrastructure work in Abu Dhabi. Otherwise in Turkey we have road, viaduct, dam and metro tunnel projects nationwide.</p><h4>Over the next 12 months, what are your top operational objectives?</h4><p>For 2019 our first objective is to finish the motorway and secondly to open the second mine facility, which hopefully will be just as successful as the first. Our biggest challenge next year will be to make sure that the second mine performs as well as the first.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Doing Business: Qatar]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ali-bin-ahmed-al-kuwari-minister-commerce-and-industry]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar has improved its ranking on several indicators of the Doing Business report by the World Bank. What are the major factors behind this improvement?</h4><p>Qatar has undertaken several measures to improve its ranking in terms of ease of doing business by reducing the number of procedures and time required to start a business, introducing a one-stop shop to streamline foreign investment applications, providing greater support for international investors throughout all stages of their applications and offering consumer credit scores to banks, financial institutions, and borrowers. Qatar has also abolished the paid-in minimum capital requirement for limited liability companies and exempted invested foreign capital from income tax for up to 10 years, for specific investment projects. These measures have resulted in improved rankings when it comes to the Starting a Business or Access to Credit Information indicators. Furthermore, Qatar has issued new laws and introduced amendments to existing legislation to attract and encourage domestic and foreign investments. These include amendments to the Investment Free Zones Law and a draft law regulation for the Investment of Non-Qatari Capital in Economic Activity, which allows up to 100% foreign investment in all economic and trade activities. At present, Qatar is in the process of drafting a public and private partnership law to pave the way for the launch of several investment projects.</p><h4>The International Monetary Fund forecasts a growth rate of around 2.6% in 2018 and also in the upcoming years. How has the ministry managed to orchestrate an effective response to the blockade and guarantee Qatar's growth?</h4><p>Ensuring the continuous flow of goods and commodities to Qatar has always been one of the government's priorities. We had plans, strategies, and projects that were formulated several years ago to overcome any regional or global economic crises and ensure the flow of goods, services, and food products to all citizens and residents without any interruptions. After the illegal blockade was imposed on Qatar in June 2017, Qatar utilized its world-class facilities such as Hamad Port and Hamad International Airport, and its hi-tech logistics capability, to mobilize existing regional agreements with Kuwait, Iraq, Oman, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Azerbaijan, and Central Asia. Qatar has undertaken several investment projects to cement public-private partnerships. Within the framework of these projects, the state has launched an initiative to establish four aquaculture projects. The government has issued licenses to establish four greenhouse agricultural projects to produce 80,000 tons of fresh vegetables and fruits each year, at a production rate of 20,000 tons per year for each project. Qatar has also completed the first phase of a program aimed at maintaining a strategic stock of food supplies and feed, whereby the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has built a stockpile to cover the strategic needs of the state.</p><h4>What other initiatives can we expect to increase the overall competitiveness of Qatar worldwide?</h4><p>Qatar has introduced an array initiatives and projects designed to foster a competitive and investment-friendly business environment and bolster the country's infrastructure, human capital, and international relations. For example, to increase the size and share of exports of non-hydrocarbon goods and services, Qatar has developed a high-standard end-to-end supply chain that enhances Qatar's export competitiveness and cultivates its market positioning regionally and globally. We are also developing a public-private partnership framework, including the law, governance mechanisms, and implementation tools. In a short time, all will be in place to open a new chapter for private project finance initiatives in Qatar. These initiatives have resulted in the nation achieving advanced positions in the latest Global Competitiveness Index. Globally, Qatar ranks first in terms of low inflation rates, sixth in terms of the effect of taxes on competition, eighth in terms of venture capital availability, and ninth in terms of financing SMEs, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2018.</p><h4>What is your message to any investor or entrepreneur considering to start a business in Qatar, and what is your overall outlook for 2019?</h4><p>Qatar is a country with a prime strategic location, excellent transport connectivity, and a favorable business environment that offers opportunities and incentives across a variety of economic sectors. We all know that the world's trade focal point is moving east, from Europe to Asia. Qatar is ideally situated to enable investors to capture the opportunities arising from this significant change. We are located at the heart of the Europe, Asia, and Africa triangle. We are capitalizing on this strategic location by developing a superior logistics infrastructure and assets. These include a world-class airport which will soon achieve a passenger capacity of 50 million people. The nation's flag carrier, Qatar Airways, serves more than 150 destinations. Furthermore, the newly-opened Hamad Port, a USD7.4-billion project, will be able to accommodate up to 7.5 million containers in the future, with the potential for further expansion. The port currently accounts for 27% of regional trade in the Middle East. Due to its massive mineral reserves, Qatar is the world's largest LNG exporter and has the largest gas-to-liquid facility in the world. In terms of downstream products, we have an extremely competitive petrochemicals industry and we are the world's largest exporter of helium, and fourth largest producer of urea. With all this in mind, the nation's outlook will remain positive, driven by a competitive business environment that will be further bolstered by far-reaching reforms and the government's infrastructure investment push in preparation for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. We expect to achieve the same growth rate in 2019. Thanks to Qatar's ability to reroute its trade, we expect to have a trade surplus and low inflation rate in 2019. Qatar's foreign trade increased by 16% by the end of 2017 to reach USD103 billion compared with USD89 billion in 2016, while exports increased by 18% to USD67 billion in 2017 compared to USD57 billion in 2016. This resulted in a trade surplus of 49.9% in 2017, rising from USD25.18 billion in 2016 to USD37.75 billion in 2017. I would like to invite local and international entrepreneurs and investors to invest in Qatar and grow with us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities do you see for the medical cannabis sector in Colombia, specifically Khiron?</h4><p>Colombia is active now, and the government is positive about opening up markets. Up until now, it has only approved medical and not recreational use, but Khiron is leading in the medical segment; these are young millennials with an aggressive vision for the future, which is why I see it moving quickly. In all my visits, where it has been legalized, I see two leaders: Canada and Colombia. Mexico is a close third and has accelerated its pace with the change of government. The former government was hesitant and slow and put medical use under pressure. The new government is liberal and is clearly promoting a change.</p><h4>How have you seen a change of perception of cannabis as a medical tool in Colombia and Latin America?</h4><p>In my time in government, there was no other choice than prohibition and illegal markets, so there was no evaluation of what happened before. It only developed the use for illegal purposes, which really complicated the situation in Mexico and generated extreme violence, especially given the product's transit from Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela heading north, a migration that included all drugs. That brought a very tough war to Mexico. It was not until recent times, after I left government and became an activist promoting openness and the legalization of markets, that legalization as a trend has gained a lot of traction. Since this will not go backwards, we are all getting ready to accelerate the development of the market.</p><h4>Beyond the personal medical benefits, what is the larger socioeconomic impact that a robust medical cannabis industry could have for a country like Colombia? </h4><p>There are great opportunities ahead, especially with medical use because the investment in research of medicines and legal drugs is impressive, and billions of dollars are being invested to improve the different uses of the plant. This is bringing in new solutions and response to patients and consumers. Colombia and Canada are leading in medical usage, and this change of paradigm is moving it out of underground illegal crime and the hands of criminals and putting it into the hands of entrepreneurs, farmers, and businessmen, a total change for the better. That is the change you see when you move from prohibition to an open legal market as the investment flows become credible and companies are put under professional management. A veritable revolution has occurred, and people in the industry are behaving extremely well with a high sense of responsibility and imposing codes of ethics and standards of quality. After so many years underground, it is just like any industry today.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the economic impact?</h4><p>Once it is a part of a normalized economic sector, you get farming, harvesting, processing, manufacturing, commerce, and trade, all of which bring in job creation and space for innovation and creativity, not to mention a lot in tax revenue. Everything is proving to be great, and I have been recommending all those who are setting up the new NAFTA rules to consider this economic sector as a critical part of the pact, as it needs to be standardized. For those leading countries and economies that decide to take the step forward and participate in this business, more and more are getting public opinion support, and those who were once afraid are now accepting because we have been watching after the markets. In the countries that have opened up, only good things have happened.</p><h4>What lessons can other countries learn from Colombia's approach toward the development of the sector?</h4><p>Like everything else in economic development, you look at the markets that are already open and legal and chart their relative successes and failures. It is excellent to take advantage of all these experiences, and this is where I have been active. I would put a strong word of caution that this industry needs to be more responsible than others because one mistake or bad company could spoil it for everybody. The credibility of this industry has yet to be granted, so people must remain on their best behavior. I came to Khiron because of that. We have identified both of our positions in the industry and are like twin souls with strong principles, values, and ethics on the way that we look at it. We are not here only to make money and serve customers, but to solve patients' problems. When you have that target then everything flows correctly, which is what is happening. Khiron has very strong ethical standards so we will work with all the producers with several purposes in mind. One is to keep a high reputation for the industry and make sure that we do not have bad corporations in the industry. Another purpose is to expand the industry at a very dynamic pace. We first need to grow the size of the pie and then each competitor will take its share. Right now we are working for the industry more than our own specific company. We have to confirm and organize the industry and have associations of producers, manufacturers, and retailers so that we have a common united front to work with the authorities. This is a highly regulated industry so it will need an organized industry to fight for the good things.</p><h4>What is your message for other political leaders, particularly in Latin America, who remain opposed to any type of legalization?</h4><p>This is an irreversible trend and is not what it used to look like. The industry is vastly different when conducted by professionals and university graduates than by criminals. Third, I would tell leaders everywhere to be close to the markets and learn what is going on. In these 10 years, I have never heard of anyone dying from cannabis; on the other hand, billions have perished from alcohol, sugar excess, and cigarettes. This industry is working with a great sense of responsibility. What we need most is favorable public opinion.</p><h4>What opportunities should Mexico take advantage of with trade partners outside of the US?</h4><p>Mexico is the most open country in the world, with 48 trade agreements. Our trade balance with the US and Canada is impressive, at nearly USD1 trillion, the largest in the world. We are an open economy and promote open trade with no restrictions. We have had the change with Trump, who came in and disrupted in a negative way by working with a completely ignorant economic position by forgetting that trade is a win-win situation for both economies. He is totally wrong with his position, which poses a serious threat to Mexico's development. This is why we are already working with new partners on new trade deals. Fortunately, after negotiations and discussions we reached a new NAFTA for what will hopefully be the next 25 years, though merely a week later this crazy guy Trump was threatening everything again and saying he would close the border for automobile imports and impose tariffs. We have to be on guard at all times now and keep the diversification process.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for Mexican companies and investment in Colombia?</h4><p>We used to have a trilateral agreement between Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela, which Venezuela unfortunately left. Fortunately, however, we still have our own agreement between Colombia and Mexico, and trade among us is growing trade every year. We have a great friendship and working relationship from which we are benefiting. Right now, for instance, Khiron is going to be using the model already tested in Colombia in Mexico, so I hope Colombia keeps its pace of growth.  That is why Colombia, Peru, Chili, and Mexico will be Khiron's target growth markets in 2019.  </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2019?</h4><p>For next year we see possibly that the US economy will go down which immediately effects Mexico and all of Latin America. We do not have high expectations for growth next year because of that reason, although Mexico has a very strong economic position together with the United States and Canada. We also have the strongest and largest manufacturing cluster in the region, larger than the rest of Latin America. Mexico is very competitive,  has a very strong economy that always respects the fundamentals with interest and inflation rates under control. This gives us the guarantee for a good future ahead but we have two big problems in corruption and violence. They are linked together because the cartels are so strong economically speaking that they can corrupt government authorities, municipalities, governors, and members of the armed forces. It is very difficult to compete with the powerful cartels that operate in Mexico, as they get from the US market USD55 billion. This makes them more powerful than many economies in Latin America, and we have to compete with that which is the challenge that Mexico has to overcome. Legalization will be very helpful in the fight against the drug cartels as taking the plant away from them is part of the solution and through legalizing cannabis we will be stopping crime, violence, and cartels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the drivers behind your decision to enter the Lagos market with E-Fitness?</h4><p>The current fitness, health, and beauty trends worldwide have showcased a blend between aesthetics and technology. This growing field has been delivering outstanding results. Here at E-Fitness we aspire to be pioneers of aesthetic technology in Nigeria and we have achieved this by being the first to introduce cutting edge technologies in the Lagos market such as Fat Freezing, EMS, and Styku 3D body scanning.  </p><h4>How do you plan to further scale your business in Nigeria and what are your expansion plans in terms of geographic locations or services?</h4><p>Our team is always scouting for the latest technological trends in health, fitness and beauty.  We, at E-Fitness will surely be expanding geographically by adding new branches and growing our portfolio of services by introducing new machines and technologies.</p><h4>How would you assess the process of setting up a business in Nigeria? Are you already seeing return on your investment?</h4><p>Setting up a business in general requires a good business plan, thorough execution and appropriate on-going management. Nigeria definitely has its specific challenges and setting up E-Fitness in Nigeria didn't prove to be an easy venture. One of the most difficult challenges was creating awareness about the services we provide. In terms of return on investment (ROI), this business is looking promising.

		<title><![CDATA[Dubai's Healthcare Future]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-mohaymen-m-abdelghany-ceo-al-zahra-hospital]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your range of health services evolved in recent years, and what are the main reasons behind this evolution of services?</h4><p>We have experienced considerable growth since we began operations in 2013 and in 2017 were statistics showed the hospital to be among the top three in Dubai in terms of patient activities. This is a remarkable achievement with less than five years of operation and illustrates the diversification strategy we are actively pursuing at Al Zahra. Fundamental to this diversification strategy is the development of centers of excellence within different specializations. An example is our fully-fledged program for obesity, which includes bariatric services both surgically and medically, it is accredited by both the European Board of Bariatric Surgery. Additionally, we have an advanced center for minimal invasive gynecology surgeries focusing on pelvic and female diseases such as endometriosis and gynecological disorders. The center is accredited by the surgical review committee of the US. We have lately got a third Center of Excellence in orthopedics &amp; sports injuries accredited by the prestigious Joint International. We are in the discovery phases of further developing centers of Excellence cancer, oncology, and gastroenterology. These centers offer best-in class services and differentiate the hospital and help define our growth strategy. And this is reflected by the increase of patients who seek treatment with us.</p><h4>What is your assessment of other gaps in the market or opportunities and challenges in the healthcare industry?</h4><p>From a supply and demand perspective, some services are notably over served while others remain underserved. In particular, more beds need to be added in Dubai for adults and pediatrics, which require access to critical care services. Moreover, even though supply has increased in the market, long-term care, palliative care, and rehab services are still underserved. These challenges are exacerbated by labor challenges such as the acquisition, onboarding, and retention of overseas talent. Al Zahra believes in continuously developing our staff and has implemented a system whereby we efficiently manage, support, and engage with our employees. As investors in people, we were recently accredited by the UK-based Investors in People organization at the gold level. This has been instrumental in reducing our staff turnover, which is now below 3%. Adopting a healthy people management system ensures that we have the healthcare professionals we need to meet the growth of key services. This growth includes adding more beds and increasing capacity at our facilities. A holistic retention strategy pays dividends, as staff are an integral asset of a hospital environment, and a contented workforce will inevitably lead to a positive patient experience.</p><h4>Is healthcare becoming more of an attractive industry for local talent?</h4><p>There are a significant number of Emiratis deployed across different areas of the healthcare ecosystem, with administration areas typically seeing a healthy supply from the domestic talent pool. We have also observed a steady supply of highly qualified local doctors and nurses, and we have number of them working for us on a full-time basis, which is typically not common for private healthcare. Others, meanwhile, work in different engagements, whether it is community based or part-time arrangements. Emirati doctors come from excellent educational backgrounds and have had access to high-quality training, which is reflected in the performance we have observed with the local doctors leading some of our clinical divisions. We have an ambitious strategy in place to get more Emirati doctors onboard in 2019.</p><h4>What are your initiatives to tackle lifestyle-related diseases here?</h4><p>This is a global issue; our modern lifestyles are significantly more sedentary, with fewer activities and increased access to unhealthy food options. The healthcare system along with Dubai Health Authority (DHA), and public and private hospitals are advocating a policy of 'prevention is better than cure.' We seek to create further awareness by going to schools, colleges, and universities to engage with the youth and explain the impact of unhealthy lifestyle choices. Conducting screenings at our hospitals and during outreach programs is major component of the awareness drive. Interestingly, we hold a Guinness World Record for the maximum number of cholesterol screenings in eight hours at one of our outreach programs in a major Dubai mall. This involved 100 nurses and 20 doctors and over 2,400 participants, and the goal was to inform the public on the dangers of high cholesterol. With regards to treatment, we have a heart attack center open 24/7 with patients for chest pain issues and a door-to-needle benchmark of 90 minutes. We have 24/7 availability of interventional cardiologists and the arrangements to meet these issues. Additionally, our diabetes center helps manage requirements, including insulin pumps and educating patients. The creation of awareness works both at the prevention as well as the treatment levels.</p><h4>How do we create better value in the healthcare ecosystem in the UAE?</h4><p>Healthcare costs are increasing globally, and in 10-15 years this will be unsustainable. Healthcare amounts to around 20% of the GDP of the US, and patients globally are becoming more aware about how much they pay for treatment when they tally costs or analyze insurance premiums. Dubai has stepped up efforts to create better cost effectiveness; DHA has a KPI program that monitors outcomes such as length of stay, re-admission, or complications experienced. These are all reported and analyzed to establish better outcomes, while hospitals are will soon be given a rating system that allows patients to be informed on the value to expect. The project is in its infancy stage, and when it matures, it should deliver greater cost effectiveness across the entire healthcare system to provide sustainability.</p><h4>How do you see Dubai's reputation as a medical tourism hub developing?</h4><p>Dubai has an encouraging outlook for health tourism, with an expected 500,000 medical tourists by 2020. According to the Dubai Medical Tourism Council, we have reached over 300,000 medical tourists, with many coming from the other Emirates, other GCC countries, Africa, or other parts of the world. To be more attractive, we need to create better cost effectiveness without compromising quality. This will allow us to compete against other healthcare destinations. There is an initiative run by the tourism council in conjunction with major private health providers whereby packaged solutions are combined to make medical tourism easier. There are partnerships with major hotels, regional airlines, and hospitals. This is part of the wider Dubai Health experience (DXH) platform, which was inaugurated by HH Sheikh Handan and has been growing in momentum since.</p><h4>How will AI transform the healthcare industry as a whole, and where will this add the greatest value to patients' lives?</h4><p>AI is disrupting many industries globally with healthcare being heavily influenced; however, the industry remains reliant on human interaction. In diagnostics, we see significant benefits with the use of algorithms that allow greater precision, enhanced capabilities, and a reduction in screening time. Technology is rapidly evolving alongside machine learning, and there are now robots that can adjust to the personal traits and habits of particular surgeons. This happens automatically without significant adjustment and readjustment. Knowledge mining is also redefining healthcare; we can access a huge pool of data for research and treatment purposes through blockchain with increased confidentiality. Furthermore, chat bots allow patients to establish dialog with a learning machine that can address their medical queries. Dubai is at the forefront of AI and has the willingness and conviction harness its benefits.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Over 50% of Revenues from Overseas]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[daniel-araujo-ceo-asseco-pst]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key achievements and milestones during the company's evolution in Portugal?</h4><p>Our first key milestone was that we were the first and only core banking software firm that was ever founded in Portugal. Another key achievement of our company is the fact that two years after our inception in 1988, we became an international firm. From the very beginning of our firm we were focused on pursuing an active international expansion.</p><h4>What makes Asseco unique for its global and Portugal operations?</h4><p>The core component is that we have been working in the financial sector for approximately 30 years; this enabled us to followed the evolution of the sector over the last three decades. As far as differentiation is concerned, the global nature of our group allows us to leverage the experience of member companies present in other markets. We, Asseco PST, are present in eight markets, Asseco Group is present in more than fifty countries and this enables us to gain knowledge from other markets and bring it to Portugal.</p><h4>What are the main directions and areas of focus for the group's R&amp;D efforts?</h4><p>There are a variety of focuses, including the internet of things, digitalization, AI, cybersecurity and many other areas. Our aim is to continue working very actively in these areas and continue our investment so as to try to capture opportunities that will naturally arise as some of these technologies become more widely implemented.</p><h4>How would you asses the company's financial performance?</h4><p>In Portugal, we have been doing extremely well for the past several years, and this is also true globally. If we were to dissect our latest turnover levels, we have to remember that even though Asseco PST is based in Portugal, more than 50% of our revenues come from overseas. Besides Portugal, we also have operations in Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Sío Tomé and Prí­ncipe, Namibia, Malta, and East Timor.</p><h4>Which line of banking IT services generate the most revenue?</h4><p>If you look at our entire portfolio, you see that we are an end-to-end provider for banks. Some of these banks have been with us for a long time, and we can provide products and services that range from core banking systems to internet banking or mobile apps. Establishing and running the core banking systems is naturally an area of heavy investment, particularly because regulation has a large impact on this area, and there are constant changes occurring. Digital transformation projects have also become a very important part of our offer and a significant source of our company revenue.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in the IT sector in Portugal?</h4><p>We have witnessed several changes in the Portuguese tech sector over the last five years. Big players have all moved into the country, which puts a huge demand on talent. The fact that the Portuguese economy is not producing as many software engineers as the market demands only increases this pressure. We were originally founded in Funchal, Madeira, and we still keep our main software development center there. We have around 150 employees in Funchal and approximately 200 in Lisbon. As far as opportunities are concerned, I would say that in Portugal, like in many other Western European countries, there are many opportunities related to Digital Transformation projects. GDPR has also been a great opportunity this year and, specifically in the financial sector, there will be opportunities in fields related to open banking and PSD2.</p><h4>Are you planning to widen your areas of focus even further? </h4><p>At present, our idea is to have as broad a portfolio as the general Asseco group has, which is really A-Z offering of services. We will try to engage opportunities that arise across the market in Portugal and in the many markets in which we are present. Our group is also actively looking for opportunities for growth via acquisition. We love great opportunities, and we are looking to engage with them.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the talent evolving through your training program, Asseco Academy?</h4><p>You have to remember why we created the academy in the first place. This was focused more on the Portuguese speaking markets we operate in rather than on Portugal itself. While there is a shortage of qualified talent in Portugal, there is an ever-greater shortage in some of the other markets where we also operate. We decided to create the Academy in order to engage with the sector as best we could so as to promote the available talent. This enabled us to help more people qualify so more opportunities could be developed. Overall, we consider this program to have been an excellent success.</p><h4>What does it mean for Asseco to have won the OutSystems Innovation Award?</h4><p>We invested a lot on our own internal systems, so we could increase our internal efficiency. We are extremely proud of this award because it reflects our sustainable developments toward greater efficiency.</p><h4>What is your goal for the next few years in order to utilize the company's new office?</h4><p>Before we opened this office, we had opened another office in Funchal where we had also doubled our capacity. Our goal is to continue engaging with our customers while also being on the lookout for new opportunities, which includes entering new markets. With the help of Asseco Group, we are looking at opportunities in Slovakia and other countries in central Europe where we think we have an interesting offer. Our growth has been such that we expect to need even more space in the coming years.</p><h4>How would you assess the potential for further growth in 2019?</h4><p>The growth perspectives are good, and we have interesting projects in the pipeline that will keep us busy until mid-2019. We are excited about 2019 for our operations in Portugal and international markets. Our main strength is that we consider ourselves to be one of the most experienced software company operating in the financial services sector in Portugal.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[25 Years in Jordan]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[hassib-sahyoun-founder-chairman-ceo-medlabs-consultancy-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main achievements over the past year, and where does the company stand after 25 years in operation?</h4><p>The biggest achievement for MedLabs Consultancy Group has been changing the culture of how medical laboratories are structured in Jordan and the region. Up until 1993, laboratories were always a one-man show operation. A specialist would open a lab and serve doctors and patients, but with limited scope and sustainability. Laboratory medicine encompasses several subspecialties and therefore Group Practice was needed to best serve Physicians and their patients. In 1993, MedLabs was able to create the first group practice in laboratory medicine. MedLabs Consultancy Group began with the amalgamation of four private laboratories headed by five doctors each with a different laboratory medicine subspecialties. Today 25 years later, MedLabs Consultancy Group has more than 50 laboratories in three countries—Jordan, Palestine, and Northern Iraq and a world standard Reference Laboratory in Amman. MedLabs employs more than 450 scientists, consultants and management professionals. It has achieved the highest international accreditation including the College of American Pathologists (CAP) accreditation, which is the gold standard for laboratory quality, the European ISO 15189 Laboratory Accreditation and the management ISO 2001-2009 certification. Locally, we were honored to be awarded the King Abdullah II Award for Excellence in 2011 and are currently accrediting all our branches with a world class Jordanian accreditation (HCAC).</p><h4>How does MedLabs Consultancy Group incorporate technological development and innovation into its operations?</h4><p>We work closely with international suppliers, and because of our high number of tests, we can justify introducing the most sophisticated equipment. There are several arms to our business, one is serving doctors and patients through our 50 laboratories and another is our reference lab that performs all the highly specialized tests, such as genetics, neonatal screening and surgical pathology that serves more than 150 referring laboratories from within the MedLabs group as well as local and regional non-MedLabs laboratories. Regionally we serve laboratories from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar, UAE, Palestine, and Sudan. These samples used to be sent to Europe or America, however, now that we have all the accreditation and are closer geographically and offer faster turnaround times, we are starting to see more referral business. A third service we offer is training for other laboratories that want to achieve accreditation. We have helped several labs in Jordan and the region raise their quality standards. Finally, MedLabs have been leaders in the region offering value-added services to patients such as a free house call service for sample collection, results online through our phone application and a loyalty program that encourages healthy behavior. The idea is to truly care for our patients and offer them a unique patient experience with MedLabs.</p><h4>What are MedLabs Consultancy Group's regional expansion plans?</h4><p>We are looking at different markets at the moment. Iraq is starting to recover and we already have four projects in northern Iraq, now we are considering expanding into other main cities in southern and central Iraq. In May 2017, we signed a soft loan agreement for USD2.5 million with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to create 10 major laboratories across the West Bank and later Gaza. We already had two small laboratories in Ramallah and Nablus, but we felt more was needed there. The first three of the new labs in the West Bank should be operational during the first half of 2019. There are also opportunities in Lebanon, Cyprus, and the Gulf.</p><h4>Is MedLabs Consultancy Group looking for more partnerships in Jordan and when you expand into new markets?</h4><p>When we go to new markets, we prefer to have local partners as we have done in northern Iraq. It helps significantly because there are local expertise and networking. MedLabs Consultancy Group has been approached many times by venture capital companies and other investors to either acquire or partner with MedLabs. This is not something we are looking for. We welcome investors, though not as controlling partners because we believe that our success is due to the fact that the Laboratory Medicine professionals are managing the business who come from the laboratory environment and know patients, doctors and community needs.</p><h4>How does MedLabs Consultancy Group contribute more broadly to the sophisticated health ecosystem in Jordan?</h4><p>Our first job in Jordan is to serve the doctors by providing them with accurate results to help them diagnose their patients. Also, over the last 10 years we have been running major preventative medicine campaigns. This has been extremely successful. The bulk of our patients 10 years ago were over 50 years old, now, 60% are below 50 years old because we have created awareness for the need to check one's own health on a regular basis. We contribute significantly to health awareness wherever we go. We also design checkups for different budgets and help financially with discounts to encourage people to have this done. Corporate Social Responsibility is also important to us at MedLabs. We helped an international organization screen 25,000 mothers and children for anemia. Recently, under the auspices of the Ministry of Health, we offered free Vitamin D testing at all 43 of our laboratories in Jordan collecting 15,000 samples in one day. We have conducted similar campaigns in the past for Vitamin B12, HbA1c (Diabetes), Ferritin (iron deficiency) and TSH (thyroid function) as a way to give back to the community and create greater health awareness.</p><h4>What would be your message to people looking to partner with MedLabs Consultancy Group, and what are the advantages of doing business in Jordan?</h4><p>MedLabs is a highly transparent company with clear goals and a deep sense of responsibility. We believe in excellence in what we do and how we serve our communities. One of the key assets in Jordan is the availability of highly qualified personnel in all fields including Laboratory Medicine. In Jordan, the regulations are clear, there are excellent human resources, there is stability and security in the country and its geographical location is strategic. Jordan has always served as a regional Medical hub. If you want to invest in this region, particularly in services such as health, education, and pharmaceuticals, Jordan should be one of your priorities. Jordan has many advantages; I encourage people to come and see for themselves.</p><h4>What developments can we expect from MedLabs Consultancy Group in the year ahead?</h4><p>Other than the horizontal local and regional expansions mentioned earlier, we also grow vertically. We are regional pioneers in neonatal screening and are currently introducing many advanced tests that have been unavailable in Jordan or the region, mainly in the field of genetics (such as whole genome sequencing). On a human resource development level, I believe that whether you are in Jordan or elsewhere in the world, over the last 20 to 30 years the way the capitalist systems have evolved, humanity has been thrown out the window in the workplace. Therefore, my message is to<em> bring humanity back to the workplace</em>. This is what we have done and are continuing to do in MedLabs. After all, the human element works the machines, applies the systems and serves the community. If your internal community is not happy, satisfied, motivated, trusted and empowered your organization will not be sustainable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tourism represents 12.5% of GDP. What does the Tourism Center of Portugal do?</h4><p>Our strategy, whether from the point of view of the internal market, and in particular from that of the external one, is based on five main axes. First, we are a cross-selling destination between Lisbon and Porto, and we have world heritage sites and destinations that are highly differentiated when it comes to nature tourism. On the one hand, then, we have heritage and culture, but on the other, many activities related to surfing and water sports, not to mention a growing number of activities like cycling and walking, and religious tourism, in particular Jewish tourism. These five axes— culture, surfing, walking, cycling, and religious tourism—are what we're staking our strategy on for attracting new markets such as Brazil, Canada, the US, and Asia.</p><h4>Over 20 million tourists now visit Portugal on an annual basis. How has this affected the country?</h4><p>We calculated there were nearly 6.5 million overnight stays in 2017, with growth coming mainly from Brazil, the Netherlands, Poland, and, naturally, the internal market, which will continue in 2019. Key points that influenced this were the visit of the Pope in 2017, which brought around one million visitors, the centennial celebration of the apparitions of Fatima, and increasing awareness around water sports and surfing through social media. However, it is worth remembering that for Fatima some of the most important markets were South Korea, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, Brazil, the US, Poland, and Israel.</p><h4>How do you describe a typical guest who chooses the region instead of others? </h4><p>Families with small children, especially those who like cycling, walking, surfing, and windsurfing, are increasingly choosing Portugal as their preferred destination. And in 2019 the center is hosting a world surfing championship that will only bring more.  </p><h4>How do you assess the furture of eco and rural tourism in Portugal?</h4><p>The Center of Portugal has high levels of rural tourism, and we have several examples of sustainable and environmentally responsible tourism. There is an eco-hotel with sustainable facilities, whose pest control, for example, is done internally by frogs. Portugal has more than 70 river beaches with blue flags, one of which, Mira, is the oldest blue flag beach in Europe, and a significant number with golden flags, which refers not just to the quality of the beach, but also of the environment and water, many of which are in isolated rural areas.</p><h4>What is a typical itinerary for a more high-end visitor?</h4><p>The Center of Portugal is not characterized by the existence of large hotel chains, our core is 'small is beautiful' and related to small family units and intimate friendships. When we talk about Areias do Seixo Hotel, Casas do Cor Hotel, H2O Hotel, or Vista Alegre, these are places where the customer is greeted as a family member and where the owners perform or oversee all services. Brands such as Vuitton, Maserati, and Vogue have done catalogs at these hotels. Casa do Cor is a typical example. Situated in a village, Marialva, in the heart of the Serra da Estrela, there are 35 rooms whose check-in and kitchen services are performed by the daughters of the owner. Portugal's best bet for the medium to premium segments is in this segment of small units with high levels of service.</p><h4>What are your goals for the coming year?</h4><p>We are working on positioning ourselves as a sustainable and healthy destination with inclusive, sustainable facilities for all ages. We want to reinforce our attraction, and reinforce our activities related to Catholic and Jewish tourism, as has happened in Santiago de Compostela. We are working with partners such as Spain to coordinate actions aimed at distant markets. For example, we have already worked with them on a heritage appreciation strategy, and want to be seen more as the heart of Iberia and less as the Center of Portugal. Altogether, we are redefining our international approach.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[chong-yee-mun-ceo-prince-court-medical-centre]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the implications of Prince Court's recent acquisition by Khazanah?</h4><p>The acquisition has not changed the philosophy of Prince Court in any way. Our focus areas have also remained unchanged, for example providing quality healthcare services with an emphasis on customer service. We are doing well with both foreign and local patients and want people to know that Prince Court Medical Centre is a hospital for Malaysians, expatriates, and international patients.</p><h4>What are the most important trends and developments transforming the healthcare sector?</h4><p>The biggest changes have been the internet and digital health. Digital health is a subset of the internet; the availability of knowledge is now so widespread, and it is not restricted to just specialists and doctors. This is a great development because it allows patients to be more informed and aware. Another trend is technological innovation, Prince Court is a leader in adopting and using new technologies, and we were among the first hospitals to use the da Vinci surgical robot. We acknowledge that the trend will increasingly move toward robotics, though we are waiting to see greater acceptance from insurance companies and the medical community as a whole. However, with the increasing use of technology and robotics in Healthcare, medical equipment is becoming even more specialized and more expensive resulting in increasing healthcare cost. Healthcare technology continues to develop, and we must ensure that we do not deprive people out of healthcare services as we head toward more robotics and innovation. Digital equipment and wearable technology will also continue to develop and will change especially, in primary healthcare.</p><h4>What needs to happen for Malaysia to develop further as a prime medical tourism hub in the region?</h4><p>We just need to put all of our ingredients together and cook them well. Malaysia has all the necessary ingredients to become a prime medical tourism destination. The general tourism industry offers a broad range of attractions, including urban cities, mountains, jungle, and beaches as beautiful as anywhere else if not more. In order for our medical tourism sector to develop, our general tourism must also take off. Thailand is a great example of a place that has a strong general tourism industry that transitioned into strong medical tourism. We are working with the public sector to determine the best way to develop medical tourism in Malaysia. Matters such as ease of visas to visit Malaysia for medical treatment should be addressed. Moreover, medical tourists often come with or as a family, so we should work towards attracting families. We can package our general tourism services with our healthcare tourism services to create the perfect mix. Healthcare standards in Malaysia are high while the charges are very reasonable in comparison with our neighboring countries which is a great incentive for medical tourism. We need to do a better job of presenting and creating awareness of such positive features to the market.</p><h4>What are the main source markets for foreign patients that come to PCMC, and which markets show signs of strong growth?</h4><p>We would like to stress that PCMC is a hospital for Malaysians, expatriates, and international patients. However, due to its quality clinical and service standards as well as its location, we receive tourists and travelers as well as expatriates from many different nationalities across the world. We have the most diverse patient load in the country. Patients from Indonesia, UK, US, and Japan are important markets for PCMC. We work closely with many Embassies to support their staff, their citizens working as expatriates in Malaysia as well as visitors and medical travelers. PCMC also attracts Singaporeans and expatriates from Singapore mainly because of Singapore's strong currency. We have catered to many large groups from China that are interested in health screening as well as our IVF services.</p><h4>How will you realize your vision of becoming a leading healthcare provider in Asia?</h4><p>For the last few years from 2016 to 2018, PCMC has been chosen by the Medical Travel Quality Alliance (MTQUA) to be among the World's Top Ten Hospitals for Medical Tourism and the Top in Malaysia. PCMC has many firsts among its services, and among them are: the first private hospital in Malaysia to have the da Vinci Robot for surgery; the first and still the only private hospital doing kidney transplant including ABO or incompatible transplant; the only private hospital to have a full-fledged Burns Unit; the first corneal transplant; and the only Dialysis Centre in Malaysia using beds and not recliners for the comfort of our patients. One of the frequent accolades from our patient is that PCMC does not look, feel or smell like a hospital. We have 'zen' areas within the hospital building itself which provide quiet and peaceful sitting areas where patients and their families can have peace of mind. One common grouse of hospital stay is the quality of food. PCMC is well known for the quality of our inpatient meals. We employ two 5-star hotel chefs who oversee our kitchen and every patient meal is cooked í  la carte. Despite being well established for the high quality of our clinical, nursing, and customer services, we will not rest on our laurels but will continue to strive to improve our services in all areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With a long-term perspective, how is Exeed Industries redefining its business model to increase efficiency in its used material and ensure a sustainable line of business?</h4><p>Industry in general is going through an important transformation and the construction and building industry is not insulated from this revolution. Today there are countless new building materials, or reinterpretations of existing materials that are bringing dramatic improvements in manufacturing processes, transport or installation costs, and of course in their quality and properties. Its novelty and competition is deeply transforming our industry, therefore at Exeed Industries we understand that the time has come to take advantage of its facilities. Of course we will continue using cement, steel, and chemical admixtures; however, for example, new nano-materials are filled with innovative possibilities in terms of design and performance. In terms of cost, five years ago it was impossible to think about producing at industrial scale, but today it is economical enough to design and manufacture products based on these materials. One interesting example is the Graphene. This nano-material manufacturing is based on graphite, whose biggest producer is China, who controls the flow of supply of this raw material globally. But new technologies are allowing for the production of graphene with other raw materials like oil coke. We are in a country that is rich with oil; therefore, if we can collaborate with and control the downstream areas of this industry, then we really have a major opportunity to produce innovative materials at a competitive price.</p><h4>How do you expect the supply chain of the industry to adapt to technologies such as 3D printing?</h4><p>Although it seems surprising, 3D printing has been around for 25 years and a relevant number of important industrial companies around the world are already employing to manufacture spare parts and consumables, with major impact on the traditional supply chain processes. It might have come a little late to the UAE, but recently there has been a serious political push to keep these technologies at the fore. However, for 3D printing to have an impact, it must support operations and reduce costs in a sustainable way, which is not always that easy. For example, if we talk about the building materials industry, 3D-printed concrete is an interesting new technology, meaning its effectiveness is yet to be proven. Undoubtedly, these technologies will dramatically reduce the amount of labor input required to produce concrete, and this labor reduction will be a major change in the whole industrial and economic model of countries. This is the future, but there is a great deal of trial and error left to work through. Right now, we have to invest in order to be prepared for this change. Invest in equipment and invest in people to change the mindset. Management should start to get used to think laterally in order to transform the business with the same speed to which it advances the technological development.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on how economies should adjust to the trends you mentioned in industrial construction?</h4><p>The public and private sectors have to shift from thinking about only efficiency to consider effectiveness as one of the main drivers of our future. The coordination and communication between the government and the corporate stakeholders is essential to make sure that change is effectively implemented. Simplifying communication, coordination and processes. In the absence of this, things will still change but it will be a much slower process. Education is another important area that requires much better coordination. Universities and institutes are a precious source of talent and we have to ensure that they are an active part of the process of affecting change on the ground. Only being leaders in innovation and adapting quickly to changes in the needs of the market we can achieve the goals that we have set ourselves. Investing in talent is investing in our future.</p><h4>How do you expect demand to evolve in Abu Dhabi and UAE market as far as building materials are concerned?</h4><p>We do use indicators such as market size and expected development, with some reports predicting around 5% growth in the construction industry over the next five years. However, I know that our target market will remain largely the same in the next few years and that the completion of projects will be higher. This means that even if the economy grows well, it will not be easy, and we must change our operations and our focus, which is why we are looking at exports that can grow the market substantially. There are good potential markets for our products in Africa, for example, and we will shortly go there to get a real feel for the business dynamics there. Africa is a vast continent in developmental terms, and we are eyeing opportunities in East, West, and Central Africa specifically. We are also keen to develop key partnerships with Companies who offer good synergies with the Exeed family. These are challenging yet exciting times to be in our business sectors. And whilst we look to the export markets for the future, we also note that the UAE construction industry continues to surprise the world with new and innovative solutions and designs. Exeed Industries is proud to be part of the industry in our home nation. And we remain confident that the UAE will continue to provide growth opportunities as more and more new developments are announced here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Progressive Telecoms Market]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[mohammed-ali-al-mannai-president-communications-regulatory-authority]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the competitive environment of the Qatari communications sector?</h4><p>Despite its small size, Qatar continues to be one of the most progressive telecom markets in the region, with the telecommunications identified as a key enabler of the country's economic diversification and sustainable growth outside of hydrocarbons. As the communications sector evolves and looks to support Qatar's National Vision 2030, open and fair competition has increasingly become important to encourage sustainable investment, growth, and success. CRA is working to ensure that the proper regulation and infrastructure is in place to create the right market environment and encourage competition to sustain a thriving Information and Communications (ICT) sector. The current healthy competitive environment that exists between the country's two service providers is a sign of the market's developing maturity. At the same time, increased competition in the mobile sector is having a positive impact for consumers in terms of reduced prices and increased service offerings. Meanwhile, increasing smartphone penetration is creating a larger market for apps, e-commerce, and other mobile web services. As consumer demand for telecommunications services continues to grow and mature, CRA is taking steps to ensure meeting this increased demand, through developing regulatory frameworks that reflect the continuously evolving structure of a converged ICT eco-system—one that depends on the availability of advanced fixed and mobile telecommunications networks. An in-depth analysis of the global ICT sector landscape indicates that the development of Qatar's telecommunications infrastructure is on par with that of comparable high-income countries.</p><h4>How is CRA cooperating with counterparts in other countries?</h4><p>CRA is highly active as a leader in the telecoms sector; we regularly attend leading world events to network, share knowledge and best practices, explore common challenges and partnership solutions, and understand the latest industry innovations. CRA coordinates with other regulators through its network and membership of the world's leading organizations such as ITU, UPU, and ICANN to discuss issues such as shared global use of the radio spectrum, international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, improving telecommunications infrastructure, development and coordination of worldwide technical standards, and the future direction of the postal sector.</p><h4>How will the early implementation of 5G technology affect the telecommunications sector?</h4><p>CRA has approved initial plans for frequency bands relating to Fifth Generation (5G) mobile service and it will be a reality in Qatar as of the beginning of January 2019. 5G will bring a new level of performance and characteristics to the telecom networks, enabling the creation of a wide range of new services, ecosystems, and revenue streams. While 5G promises some impressive download speeds, it will probably not make a great deal of difference to the average smartphone user streaming a video; the biggest impact from 5G is likely to be on the Internet of Things (IoT). In recent years, we have increasingly seen the growth of so-called cyber-physical systems particularly in industry, manufacturing, transport, health, and logistics. Furthermore, in these environments, there is increased automation and autonomous decision-making, and this is commonly referred to as Industry 4.0, not to mention self-driving cars and smart buildings and the health sector. With all of these objects connected to the Internet, considerable resources and bandwidth are needed to manage the colossal amounts of data that need to be gathered and analyzed in order to make these concepts a reality on a massive scale, and 5G has the potential to make this possible. I believe that 5G will create entirely new market opportunities not previously realized and entirely new business models will emerge as a result. One thing is for certain, faster Internet speeds lower the cost of innovation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will continue to initiate new projects, plans and infrastructure improvements in line with Qatar's 2030 vision of driving a knowledge-based information society. Looking forward to the year ahead, CRA will be working hard along with the stakeholders and service providers to deliver 5G mobile technology to the market in Qatar. In addition, CRA will continue its work towards the full transition from Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) to IPv6 before the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. CRA is part of the Global IPv6 Forum and to support this changeover CRA has developed Qatar's IPv6 Taskforce, which includes local stakeholders. IPv6 will enable higher levels of Internet security, contribute to the continuity of a robust connectivity across Qatar and will ensure the country's readiness for all new upcoming next generation technologies. In 2019, we will continue in close collaboration with the Ministry of Transport and Communications to develop the new Postal Law, and will work on developing key related regulatory instruments for postal regulation. A key aspect to consider within the new law is the significant decrease of traditional mail globally, but at the same time providing a model for the postal sector as an increasing part of the e-commerce and digital economy. We are also looking to future-proof the regulatory framework. We need to consider the entire digital ecosystem, promoting the readiness and openness of the wider sector and make it attractive to investors. We will perform a sector review in the coming year in order to further align our strategy with market developments with a focus on information technologies and emerging technologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What industries has Evonik identified as key in Mexico?</h4><p>Today, we have a major presence in a wide variety of sectors such as mining, automotive, and the animal nutrition and health businesses. The company has identified further opportunities for growth in the personal and household care, dental care, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, coatings and oil and gas segments as well. The automotive industry is an interesting area of opportunity for us because our presence in the sector coincides with many of our business lines, which allows us to offer an integrated approach. The same goes for oil, gas, and aerospace. Evonik is working with the Mexican authorities and regulatory institutions to implement new technologies that can support the production and development of gas pipes. When it comes to aerospace, Querétaro has one of the fastest growing hubs in the world today. It is roughly a USD20-billion industry in Mexico that Evonik can provide a wide variety of solutions to. As a global company, we benefit from seeing many of our global accounts in Mexico and setting up assets here. They want Evonik to support their business in Mexico the same way we do in other regions.</p><h4>How does doing business in Mexico differ from other markets?</h4><p>One of the biggest differences in Mexico is that many global players and key regional accounts invest more in local R&amp;D in comparison to their investments in other emerging countries, especially those involved with industries connected to manufacturing. This also due to the high level of quality that customers and companies expect from products and services. For this reason, it is important to not only rely on what is being developed in headquarters but we must also develop services and products adapted to the local needs. We also see companies investing in the Mexican talent pipeline. Companies such as Audi are developing programs with universities to develop local talent. It gives young students the opportunity to work and initiate their careers at an academic stage. Audi offers opportunities for Mexican students not only in Mexico but also in its facilities in Germany. To some extent, Evonik is developing in Mexico a similar program. We collaborate with universities in both Mexico and Germany to work in different areas of our organization through internships, and many of these students stay in the company after the program is finished.</p><h4>How will recent mergers and acquisitions affect Evonik's business model?</h4><p>Integrating recent acquisitions into our business model is one of our most important projects at the moment. We completed two important acquisitions in the US, one is the Performance Materials division of Air Products and the other is a producer of precipitated silica for dental care, J.M. Huber. These acquisitions will increase our product portfolio and our customer base in Mexico. J. M. Huber is a well-known and active American company in precipitated silicas, especially for the production of toothpaste. In this business, we will strengthen our partnership with Mission Hills and Procter and Gamble in Mexico, among others. We have been selected as the main supplier of all its necessary raw materials for the production of toothpaste. Mission Hills Mexico is the largest toothpaste manufacturing site of Colgate globally; from here, it serves the international markets. In addition to dental care, our products and technologies for the manufacturing of car seats will benefit the most from our other acquisition, particularly tier one and tier two automotive companies. The acquisition also benefits our coatings and additives business line, from which we serve companies like PPG Comex, one of our largest customers. So far in Mexico, both acquisitions have received positive feedback from our customer base. On top of these two projects, Evonik continues to target additional future acquisitions. By the end of 2018, Evonik Industries has signed an agreement with One Equity Partners to acquire US-based PeroxyChem, a manufacturer of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and peracetic acid (PAA). PeroxyChem will significantly strengthen our growth segment Resource Efficiency globally. We are expanding our portfolio of environmentally friendly and high-growth specialty applications. We are excited about the opportunity to join forces with PeroxyChem in Mexico and make our successful business even stronger. The complementary fit of the two businesses will unlock new and attractive growth opportunities for our customers and employees. We look forward to more to come in the next year. We are going through an interesting transformational phase, in which we are focusing even more on specialty chemical. Thanks to this new focus, our investments will now support strong organic growth in the specialty chemical segments in specific areas in Mexico.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans for your sodium cyanide JV subsidiary, Cyplus Idesa, in the medium term?</h4><p>We are pleased with the relationship and investment we have established with Idesa to create this JV. The silver and gold mining industry continues to be promising in Mexico. Cyplus is well positioned, as it is the only sodium cyanide manufacturing company in Mexico. If the market continues developing in a positive direction, and our customers believe more support is needed, there will be potentially opportunities to further expand and invest in Cyplus Idesa in Mexico. Our number-one priority is safety and sustainability in our business and our customers' business. We offer a large range of services and support to our customers in the handling and dosing of our product in the mining sector. We go beyond merely providing the product by collaborating with the technical and engineering departments of our customers. We want them to handle sodium cyanide in their operations as safely as possible. We collaborate with many players and partners in the industry to advocate for safety and are always exploring opportunities to engage with local players in the industry to eventually try to bring technologies and manufacturing sites to Mexico.</p><h4>What strategies does Evonik use to remain relevant in the petrochemical market?<a href="https://admin.thebusinessyear.com/Article/Edit/?Id=5c59326a86b7b01470b69142#"></a></h4><p>One of the major challenges in this respect is to find the right product for the right market and assuring access to local raw material. We are part of the North American platform and have a strong footprint in the US with manufacturing sites across the country. Our main focus today is optimizing our supply chain and logistics as much as we can to bring in new products. We look for new opportunities based on the market and the availability of partners and raw material. As to the supply of raw materials, we need a strong downstream of the petrochemical industry that is competitive and sustainable to make sure a production site in Mexico would be efficient. Depending on the segment and business line, Evonik also looks into global and regional businesses.</p><h4>How does Evonik plan to further consolidate its presence in Mexico?</h4><p>For the third year in a row, our company has seen double-digit growth. In 2018, we grew 20% volume-wise and more than 15% in terms of turnover, which is a result of our strong organic growth in many of our businesses and the realization of many projects with Mexican customers. The integration of our acquisitions is also a positive contributing factor. The rising middle class in Mexico also directly benefits all our business lines in Mexico, as the country has more purchasing power. This motivates more companies to enter Mexico, create jobs, and boost the well-being of the country. In general, we expect our 22 business lines to continue to develop and grow in Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[CAPEX for Drilling in 2019]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[austin-avuru-ceo-seplat-petroleum-development-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the past three years of low prices forced you to optimize your operation?</h4><p>Prices fell in 2015 followed closely six months later with the outage of Trans Forcados Pipeline, so this was a challenge. We were averaging about 10,000bpd at a low-price regime. We had to react quickly, and the first thing we did was to rejig our 2015 and 2016 work programs and reduce operations to the bare minimum. We combined this with also reducing our OPEX costs to the minimum. We had to improve efficiency and reduce costs, as our goal at the time was to survive. Finally, by the mid 2017 we saw the light at the end of the tunnel, and by the end of 2017 we were back to full production. We were then able to start addressing the quality of our balance sheet, and the results were seen in 1Q2018.</p><h4>What role will your recent USD350-million bond offering play in terms of a fiscal foundation?</h4><p>The entire refinancing package was targeted at two things. The first was to reduce our cost of borrowing with Nigerian banks, which was approaching 12% dollar debt, and about 7% for our revolver with foreign banks. In the aggregates, the combined bond and bank loan gives us a gross debt of USD550 million at a cost that is closer to 8.15% now rather than 12%. Over the next three years it gives us a great deal of room to accumulate cash, which we can then re-invest. This gives us some money to spend on increased CAPEX. In 2016 and 2017, CAPEX spend was minimal, and we now have to go on a more aggressive spending program. For the second half of 2018 we are back to drilling wells, and in 2019 we will increase the number of wells and critical facilities to maintain production and eliminate any drop in production. We will also have a balance sheet strong enough to support any acquisition that falls our way. In addition to organic growth by spending more money in the ground, we are also looking at inorganic growth by acquisition.</p><h4>What are you looking for now in terms of acquisitions?</h4><p>Our core acquisition targets have always been assets that have near term production opportunities with substantial upsides in terms of resources. In addition, we have an aggressive work program that can convert contingent resources into production. We have a fairly wide footprint of gas processing, and when we finish the Assa North-Ohaji South (ANOH) project, any asset that has either gas or oil will be interesting to us. We look for assets that have near term production with either gas or oil that we can bring to the market as quickly as possible.</p><h4>What is the timeline for the ANOH project?</h4><p>The project will take 18-24 months, and we are targeting finishing it within 18 months of FID. Our Production mix as supplied will continue to be 30% gas and 70% oil in terms of dollar value of gross revenue despite the excess capacity from that project. Most of these gas projects we keep engaging in will serve two purposes: maintaining the balance in terms of revenues of 30% gas and 70% oil and also maintaining a critical market share in the domestic market space. Right now, we contribute 30-35% of domestic gas supply and, as demand increases from the current 1.2BCF to anywhere above 2-3BCF, we want to maintain that market share. When the actual domestic consumption rises to 3BCF, we should be able to do 1BCF of processing capacity. Those are our targets, and they are the reason why we continue to invest in gas projects.</p><h4>What initially led Seplat to investing in gas in 2012 when the market was slow?</h4><p>The asset we acquired already had substantial gas reserves that had no value in the pricing of the asset done at that time. The ruling gas price of USD0.20 and the selling ratio meant that gas volumes had a negative NPV. We already had gas processing infrastructure that were part of what we were acquiring, and we had gas reserves and processing capacity through acquiring the oil assets. It only made sense to build on it, though in an efficient manner. From there, the market has only improved, and we have grown with it.</p><h4>You hold a key gas supply contract with the Azura IPP. How was this gas price determined by the market?</h4><p>The Azura offtake is currently receiving commissioning gas, and in the last two years the Nigerian Gas Marketing Company (NGMC) has been taking most of our volume to satisfy its customers, both industrial and power. We had already committed part of that volume to Azura three years ago, and we gave that volume to NGMC on a floating basis. As soon as Azura came in, we took that volume from NGMC and gave to Azura. There is no change in revenues except for a change in customer structure with Azura coming in. The target is for NGMC to be just one of six or seven customers that we supply gas to.</p><h4>What role has the government played in the development of the gas sector?</h4><p>The government has done a fantastic job since 2012 to boost domestic demand and capacity to increase domestic supply through the gas master plan. Demand already captures a market-driven price. Any government intervention now will only be in the way; the transition is over and it should only supervise willing buyer and willing seller negotiations rather than impose prices.</p><h4>What is your vision for the year ahead?</h4><p>In 2018, we moved to the beginning of our build stage, which is where we are currently. 2018 and 2019 are years of building up our business, strengthening our balance sheet, and returning to and maintaining profitability. We have told the market that we want to be able to consistently pay dividends and be consistently profitable through growing the business with both oil and gas production and oil and gas reserves. By the end of 2019 we want a large chunk of our future business to be fairly predictable in terms of balance sheet quality, profit, and production. The building blocks in order to do so involves spending more CAPEX in drilling and so on and looking at acquisitions when they are available. We are preparing the balance sheet to be ready for those building blocks so that business will be more solid and predictable in the future no matter where the oil price takes us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is Mexico the second-largest country in the world in terms of demand for air services?</h4><p>The mobility issues in the country are the primary cause of demand for air travel. Traveling within cities that are important in terms of industrial and economic activity is fairly difficult due to traffic congestion. Air mobility significantly reduces the amount of time it takes to travel from one place to another. The country has a strong oil and gas industry as well that requires the use of helicopters and air taxis frequently. This volume of helicopter use is an area of opportunity for a company such as Voom. We are a digital platform that does not own a single air taxi; our goal is to connect operators with users through an application. A city as congested as Mexico City with a high amount of economic activity requires people to get from one place to another on time and quickly, especially at the airport.</p><h4>What is the future of air mobility?</h4><p>The nature of Voom at the moment lies with helicopters, though the future is with Electrical Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL), an autonomous vehicle that is being developed around the world that could change the face of urban air mobility. At some point, we will have to incorporate such services. It will ultimately make air mobility more efficient and less costly. These vehicles will likely be electric and less noisy than helicopters as they use smaller blades. The first step for us is to help clients get used to air mobility; since one day, it will be as normal as taking the train, car, or bus.</p><h4>How many riders did you target by the end of 2018, and what are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>We have over 50,000 users in our website spread out between Brazil and Mexico, with most of them in Sío Paulo, which has been operating for a year and a half now. Brazil has a stronger client base and more helipads, and we plan on tripling the number of riders in the system. We are confident in our business in Mexico and have seen steady levels of growth when it comes to people adopting air taxi services and repeat customers. Some clients have already used our service up to 12 times. Owning a helicopter is expensive, and before we entered the market, only those with a fairly high net worth could afford them. Voom allows all people to take advantage of this form of transportation; we are democratizing the use of helicopter and air mobility.</p><h4>What strategies do you use to make the service more accessible?</h4><p>We price by the seat, which makes the service significantly more accessible in comparison to renting an entire helicopter. Our pricing is 80-85% lower than the market because of how we structure our business model. We use our own algorithm to coordinate flights and seats around the city to ensure the best prices.</p><h4>How do you plan on expanding to other cities and countries in Latin America?</h4><p>Sío Paulo has 10 heliports, including three in airports and air bases, while Mexico City has five, two which are in CDXM and Toluca airports. We want to further expand into other parts of the city, as the service is needed in south and north of Mexico City. Our business model can be applied to any city in the world and our first step is to consolidate these two cities. It is a great honor to pioneer these services in Mexico and disrupt my own country. Mexico and Sío Paulo are at the forefront of this urban air mobility movement worldwide. In terms of on-demand urban air mobility, Voom is unique in the world at the moment.</p><h4>How do you ensure there are enough heliports for your application?</h4><p>We have contracts between heliports, operators, and our digital platform. We are only allowed to use heliports with commercial permits since we charge landing fees. Mexico City only has three heliports with these permits, and all are part of our platform. Private licensed heliports that want to be part of our network will have to switch and apply for the commercial permit.</p><h4>How do air service trends differentiate in Latin America compared to other regions?</h4><p>Mexico and Brazil have strong cultures of private aviation, which makes them important markets for us. Other cities have much larger commercial aviation markets that are well known. Our point is not to compete with private air mobility service providers but to collaborate with them and allow them to use our platform. We are not bringing more helicopters into the country, we are partnering with them to create a bigger market and demand. Our booking window is between 24 hours and a week, as we want to do it on demand. Perhaps in the future we will extend the booking window to two months.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[SMEs to Provide 20% of Tax Base]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[babatunde-fowler-executive-chairman-federal-inland-revenue-service]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Federal Government managed to increase tax revenue by 42% in 1H2018. To what do you attribute this success?</h4><p>This success is the result of certain measures. First, we implemented changes within our staff, ensuring we had the right people in the right positions. Second, we increased our level of education for both tax administrators and taxpayers. Finally, we deployed technology that makes filing taxes more convenient and transparent for taxpayers. FIRS signed an MoU with the state revenue boards so that we are able to exchange taxpayer information. We added 800,000 new corporate taxpayers in 2016. Due to these efforts, -FIRS and states have over 19 million taxpayers nationwide by 2018. We focused on technology. We have made it extremely easy for any corporate organization to pay tax, download receipts, and go through the refund process. Therefore, taxpayers are willing to pay without worrying about making a mistake, which would mean not getting their credit back. On top of that, we have effective monitoring to regulate compliance. Taxpayers realize that they will not be left alone; even if we are not knocking on their doors in six months, we will be knocking in 12 months. The tax administration at both state and federal levels has changed, and they are starting to see this. To date, no Nigerian has ever been sent to jail for tax evasion. However, now there are consequences, and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) can question people or meet them to discuss their situation. We may have been lenient, but now we are bringing the consequences into light.</p><h4>What is the reason for huge disparity between tax collection from different states?</h4><p>In line with the constitution, every state has the opportunity to share from the Federation Account on a monthly basis. Many states do not look inward but wait once a month to get money and then run their budgets. With dropping oil prices and falling revenue in the Federation accounts, the allocation to each state has also automatically dropped; over a period of three months, the allocations dropped more than 30%. As a result, the states that depended on the federal allocation found that there was not enough money. Some states, particularly, Lagos state, had to look inward and make sure they could financially fulfill their obligations without the federal allocation—that is why Lagos is a leading example today. About five or six states began this process before the others, with some states bringing in 40% of their budgets from internal revenue. The remaining states have now realized they have to change this approach and tax their residents, whether it is a popular policy or not. Some worry that taxation will make them unpopular for upcoming election. But once people start to see the benefits of what the government is doing with the tax revenue, they will begin to appreciate it more.</p><h4>How hard is it for you to raise awareness about the importance of paying taxes and its benefits?</h4><p>We are engaging with our primary stakeholders. For the first time, the FIRS has reached out to meet all its stakeholders in hospitality, entertainment, business, and politics. Members of the House of Representatives and Senate are sitting with us to discuss their current year's budget and strategies for improving the revenue drive. They give us ideas based on our limitations; we are bringing every stakeholder into the picture so they can see the benefits of working together.</p><h4>Which sectors seem the most promising for increasing tax revenue?</h4><p>In terms of number of taxpayers, we are looking to add more SMEs. They currently contribute less than 5%, and if you look at their contribution to GDP, they should be contributing nothing less than 35% of the total tax revenue. We have met with them and engaged with them, while taking other measures based on information that we have to ensure that none of them are left out of the tax net, whether they run an enterprise, a small-business, or a limited-liability company.</p><h4>What is your vision for achieving these goals in Nigeria?</h4><p>I believe that if we continue with the same pace, we can reach 20% of the tax mix comprised of revenue from SMEs by 2019. The government fully supports us. Some projects may take a year or more to develop, but citizens' believe in the tax system is uplifted even when they see work in progress.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>Just like some of the other oil-rich countries, we never imagined that taxation would be the main way to generate revenue. Now we appreciate the fact that oil is a resource with a price determined by more developed countries, and with that, we are disadvantaged. There is a 2026 agenda for African countries to be able to fund their budgets internally without grants or aid. It is something we can do right now.

		<url><![CDATA[bryan-thompson-ceo-abu-dhabi-airports]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4></h4><h4>What will be the economic significance of the opening of Abu Dhabi's Midfield Terminal?</h4><h4></h4><p>The opening of the Midfield Terminal will add capacity to the market and allow for the continued economic growth of the aviation sector. It has allowed us to broaden our commercial offerings in terms of concessions, retail propositions, duty free, specialty retail, and food and beverage. If we compare the current economic benefits from the existing terminal to the future predicted benefits of the new terminal, we will significantly increase our annual revenues from non-aeronautical revenue due to the increase in available space. Furthermore, the terminal will serve as a strategic asset which allows us to further advance the aviation industry within Abu Dhabi.</p><h4></h4><h4>How does the development of the airport coincide with Abu Dhabi's broader efforts to attract more tourists?</h4><h4></h4><p>Abu Dhabi Airports works in close collaboration with the major stakeholders, including the Department of Culture and Tourism (DCT) and Etihad Airways, to promote Abu Dhabi as a visitor destination. Historically, Dubai and Abu Dhabi have been excellent transit hubs; however, we want passengers to experience the varied cultural and tourist offerings of Abu Dhabi. While the hub activities will remain fundamental to our operations, as will our close relationship with Etihad and its hub activities, we seek to develop this further. Singapore did this with Changi Airport around 20 years ago, leveraging on its status as an international hub and marketing the city as part of that transit, giving visitors the ability to experience Singapore for a few days before recommencing their journeys. Abu Dhabi has plenty of tourist attractions as well as a rich events calendar which includes F1. We play a crucial role in transport infrastructure in terms of bringing people into the UAE, and we will continue to work with the Department of Culture and Tourism (DCT) on this agenda to ensure the UAE is well represented. We recently set up a sector committee that looks more long term at the aviation sector and the strategy.</p><h4></h4><h4></h4><h4>Many new ultra-long-haul flights have entered into the schedules of airlines in recent years. Do you see this as a potential disrupter to the growth of hub network traffic?</h4><h4></h4><h4></h4><p>Abu Dhabi is well located geographically in terms of its proximity to the majority of the global population. Geopolitically, this is a sound region, and the UAE is ranked as the safest country in the world for visitors and residents; we are fortunate in many ways. Ultra-long-haul in terms of network economics and the support for such long flights does not disrupt hubs at the moment, though this remains to be seen in the long term. The Midfield Terminal will boast the best facilities in the world when it opens, and our role is to make it as efficient and attractive as possible by giving passengers the opportunity to relax and rejuvenate before continuing on their journeys. There will always be a role for hubs just by the virtue of network economics, as not all routes are busy enough to justify long-distance flights. In those routes where we are ideally positioned to support, our job is to make it an experience that passengers want to partake in.</p><h4></h4><h4>Is there demand in the market for a low-cost airline to establish a significant presence at Abu Dhabi International Airport?</h4><h4></h4><p>Part of our goal in terms of developing the aviation sector within Abu Dhabi involves how we optimize the use of our assets, in particular with the new terminal. We facilitate the best operations for airlines, with Etihad as our resident hub carrier. Fly Dubai was traditionally a low-cost carrier, though it is now more of a hybrid. Airlines adjust to the market conditions, and the routes served are made as attractive as possible to suit the preferences of customers, so cost structures and fares have become distinctly different. Traditional full-service carriers operate with low fares. The market is interesting, and there is room for traditional low cost, low fare, and full fare, full service, though the market really does adapt to what customers want.</p><h4></h4><h4>How have you been involved in developing the next generation of aviation professionals?</h4><h4></h4><p>Abu Dhabi is proud to have the Gulf Centre For Aviation Studies, which offers a wide range of courses from traditional aviation study type courses to IATA and ACI all the way to management courses. We intend to continue to build on that in terms of the offerings. Preparing to operate the new Midfield Terminal is a phenomenal challenge; we not only have to train staff on the new facility but also on a new way of delivering customer satisfaction. The diversity of our workforce continues to be of prime importance because of the people we serve. However, we are also focused on building an Emirati workforce that is capable and qualified to deliver the services. We have specific diversity targets in terms of recruitment. We have a balanced workforce in terms of gender, and our primary focus at the moment is on competence. We look internally to make sure we can deliver all the training and courses to enable this.</p><h4></h4><h4></h4><h4>Air travel is set to rise globally, how can we ensure this growth happens sustainably?</h4><h4></h4><h4></h4><p>Sustainability is now a core focus of the Emirates and across the world. The Midfield Terminal has specific design criteria to limit its impact on the environment and was rated Pearl 2. We have also started to implement a solar farm on the car park to generate power. Additionally, we use treated effluent in our landscaping to conserve water. Looking more broadly at the industry, the aircraft today versus aircraft 10 years ago are far more efficient not only in terms of fuel usage, but also in CO2 emissions. The industry is working hard on this issue. From an organization perspective, we want to make sure we look at our generational impact and how we create a sustainable business from a financial perspective and a sustainable workforce that can regenerate itself, learn, and create activity for many years to come within the UAE, particularly for Emirati nationals. How can we create an organization that truly concentrates on sustainability? We need a master plan to ensure the airport knows where it will be in 100 years' time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The stock market is often regarded as the barometer of the national economy. How does this apply to Jordan?</h4><p>In the medium to long term, the stock market is the mirror for the economic situation in a country. It reflects the overall standing of economic performance and indicators as well as the changes. However, in the short term, the stock market has its own dynamics, where players within the market decide the day-to-day fluctuations. In Jordan, we had certain boom years on the ASE, and we were hopeful we could expand it both horizontally and vertically. Unfortunately, after 2008, there was a huge drop in size and the share price index, and a number of companies also relocated elsewhere. This led to the demotion of the ASE from an emerging to a frontier market. This alienated large pension funds and institutional investors that only invest in emerging markets and above. ASE is working hard to regain that emerging market status, so we can attract more investors. There are great opportunities because funding is tight in Jordan, so most people do not run their portfolios on stocks. They opt for government bonds and securities, which provide a great income that is tax free. There are excellent opportunities for profit in the industry, banking, and finance sectors here.</p><h4>What needs to be done to attract investment and enhance confidence in the Jordanian economy?</h4><p>We would like to see the government abolish the recently imposed tax on trading and speculation in the market. The government seeks long-term investment; however, if that is the case, we will not get any money because speculation is part and parcel of investment. It is also important for monetary policy in terms of open market operations. One cannot have an open market without a variety of portfolio investments in the secondary market that impact people's decisions from one form of paper investment to the next. To give buyers of securities comfort, the government has given them recourse to the issuer. However, there should only be recourse to the issuer at maturity, and if anyone wants to sell before maturity, they should come to the secondary market, which would help ASE expand. We also recently introduced sukuk, which is a step forward. We hope to expand the market and make it deeper. We are also trying to convince some of the private shareholding companies to go public, though some, family businesses in particular, do not want to lose control. We encourage them to create trust funds and release some of their shares into the market to make their companies more robust.</p><h4>Can you elaborate more on your evaluation of the proposed tax reforms?</h4><p>I was vocal about my opposition to the proposal. My dissent did the trick, and we ended up adding an extra fee that both investors and brokers were satisfied with. It was not the ideal solution, but it was the next best one. In terms of the tax reforms overall, income tax law has been heavily debated in Jordan and has incited considerable emotion. There was no need for the government to increase tax rates. It could have thoroughly looked at the margins and the income groups and adjusted the rates to make it a more progressive tax system. It could have also tightened its grip on tax evaders by closing the loopholes, essentially increasing revenues without actually increasing tax rates. Now is not the time to increase rates; it is more important to enact reforms that enhance the government's ability to collect taxes.</p><h4>What do you see as Jordan's key bilateral relations?</h4><p>Moving forward, Jordan must realize that its traditional and long-term beneficial relations with the Gulf states are changing. Previously, we used to get about 50-70% of our FX from our economic relations with the Gulf states. This took the form of employment with many Jordanians working abroad, trade, investments, soft loans, aid packages, and export of goods and services. Things are changing, however. We are worried more Jordanians will be sent home because some of the Gulf states are having financial difficulties. Saudi Arabia has at least a USD45-billion deficit for 2019's budget. The Gulf has its own challenges to worry about as it moves out of being a rentier economies and into being a region of productive economies. Jordan's potential is more with our direct neighbors in the Levant, such as Syria, Iraq, and, perhaps in the future, Israel and the Palestinian territories. That would require a different set of regulations and likely a different paradigm. If we continue to antagonize Iran and Turkey, this will also influence our relations because of the leverage both countries have. We should focus on the Levant, though without severing our links with the Middle East; however, we cannot continue to pretend that things will stay the same. We must explore potentials that will give us new opportunities in different sectors. For example, Iraq is an excellent and promising neighbor. We can do pipelines, railways, and many other mutually beneficial infrastructure projects with longevity that will guarantee a better, more secure future, rather than depending on trade exchange and profits thereof. This can help establish wealth that both countries will be keen to maintain. At the same time, we can engage in agriculture and industry. Jordan's problem is that the country is short on liquidity on all fronts—money, oil, and water. We have to resolve those three challenges. We need huge projects, like desalination, though these will not be cheap. If we want to have sustainable growth, we have to manage our water resources for the future, especially since Jordan's population has skyrocketed to 10.5 million. That was the country's projected population for 2030, so we have to find a way to accelerate our processes to maintain the same levels of welfare and economic sustainability. Moving forward, we need to be more conscious and recalculate what we are paying in real terms for our production.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe 2018 for Avis in Colombia, and what expectations do you have for 2019?</h4><p>In Colombia, Avis has consolidated itself as one of the top five companies in the country with a fleet of 560 cars in the rental car business and 2,500 in the long-term business. Currently, we have offices in the seven most important cities of Colombia, mainly in airports. By 2019, Mareauto, as operator of the Avis franchise for Colombia, expects to continue to strengthen its operation in B2B business.</p><h4>In a regional context, how important are Avis operation in Colombia?</h4><p>Mareauto Colombia has achieved a relevant place with Avis in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2018 we were awarded as the franchise of best growth in the region.</p><h4>How has the renting business changed since Avis entered the Colombian market?</h4><p>Mareauto has been operating the Avis Colombia franchise for the last 10 years. During the first five years, Mareauto completed its learning curve in the Colombian market, and in the following years has been gaining market share with two-digit sustainable growth. Our presence in the market has fostered the competitiveness of the sector.</p><h4>What major challenges remain for the Colombian market? What can we expect from the Colombian tourism sector in the coming years?</h4><p>Avis has high expectations for the coming years; the impulse that the new Colombian government wants to give to the competitiveness of the country is a factor that allows us to project great growth in strategic sectors of the Colombian economy, making more companies consider us the best offer in integral mobility solutions to support their operation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Workforce Demand]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[andres-sanchez-director-general-randstad]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main changes the workforce in Mexico is experiencing considering the advances of the country's industries?</h4><p>The workforce in Mexico is fairly young, similar to that in India and other developing countries. Mexico is expected to have one of the largest workforce in the world in 20 years time and will be one of the top five in terms of growth. At the moment, however, it faces a problem when it comes to informality in the workforce, even though we have a low unemployment rate of around 2.3%. Informality makes up around 50-60% of the workforce, and to create a true solution, the country needs to find a way to transition these informal positions into formal ones. Even many HR companies are not formal themselves. One of our main differentiators is our formality, and we encourage other companies to do the same. We comply with all labor and fiscal legislation.</p><h4>What are the new trends appearing in terms of generational and work condition preferences?</h4><p>As a result of technological advances that have greatly improved productivity, for example cellular phones,  young generations seek jobs that offer benefits such as more free time Transformation has become an everyday part of the process since we started using computers. Today, some are even working longer than before because technology makes it easier to communicate at all hours of the day. Employees are more demanding, and companies need to make sure they can offer continuous new goals and objectives. It has become part of the culture of the new workforce.</p><h4>Why are more companies in Mexico demanding outsourcing services?</h4><p>In Mexico, our main business line is staffing, and this is typically outsourced. Our clients want to stick to their expertise, which is their core business, and look for outside help when it comes to recruitment and the administration of employees. These employees become part of our company even though they work for someone else. We provide these services to a wide array of sectors, from pharmaceuticals, telecommunications to the automotive sector. The automotive sector is growing quickly, despite our new trade agreements with the US and Canada. It has its challenges as a sector, but is still extremely attractive. Automotive companies plan to continue investing in the country. Besides staffing, we also have recruitment process outsourcing (RPO). In this line of business, the employees belong to our clients, and we simply manage their recruitment process, particularly for clients that do not want a recruitment department themselves. This allows us to bring quality and quantity to our clients in a straightforward way. In Latin America, RPO is relatively recent and has only been available for five years or so. In the last two years, it has become more popular in Mexico and is our fastest-growing segment.</p><h4>What is employer branding and how successful are Mexican companies in it?</h4><p>Employer branding is a strategy companies can use to market themselves as an employer and attract talent. Companies never used to invest much into this matter, but are now putting more effort into establishing their brand. This has to be done consciously; companies need to create their own stories and properly explain to candidates what their journey will look like from the first day to training. Companies need to make sure they are congruent with what others see in the company from the outside. We need to identify what companies need to do to be attractive to young people, especially in the digital age, since they are the future workforce. This is important because it is a challenge to find high-level management and executives. We are always looking to create a great story in each company to attract high-level employees.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities has the company identified in Mexico's petrochemical industry?</h4><p>Our company was created after a government initiative to develop the petrochemical sector through an auction of 18 contracts with a duration of 20 years. After winning the auction, we decided to invest USD5 billion in the country because we believe in Mexico and have identified important drivers and potential in its petrochemical industry. The country's geographical position is a plus, along with its FTAs with many countries. The service and labor available here is also prime. In all, the petrochemical industry in Mexico moves around USD60 billion a year. Around 60-70% of what we produce is consumed by the Mexican market, and we export the rest to more than 46 countries, particularly the US, Europe, and Central America. Our success in Mexico proves Latin America's potential to encompass projects of this size. We are pleased with not only the financial results but also the relationships we have been able to establish with our clients.</p><h4>Who are your main clients in the country?</h4><p>We are in the middle of the plastic supply chain; therefore, our clients are a blend of companies that transform raw material to final products. We serve a variety of sectors from agriculture to packaging and automotive, among other industries that utilize plastic. The wide scope of the petrochemical industry makes it such a relevant sector in the country's economy.</p><h4>In what ways is the consumption of plastic increasing rapidly in Mexico?</h4><p>All around the world, the consumption of plastic is increasing rapidly. There are many new necessities we have to consider, especially in the US due to the shale gas phenomenon. In China and Asia, we observe a transitional moment as a result of the tariff war between US and China. Demand is growing rapidly, not only in the US but also in Asia. We are optimistic about our global vision for the future of this industry.</p><h4>How is the company promoting a more ecological use and handling of plastic?</h4><p>This is a highly relevant issue, and we are concerned about the amount of plastic waste accumulating in the ocean due to a lack of action. Plastic can truly improve the quality of people's lives; however, as a society we have to learn to use it wisely. As part of the industry, we feel a responsibility toward the government and society in general to promote better waste handling. The company is focused on increasing the reuse and recycling of products. We are committed to educating society on the responsible handling of plastic. The main driver of change will ultimately revolve around education, especially within families and schools. Chemical associations around the world are participating in and developing movements on these matters. The idea is to take advantage of the pros that plastic can offer and minimize the impact through reutilization. We also want to promote the use of technology to efficiently use natural resources and avoid waste. This also helps minimize water consumption. We want to take advantage of our global outreach to create an impact. Braskem Idesa is equally promoting initiates to develop plastic from renewable material such as sugarcane.</p><h4>What are your production expansion plans in Mexico?</h4><p>We are committed to staying in the country long term. The company seeks opportunities for expansion, and we will likely start by expanding our platform and complex. This can be achieved through small investments that can greatly increase our total production capacity. We are also looking into expanding our portfolio and the types of polyethylene we produce for our clients.</p><h4>How will the new administration impact your 20-year contract with Pemex?</h4><p>This will be the third administration that we will interact with, and we do not prioritize one party or another. We are committed to the country, and we perceive Mexican institutions to be strong. I am optimistic about this new administration due to the huge support we saw during the election phase for the President. We will continue to have a presence in the country and have already announced an important investment in exploration that will have a positive impact on the petrochemical industry. We plan to have a positive dialog with the new authorities on how to improve its ethane supply. This is relevant for the entire industry and not just Braskem Idesa.</p><h4>How can Mexico improve and diversify its supply of ethane gas?</h4><p>Ethane gas as well as natural gas are going through an important transitional moment. There has been a great lack of investment in the last few years that has created issues for Pemex in ethane production. In effect, Pemex started to increase imports of these resources. Importing these resources are a temporary solution, though we also need to look into taking advantage of the resources that we already have in the country. The new administration has announced a clear interest in recovering national production rates of natural gas, ethane, and oil, among other resources. This will require large amount of investment, and imports can close the supply and demand gaps for the meantime. There is a huge amount of potential to collaborate between Pemex and private companies to solve these issues. Dialog will play a key role in enhancing the competitiveness of Mexico's petrochemical industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Spain and Lebanon Under the People's Party]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[spain-and-lebanon-under-the-peoples-party]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe relations between the two nations?</h4><p>I would rate them as excellent. However, this is not a relationship that has come out of nowhere. The link between Spain and Lebanon has deep historical roots that have sailed across the Mediterranean. For example, some of the most important cities in southern Spain, such as Malaga or Cadiz, are of Phoenician origin. Both countries also share a common Roman and Arab heritage, clearly visible in our cultures. For all this, it is easy to understand the closeness and mutual affection between our peoples. On the other hand, the traveler spirit of the Lebanese and the appeal that the Spanish language exerts on a polyglot population play in favor of the diffusion of the Spanish culture in the region. We cannot forget the millions of Lebanese who live in Latin America and use Spanish as their language of communication. Spain always stands at the side of Lebanon in times of difficulty, as evidenced by the efforts in favor of the Middle East peace process, the presence of Spanish troops in the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) contingent, or the development cooperation projects financed by Spain.</p><h4>Is there an area where bilateral relations can be enhanced?</h4><p>I would like to emphasize Spain's commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the region, in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1701. The Lebanese authorities and people appreciate the important Spanish participation in UNIFIL, especially after the sad event that resulted in the deaths of six soldiers from a terrorist attack in June 2007. I know the good work of the General of the Spanish Division Alberto Asarta Cuevas controlling the Mission of UNIFIL between 2010 and 2012 is still remembered. We must also point out the importance of civilian operations carried out within the framework of UNIFIL, which have a great impact on the local population and contribute to improving their living conditions. In the economic-trade area, we are working on intensifying commercial relations and on publicizing investment opportunities open in that country for Spanish companies, in sectors where we have great experience and competitiveness, such as renewable energy or infrastructure. In this sense, in 2015 a Hispano-Lebanese Business Council was created to strengthen commercial relations between the two countries. At the same time, it should not be forgotten that Lebanon will play an important role in the reconstruction of Syria, when it occurs. What's more, the Cervantes Institute in Beirut, whose new headquarters will soon be inaugurated, is a great example of the interest Spanish awakens in Lebanese society. We are working to consolidate the teaching of Spanish in primary and secondary education and are pleased that Spanish has been recognized as an optional language in the Lebanese education system. The contacts and exchanges between Lebanese and Spanish universities are intense and constant. In terms of tourism, more Lebanese visit Spain each year and vice versa. Lastly, Spain has traditionally been a country of solidarity with Lebanon. We were a main contributor to the Lebanon Recovery Fund after the 2006 war and have been major donors to the UN Refugee Agency (UNRWA) in Lebanon.</p><h4>How do you foresee the evolution of trade relations given the instability of the region?</h4><p>The country is always able to overcome the challenges it faces. Despite a particularly complicated regional environment, Lebanon has managed to overcome the institutional blockade that has paralyzed it in recent years, electing a president and forming a government. To this must be added the recent agreement to approve a new electoral law and set a date for legislative elections in May 2018. Hopefully, this will bring confidence to investors. The Lebanese government has also launched bidding processes for the exploration and exploitation of gas and oil, which will undoubtedly revitalize the national economy. There are many leading Spanish companies in these sectors that wish to contribute to the growth and expansion of the Lebanese economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Energy Reform and Opportunity]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[enrique-riquelme-president-ceo-cox-energy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you decide to enter the Mexican energy market?</h4><p>We entered Mexico between 2013 and 2014 because of energy reform. Cox Energy saw that the country was heading in the right direction in terms of regulation. In Mexico, solar radiation is incredible and adequate for long-term operations. Importantly, the tenders were and are in dollars, which helped concrete the viability of our project along with the natural resources of the country that keep our operations at a low cost. The company already has projects in several places, but the main ones are in Zacatecas, Sonora, Hermosillo, Veracruz, Estado de Mexico, and Campeche. In Mexico, we have PPA with CFE and with private groups. At present, we are building several projects; the 2.5 GW we can install in Mexico will take approximately four years. We continued to study the Central American market for additional opportunities, but we found that it needed to mature. However, Chile has proven to be an interesting market as well with a stable regulatory framework.</p><h4>What model do you use to finance your projects in Mexico?</h4><p>We prefer to auto-finance stable projects that can provide long-term cash flow that can be collected in dollars. These factors allow us to sell cheap energy as the projects require less expensive financing. The fact that the cost of energy is cheaper does not affect the viability of projects as long as they have a long-term vision. We have 20-year contracts and have guaranteed sales during this time period.</p><h4>What do you consider your star project in Mexico?</h4><p>One is a small project in Sonora of 30 MW. This location has an abundance of solar resources and was the first project I bought in Mexico without a PPA. There is another project in the state of Mexico that has less radiation but is still attractive as it has the potential to expand. We are also building a project of 118 MW in Veracruz and we are going to start construction different medium-sized projects in Sonora and Campeche. The energy model and the business model in Mexico include public tenders mainly from the CFE and tenders with private companies with a proven long-term focus. We are in the entire value chain; we develop the parks and invest. Although we do not build, we subcontract that part, and we operate the plants throughout their life period. Apart from the large-scale generation, we have another business niche for Mexico: we carry the representation of our plants and those of others in the market. Another of our segments is distributed generation with net metering with large industries. Similarly, the company is in the niche market of electricity generation that has nothing to do with public or private PPAs, but with the sale of energy in the SPOT market. We will develop small- and medium-sized projects to generate SPOT market energy.</p><h4>Is Mexico taking the steps it needs to increase its renewable energy consumption?</h4><p>Mexico will not only meet its goals that it has set up for itself but surpass them. The country just has to ensure the future of the energy reform and allow it to mature. I trust a lot in the new government and its intent of lowering the costs of energy; this benefits us as solar energy is the most competitive. It is important that domestic or foreign investment is not be impeded. Long-term investments that generate jobs and produce cheap energy are necessary. I was able to meet with both incoming and outgoing government teams, and I was left assured. Due to sustained efforts of the government, investments have increased and new market niches have also been opened. We are betting on the Mexican market for the next 50 years. We are studying the possibility of structuring the Latin American holding company from Mexico so that it can be financed in dollars. The demand for energy does not cease, and the population continues to grow. With that in mind, solar energy is the best solution as it is the cheapest in the world.</p><h4>How are you looking to continue growing in Mexico?</h4><p>We want to invest USD 1.5 billion in large- and medium-scale projects, both through public PPA and private PPA. We want to continue investing in medium- and small-sized SPOT market energy projects as well as medium-term PPA projects. Mexico is one of the best countries in the world to develop energy projects because of the regulations in place.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Over 70 Years in Mexico]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[hermes-aguirre-country-vp-mexico-halliburton]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is Mexico within the company's international business strategy?</h4><p>Halliburton has had a strong presence in Mexico for over 70 years. The company expanded its presence in Mexico through its business lines and technology offerings for onshore and offshore projects. Offshore projects currently account for 80% of the country's production which translates to a high demand for Halliburton's products and services. Moreover, exploration is another key activity in the country and we work closely with operators to locate new reserves and produce them economically. Remarkably, Halliburton has participated in all the inland exploration and development programs with a major operator to help the company drive greater returns and maximize their asset value.</p><h4>How are you helping companies reduce their cost per barrel?</h4><p>From the drilling side, we deliver the latest technologies to the rig site which helped reduce the number of days by 30-40%. Our expertise allows Halliburton to reduce costs and drilling time in onshore and offshore projects. One example is providing new stimulation vessels to Mexico that will help operators produce wells earlier to save valuable time. Additionally, our services help new companies entering the country accelerate their investment and start-up projects, particularly for exploration wells.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the change of Director General at Pemex and how are you adapting?</h4><p>Halliburton has worked around the globe with different national oil companies, so we understand the responsibility and changes that those companies go through when there is a governmental transition. We will continue to work with the new administration as we have with previous administrations and maintain strong relationships from the top management to the workers in the field. Halliburton will continue to align our business with our customers' challenges and collaborate to deliver the right solutions.</p><h4>How was the company able to return to profitability in 2017 before all other service companies?</h4><p>The improving prices in combination with our higher levels of efficiency allowed us to grow positively. The industry suffered from the impact of low pricing and we worked hard to reduce costs to soften the blow. We developed several global continuous improvement initiatives to increase efficiency and drive cost savings in our daily business. We also brought new ideas and technologies to customers that helped them optimize previously drilled wells and boost production in existing assets. The last four years have been challenging; however, they have given us the opportunity to review our execution and how we work with customers. These initiatives throughout the organization were responsible for limiting expenses, recalibrating our focus on efficiency and demonstrating our commitment to operators and their particular challenges.</p><h4>What is your outlook for exploration demand in the coming years in the Mexican oil industry?</h4><p>Halliburton views the Mexican market favorably and sees a tremendous commitment from the international oil companies (IOC's) and other operators across the E&amp;P landscape. Big players such as integrated majors are continuously investing in the country and starting their exploration projects. One of the significant challenges in the region is reservoir recovery which is driving greater investment into exploration to increase declining reserves. We are aware that these projects will play a key role in operations for the next four to five years. Moreover, these projects will demand high levels of technology and we are prepared to offer these services.</p><h4>How do you strive to keep expanding Halliburton's presence in Mexico in the coming years?</h4><p>We are well established in Mexico and plan to expand by further understanding the unique challenges of the country and opportunities they provide for service companies. The company plans to reactivate its presence in deep-water projects and onshore expansion in northern Mexico. We also see opportunities in helping the country expand its gas production as there are many important reserves to participate in. We have a large portfolio of service providers and national companies that collaborate with us to make sure that new projects continue to be developed. In terms of employment, we incorporate local talent in the company and almost 97% of our staff are Mexican. Halliburton will continue to support the local economy and have a large number of Mexican professionals working internationally. It is important for the talent to grow not only in Mexico, but outside the country as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights and achievements of your mandate to date?</h4><p>There has been an effective process of European convergence since 2016. Our notable accomplishments include growing the budget allocation for public higher education institutions by 10% between 2016 and 2019 from EUR1.002 billion to EUR1.105 billion, with the total number of students growing by 5% between 2015 and 2018, from 356,000 to 373,000 students in the public and private sectors. The number of students enrolled for the first time in public and private higher education institutions grew from around 87,000 in 2014/15 to more than 103,000 in 2018/19, including more than 9,000 students in short vocational cycles. In parallel with the implementation of the Study and Research in Portugal program, the number of foreign students increased by 48% from 2014-2015, representing today about 50,000 students and 13% of the total number of students enrolled. Funding for the Science and Technology Foundation (FCT) increased by 24%, from EUR490 million in 2016 to EUR621 million in 2019. The number of new PhD grants supported annually has grown from 971 in 2015 to over 1,600 in 2018 and 2019, in parallel with the implementation of the Scientific Employment Stimulus Program, which includes the execution of at least 5,000 more doctoral researchers' contracts until the end of the legislature. As well, the number of social scholarships in higher education has grown from around 64,000 in 2014/15 to more than 80,000 in 2018/19.</p><h4>How do you see Portugal's regional and global leadership in the IT start-up culture?</h4><p>National short-, medium- and long-term strategies for the development of digital skills were set out through the National Digital Skills Initiative (INCoDe2030), so that by 2030 approximately nine out of 10 citizens are frequent users of the internet, and we increase by 50% the number IT experts in companies. The strategies include, among other aspects, providing support to creative communities in the area of inclusion and at a local and decentralized level throughout the country in close interaction with the local/regional administrations; supporting teachers in the progressive and systematic modernization of the education system working closely with the Minister of Education and related central and regional administrations; establishing regional networks of qualification and digital specialization, namely through partnerships between polytechnics, local administration, and companies namely in the regions of West-Leiria, Cavado and Ave, Nordeste Transmontano-Bragança, Castelo Branco, and Setúbal-Palmela; the establishment of a national AI strategy, with the specific involvement of the public administration, R&amp;D centers, and companies and in close European interaction; and the development of advanced forms of computing, including the creation of the Minho Advanced Computing Center-MACC.</p><h4>What are the ministry's goals in terms of national spending on science R&amp;D?</h4><p>Our goals are to double public expenditure in R&amp;D by 2030 and multiply business expenditure by a factor of four, in close association with the creation of more than 25,000 new skilled jobs in the coming 12 years. This is possible because the previous years have created a new environment for public and private engagement in research and innovation. For example, total public and private R&amp;D expenditure grew by EUR114 million in 2016 and EUR175 million in 2017, reaching 1.33% of GDP in 2017. This is predicted to reach 1.7% of GDP by the end of 2019. It represents an effective convergence for the Europe of knowledge since 2016, as a consequence of a clear policy of qualification and employment of qualified human resources and of scientific and academic career enhancement. The increase in R&amp;D expenditure was particularly significant in the business sector, which increased by 12% between 2016 and 2017 and now represents more than half of national R&amp;D expenditure.</p><h4>How would you assess the balance between private- and public higher education sector?</h4><p>The number of doctoral researchers in companies conducting R&amp;D activities benefiting from fiscal support has increased by 30% since 2015 and by more than 10% between 2016 and 2017, showing a clear fiscal policy in support of R&amp;D and innovation. The number of R&amp;D companies benefiting from financial assistance to hire doctoral researchers has increased by 37% since 2015, including some 290 companies in 2017. The hiring of researchers by companies grew by 11% between 2016 and 2017, with the number of researchers in the active population to grow to 8.5% in 2017 compared to 8% in 2016 and 7.4% in 2015. The number of full-time researchers in higher education has grown by 9.5% since 2015. In addition, the territorial densification and institutional diversification associated with a polytechnics valorization and modernization strategy, as well as an innovation strategy and to support the growth of more and better jobs, included the creation of 21 new collaborative laboratories in 2018 under the scope of the Interface Program, after an international evaluation and considering collaboration between companies, R&amp;D units, and higher education institutions. It includes a five-year public investment of around EUR50 million, aimed at stimulating economic and social development in all areas of knowledge, from agricultural production to digital transformation of industry, and including critical sectors such as cement, production food, space, or forests, considering critical technologies such as AI.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions and goals for the Ministry for Science, Technology and Higher Education for 2019?</h4><p>We want to strengthen institutional capacity and presence in European and international networks, including the promotion of the Atlantic International Research Center (AIR Center) and the Global Science and Technology Partnerships Portugal program, including the effective strengthening of partnerships with major institutions of relevance such as MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Texas at Austin, and reinforcing the Fraunhofer-Portugal Program with the installation of a second center in Portugal in the field of precision agriculture. A new strategy was also launched to support the development of new space industries, Portugal Space 2030, and a new program is underway for the installation of new satellite launch services in the Azores, with launches planned from 2021, as well as the installation of a laboratory for the design and development of small satellites, STARLAB, in cooperation with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS. In addition, we are making all necessary efforts to guarantee the effective simplification of administrative procedures and reduce bureaucracy in the higher education system, science, and technology. Notably, the “more science, less bureaucracy" program, has significantly simplified the public procurement regime for R&amp;D activities. The program of rationalization and administrative modernization of the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), the National Innovation Agency (ANI), and other public entities with attributions in the financing of science, technology, and innovation was also strengthened. The procedures for renewal of social support scholarships for students of higher education were also simplified; however, overall, the simplification of administrative procedures and of bureaucracy needs to be strengthened at the level of all institutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mazin-saad-al-nahedh-group-ceo-kuwait-finance-house]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was key to your success in 2018, and how did you significantly grow your loan book?</h4><p>We operate in different jurisdictions, including Kuwait, Turkey, Germany, Malaysia, Bahrain, and KSA. Throughout those locations, the growth trajectory for each economy is different. For example, in Turkey, because of the high inflation and devaluation of the currency, typically growth rates are in the high 10s or 20s. In comparison to Kuwait, with low interest rates and inflation, credit growth is more subdued and closer to 5-6%. Therefore, in Kuwait we focused specifically on infrastructure projects, primarily in the oil and gas sector in addition to financing trade-related business. We provide most of the corporates with the necessary financing requirements when they import goods. In addition, we focus on the large corporate sector that has not been banked by KFH in the past. We take market share from other banking participants, which helps the general growth of KFH on the corporate and SME sides. On the retail side, KFH enjoys likely the largest customer base in terms of numbers; we are the second-largest bank in Kuwait and the largest Islamic Bank. Our strength lies in our retail portfolio and the diversity of our deposit base. This is primarily driven by KFH being the only Islamic bank upon its establishment in 1977 up to 2003.</p><h4>What factors differentiate KFH from its main competitors in Kuwait?</h4><p>We have been in the market much longer than the rest and have extensive experience and know-how in Islamic banking, as we were one of the pioneers driving that movement forward. We are the only Islamic bank that offers as part of our sustainable development goals and financial inclusion pillar female-only branches to cater the needs of an important part of the population.</p><h4>How is KFH adjusting its strategy to the new trend of digitalization?</h4><p>The digitalization strategy started about three years ago. Each of our eight KFH business lines had its own system managing the same customer base; the same customer would reside in multiple databases without any links. We therefore changed our system into a relationship-based approach rather than a product-based one and segmented our customers based on their business activity. The objective is to better manage our customers' wealth and facilitate their transactions. This also ensures the quality of service we provide. On another level, we implemented robotics to reduce the process time for time-consuming applications such as onboarding. With our new systems, we reduced processing time by a third. That frees up time for our employees, who can be more productive and serve customers better. We also made significant improvements to our mobile banking app that cover almost 90% of the services a branch can provide. We just launched a concept called KFH Go, our new vision for what future branches should look like on a self-service basis. Those branches' footprints are about one-fifth of the existing branches' footprints, which drastically diminishes rental costs and overheads. This is a full-fledged electronic branch that does roughly 90% of what one could do in a branch. Printing of checks and instantaneous issuance of cards are services that will soon be available as well. We piloted this concept about a year and a half ago and started off with two machines. We have ordered eight more. We will have 10 electronic branches that we will be installed in 2019 and 2020 so that we can have 24/7 banking available to all our customers in key locations.</p><h4>What sector will experience significant growth in 2019 and become of interest for KFH's investments?</h4><p>We are looking to finance the solar farm project built by KPC. There is also the solid waste plant that we are working on and hoping to close. Finally, there are plans for new cities in the north and south that will be developed through the PPP structure. We see those projects coming to completion rather than just being tendered; once complete, the infrastructure would be ready, the city will start flourishing, and activities will begin. In the oil sector, there are about hundreds of billions dollars of projects over the next five years that involve LNG and the improvement of upstream and downstream processes through the fourth refinery, which is one of the key projects that will be introduced. However, less government bureaucracy will be the key in order to cut down on delays. Another main factor will be the urgency of completing the national plan, and as long as oil prices go above USD60, the urgency will be less. When we saw oil prices drop below USD40, the country immediately went into damage control. When oil prices broke the USD70 ceiling, everyone forgot the reforms that needed to be done; even the introduction of VAT is no longer in the agenda. Many factors will play into the equation; however, if oil prices remain high, the public sector will ask for more benefits, which might be dangerous in the long term for the economy, and the government might delay its delivery on the development plan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[yousuf-mohamed-al-jaida-ceo-qatar-financial-centre]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of the QFC and its structure?</h4><p>QFC is an onshore business and financial center that provides an excellent platform for firms to do business in Qatar and the region. QFC is made up of five separate entities: the Qatar Financial Centre Authority (QFCA), which is responsible for licensing firms to conduct business in or from the QFC and managing and maintaining the QFC's legal and tax environment; the Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA), responsible for regulating and supervising QFC firms conducting regulated activities; the Qatar International Court and Dispute Resolution Centre (QICDRC), which is responsible for managing dispute resolution and hearing civil and commercial disputes between QFC firms and their counterparts and hears appeals and decisions made by QFC Authorities and Institutions; the Qatar Finance and Business Academy (QFBA), the educational arm of the QFCA and works to raise the financial services industry standards and help organizations and professionals achieve their learning and business objectives; and the Employment Standards Office (ESO), which works to administer and enforce employment regulations and resolve employment disputes through conciliation, mediation and arbitration. We are proud of the fact that it is the first Administrative Employment Dispute Resolution Centre in the MENA region operating under International Labour Organization (ILO) standards. ESO recently signed a joint MoU with the Ministry of Administrative Development, Labour and Social Affairs (ADLSA), Qatar, and ILO that focuses on organizing training workshops and seminars on key human resource topics.</p><h4>What are the benefits of setting up under the QFC?</h4><p>There are a host of benefits for companies setting up under the QFC. QFC offers its own legal, regulatory, tax and business environment, which allows up to 100% foreign ownership, 100% repatriation of profits, and charges a competitive rate of 10% corporate tax on locally sourced profits. Once a company submits its application, a dedicated QFC relationship manager is appointed to provide guidance on the registration process, obtaining a license and setting up operations. We also offer access to an independent and transparent legal environment based on English common law and an independent Employment Standards Office (ESO). Additionally, firms benefit from gaining access to Qatar's business community, especially now with our expected move to Msheireb Downtown Doha, which will house the new financial and business capital for Qatar. Finally, all QFC firms benefit from Qatar's extensive double taxation agreements network with over 60 countries.</p><h4>How has the number of new QFC licensed companies evolved in the recent years?</h4><p>The number of firms we register is definitely an important measurement of success for us as a financial center. While 2017 saw unprecedented events take place, QFC has proven challenges can turn into successes, and we have had our most successful year yet. In 2017, we witnessed a 66% increase in new firms being licensed YoY. As of December 2018, we have over 600 firms registered on our platform—well past the 50% mark of registering 1,000 firms by 2022. Our success is further evidence of the attractiveness of the QFC platform and the openness of Qatar as a market. Our model is unique in the region, and an increasing number of institutions from Qatar and around the world are clearly seeing the benefits of coming to Qatar and joining the QFC platform. There are also other measurements we look at and take into account. Our five-year roadmap announced at the beginning of 2017 sets out a number of targets for us to meet in the upcoming five years. These include establishing Msheireb Downtown Doha as Qatar's pre-eminent financial &amp; commercial destination and the first of its kind inclusive financial city in the region. Increasing the number of our licensed firms to reach 1,000 and in turn creating 10,000 jobs within the QFC ecosystem. We also aim to triple the licensed firm's assets under management. Finally, we are working toward increasing QFC firms' participation on Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE) with the goal of reaching 5% QSE market capitalization.</p><h4>What are some exciting new initiatives that QFC has set forth for 2018 and beyond? </h4><p>We are working on a number of exciting new initiatives that will be rolled out in 2019. Mainly, we will be focusing on providing access to regional activities and investments through the QFC platform. This is a new era for Qatar and for the QFC, as we look to attract regional headquarters of major international financial and non-financial services firms. On a more global level, we will continue to reach out to our partners and arrange B2B meetings to showcase the market sectors worth in Qatar. Just recently, we concluded roadshows in Madrid and Paris, as well as China, where we conducted networking events with professionals corporations and private firms. The roadshows provided us with an opportunity to highlight the strong historical relationship between Qatar and France, Spain, and China and to help companies looking to grow their businesses in the Middle East. Qatar opened the Middle East's first renminbi clearing center in 2015 to boost trade and investment between China and the region, and our roadshows are just another step towards enhancing the economic ties between Qatar and China.</p><h4>What is the specific role that the QFC plays in helping fulfill His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani's Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030?</h4><p>At the QFC, our mission is, and has always been, to drive economic development and diversification. Today, we work hand-in-hand with the government to develop a strategy that is in-line with the ambitions set out in QNV 2030 and the subsequent First and Second National Development Strategies. Being the country's only business and financial center has also allowed us to put Qatar on the map and reiterate the growing business opportunities available here ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup and beyond. We support the development of a world-class financial service industry and continue to broaden our platform to cater to the needs of the country and reaffirm our economic attractiveness. Our mandate so far has been successful; our firms, which recently crossed the 600 mark, manage roughly QAR75 billion in assets. We are playing a key part in the QNV 2030 roadmap by helping promote Qatar as a whole and the vast opportunities that are available in this thriving nation. Our roadshows have seen us visit Asia, Europe, and the UK, and we see great interest from these markets. Another aspect of our involvement in achieving the goals of QNV 2030 is our contribution to knowledge-sharing. At the QFC, we attract top international firms from various market sectors, and such businesses naturally bring along a vast amount of knowledge and professionals to the country, consequently adding value to the growth and prosperity of the local economy. However, we don't only look at firms, but at local talent as well. In 2009, we established QFBA, an entity that is fully committed to developing the business and finance skillset of Qatar's youth. Recently, one of the UK's leading universities, Northumbria University, joined hands with QFBA to offer degree courses in accounting, finance &amp; investments, and international banking.</p><h4>Which sectors represent the greatest opportunity for investors interested in doing business in Qatar?</h4><p>As one of the world's leading and fastest-growing business and finance financial centers, we will continue to promote the Qatar huge market sector worth and look to boost the financial services sector. That said, we are also focusing our efforts on highlighting the market sector worth available in professional and business sectors. These sectors include sports and events, where Qatar is investing close to USD20 billion until 2023 with opportunities available in event management, ICT, facilities management, and more. To leverage these unique opportunities, we have partnered with Aspire Zone Foundation to launch the region's first sports business district that aims to attract multinational corporations in the sports industry to Qatar through a dedicated incentive package and world-class services. Healthcare is another sector that is filled with opportunities; USD5.8 billion are estimated to be spent as Qatar plans to expand five hospitals and develop 56 healthcare facilities. The transportation sector is in full swing, with the Doha Metro aiming to provide 600,000 passenger trips per day by 2021. USD12.8 billion is being spent to deliver and operate a world-class transportation system and to support commerce, residence, and visitors for international events. Finally, the tourism and culture sector is seeing massive investment to develop Qatar as a world-class hub with deep cultural roots, with USD200 billion already invested in infrastructure that supports tourism and a dedicated government strategy to diversify Qatar's tourism offering. As previously mentioned, we will focus on developing a financial, sports, media and digital hub in Msheireb Downtown Doha. These are areas and sectors that are of vital importance to Qatar's development and the realization of the goals set out in QNV 2030.</p><h4>In what ways has the blockade allowed the QFC, and therefore Qatar, to compete more successfully? </h4><p>The blockade has had many positive effects on Qatar's economy. 2017 was the fastest growth period in the QFC's 13-year history since its establishment in 2005. In fact, we recorded a 66% increase in new firms being licensed on the QFC platform in 2017, compared to the year before. Not only has Qatar weathered regional challenges, but our economy has flourished by turning these challenges into undeniable opportunities for growth. Thanks to a united, coordinated effort across the public and private sectors, Qatar's GDP growth is projected to rise to 2.4% in 2018 from 1.6% in 2017. The strength and versatility of the Qatari economy is also recognized on an international level, with Moody's upgrading the banking sector's rating to stable in October 2018 and S&amp;P upgraded Qatar's outlook to stable in December 2018. The blockade of Qatar has in fact further positioned Qatar as a leading hub for international business, by providing unrivalled access to the Qatari market as well as a USD2.1 trillion market in Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, and Turkey. The current situation has also led us to find alternative solutions and helped to prove our resilience to grow. Our government has looked at new trade routes and continues to establish trade relations with a growing number of countries. Milaha has launched new container services, including to Oman, Kuwait, India, Pakistan, and Turkey. Mwani has developed relationships with other regional ports and shipping companies. Hamad Port, Qatar's main seaport, located south of Doha, began operations last year and is being further expanded. The foresight of this project means we can be self-reliant for imports. The blockade has also been a catalyst for change for the whole country—reforms in business will make Qatar stronger in the long run. These reforms include, completion of necessary legislations and decrees to facilitate investment, reduce bureaucracy, and reform the banking system, completion of food and water security projects and development of new industries and services and implementing constructions essential for the oil and gas industry. In addition reforms are in place to accelerate the completion of current infrastructure projects as well as the FIFA 2022 World Cup projects in line with the 2017-2022 National Development Plan and QNV 2030 and the implementation of the tourism strategy over a specified timeframe. These efforts help in encouraging the private sector to engage in these areas and provide them with the necessary framework to facilitate their success. Recently, Cabinet approved a draft law regulating and welcoming non-Qatari investments in all sectors of the economy, including the fields of banking and insurance. These efforts are a clear indication of Qatar's efforts to attract foreign investment and to continue the drive towards economic diversification. All of these factors have led to a surge in the number of companies setting up under the QFC as an alternative hub to access regional markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Exporting to Over 70 Countries]]></title>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most recent updates regarding the Nuqul Group's aggressive growth strategy?</h4><p>In 2015, the idea was to have a five-year business plan with specific KPIs and milestones for accelerating growth and achieving the business plan on a larger scale than anticipated. In May 2015, we increased our capital by bringing in some investors, namely Standard Chartered Private Equity. The idea is to be IPO ready; everything we do—every system, procedure, plan, and department—we are calling it IPO readiness. Whether we have an IPO in the end, merge with a conglomerate, or buy a number of players in the region, there will be some sort of an exit at least for the private equity team. What has happened in the industry and region has caught everybody by surprise. Pulp prices went up for 18 months in a row to historical highs, and prices of finished products went down. That was coupled with the removal of subsidies in some markets in the Gulf and other places, which also weakened purchasing power, so consumers were migrating away from our top-tier brands to a second and third or even fourth tier. All of this put pressure on everybody, and our plan became a continued aggressive approach and continue to explore organic and inorganic growth.</p><h4>What innovations and product solutions do you have in the pipeline as part of your comprehensive strategy?</h4><p>The first step is de-commoditizing the tissue. We are coming up with interesting propositions for different types of consumers whereby we do not only compete on price but on value, features, and enhanced customer satisfaction. We have already identified certain products within the tissue business that are totally different and disruptive to the industry. One small example we are test marketing is in Egypt in what we call Dueto. When you buy toilet paper you can ask for it soft or hard, but both options include the hollow cardboard core inside. You end up paying for the air inside at all stages—shipping, shelf space, and consumer use. We removed this core and inserted an extra small wrapped roll. The consumer just pops it out and can use whenever, wherever he/she needs. This innovation is an extra benefit; the consumer does not pay a single penny extra for it but gets an extra roll inside. That is creative and disruptive and is one example of many lines we are expanding within our existing business segments.</p><h4>What role does technology and e-commerce play in this disruption?</h4><p>Technology has two facets. One is e-commerce and online B2B and B2C, and we are the first to launch the B2B online store. All hospitals and hotels can actually book online and are connected to our enterprise resource planning system. The other element of e-commerce and online business is integrating with souq.com, Amazon, and many platforms. The other facet is our department for digital transformation, which is separate from the IT department and is in charge of these developments in addition to internal developments for our sales people, merchandisers, and staff members who can do everything online and utilize technology. Our fleets will be connected with the smart solutions where you control driving habits, savings, and route optimization, among other things. Our machines are state of the art; everything is being digitized and computerized as we speak. We are also starting to work with artificial intelligence (AI) to improve our in-store availability and shelf location, monitoring consumer habits and using analytics. We are at the forefront of technology as technology is the major platform and the tool that will enable us to move forward, both toward disruption and expansion. If you are not part of the future, you will be out.</p><h4>In terms of increasing exports, what are your key markets?</h4><p>We export to more than 70 countries between both raw materials and finished products. For target markets for expansion, Africa as a whole would definitely be one; there is also Pakistan and India. India and Pakistan are new markets for us in terms of finished products that we are looking at in addition to the markets we penetrated in 2018 such as Europe, the US, and others. We have strategies in place depending on the market, whether we want to enter through a distributor, franchise, or joint venture. The most important thing that differentiates Nuqul Group and Fine as a partner is our code of conduct and our values. At the end of the day, you can have people who are progressive, who have the means and the vision to do things that are important, but if they do not adhere to values and codes of conduct and ethics, it does not make good business sense.</p><h4>What are the current opportunities in Jordan?</h4><p>There are great opportunities. We have a new generation of brilliant Jordanians who are creative and at the forefront of technology. From my experience, what we need is the enabling environment, so if you create the right environment, then ideas will come. Renewable energy, mobile applications, smart phones, technology, and IoT will all develop as these young Jordanians come up with the ideas themselves. We need fewer unproductive taxes on them, and by unproductive taxes I mean taxes to cover the budget deficit. Government expenses are like a leaky bucket. However, the fact that a businessman can go and see five ministers in one week in Jordan tells you that the government is willing to listen. The issue is our ability to remove the excuses that we always use as obstacles such as “in Jordan it does not work“ or “we have a budget deficit so we cannot do it now.“ For example, the government is up to its neck in debt, but if you are in business, then this is the time to take more loans to spend on the capital investments in Jordan. But, we have to address all the issues comprehensively and on a long-term basis. We certainly need an economic plan with milestones, KPIs, timeframe, and accountability. Second, this plan should be trans-governance so no government whoever they may be can change it except when you go to a specific predetermined mechanism because things change. Third, we need a major mindset transformation, from a country that looks at collecting taxes to government that stimulates growth. We need to be bold and tackle these issues head on. Nonetheless, there are tools we can use to find innovative solutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[FDI for Medellí­n]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[catalina-restrepo-c-executive-director-aci-medellin]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2018 for ACI Medellí­n, and what were your priorities and greatest achievements during this period?</h4><p>ACI Medellí­n captures and seeks FDI resources for international cooperation to improve the quality of life of the citizens of Medellí­n, and we are aligned with the development plan Medellí­n Cuenta con Vos 2016-2019. Although we have annual goals, for me as a director, long-term goals are more important. For 2018, ACI Medellí­n targeted USD242 million in investment, and as of October, we have attracted investments totaling up to USD250 million. Which means that we not only have reached our goal, but we even exceeded it. As for jobs related to that investment, we achieved almost 2,000. Although we have annual goals, we always aim big because we know we can achieve big things. Medellí­n has many opportunities that we can take advantage of. Therefore, we are a 50-people team focused on Medellí­n and its metropolitan area from different approaches.<br>In terms of cooperation, in 2018 we exceeded expectations. Currently, we have a great project with the Ministry of Transport of Korea which reaffirms Medellí­n's commitment on air quality and sustainable mobility. Therefore, 2018 has been a tremendously positive year.</p><h4>What potential does ACI Medellí­n see in the ICT sector in Medellí­n that makes it a great target for foreign investment?</h4><p>Medellí­n has the most ambitious science, technology and innovation policy in Colombia. Currently, we invest 2.4% of the city's GDP in science, technology and innovation, when the national average is 0.67%, and in 2021, we will invest 3%. We are betting on Orange Economy, the creative industries, and the cultural sector. Grounded on these bases, we set up the Ruta N strategy, which is an anchor for investment attraction due to its landing strategy and added value that other cities do not have. There is also an opportunity in human talent. Training to cover the demand for employment in this sector must be short and customized to industrial needs. We count on SENA or our different educational institutions specialized in technology to train these young people. For us, it means that those young people will no longer be on the streets, but they will start generating income from an early age. This allows us to be on par with European countries, where formal education is 70% technical-technological and 30% university.</p><h4>Medellí­n has seen substantial investments in the tourism sector. What could this mean for business tourism in the city?</h4><p>It has been a boost that the world has given to Medellí­n for its internationalization. The city has transformed its difficulties into opportunities. To attract people, we started to attract renowned international events in tourism, business. This meant a joint effort from the business sector, the local government, and the academic sector. The world trusts in Medellí­n already due to, among other aspects, its institutional continuity regardless of the mayor in turn. Private entrepreneurs created the University-Enterprise-State Committee 16 years ago to integrate the government, the private sector and the academy in the construction of a new Medellí­n. We also involve foreign investors in these projects because we want them to stay in Medellí­n and feel part<br>of it.</p><h4>What are the strengths of Medellí­n and the region of Antioquia to attract foreign capital?</h4><p>They include citizen trust, our people, our commitment to make things happen and being excellent business partners. There is cooperation between the companies, the government, and the academy in the ecosystem. We have free zones, and we are working on a wider competitive infrastructure with the construction of the Toyo Tunnel. It will connect us better with Urabá and its three ports, it will change the history of Antioquia. Additionally, the quality of life in Medellí­n is extremely attractive, its quality public transport system and the vibrancy of the city makes Medellí­n and Antioquia a strong region.</p><h4>What initiatives does ACI Medellí­n take to promote Medellí­n in the international market?</h4><p>ACI Medellí­n carries out events such as Why Medellí­n? To do that, we study the areas that could be reinforced through foreign direct investment. For instance, the US is our largest investor and we work to strengthen the relationship of trust. However, there are other markets. Thus, when a government has already cooperated with Medellí­n, we know there is already a trustful relationship between businesspeople. Our cooperation agreement with Korea attracted Korean companies to explore Medellí­n, and the same has happened with Japan and the US. Cooperation is useful for investments. Also, we have created a network of ambassadors with the people from Antioquia living abroad. Receiving delegations from different countries that come to learn about Medellí­n and about what we are doing here, is another way to promote the city. With this continuous flow, we are getting the world to know us. In 2019, we want to reinforce our relations with the US and explore Canada. The Pacific Alliance has gained strength and new governments in other countries have begun to show interest in Colombia.</p><h4>Medellí­n has an agreement for fossil fuel-free streets. What has this meant for foreign investment?</h4><p>All these actions ensure greater quality of life for the people of Medellí­n. We want to be the capital of electric mobility by 2030. Therefore, we already have a plan to renew the buses and taxis fleets, and there is a project to create more electric stations. However, this poses us also new challenges because they are completely new initiatives, as in the case of insurers. Nevertheless, we are sure these actions will be reflected in the quality of life and investment opportunities.</p><h4>What projects and initiatives does ACI Medellí­n have for 2019?</h4><p>2019 will be an active year for ACI Medellí­n. We will continue working on all cooperation and investment attraction issues, though we will be leaders in the city of major events. We will host the World City Summit in 2019, and it will be the first time it is held in Latin America. Asian and European mayors who have never come to Colombia will visit us. We are also considering holding an international orange economy summit. In 2017, Medellí­n entered the World Network of Learning Cities and in 2019 we will be the headquarters of the Network. We are the only Colombian city and the third from Latin America to join that network. We have many events that had not arrived in Colombia. We will be focused on Aliados Medellí­n, an international allies' event. All these events will allow us to bring great things to Medellí­n.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[10% Growth in 2018]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[juliana-tobon-pena-president-metlife-2019]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2018 was extraordinary for the industry and MetLife. You are the third biggest insurance company in the individual segment and the sixth among all the insurers. How do you describe your goals for the next five years?</h4><p>In 2018, the market has grown by 10% in the individual segment. Group segment and personal accidents have grown above the market line as well. In total, the insurance market has grown by 5%, but MetLife has grown by 10%, allowing us to gain market share in the last four years. Moving forward, we hope to continue growing our market share above our immediate competitors at least in the individual segment. Of the three segments that we manage (individual life, group life, and accidents), individual life is our focus, and today it represents 60% of the company's portfolio. In five years, we want to be leaders in that line, and to achieve this, we have to innovate and create new products and technology. Moreover, the company has to offer greater coverage through digital media and strengthen our distribution channels.</p><h4>The insurance market in Colombia is increasingly competitive, and many international players are entering it. What separates MetLife from both its new and existing competitors?</h4><p>Our competitive advantage is our business model in the individual life segment. This model is unique and consists of a group of about 700 protection consultants distributed across Colombia's seven major cities: Bogotá, Medellí­n, Cali, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Pereira, and Manizales. These consultants identify potential clients and help them structure a risk map about their life, family, and personal circumstances to offer a suitable product for those specific needs. This personalized consulting model makes us different and unique in the market. We have extraordinary competitors, but this model is a sales force specializing in the life segment and is managed through MetLife employees who are part of our 1,000-strong workforce.</p><h4>How does MetLife attract and maintain better human capital?</h4><p>We have different search sources to attract required talent. We have migrated our selection and recruitment processes to social networks because we understand that it is one of the most popular forms of job search. We make agreements with recruiting companies and universities according to the different age profiles we have. We want to agree with a university so that students of last semester with a suitable profile can be part of a project in MetLife as their first work experience. The reduction of turnover is fundamental because the company invests a lot of time and money in attracting, training, and certification based on financial superintendence standards. If we lose this staff, we need to start the process again. To the extent that we retain our consultants, our sales force grows.</p><h4>What is the role of Colombia in the regional and global agenda of MetLife?</h4><p>Latin America represents 15% of MetLife's global business. Brazil and Colombia have enormous potential for the company. In Colombia's case, the operations are still small, but there is great potential in a country of almost 50 million inhabitants and a low penetration of the insurance market. There is also enormous potential to grow in the group life segment. This is the area where national and multinational companies offer life insurance within the compensation package to their employees as part of the benefits program. If the economy has high growth expectations, low unemployment rates, and a middle class that flourishes and enters into formality, the number of jobs increases and so does the potential of the group life segment or employee benefits. Moving forward, we want to grow in the individual life, employee benefits, and mass business segments. The latter is managed through the companies of public services, retail companies, supermarkets, and banks. The compensation funds are also important clients for us. In that universe, we can make a more aggressive insurance penetration regarding volume because there are more small life policies for more people. The penetration rate has been gradually growing in Colombia, and it is now 2.8% as compared to Latin American average of 3.1%; our best example in the region is Chile with 5%. In the most advanced economics in the world, it reaches 7%. However, Colombia has had gradual growth in its economy that has allowed these trends. All the actors in the insurance sector have made a great contribution in uplifting the sector.</p><h4>What can we expect from MetLife in 2019 and beyond?</h4><p>We are working hard to be digital, and we make important investments in technological tools. We want potential and current customers to have more access to our information through these channels, and our consultants to have digital tools. To that end, we will launch the platform for consultants to quote and subscribe digitally in 2019. We are also working to strengthen our product portfolio by improving it; we want it to be more competitive. We make market research to launch a new product that will allow us to adapt the insured value and the coverage to various segments of the population. As a result, we will be able to serve a much larger segment like the middle class.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2017 you revealed plans to ramp up production. Did you reach your targets?</h4><p>We have achieved most of the things that we planned to do over the last year. We have concluded an alternative evacuation route for our crude in OML 42, and today are producing almost 90% of our crude through our own international terminal at Oguta. We no longer send all our crude to Forcados, and only have about 10% going there. The facility has made our production steady because when the Forcados pipeline goes down, we stop production in all the fields, and this happens every two weeks. We are now able to avoid this, resulting in steady production, and this has been our most important achievement in the last year.</p><h4>What financial engineering are you strategizing in an era of high cost of capital to fund this expansion?</h4><p>The oil and gas business is like a two-way street, and once the oil price is stable and going up, then funds are automatically made available. As a result of the current price of oil, we are beginning to see great business in terms of the value gained from production. For us, USD75 is a great price, as we produce in the shallow water swamp and not deep water. We now plan to continue our drilling toward the end of 2018 and throughout 2019. We are bringing oil rigs to the site to begin drilling.</p><h4>Will you fund this expansion through a mix of your own equity and debt?</h4><p>We will find more funds as the value we have been receiving is increasing because we have steady production. The two things that affect production in the Niger Delta is being able to evacuate and being able to produce every day, and these two things go hand in hand. Since we have steady production and are able to produce every day, we can see a cash flow that can assist our future expansion. We want to start drilling before getting more funds; however, if we need to borrow more money in the future, we will do so because we have borrowed over the years and are repaying our loans. We borrowed large sums of money when the oil price was USD30, so now it is time to repay old loans while expanding.</p><h4>How are your plans for the gas power plant in the east of Nigeria going?</h4><p>They are great and in progress. Construction is planned for early 2019, and we are preparing to lay the pipeline for gas. When that happens we can start getting ready for construction. The plant is fairly large; therefore, we will also sell power. It will serve the majority of the states in the southeast, and the remainder will be sold to the national grid. The first phase will have a capacity of 750MW, which will supply gas to power it from our oil field. This is one of the reasons why the project was conceived in the first place, as we were looking for a way to utilize our gas production.</p><h4>Outside of oil and gas, which companies within the group are driving business?</h4><p>The oil and gas business is supported by service companies such as AWT, BIQ Dredging, and HDD company. Apart from that, we still have our civil construction companies like Hammer Corp, which does road construction. Our dry docking business also provides many opportunities for revenue, though looking into the future, apart from the investment we look at the power business and healthcare. We have a children's hospital in Okija that we expanded to include women and children, so we are investing more money into that. Ultimately, however, the production of oil remains the cash cow for the group, at least for the next two years. Still, in the long term, we are looking to diversify further. We need to first consolidate on the investments we have made, as most of these companies are set up and are all on their own. If the oil price remains stable for the next two years, we should be able to deliver some of those companies, as some are major investments like the dry dock.</p><h4>How do you see the infrastructure gap changing in the near future, and what needs to be done to address the situation?</h4><p>If the government plans to do something about it with the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), then it needs to enforce it now, as it will bring capital inflows into the country. Secondly, many businesses are not doing well because the climate has to be great for assure investors that when they invest money in oil and gas, they can collect their profits. When IOCs sold most of their assets, they knew very well the infrastructure required to produce all this was not available. No one was thinking about how oil and gas would be excavated, and so one of the reasons why the government needs to encourage more pipelines to be laid is because gas cannot be transported from the Niger Delta without pipelines. This is why there is a shortage of natural gas in hospitals or for cooking. It is all tied to infrastructure investment, and if the government focused on providing what is required for this investment to happen, then the issue of infrastructure will be addressed. The government needs to get the PIB signed off, as it has been in limbo for years now.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>For the group, we expect to have a great 2019 if nothing extraordinary happens. As long as the oil price is above USD50, then we are comfortable, and we expect a bright future for the group as all the work we have done over the past two years will start to bear fruit. This means that we have steady production, know what we are producing, and intend to ramp up production. If the oil price does not go down below USD60-70, then we will have a great year and can enough profits to start bringing up some of the projects that we have been keeping in the closet for some time now. Most of our success in 2019 will be based on the international market and international off takers, and our hopes lie in the price of crude, which we do not expect to change much from today.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current main focus of SCPD?</h4><p>SCPD continually focuses on investing in capital projects, CAPEX, and development projects. Current examples of such projects include the Jaber Causeway and Silk City. Our focus has been, and will remain, the same regardless of the oil price. We use a custom-made system for the preparation and monitoring of the national plan progress that allows the manager of each project to update us with their individual status, which adds responsibility and accountability to the role of the SCPD. We constantly strive to improve the efficiency of our project management and development, with one example of this being the integration of our new Astrolabe system that optimizes project selection, our decision support system, and data entry with macro models. We are currently focusing on patenting this system, which is unique insomuch that it carries out follow-ups by incorporating the use of artificial intelligence into project selection and simulation.</p><h4>What is the SCPD's stance on collaborating with the private sector?</h4><p>We are actively pushing for the government to support more PPPs and encouraging other entities in the government to secure projects that the private sector will perceive as attractive. Results are not achieved instantaneously; success in this regard is a lengthy process. The only way the Kuwaiti government can develop trust in the private sector is by producing economic results, an increase in job creation, and giving the private sector significantly more freedom to conduct its own business operations. Trust between the private sector and the government is gradually improving. There are an increasing number of infrastructure projects undergoing development, and the results are becoming more evident. Infrastructural projects, power stations, and Shamal Resort are the only PPPs that have been successfully implemented thus far, and this is undoubtedly insufficient. However, dealing with energy waste, city development, wastewater treatment, stages two, three, four, and five of the power stations, and the Agella beach tourist attraction are all examples of PPP that we are currently in the process of implementing. These projects are all in line with our overall vision of diversification and shifting the economy away from oil. We aim to do this through innovation, human capital, and increasing the inclusion of women in industry across society.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your plan for women's empowerment?</h4><p>We have a full-fledged program to help increase the political and economic inclusion of women. In our most recent initiative, for example, we had 61 women fully engaged in a program designed specifically to help them enter the business community and the political sphere. Part two was launched in October in collaboration with UN Women, Kuwaiti universities, and the Women Studies Center.</p><h4>What are SCPD's goals and objectives for 2019?</h4><p>In 2019, we will present our voluntary national report on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the UN. It is a substantial project led by SCPD that will engage with all government entities, the private sector, NGOs, the World Bank, and the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce. We have our own PR strategy, which involves the complete rebranding of the Kuwaiti national plan which initiative has been fully supported by all the ministers across the board. So far, the OECD, the UN, the World Bank, international think tanks, and universities have all acknowledged our National Vision for 2035, demonstrating the success of our PR efforts. Our projects will take time; however, the end results speak for themselves as our brand's credibility has gradually solidified on a global scale. The promotion of our brand is crucial, as it allows Kuwait to attract the relevant foreign direct investment to help us achieve our ultimate goal of Vision 2035.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[athbi-alenezi-co-founder-managing-partner-justclean]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to the creation of JustClean and what has it achieved so far?</h4><p>After my brother and I moved back to Kuwait from the UK, we realized that despite the abundance of laundry and dry cleaners, all such places were operating at full capacity. As a result, we decided to undertake research as to whether the majority of people were doing laundry at home or through professional services and what further capacity there was in this space. At the same time, we noticed a trend with consumers using online services much more readily. All of this was being considered by us just at the time that we saw the high-profile sale of Talabat.com, the online food delivery platform. This gave us a definite incentive to move ahead with the business. After meeting App developers, deciding what we needed, forming contracts with laundry services companies, and approaching legal authorities, we had finally realized how we could penetrate this market ourselves. From our own resources, we formed an initial capital budget of KD 15,000 and took out a loan for the rest of what was needed. The entire process from developing the idea to launching it took approximately six months.  It has now been two and half years since the JustClean launch and at present, we are active across the GCC, with operations in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Bahrain. We are planning to expand into Saudi Arabia as well in the coming months. Deciding to partner with our investors was a big risk that has definitely paid off.</p><h4>Since the acquisition of JustClean by Faith Capital Holding, how has the business been affected?</h4><p>It was a difficult process knowing with whom to collaborate after being approached by so many different high-level investors. My brother and I took an interest in Faith Capital because they were not just making the financial investment but also putting the effort into the business itself.  It has become a true partnership and Faith Capital has fully engaged with us in the operations and continuously builds upon the business which has led to an early expansion across the GCC. The partnership is really reassuring as we utilize their experience as our guidance.</p><h4>What differentiates JustClean from its competitors in the market? How does marketing fit into those strategies?</h4><p>JustClean is the first of its kind in the marketplace. There are apps in London and Germany offering a similar service; however, they only draw upon a single laundry service. We offer the option to select from a wide range of laundry service providers. We allow options and a selection, where customers can read and write reviews. We look after our customers so that if for any reason they are dissatisfied with a particular laundry service provider, they can select another and post feedback which other users will be able to view. In terms of competition, there is no other similar company in the market place because we have taken a unique approach within this service. 2019 will be challenging as we will have to execute operations in Kuwait, the UAE, and Bahrain simultaneously; each market is home to cultural differences that must be addressed differently. There are also other variables to take into consideration such as the number of ex-pats present in each country. Our experienced marketing team has created an amazing strategy for 2019 but JustClean is always ready if there are any changes. We evolve with the needs of our customers.</p><h4>What is JustClean open commitment to give back to the community? </h4><p>We take a percentage of each order and give it to charity. We also collaborate with well-known and government-approved charities for events regularly. This money does not come from the customers, but the company. It is not just about the image and marketing, it is about giving back to society a principle which is deeply important to ourselves and Faith Capital.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the operations planned in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We launched in Kuwait because the logistics here are great. However, in addition to running the app, we also run our own logistics service on our platform with selected partners. For the Saudi market, we are planning to launch a different product, a SaaS product that is based on a POS system. We are looking at the logistics while considering that Saudi Arabia has three big cities, the Eastern province, Riyadh, and Jeddah. Initially, we will enter the Eastern province because of its close proximity but we are equally excited about expanding into the entire Saudi market as soon as it is practicable to do so.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<intervieweelist0description><![CDATA[Mohammed Nabil Jaffar is CEO of Faith Capital Holding, a Kuwait VC fund focusing on MENA e-commerce businesses. Before Faith Capital, he owned, Talabat.com, an online food delivery platform acquired in 2010. Under his leadership the company became a market leader throughout the GCC which was successfully sold in 2015 to Rocket Internet, the German internet giant. This deal remains one of the largest internet technology transactions in the Arab world and Talabat and Mohammed are recognised as pioneers and key innovators of the e-commerce space in the GCC.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key factors are making Faith Capital such a successful and unique investment company?  </h4><p>Faith Capital was established in early 2017 to focus on investing in the technology space, predominantly supporting Arab individuals who work in the technology sector.  Faith Capital has invested in six companies to date and we are planning on investing in another one or two before the end of 2018. It is anticipated that there will God willing be further investments in 2019. Furthermore, we are creating a new marketing team that will establish a solid and highly strategic plan to drive forward our business growth in 2019 and the subsequent years. What makes us different from other VCs is our active participation within the companies we invest in. We are entrepreneurs investing in and supporting entrepreneurs. We are constantly helping the entrepreneurs progress by advising and nurturing them. This includes HR, operational, and technical assistance, or simply by brainstorming ideas. In addition, we seek Sharia-compliant businesses as we want to put an emphasis on advancing business in a strongly ethical way. As Faith Capital, we believe that religion can lead to successful and fulfilling businesses, a strong lesson I learned from the success of my grandfather. It was this that encouraged me, in 2008, to initiate my own entrepreneurial journey. A decade later, our activities are flourishing and my everyday challenge is to keep applying these principles in order to create reoccurring success in business. On top of it all, we are blessed to be surrounded by believers, achievers, and people who share the belief that a business has to be equally beneficial for all the parties involved by applying logical Islamic values.</p><h4>What have been the key changes in the Kuwaiti market lately that Faith Capital has had to consider when making its investments?</h4><p>In this part of the world, we are behind the Europeans and Americans when it comes to investing in the tech space. However, over the last three years, this sector has attracted a lot of money from within the GCC. An increasing number of investors from this region are investing in the technology industry because they truly believe in its potential. The trend is moving forward in the right direction and as a result, Faith Capital will not be working alone as other players enter this space and start to gather more confidence in the tech industry. Entering the technology space is, of course, not without its risks and one has to have patience. At present, investors in this part of the world are starting to understand how the game is played when it comes to tech companies and the sector is therefore evolving at a fast pace. Governments as well are taking positive steps to create initiatives to invest in both tech and non-tech startups and to improve entrepreneurship among Kuwaitis. Even though this is recognized as a long-term process, we have noticed a constant positive evolution through the years, making us very hopeful for the future.</p><h4>Have you seen any initiatives from the private and public sector to incentivize this entrepreneurship in Kuwait?</h4><p>We have the Kuwait National Fund for SME Development where I was a board member for one year. The National Fund is continuously evolving and constantly improving. The aim of the government with this Fund is to improve and encourage entrepreneurship, as well as the ecosystem when it comes to SMEs. The economy is shifting away from oil revenues; it is, therefore of paramount importance for Kuwait to expand and diversify the general economy by investing in Kuwaitis and encouraging them to do business. At the same time, we should change the mentality of individuals by instilling within them the principle that we should do as our country does for us. Ultimately, the more we grow as individuals the more our country grows with us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[faisal-mansour-sarkhou-ceo-kamco]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With KAMCO recently acquiring the majority stake of Global Investment House, what will be the company's new ambitions and how will its role change in the national and international market? </h4><p>KAMCO has performed well this past year and our results are a testament to our progressive growth and enhanced operational performance. As of September 30, 2018, we managed to maintain our Assets under Management (AUM) at over USD9.5 billion and achieved a strong track record of 102 successful investment banking transactions worth approximately USD16.1 billion. In addition, we recently acquired a 69.5% majority stake in Global Investment House, one of the leading investment firms in Kuwait and the region. KAMCO continuously strives to enhance its contribution to a sustainable future in the local capital market by taking the role as lead managers in several debt issuances that have stimulated local and economic growth. As we grow into a larger entity, we will be able to offer a wider selection of diverse investment solutions and introduce new offerings that can add great value toward local and regional investors. Our acquisition is, therefore, in line with the Amiri 2035 Vision. By pursuing its vision of becoming the preferred asset management and investment banking player in Kuwait and the region, KAMCO can cater to a wider network through diverse investment solutions in various asset classes. This will assist the country's vision of becoming a key regional financial hub. KAMCO has also been awarded an exclusive role in providing its extensive advisory services to assist in the Boursa Kuwait privatization initiative. KAMCO is seeking further roles and opportunities to collaborate with entities within the public sector, as well as future privatization initiatives. On a regional level, prior to purchasing the majority stake in Global, KAMCO assessed the benefits of gaining access to Global's international presence in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey. Through Global's established presence, both firms can further expand their exposure and offerings throughout the MENA region. KAMCO has now taken the first step towards its vision of becoming the preferred investment firm in the region. The next step will include a collaborative approach to assess and identify the key strength areas within each firm. This collaborative approach will efficiently assist the business integration model in terms of product offerings, technology ecosystems, and geographical reach.</p><h4>In what ways can the ratio equity market capitalization, GDP, and the debt market ratio be improved?  </h4><p>Kuwait's market cap-to-GDP ratio at over 70% is broadly in line with major GCC peers. We look at this ratio from two angles—the first as a pure valuation metric of the market compared to the economy, and the other as a measure of the extent of corporatization in a country. Though the market cap-to-GDP ratio for Kuwait is below some of the developed markets where the ratio is well above 100%, the ratio does not fully represent Kuwait's entire corporate market. This is mainly because the ratio excludes predominantly family-owned private businesses and conglomerate groups. Family businesses in Kuwait range from both single-industry corporate entities to large institutionalized multi-business conglomerate groups which contribute significantly to the economy. Family owned businesses in Kuwait are typically well run, funded by internal equity, and have high rates of return, which generally disincentivizes such entities from taking the IPO or listing route. Public stock markets' performance is key to pushing the market cap-to-GDP ratio up as well. The performance of stock markets post the global financial crisis did make GCC investors more risk averse and led to lower trading activity on regional indices, and Kuwait was no exception. However, we expect the trading activity in Kuwait's stock market and market performance to pick up from higher passive and active flows from regional mandates, as Kuwait witnessed upgrades in market status and features in global index compilers. The upgrades should drive the initial rally in large cap names included in these upgrades, as witnessed from the performance of the Premier Market Index YTD in 2018. However, high-quality names outside this list are also likely to see gains over the medium term from more passive and active flows. Primary stock market activity also becomes crucial in pushing up the degree of listed entities, and corporate issuers will look for leadership from larger issuers in terms of activity to ascertain the conditions for flotation. New Issuers will look at equity market valuations and market performance going forward. The development of SMEs in Kuwait is clearly the first step in realizing this goal; an independent private sector and ecosystem for smaller players is instrumental in realizing more advanced corporate evolution. At present, the contribution to Kuwait's GDP from SMEs is in single digit, while the sector employs only around quarter of the workforce; however, the National Fund for SME Development, the Industrial Bank, and the Kuwait Small Projects Development Company are working toward the development of the SME sector. Corporate debt markets should improve going forward and should follow the lead of sovereign bond issuances by Kuwait. Kuwait's sovereign bond issuances of over USD15 billion were instrumental in creating a secondary yield curve benchmark and should drive corporates to issue more conventional and Islamic debt instruments. Furthermore, we were also advisors to Kuwaiti Banks in issuing Basel III-compliant bonds and sukuk to enhance their capital base and will continue to assist corporates in their endeavor to diversify capital base. Kuwait's eligibility for the JP Morgan emerging market government bond indexes starting from January 31, 2019 is also a big positive.</p><h4>What will the roadmap and outlook for KAMCO's key business segments and asset classes look like?  </h4><p>We see a potential for growth within each segment. Given the ongoing volatility in the global financial markets and the associated concentration risk for each asset class, we believe that investors should aim for a diversified portfolio of investments. Therefore, the company follows a risk-weighted framework for asset class selection that weighs in country risk, company risk, and return potential. We eventually offer our clients access to all assets classes globally while assessing them with our best-in-class technology. In terms of asset classes, equity markets in the GCC are expected to see higher institutional interest going forward, and this is further solidified by the recent inclusion of certain GCC countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait as emerging markets into global index compilers such as MSCI and FTSE. As a result, we expect more passive fund flows, higher foreign ownership of stocks, and increased trading activity on the region's exchanges. Being a prominent player both on the sell-side and as one of the region's largest asset managers, KAMCO will continue to work with regulators and market participants to provide thought leading research, best execution in terms of trading, and asset management across funds and portfolios.

		<title><![CDATA[30% Production Increase 2018]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[marcela-vaca-general-director-geopark-colombia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have things changed in the past year and to what do you attribute the remarkable success of this year?</h4><p>The increase in our revenue and production, and the rise of the company to become one of the largest operators in Colombia can be attributed to several factors. First, the increase in the price of oil which obviously benefited all the actors in the industry. Second, our exploratory success which contributed to an important increase in our production: during 2017 we had two discoveries and so far in 2018, we have made another two discoveries that are currently being tested, in addition of the continued extension of the Tigana-Jacana play concept in Llanos 34. And lastly, our ability to reduce operational costs, successfully test our new discoveries and manage our surface risks with special attention to our engagement with stakeholders.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the development of the Llanos 34 project over the past year?</h4><p>At present, 98% of our gross production comes from Llanos 34; it is the heart of our Colombian operation and definitely the most important asset of the whole company. Equally significant, around 80% of the company's EBITDA comes from Llanos 34. During 2017 our production increased in 36% and 30% during 2018 (November), mostly coming from Llanos 34. This asset has largely contributed to GeoPark's overall growth and continues to have enormous potential.</p><h4>What role does Colombian operations play in GeoPark's global portfolio?</h4><p>Other than providing an important share of the production, Colombia has a strategic location not only for allocating teams and support for other projects, but also for the company's managerial headquarters. Colombia continues to be a highly desired location for investment and having a solid presence is an important asset to continue to grow in an active market. Colombia is probably one of the countries in Latin America that has the most qualified professionals, legal stability, and steady economy. On top of that, GeoPark's Colombia operations contribute a high percentage of the EBITDA and production.</p><h4>What initiatives helped you to earn the Good Neighbor Award and what ways do you plan to work with local communities in the future?</h4><p>We are extremely proud of receiving that award because resolving conflicts with our neighbors is something that we have very worked hard on. When GeoPark started in 2012, we faced often blockades and permanent conflict for nearly two years. That led us to structure a whole different approach to how we handle relationships with our neighbors. We worked hard in strengthening one-to-one relationships while training our neighbors in conflict resolution and leadership. We also established “Cúentame“ a solid program to record and resolve our neighbors complains and expectations, and also got all our staff, including operational and administrative teams, sincerely and decidedly involved in resolving our neighbor's requests and sharing with them, on a quarterly basis, the results of our operations which allow us to keep them informed about the evolution of our business and prevent some risks related to it. The goal was getting to know each other and above all, creating trust through a regular dialogue where we anticipated alerts, strengthened community leaders, and resolved conflicts. Our initiatives have made a significant difference and for the last four years, we have not had any blockades affecting our production. GeoPark arrived in Colombia six years ago in an area that had no oil activity, and the company has grown from zero wells to over 30, nine fields, and more than 65,000 operated barrels. Indeed, there still multiple challenges, but we remained committed to creating value and giving back.</p><h4>How has GeoPark's commitment to responsible extraction and taking care of the environment evolved?</h4><p>Our integrated system of values is called SPEED, which stands for safety, people, environment, employees, and development. Based on this we have a commitment to nature and our operations are structured around this promise. In Colombia, we have also been certified with ISO 14000. Moreover, we are engaging in environmental investments and trainings as well as participating in studies with local or regional NGOs. We constantly strive to being better and to create programs to make our operation more sustainable. For example, we are working on a solar alternative energy project, with the pilot project providing solar energy for one of our fields and councils in 2019. On a larger scale, we are also transitioning from diesel to natural gas, not only for cost reduction but also because we are committed to the reduction of emissions. In fact, we expect to be certified in carbon footprint very soon. Other than that, we are reutilizing our water and have so far reduced our water consumption by 40% through reserve osmosis. Notably, we recently got approval to use a special oven to dehydrate our drilling cuts, which is something we have been investigating for the last two years. It will allow reuse the cuts either to build bricks or mix it for construction material. The oven is currently being tested so that it can be used for future contractors. By utilizing the drilling cuts, we will avoid any possibility of pollution, reduce costs, and make bricks to build the local infrastructure.</p><h4>What can we expect from GeoPark in 2019 and beyond?</h4><p>Of course, we will continue to explore and develop Llanos 34, but we will also continue to look for organic and inorganic growth opportunities to achieve our goal of being a leader independent Latin American oil and gas explorer, operator and consolidator.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Expanding Banking Coverage]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[alvaro-f-pimentel-ceo-itau]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What made ITAíš choose Colombia for expansion?</h4><p>We had a proposal for Latin America and ITAíš aims to be the most important Latin American bank, supporting regional companies and investors looking to expand as well as global companies who are planning to enter Latin America. Any company with an aim to target Latin America must include Columbia in its strategy, not only because of its relevance in the region but also because the country has a population of 50 million people. Moreover, Colombia has dealt successfully with inflation and the drop in oil prices. Particularly, Colombia has never defaulted on its debt. According to my knowledge, Colombia recorded negative GDP growth only once during the last 15 years. With these facts in mind, it would be wrong to claim that we are a Latin American bank if we didn't operate in Colombia. ITAíš's Colombia operations were established here six years ago with a small second floor wholesale bank with the objective of understanding the country. We waited for the opportunity to have a full-scale bank here, which arrived in 2016 when ITAíš merged with CorpGroup in Chile. CorpGroup owned two banks: Helm Bank and CorpBanca. After the merger, CorpGroup became a part of the ITAíš Unibanco Holding. In May 2017, ITAíš started integrating Helm Bank and CorpBanca with ITAíš. The process was completed by end-2017 and at present, we have only one bank and brand integrated under the same culture.</p><h4>What is the importance of the ITAíš brand for your business model and specifically when entering new markets?</h4><p>Talking about institutional investors, the brand of ITAíš is extremely important. Once we integrated the brand ITAíš in our branches, the regulator was clear that ITAíš has a long-term compromise with Colombia. When talking about retail, we represent 30% of the value of the ITAíš brand in Colombia while the other 70% will depend on the quality and value proposition we are creating for Colombia. It is easy to say that you have to be customer-centric, but it is hard to implement. A company has to be creative and experiment with all sorts of operations, from small tasks to digital strategy, while keeping the clients' needs in mind throughout the entire process.</p><h4>What is the competitive advantage that ITAíš can offer its customers?</h4><p>First, ITAíš has an organized way to work—one that focuses on setting a different value proposition for our three segments. Our aim is to not be the cheapest bank in the market, but I believe that it is possible to have the most competitive value proposition, so that our offer for one client with the service quality of digital solution can be the best value offer in Colombia. ITAíš employs the same technology in Brazil and while it is applying the same model here, the solution needs to consider the needs of the Colombian market. The company has spent the last year understanding and preparing this value proposition and the local market, and it is using the expertise and knowledge from its operations in Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina to set a value proposition for Colombia. Although we started the value proposition in 2018 after completing the integration, we continue to conduct polls to better understand what the client wants.</p><h4>What unique challenges did ITAíš find in the Colombian market?</h4><p>Colombia has a highly organized financial market with strong players, thus presenting tough competition. We had to deal with a tough market during the integration process; it wasn't a part of our plan but we are succeeding in our efforts. It is better to work on organizing a company's operations in a new market when the market is not so strong because there are less opportunities to lose. At present, looking at the non-performing loans related to the retail market, I think that the market is at an inflection point.</p><h4>How crucial is expanding banking coverage to underserved populations for Colombia's growth?</h4><p>The main point is that the marginalized part of the population has to get inside the consumer market, of which financial systems are a part of. This is a challenge not only for the banks but for the entire country. There is a need to formalize the next segment of the population, and while looking at worldwide regulations, it is important to understand that banks should deal with a formalized sector. Different stakeholders hold clashing opinions in Colombia, but the country has a huge potential to start a strong process of formalization, as close to 50% of Colombia is yet to be formalized. We have an opportunity and the growth and economic responsibility to maintain the fiscal side and get inflation under control with sustainable GDP growth of 2.7 to 3.3%. If that is maintained for two to three years, it will allow the underserved part of the population to get inside the formalized market in all different sectors. Such an outcome is extremely important for financial services.</p><h4>What can we expect from ITAíš in Colombia in the coming years?</h4><p>We have an organized plan and a vision that we want to be the best retail bank in Colombia. If an interested investor comes to Colombia and a consulting firm wants to present a successful story about a bank that expanded to Colombia, ITAíš will be the reference. Our vision to maintain that image of ITAíš.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Transformation Ahead]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[mohammed-alshaibi-ceo-tamkeen-technologies]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the past year, what key changes have you seen in the IT sector in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The ICT sector in Saudi Arabia has gone through a major transformation recently. ICT is an increasingly integral part of our economy, and isolating ICT as a separate sector is not necessarily accurate today. The distinction between the ICT sector and other businesses are now becoming blurred. This is not only the case in Saudi Arabia, but a global trend. We work in many sectors. We initially started with the Ministry of Labor and Social Development but are now working with other sectors such as the education and health sectors. Tamkeen's role is to provide IT services and solutions that help government agencies solve problems in either a self-sustainable mode or at a reduced cost. Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 has an aggressive plan to reform, and technology is an integral part of this plan.</p><h4>What key areas will you focus on in the medium term?</h4><p>Our focus in 2019 will be to continue to develop the leads we generated through our PPP initiatives, and hopefully we will witness an increased adoption rate. One way to reduce the government's IT costs is to migrate hosting its IT systems such that they are hosted in country and managed by local IT service providers such as Tamkeen or to at least adopt managed IT services as an alternative to running their own data centers or hiring outsourced IT employees. The adoption and utilization of open-source technologies as an alternative to the traditional commercial software packages is another area that we will focus on in 2019. Tamkeen has developed several products to address new government issues, especially in traditional systems such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), project management, and strategy management. We have an excellent track record in deploying and customizing open-source solutions, especially for ERP systems in the private and semi-government sectors. We will focus more on that and soon provide full ERP solutions for the government sector. Currently, our ERP solution is targeted for small to medium government agencies, as a viable option to commercial products that have significantly higher capital and operational costs, especially if there is a need to integrate with either custom-built systems or systems from other vendors. Current project management tools are not fully integrated with ERP tools, so we are working on a solution that integrates tightly with our ERP systems, for which we see great demand.</p><h4>Are you seeing a change as government agencies work to achieve their KPIs for 2020?</h4><p>Most government agencies are actively working to achieve their 2020 National Transformation goals, and most heads of government organizations want tools to monitor the execution of these projects. We have developed a simple solution targeted at executives and ministers and have proposed it to some government agencies. Where it has been received extremely well, and in 2019, we will actively promote it to other government sectors. Since we already have pre-built products and components, it is extremely easy and quick for us to respond to varying requests by customizing our pre-built components to address the demands of the various government sectors. Many are approaching the deadline and realizing they are late. Everyone has deliverables, and we give them a viable option. We have a proven success story and a great reputation in the market.</p><h4>In 2019, do you expect to derive revenue from PPP and open source?</h4><p>We expect PPP will still be a significant portion of our business with managed services also expected to grow significantly. However, Tamkeen is not only in it for the financial rewards; we are a government-owned company, and our main goal is to provide high-quality jobs in the IT sector for Saudi citizens, male or female, while helping the public sectors achieve its 2020 National Transformation goals and ultimately help us all achieve Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[15 Major Projects in 3 years]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[juan-gabriel-perez-executive-director-invest-bogota]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the investment climate in Bogotá in the last year?</h4><p>2017 was a great year for the city, since certain interesting strategic sectors consolidated. Bogotá better positioned every year as a global business destination. For instance, América Economí­a ranked us the fourth-most attractive city in Latin America, when 15 years ago we were in 16th place. Bogotá has an interesting value proposal regarding the size of its economy; it is the same size as the economy of Ecuador and is bigger than countries like Uruguay, Paraguay, Costa Rica, and Panama. The human talent in Bogotá is also key. There are more than 115 higher education institutions, and every year more than 140,000 students graduate from these universities, 33% of them with postgraduate degrees. A third of the country's tech professionals are in Bogotá. We continue to work to make Bogotá a city not just with a better investment climate but also a better quality of life. That is what people seek when they move to a city like ours: gastronomy, culture, arts and public spaces, and events. We work on more than 25 business-oriented events, like ARTBO (International Art Fair of Bogotá), Bogotá Audiovisual Market, Music Market, and Bogotá Fashion Week.</p><h4>Which sectors in Bogotá receive the most attention from foreign investors?</h4><p>In Bogotá, currently, the local government and the chamber of commerce are working together on a development agenda. The city is not only strengthening its service sector, but also providing new opportunities for manufacturing. Invest in Bogota has currently five teams, two of them working in the service sector: one is oriented toward value-added services and the other is on creative industries. The national government is also interested in this digital content industry, and Bogotá will certainly benefit. Regarding the manufacturing sector, we have two teams: one focused on the healthcare industry and the other one on manufactured products that can be sent via air, such as processed food, construction material, and electronic devices. We are looking at Chinese products that now have a tariff in the American market, so we can export our products to the US. The fifth team is infrastructure oriented. There are great challenges to be solved concerning mobility, urban development and logistics, and we are currently prioritizing 10 projects out of more than 40 that have been studied. These 10 main projects represent more than USD13 billion, and this could be an area for investment where foreign companies help the city's development. Some of these projects include a subway system, a second terminal of the airport, and a water treatment plant. All these projects are part of the work we do here. We help the city find global investors that can help build the infrastructure that Bogotá needs.</p><h4>What is the role of the creative industries in Bogotá, and how does Bogotá stand out in this sense?</h4><p>Bogotá has been working in the creative industry sector for more than two years, and there is currently encouragement from the federal government. The Bogotá Audiovisual Market, which gathers producers, filmmakers, and so on, is an event we have been working on. Almost 80% of the companies in Colombia in the audiovisual sector are in Bogotá. It is also one of the sectors that is rapidly growing. In the last 10 years, 50 projects have arrived in the city, and in the last three years, with Invest in Bogota, we have brought in 15 big projects. Bogotá is now seen as a business hub. There is a significant number of companies setting up in the city and using the human talent, the strategic geographical location, and the neutrality of the language. This sector has a bright future.</p><h4>What other industries and sectors is Invest in Bogotá interested in?</h4><p>All industries are welcome in our city. The fact that they are not in these priority sectors does not mean they cannot use what we have. The services sector represents the 62% of the city's GDP. Business services are also increasingly important. The city must continue to invest in education and formation. We are currently working with the Chamber of Commerce, which is one of the biggest in Latin America, with more than 450,000 affiliates, to bridge the gap between the needs of companies and the graduates of higher education institutions, so that it matches the requirement of the business sector. We have made considerable efforts with the Ministry of Labor, Secretariat of Economic Development, the Chamber of Commerce, and more. The city has a strong long-term vision.</p><h4>What will be the expectations, challenges, and changes for Invest in Bogotá in 2019?</h4><p>The trade war between the US and Asia is a situation that we need to monitor closely. Another challenge is the tax reform currently taking place in Colombia; we need our taxes to be competitive with other countries. Another aspect is enhancing free zones, so that Bogotá has some of these zones inside the city, and companies do not have to go outside of the city. We are optimistic about 2019. We have at least 40 projects in mind and are looking for major global companies to settle in the city, which will help with Bogotá's development, promotion, and transformation. We also need to continue to work side by side with the local administration and the federal government to have better results.

		<title><![CDATA[60% of Clients High Net Worth]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[johnson-chukwu-managing-director-cowry-asset-management]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your expansion plans progressed throughout 2018, including opening a South Africa office?</h4><p>We modified our strategy and are working on setting up a banking license as we feel there is space within the commercial banking sector, so we have broadened our service offering to ensure an enduring customer base. We currently have the investment banking business which is Cowry Asset with an issuing house, underwriting, financial advisory services and we have Cowry Treasurers which is a mutual fund manager. We also have Cowry Realty, which came about due to the needs of our customers. Many of our customers have their wealth in real estate, therefore we set up Cowry Realty to manage their real estate assets.</p><h4>Did you see an uptake in the economy in 2018?</h4><p>Some aspects of our business saw major uptake, for instance wealth management. The size of the portfolios we manage tripled in 2018. Because of the economic downturn, many investors did not want to manage their resources themselves, therefore we enjoyed a lot of referrals throughout the year.</p><h4>Are you trying to keep a balance between corporate and individual clients?</h4><p>Currently, 60% of our clients are High Net Worth individuals. However, corporate clients give us more volume but less income. For visibility you need the corporate clients, although the corporate clients give minimal income but they boost your volume.</p><h4>In 2Q2018 the oil sector shrank by 4% whereas the non-oil sector and services grew by 3.1 and 2.1% respectively. Does this make you more optimistic this year about economic growth? </h4><p>What happened last year was that the oil sector shrank by 4% in 3Q but the oil sector contribution to GDP was about 8.8%. When you look at the oil sector performance you are looking at volume of production, which was about 1.8 million barrels per day, while the government target was 2.3 million. To measure the GDP contribution of the oil and gas sector they look at what is the economic activities that the oil and gas sector is creating. If the rate of production is higher you will see an uptake in terms of that sectors performance, but if the performance is lower you will see a shrinkage. The shrinkage we saw in terms of crude production was more than compensated for in terms of crude price. When you have negative volume but positive price variance, the implication is that the other sectors of the economy will still report a decline. The oil and gas sector contributes around 8.5 to 9% to GDP, but the main contributor to the GDP is the agriculture sector followed by trade followed by the telecommunications sector and then the manufacturing sector and the oil sector, followed by the construction industry. If you look at non-oil sectors, the agriculture sector did not contract but slowed from a 3.2% to a 3%. Manufacturing slowed down, the telecommunication sector slowed down, while the trade sector came out of recession.</p><h4>40% of tax revenues come from the oil sector which only represents 8.5% of GDP. How can this be changed?</h4><p>Other sectors have to grow. The tax rate in the oil and gas sector is very steep: the petroleum tax is about 95%. It is high compared to all other industries. Corporate tax in Nigeria is 30%. Also, because the hydrocarbon tax is calculated in dollar terms, when you convert it to naira it is even higher, while other taxes are calculated in naira. For that to reverse, a couple of things need to happen. The economy needs to be formalized, as a lot of economic activities are not taxed correctly since the government cannot track them. The largest economic sector, agriculture, is not formalized, hence not taxed. Therefore, 20% of economic activity has no tax coming from it. The trade sector accounts for 16% of GDP, but again, many traders do not have formal structures so they are not taxed. You need major formalization to generate tax revenue from these huge sectors.</p><h4>How competitive is the sector for the type of services you provide?</h4><p>We provide more personalized service than most of our competitors and in a lot of instances we end up creating a close personal relationship with our clients. They cannot get this kind of personalized service from the conventional banks. You can have somebody that will call you at 1am and just wants to clarify something or ask you a question but this cannot be done with most of the financial institutions. We have developed a culture that fits into the Nigerian social fabric. We build a personal relationship so that the client feels attached to you. That is the key element to private banking which a lot of large institutions do not have the capacity to provide.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Cowry in 2019?</h4><p>I think 2019 will be interesting both for the company and for the country. To look at the prospects for the company we need to consider the outlook for the economy, which starts at the political level. We believe that regardless of who wins the elections, investor confidence will be restored. Some people think the economy will boom but we do not believe so. We think as long as the election is peaceful, the economic environment will calm down immediately afterwards. We see investment opportunities in the country which people are not tapping into because of political risk, however this will moderate at the end of March. The second factor is, especially if a business-oriented President is elected, there will be a scramble for Nigerian assets. The Nigerian stock market lost close to 18% of its value, but beyond that, the Price-to-Earnings ratio of any of these companies has fallen 9 to 10 times, to among the lowest in Africa today. That means that people who buy into Nigerian equities at a time like this will be almost certain that market prices will recover next year, which means we see a lot of investment opportunities after the election. We also expect a lot of foreign direct investment in the form of equity into corporate entities. These are areas that will play major roles where we guide foreign investors on where to invest and we also help local institutions invest, either within or outside the country. Lastly, we think the bond market will recover this year and will generate good returns.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[joao-pedro-matos-fernandes-minister-environment-energy-transition]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In a few sentences, what are the main highlights and achievements of your mandate at this point?</h4><p>We started our mandate based on three integrated policy areas which are fundamental in order to guarantee prosperity in the long run: decarbonizing our economy, valuing the territory and its habitats and striving for a more circular use of our resources. As of now, all these strategies are being deployed on the field: the National Program for Territory Ordinance (PNPOT), the National Plan for Circular Economy (PAEC) and the National Roadmap for Carbon Neutral Portugal 2050 (RNC2050). And to make it happen we have our Environmental Fund, which has been crucial to finance the integration of these principles among municipalities, companies, and citizens.</p><h4>How do you see the role of the private sector in addressing sustainability challenges and advancing the Portugal's agenda to become “a truly clean energy" country?</h4><p>One of the things that we have seen during this mandate is a raising awareness by companies that change is coming, sooner than they expected. Now, some have chosen to bury their heads in the sand and simply continue to go for incremental solutions, or insisting that there are regulatory barriers that hinder their competitiveness. I am not saying that they are wrong, but the fact is climate change or resource scarcity will not end by law-decree. If you have a business, you must prepare. I am glad to see more and more industries in Portugal that are placing decarbonization and circular economy front and center in their business models. Look at textiles, for example, or the metalwork's sector, or ceramics. They are investing in R&amp;D and thinking about new business models that reduce costs and guarantee materials for their future. All the while striving to emit less and preserve local jobs. For me, that is sustainability. And, at last but not least, high-tech startups are redirecting their solutions towards fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals. One clear example was the great success of the Govtech competition, by the Ministry of Administrative Modernization.</p><h4>What are the main advantages of investing in Portugal's green energy sector and what steps are being taken to attract FDI?</h4><p>Portugal has a trifecta of highly valued assets: sea, sun, and wind. And I would risk a forth, which is skill. When we think of green energy sector, we tend to focus on the big projects — windmill, solar, water — and, it's a fact that we have an extremely high-value industry both in hardware (e.g. metalworks) and software (e.g. electronic systems). It's not by chance that we attract companies like Siemens, which may come to benefit of experienced PT companies like A. Silva Matos and others. However, the green energy sector is also made of smaller projects. Of bio-economy, for example, in which we have an enormous potential for development, both on the “blue" side (sea, river) but also on the “green" side (forest, agriculture), combining the cascading of value extraction from natural biomass with energy production. And in that context we certainly have a solid and growing pool of companies and competences, from north to south of the country: CIIMAR, in Leixíµes, BLC3, in Oliveira do Hospital, Católica School, in Porto, and companies like SilicoLife and A4F.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions and goals for the Ministry for the Environment and Energy Transition for 2019?</h4><p>In 2019 we will continue moving forward with our main orientations, mainly in decarbonizing the public transport sector. The most evident effort will certainly be in continuing the expansion of the subway lines of Oporto and Lisbon. But there is another area, in particular, that we want to focus on, and that is financing. To have the right mix of public and private financial support is crucial in guaranteeing a safe and just low carbon and circular transition of our economy; and there is a lot to tackle. It is impossible to expect that public funding alone can support this. On the other hand, we have a financial system which is still very much focused on short term and linear forms of value. That, in general, runs away from innovation and environment-based solutions and deems it “risky." But we know how placing your chips in “linear, solid" investments holds up in the long run — and banks are beginning to realize that the risk of ending up with stranded assets is, in fact, far greater. The Commission is working on a taxonomy for sustainable finance; the European Investment Bank is pulling all stops to support projects on circular and bioeconomy; the next Cohesion Fund will demand an allocation between 65% to 85% of support to smart, sustainable (low-carbon and circular) projects. We have 12 years to come to a full stop on the climate breakdown of our natural system, and this means we have 12 minutes to act. I am confident on Portugal's resilience and ingenious drive to tackle these challenges.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[shina-peller-owner-aquila-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do your non-entertainment operations fit within the group?</h4><p>Although Quilox is the most popular brand in the Aquila group and Aquila records has also gained widespread recognition they contribute less than 10% to the revenue of the group I went into the entertainment and hospitality space due to my passion and the genuine belief that I could redefine the industries. I am not sure entertainment was meant to fit but rather part of a diversification strategy driven by passion and conviction. Aquila Group is a conglomerate with interests in oil and gas although we focused more on the downstream side of the business. However, now we are restructuring to move more into EPCI, mid-stream, and upstream. The construction Subsidiary also has executed several projects for government and also in the private sector. In fact Aquila Building built Quilox so if that expertise wasn't resident in the group setting up Quilox would have been a bigger challenge. We also have a few properties that we build and sell, such us our residential project Eagle Heights, which is coming up in Banana Island soon. We also do a great deal of procurement and supplies for private companies and the government with Aquila Global Resources Limited. On the entertainment side, Aquila Records was established to develop talented Nigerians and Africans and help them become superstars. We have artists like Air Boy, as well as my brother, Que Peller, the only artist magician in the world. We also have Base One, an indigenous rap artist, Beezy, and my daughter, Naomi Peller. Quilox was established with the goal of revolutionizing nightlife in Nigeria; hence, the name, which means redefinition. My financial advisers thought I was overexposing myself in a business that has a notoriously short life span. However, Nigeria was one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, and I knew Lagos, as the commercial capital of Nigeria, had great potential. I saw a gap in the nightlife industry that needed to be filled. Quilox has been around for five years now.</p><h4>How large is the entertainment portfolio of the group compared to the other areas?</h4><p>It would be unfair to compare some of the other businesses in the group to the entertainment side because the industry structures are fundamentally different. I am more concerned about the impact of each business in their respect market but like I said the contribution of my entertainment portfolio to the group is about 10% which is quite decent.</p><h4>How can Quilox contribute to economic development?</h4><p>Quilox has contributed significantly to the development of the country, and it has raised the bar within the nightlife industry. Every club now looks at Quilox as the benchmark. Also in terms of tourism, people come to Nigeria from all over the world now just to visit Quilox and this is contributing positively to Nigeria's image. Quilox even had a feature on CNN on the prestigious Parts Unknown show with the late Anthony Bourdain. We are an employer of labor, we pay our taxes, we are contributing a lot really. The government needs to look into nightlife and the contribution it makes to diversify the economy especially on the back of a tourism master plan. It is unsustainable for us to have such a strong focus on oil; we need to diversify to take the country to the next level. Entertainment and tourism should be major areas of the government's economic vision moving forward. I see great potential in the entertainment industry. There are many more collaborations between American artists and other international artists with Nigerian talent, and that underscores the value they can bring and have brought. There is much potential that could be tapped into.</p><h4>What are the main challenges affecting the music industry in particular?</h4><p>There is a great deal of talent out there; however, there are challenges in terms of a lack of industry structure, which is essential for any business. This can negatively affect the ability of certain artists to gain popularity. Some artists do not have the resources or support required to develop their following and popularity. There should be a structure that helps develop artists' recognition as they enter the market, so we can create truly global superstars. Even having the infrastructure in place for coordinated, multi-modal media strategies would go a long way. Social media has helped in this area, though there are more structural adjustments that can be made.</p><h4>What are the main challenges in the entertainment business?</h4><p>The main issue is power. I spend an average of NGN8 million (USD22,000) a month powering our clubs via generators. On unstable power, we spend an average of between NGN700,000 and 1 million. This is a huge factor and a key expense. Security within the country is also a major issue, and the government needs to focus more on security. This would create a better business environment, because more people would be interested in coming and spending money. Other important factors are levies and taxes, and the government should work on streamlining the tax and levy structure. The nightlife business here does not function the way it does abroad. Many clubs here are free to enter, which limits the amount of activities that they can provide. By not being able to adjust my own fees accordingly, I can only offer certain services that are more limited than they might otherwise be. Furthermore, the system in Nigeria relies on orders being placed before charges are made, which is somewhat riskier than the minimum spend pre-authorization used in many other countries. A payment-before service model similar to other countries would reduce our risks significantly, though it would be difficult to implement. We need to have industry people coming together to make these changes as one voice. There can be more industry-wide cooperation to improve efficient operations.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the group in 2019, particularly the entertainment side?</h4><p>In 2019, I will be contesting for national legislative position, which is a vital challenge for me. The time for armchair politics is over, and I will get more involved in policy-making and law. I will join politics as a technocrat, which will allow me to help shape economic and business policy in the most effective way. I have been involved in many philanthropic activities, and I am excited to represent a new set of ideals. I have structured my businesses such that they will function smoothly in my absence during 2019. I foresee the price of oil continuing to stabilize. The government will continue to work on diversifying the economy as well. Domestic production in certain areas will increase. The president seeks to make Nigeria a self-sustaining country whereby we export more than we import. I foresee the economy growing more, and in 2019 things will really pick up.</p>]]></richbody0content>

In September 2018, GE's former chairman came from Boston to meet with the Prime Minister and announced that we would expand the footprint of our aviation business. We have a maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facility near Subang Airport that provides overhaul services for the CFM56 engines for narrow-body jets. We service around 40 airlines from this facility, making it a global business. GE is investing USD80 million in expansion plans for tooling, testing, and skills capabilities to support the MRO of CFM LEAP engines, the latest and most efficient jet engines in the market. The CFM LEAP engines are used on the Boeing 737 Max and the Airbus A320neo, which are the latest narrow-body planes from these manufacturers. These narrow-bodied jets are in extremely high demand, with a backlog of more than 16,000 engines. The MRO facility in Subang will play an important role in maintaining the LEAP engines and we are extremely proud of this. Over the years, we have developed the workforce such that the entire group is Malaysian. We are highly localized and pride ourselves in the talent and skills we have built within Malaysia.</p><h4>What role can GE play in fully unleashing the potential of Industry 4.0 in Malaysia?</h4><p>GE is a global leader in metal additive manufacturing. Our direct metal laser metal and electron beam machines are backed by a strong portfolio of software and services. Additive manufacturing has the potential to disrupt industries. Super users of additive manufacturing right now are the aviation and healthcare sectors, where additive is already providing manufacturers an increased level of choice, flexibility and design freedom to create products and parts that have never been seen before. One of the reasons our LEAP engines are so efficient is because we have invested in additive manufacturing and our teams are already designing engines that incorporate additive from the start. The National Industry 4.0 Policy Framework also focuses on additive manufacturing, so I am excited to see how GE can contribute to the outlined development goals in the strategy. GE is also active in big data and AI. We have remote monitoring and diagnostic centers for the oil and gas and power industries. There are currently about 1,500 assets, both GE's and our customers', connected to our centers in Kuala Lumpur. These include power turbines and chemical plants, and within these are embedded sensors that send billions of data bits to the center. Using AI, we analyze this information via digital twins that can monitor exactly what is happening in a given asset. We can pinpoint potential issues via these centers and are able to offer massive savings for our customers.</p><h4>How do you see GE's role in powering the future of Malaysia? </h4><p>Our role here is truly in power generation. In Malaysia, 40% of the power generated uses GE equipment. We are active across the board, including gas-powered turbines, steam-powered turbines, hydro, solar, and wind, and can help increase the efficiency of power generation in the nation. We have several ongoing projects that will utilize our latest gas-powered turbines. In Johor, we manufactured a 1,440MW gas-powered station for Tenaga Nasional, and we are utilizing two of our latest 9HA gas turbines, which are the most efficient gas turbines in the market right now. As efficiency increases, the cost of electricity falls.</p><h4>What are the most important requirements for Malaysia to maintain and further enhance its international competitiveness?</h4><p>The government has the right idea in pursuing its Industry 4.0 strategy. It needs to move fast, though. There is a great deal of talent here, and thanks to the policies of the new government, there is also growing interest within the global talent pool of Malaysians to return to the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar has intensified its business relations with countries beyond the GCC. How has this affected the business for law firms?</h4><p>Qatar has always understood the importance of attracting international companies to conduct and carry out business in the country. Especially, with Qatar hosting the World Cup 2022, it became vital to have international companies bring their experience to develop and execute various projects. This effected law firms in several ways, mainly, through the requirement to have a team of varied members in terms of culture, language, background, experience, and education that can meet the expectation of different companies and international parties. Second, law firms had to build a larger team due to the size of work assigned as a result of the booming economy. Finally, increased competition meant law firms had to introduce attractive modules of services and better quality of service to grow and shine in the market.</p><h4>How is Sharq law firm involved in IPOs in the Qatari market?</h4><p>Sharq law firm has extensive experience in the field of capital markets and IPOs, as the firm has been a leading player in major IPOs happening in Qatar over the past few years. Being a local law firm with an international outreach, Sharq law firm has been able to adequately advise clients on the best structure to establish a company or transform a limited liability company/private shareholding company into a public shareholding company. Sharq law firm has not just helped with the establishment phase, but has played a constant active role in advising clients with due diligence or prospectuses in order to ensure a smooth efficient process. Since we are a local law firm, it puts us on a greater playing field as we are able to benefit from certain exemptions as a result of the government's desire to encourage growth in the market, which also falls in line with Qatar's Vision 2030.</p><h4>What is the added value that a strong legal partner can bring for international companies starting business in Qatar?</h4><p>Under the Qatari Law, only Qatari lawyers who are admitted in the Qatari Bar can advise and appear at the Qatari Courts, making the experience of local law firms irreplaceable. Sharq law firm has built a team that has local and international members who are qualified in common law countries and civil law countries with experience that varies and differs in terms of education and practice. An international business or a company that comes to Qatar looks for a partner who can understand their language and business needs and advice on the local law, which is our strength.</p><h4>Which major regulatory changes are in the pipeline for Sharq law firm?</h4><p>Tax law is one of the regulations the market has been anticipating as it will cause several changes in the way businesses are conducted in Qatar. Furthermore, with Qatar encouraging 100% foreign ownership, a new law may be enacted, which allows such ownership, in addition to the existing laws under QFC and the foreign investment law.</p><h4>Qatar has been the first country in the GCC to introduce a Data Protection Law. What are the implications for companies working in the country?</h4><p>Qatar has successfully enacted a Data Protection Law, which is essential to companies and institutions whether as individuals or as organizations. It gives individuals comfort that their data will not be used in an illegitimate manner. Qatar was quick to understand the importance of data being kept private and confidential, resulting in it being the first GCC nation to have such laws. The law is more rigid when the confidential data relates to children or medical information. Ultimately, such legislation provides comfort to individuals and business and reassures them that Qatar is an ideal location to conduct business in.  We have witnessed a huge increase in demand in companies approaching us to seek reassurances if their policies comply with the Data Protection Act.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>I believe that the economy will still grow and business will increase, hence law firms must focus on improving the team and continuous development as it is essential to keep up with the current changes. Furthermore, some areas of law will become relevant to the market with new businesses entering Qatar, and law firms should pay attention to expanding their expertise to match new requirements. Moreover, a recent trend in Qatar is that an increasing number of companies are open to the idea of growing and transforming from either a private shareholding company or a limited liability company to a public shareholding company. The market has considerably expanded and due to the current political spat in the Gulf, Qatar aims to become more independent of others and the government has supported such growth, particularly in certain sectors such as the food and beverage, pharmaceutical, and mining sectors. In addition to this, there has also been a noticeable change in many Qatari companies operating in new markets, especially in Oman and Jordan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the recent trends in retail and shopping centers?</h4><p>The idea that “malls are dead" and retail is facing an “apocalypse" scenario is completely wrong. That said, malls and retail concepts must evolve along with consumer needs, meaning they must adapt to new technologies and understand what the main e-commerce players are doing. Pure online brands are moving to physical stores because they need to reduce logistics costs and enhance their relationship with customers. Traditional malls must become community centers and transform the shopping experience into a more intimate relationship with their visitors. New generations like millennials are changing the shopping process, so we must adapt to the needs of the young and dynamic generation. Social media, big data, IoT, augmented reality, and other technologies are playing a larger role in the retail world. Physical stores must focus on selling “experiences" instead of just “products or services." Therefore, food and beverage as well as new entertainment offerings have become the new anchors.  </p><h4>What does that mean for the new offerings in your facilities, and how do you envision attracting more customers?</h4><p>Our efforts are focused on one main concept: experience. In October 2018, we opened a new food hall called GASTRO that includes six restaurants with diverse food and beverage menus. We built that because our visitors were looking for a more intimate and stylish area where they could enjoy different gastronomic experiences. Considering that Guayaquil needs more leisure centers, we have partnered with one of the largest entertainment brands in the region to satisfy our customer's needs. We have a 9,000-sqm expansion project in progress, divided among two anchors: an entertainment center and a home goods store. We expect to bring a lot of new visitors to our center and become the biggest entertainment hub in the city. The project will be completed by December 2019. Our visitors have been able to experience our new automated parking solution, making Mall del Sol the first shopping center in the area to implement it. </p><h4>With a growing e-commerce industry, how do you envision going forward?</h4><p>We are turning our shopping environment into an “omni-channel" experience to ensure that we get the best from both the digital and physical worlds. Big data is a key component of this strategy, along with an improved Wi-Fi network and a new guest services menu. We are also developing a new website, engaging our fans through different social media platforms, implementing digital signage, and other innovative elements that will enhance the “customer journey" process. We are planning to include click and collect services to our physical stores as well as e-commerce brand that could benefit from our center. This will allow customers to start their shopping process inside the mall and have the products delivered to their homes at their convenience. </p><h4>What kind of businesses would you like to attract?</h4><p>With a new mega scale entertainment center opening next year, we expect to have larger groups of visitors spending more time within our mall. This effect, as well as an increasing customer base, will attract more international and local brands to open new concept stores in Mall del Sol. We are extremely careful in the new brand selection process to ensure high standards and to keep our company promise, “the only place that has it all." Our goal is to develop and maintain a diverse tenant mix. As well as including new shopping trends, healthy and sustainable brands will have a higher impact on our visitors. We plan to become a sustainable mixed-use shopping center, minimizing pollution and the use of resources while operating and developing new enhancements to our building. Mall del Sol will always try to benefit its community in the long term, so brands that have similar strategies can ensure strong relationships with our shopping center. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-solid-plan]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main activities to promote Guayaquil?</h4><p>We have worked hard to classify our tourist attractions. We developed the Guayaquil city brand, the official travel guides in the website, and the set-up of a convention bureau. Since tourism generates progress, employment, and revenue for the city, the mayor of Guayaquil decided to create the Public &amp; Municipal Company of Tourism, Civic Promotion, and International Relations of Guayaquil. With this new organization, we created the conventions bureau, and it has attracted many business events in just two years. We are affiliated with the International Congress and Conventions Association (ICCA), which has all the information about congresses around the world. Thus far, we have had 60 congresses in 2018, and there are 14 events scheduled for 2019.</p><h4>What are the main pillars of the city marketing for business tourism?</h4><p>Our main attractions are Ecuador's largest convention center and all the needed infrastructure in the city. We also have international hotels equipped with event rooms to host conventions and congresses. According to travelers, we have one of the best airports in its class. We also have a massive public transport system that helps tourists commute. Equally important, we have an ambassador's plan and are working together with labor unions and universities to attract international congresses to the city. Four years ago, we created the conventions bureau where several important events have been hosted, such as the Economic Congress. We are also working with the hotel industry; our hotels are currently operating at 100% capacity. The congresses we have held in 2018 represent an economic revenue of USD35 million, in part because the congresses resulted in the booking of more than 60,000 hotel nights. All these developments guarantee job generation for the overall economy.</p><h4>How do you seek to boost traditional tourism?</h4><p>Launching the city brand “Guayaquil es mi Destino" (Guayaquil Is My Destiny), promoting the city through social networks and the internet, and classifying tourists attractions in terms of gastronomy, nature, entertainment, history, and heritage, have done a great job in attracting tourists. In terms of technology, we have more than 6,000 Wi-Fi spots. Another important aspect is the number of fairs taking place, such as the gastronomy fair, the book fair, and COMIC CON Ecuador. Similarly, there are parades, concerts, and other events that allow visitors to enjoy the city. On average, a business tourist spends USD460 daily while a traditional tourist spends USD110. Since 2016, Guayaquil has been the leading destination in Ecuador, i.e. the most visited city by local and foreign visitors. We are working on boosting those sectors that have made Guayaquil an emerging destination recognized by TripAdvisor, among cities such as Medellí­n and Sío Paulo. In just five years, we have won the World Travel Award as South America's Leading Business Travel Destination for three years in a row, and this year we also won also the award for South America's Leading Festival and Events Destination. </p><h4>How do you envision more public-private collaboration in tourism?</h4><p>In Guayaquil, most investments are private and part of the mayor's vision. The municipality is in charge of public works, involving strategic alliances with the private sector. The local administration does not spend its budget on attractions because this is part of the convention bureau's job. Moving forward, we await the construction of the Royal Hideaway Barceló, which will host Ecuador's tallest building with an investment of USD55 million, Hampton by Hilton, Hilton Garden Inn, and Giardini Hotel. Guayaquil's administration, through the Municipal Company of Tourism, has boosted the hotel sector and enabled more investments. This benefits all the inhabitants of the city, who are now able to start businesses such as restaurants, craft shops, guide services, and tourist transportation. Guayaquil has already found the path for progress and well-being through tourism, and we will continue to maintain our progress. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-art-of-attracting-investment]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the new investment law amplify investments in your industry?</h4><p>The new law is a powerful set of incentives for all the sectors involved. It also provides interesting tools for the tourism industry to promote Ecuador around the world. With generous income tax exemptions for up to 20 years, hotels are now able to import goods without duties, and the repatriation of profits will no longer be subjected to the currency transaction tax. Already, we have noticed increased investor appetite in our tourism sector. Furthermore, our dollarized economy makes investments more stable. We complement this with adjustments and better enforcement of the legal framework. In the past 16 months of our administration, USD370 million in new investments were generated for the tourism sector.</p><h4>How do you envision capitalizing on Ecuador's biodiversity to drive tourism?</h4><p>Ecuador is a natural paradise, perhaps the most biodiverse place in the world. During meetings with investors, I mention that in Ecuador, one can have breakfast in the jungle, lunch in the snow, and dinner along the coast—and even offer to drive them myself. We are marketing Ecuador to the world as a tourist circuit with historic cities, cultural heritage sites, and wonderful nature. Quito and Cuenca are already recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, while Guayaquil is a growing center of business tourism. Now, we seek to extend this circuit to the rural areas. A tourist would be able to discover natural attractions and beautiful towns, which are colorful and full of history and traditions. At the same time, we need to protect our cultural heritage and preserve it for future generations. Ecuador has state-of-the-art airports, road, infrastructure, and hospitality, which will support all the other efforts.</p><h4>How do you envision preserving and renovating the UNESCO list of sites while at the same time attracting more tourists?</h4><p>There are many different interests among tourists. Some will come here because of the country's culture, while others will come for gastronomy, adventure tourism, or birdwatching. We are fortunate to have UNESCO world heritage sites and are currently working on two programs to turn all these attractions into real tourist products. One is the Pueblos Mágico (magical towns) program that originated in Mexico; mayors of certain towns are currently working on the specific requirements for culture, folklore, traditions, and gastronomy, and the Ministry of Tourism will analyze the effort and declare them as “Pueblos Mágico." The second program we are working on in the Pacific Riviera has to do with selecting certain areas of the coast and promoting them for resort development investments. </p><h4>What are your ambitions as minister in terms of investors and tourists?</h4><p>Our long-term ambition is having the equivalent of one tourist per citizen, while never compromising on the quality of services. We do want more tourists coming into Ecuador, though we want quality tourists who help the country in terms of the economy and environment. We have three strategies in place to attract more tourists. First is receptive tourism through promotions and diversifying our offerings relevant to each market. We use online travel agencies and big data in order to track travelers. Next, we have a film commission in charge of promoting Ecuador as a place for documentaries, music videos, and film productions. We are doing well and have grown 14% in receptive tourism in less than a year. Second, we are working on revitalizing local tourism, which has witnessed 35% growth compare to the last survey. We are also setting up arrangements with airlines, inland carriers, the hotel sector, and travel agencies to offer attractive packages. The third aspect is related to investment; as part of the new investment law, we created the Tourist Promotion and Management Fund, which enables us to have the appropriate budget for both promotion and projects development. In addition, Ecuador has been declared an open sky country, which means international airlines can land in our country with all the needed facilities. We are currently working on an agreement with the US, and after signing it our numbers will increase.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the strengths of UDH in the education landscape of Ecuador?</h4><p>The big difference between UDH and other universities is that our main educational focus is centered on the values of people. We provide real personalized education, and this is the main reason why we do not have as many students: we want to be able to build close relationships with our students. UDH was established 14 years ago with approximately 100 students, and today we have 1,500 students. The Higher Education Law changed 10 years ago and requires 60% of a university's professors to hold PhDs. The country needed this regulation to improve the quality of higher education; however, meeting this target in a short period of time is a challenge. We seek to contribute to disciplines that can help change our society. We teach subjects such as law, dentistry, communications, business, and political science. However, we have designed our courses to teach our students to think differently, for example, regarding family issues such as marriage and abortion. Our students today are extremely different from those of 20 or 30 years ago; they learn differently and are fast adopters of new technologies. The difficulty is changing the mindset of teachers so they can keep pace with the new generation of students.</p><h4>What is your vision for working with the private sector?</h4><p>Our graduates have to be prepared to work in both private and public sectors, and we have designed our curricula to meet this challenge. We have been building close relationships with the private sector through our Entrepreneurial Advisory Board formed by prestigious businesspeople. We also have signed many internships agreements with law firms and enterprises for our students to gain real work experience. We are also more flexible in terms of changing the topics we teach, and we can invite other professionals and business people to teach some subjects. Moreover, we have agreements with other universities in the US and Europe, giving our students the opportunity to go on exchange programs overseas.</p><h4>Would you tell us about your work with the Open Government Alliance, which focuses on promoting transparency?</h4><p>The transparency and the fight against corruption are among the main values of UDH, so we are totally aligned with any effort to promote these values. The Open Government Alliance brings together government reformers and civil society leaders to create action plans that make governments more inclusive, responsive, and accountable. In the spirit of multi-stakeholder collaboration, it is necessary to include representatives of governments and civil society organizations.</p><h4>Are you looking to have more exchange programs with overseas universities?</h4><p>We would like to work jointly with other universities so that our professors research with other bodies. We need to join forces and have access to the experience and strength found in other universities. At present, the universities in Ecuador work separately; collaborating with other universities gives people different perspectives. I love the fact that our students go to places like China and the UK and experience other visions and ideas. We seek to have master's programs in energy, environmental issues, and innovation. Universities have to lead change in such fields in Ecuador. It is important to address, for example, the shortage of nurses in Ecuador by starting a project for nursing training.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the coming two years?</h4><p>Our strongest interest is humanities, though I would also like to introduce engineering programs, such as environmental engineering, and have 10-15 classrooms with cutting-edge future technology. Also, we would like to see our graduates work more internationally and build a stronger alumni network. Furthermore, we would like to open a campus in a different city, which is not possible under the current regulations; however, the laws are changing and we are in discussions to address these reforms.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us more about your market position in the recent years?</h4><p>LIFE has been ranked amongst the 10 most important pharmaceutical manufacturers in the market. This is a business that is continuously evolving; there are always strict regulations, and the requirements of customers, patients, doctors, and the government continue to evolve and become stricter. Our growth in the last few years has helped us maintain our market share against the competition. We seek to expand our market beyond Ecuador and continue to find products that are beneficial for our specific market. </p><h4>How much do you invest in innovation and R&amp;D, and what are the main areas of research?</h4><p>Most of the products that we are currently selling were developed within our company. Our research formulation group is comprised of nine-10 people with master's and PhD degrees who are responsible for finding new formulations. These formulations require that we find and import the proper active ingredients, excipients, and materials to manufacture the final products.</p><h4>How do you adjust your research depending on the demographics of the country?</h4><p>Ecuador's population is changing. The percentage of people over the age of 55 is growing and will continue to grow for the next 15 years, so the type of products that we need right now is different. We had identified this trend a few years ago and began developing formulations related to chronic diseases to tap into our market's demographic changes.</p><h4>How do you envision further regionalization?</h4><p>The most natural markets to expand to are Colombia and Peru. We have also been working on entering certain countries in Central America. Our main market is Ecuador, and we are working hard to maintain and further grow our market share here. The strategies that we use for the local market could also work in other countries in the region since we share some similarities. Our aim is to grow our export business in comparison to the local one. For this purpose we must not only have the right product that complies with local regulation for the product's registration but also the local marketing platform to successfully launch a product in that country. The pharmaceutical business environment is changing drastically all over the world, and we need to adapt ourselves internally to remain competitive. For instance, we are faced with a social insurance system that will be upgraded and extended, and these changes are in the interest of all stakeholders, including the government, pharmaceutical companies, and the general population. As key players in the industry, we must be committed in reviewing and establishing goals to continuously develop the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you positioned your hospital group within Ecuador's healthcare landscape?</h4><p>We are one of the largest hospitals in the private sector in Ecuador. At the time of our establishment, there were mostly smaller clinics in the country. When we opened, we attracted many healthcare professionals who studied abroad and wanted to utilize their experience in a large-scale hospital. This led to a scaling up of other healthcare facilities as well, so in that sense we were pioneers in improving the standards. As the first hospital in Ecuador, we have JCI accreditation and are ranked among the 25 best hospitals in Latin America by America Economia. Still, we keep working on improving our standards—being the best in Ecuador is not enough for us. To be able to provide people with the best level of care, we invested in a medical prepaid company called Humana, which functions like an insurance company and gives wider access to healthcare. The healthcare environment in Ecuador is not that patient friendly yet, with confusion over the role of the private and public sectors in terms of financing access. Our constitution states that it is the government's responsibility to guarantee access to healthcare, but sometimes the authorities state that part of this responsibility is on the private sector. Through the social security institutions, people make their obligatory payments to be eligible to healthcare. The rest of the population enjoys access provided by the Ministry of Health. The private sector does not get funding so we have to self-finance our operations.</p><h4>How should the synergies between the public and private sectors be enhanced?</h4><p>Three years ago, we had to close down our transplant facilities because our bills could not be paid due to the system in place. As a private institution, we should be able to invest in our healthcare, and provide it in return for sufficient financing. Shutting down our transplant unit was not good for the country; it is vital for public and private healthcare institutions to complement each other. At present, the way the public and private sectors interact puts financial pressure on the private healthcare providers, which has even led to bankruptcy of some. Fortunately, in 2012, we managed to open up our agreements with the social security institute to put a limitation on our exposure under that payment structure. There is a new law under review, Código Orgánico de la Salud, and although people need the best possible care, proper financing is just as important for sustainability of the sector. In the private healthcare sector, there will always be a corporate view, which means we cannot accept all patients for free. We have a strong CSR program in place and see around 9,000 patients for medical consultations at almost no cost, in addition to 650 complex surgeries for those who cannot afford it. It is our vision to provide affordable care while maintaining operations as an enterprise. The Ministry of Health should take care of the rest, one way or another. There is a great opportunity to improve healthcare, and we are pleased to collaborate with the ministry and other healthcare facilities to make this happen.</p><h4>What are the ambitions for the coming year?</h4><p>We would like to further advance in tertiary and specialize care, as we have the expertise in-house. In the short and mid term, the road ahead is fairly challenging, though in the long term, we can achieve our goals for Grupo Conclina, while also moving toward a better healthcare environment in general. The public sector is focusing on preventive healthcare, as it should, though it is diverting some of its responsibilities to us. As a listed company with 2,000 shareholders, we have to maintain an enterprising perspective and be rational. The general occupation in the private sector is 65%, so there is unused capacity that should be allocated for the greater good. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[universal-health-coverage]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main public health challenges for Ecuador being a leading tourism destination in Latin America, and how do you ensure adequate healthcare provision to travelers?</h4><p>The Ecuadorian state, by constitutional mandate, guarantees comprehensive, universal, and free healthcare to all persons in the national territory, without any discrimination and regardless of their immigration status. Thanks to this political and constitutional will, we have been recognized internationally by several agencies of the United Nations System for not only our commitment to ensuring universal access to health services, but also the country's leading role in international forums to promote universal access at the sub-regional, regional, and international levels. This represents a great challenge—not only for Ecuador but all countries in the region—in terms of the sustainability of health systems. The right to health is enshrined in the Charter of the UN as well as in constitutions and regulations of most countries. The challenge is ensuring greater sources of financing, specific to the national health system.</p><h4>How do you envision improving the dynamics between public and private healthcare in Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador received the prestigious United Nations Award for Public Service 2017 (UNPSA) in the category of Innovation and Excellence in the Provision of Health Services for the creation of the Comprehensive Public Health Network (RPIS). However, a system has to be also articulated with the private sector. Under this premise, the ministry offers healthcare services to the entire population. The municipalities have programs and health facilities in which they also provide care to the uninsured population. The social security institutions cover the salaried affiliated population. The private sector, called complementary private network (CPN), includes for-profit entities and non-profit organizations of civil society and social service. Also, there are private medical offices equipped with infrastructure and technology. We work with the Association of Clinics and Private Hospitals of Ecuador (ACHPE) in several aspects, but especially in the care process through referrals of patients, reciprocally and continuously. Between January and August 2018, 68,950 referrals were made to CPN, whose care is 100% financed by public health funders. All these actions are constantly evaluated, and we are committed to making the relationship process more efficient, always taking into consideration the principle of complementarity, namely to take advantage of the installed capacity and expertise of each actor in the system so as not to duplicate efforts but to strengthen the resolutive capacity of the national system, both public and private.</p><h4>What are the main challenges and goals for your term as Minister of Health?</h4><p>The right to health must be collective and based on the principles of equity, solidarity, efficiency, effectiveness, and quality. Health is a constitutional right, and we are committed to protecting it. We are also committed to building the new legal framework that allows it to be effective. Therefore we work in the debate and preparation of the new Organic Code of Health (COS), probably the most important regulatory framework for the national health system. As immediate goals, the MSP proposed the implementation of a unique clinical history of births and deaths to strengthen the health system and the monitoring of patients. Another issue that concerns us is the judicialization of access to medicines, which consists of the use of lawsuits to compel governments to provide access to medicines that have not been incorporated into public health coverage. Health cannot be guaranteed by decree, judicial provision, or sentence; health needs the establishment of technical public policies that assure the collective good. Without health, the national objective that governs our public policy is unattainable. To guarantee the right to health, we must recognize the existence of structural factors that determine the health of the population. That is why we will continue to direct our actions toward the global objective of poverty reduction and to achieve a substantial increase in the quality of life of our citizens. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are you digitalizing government interactions with citizens, and what is your agenda for the implementation of e-government services?</h4><p>The ministry has two tasks: to make known to the public all the services available in each of the government institutions and the optimization of procedures from which we show citizens the catalog of public services. We are working with institutions to automate and optimize their processes and applications. In May, an executive decree was issued aimed at improving and optimizing processes such as the constitution of a company or other public procedures. A series of steps are necessary, and the decree obliges us to observe all processes to implement a methodology and establish the priority ones. There are around 4,000 processes, and a technical standard was created for institutions to register their processes in the database created by the Ministry of Telecommunications. From this platform, institutions can eliminate procedures that are not worthwhile, and we can see how to fully or partially automate those processes.</p><h4>What is the anticipated impact of the new legislation for the IT industry?</h4><p>Ecuador issued a new law on productive development, attracting investments, employment generation, and fiscal stability, which establishes benefits for new investments such as the exemption of income tax. The law defines new prioritized sectors like the development and production of software services and technological hardware, digital infrastructure, information security, and online services, which will promote new investments in the IT industry made by entrepreneurs in new or existent companies. This will positively impact the develop of the IT industry, since it will promote local offer of goods and IT services, encourage the strengthening of their human resources competences, incorporate innovation in their processes, and promote access to global markets with our support. These measures will create more sources of employment through digital transformation in companies and industries by the use and appropriation of ICT.</p><h4>How do you envision building a sustainable digital economy in Ecuador?</h4><p>Months ago, we presented an information and knowledge society white paper, which has five goals that our ministry seeks to accomplish by 2021 through the execution of several plans to implement the public policy in telecommunications and information society. The fifth goal about digital economy and emerging technologies includes all the necessary aspects to incorporate our country to the digital economy. ICT is important and must be incorporated into institutions and companies to automate them. For this purpose, our ministry has been working on an information and knowledge society plan, which has a dedicated program related to the digital economy with projects to encourage digital transformation in companies, reinforce IT industries, and strengthen innovation-driven entrepreneurial ecosystems.</p><h4>What are the primary ambitions of the ministry for the coming year?</h4><p>Our vision is to become the reference in public management to lead all processes for citizens to access and generate information and knowledge, through the effective use of information and communication technologies. As for infrastructure and connectivity, we will promote its deployment, which will allow the coverage of telecommunications services to be extended in areas still unattended and stimulate migration to new generation and high-speed networks,through the universal access plan. Regarding e-government, we will bring the government closer to citizens by the use of ICT, with emphasis on priority attention groups, so they can have access to online services. With respect to the information and knowledge society plan, we will encourage the incorporation of ICT in companies in all their processes and structures to achieve the digital transformation. We will also incentive a culture of data protection in our citizens as well as constitute our country in a regional reference in information security. Finally, we will promote the development of digital skills in our citizens, as part of the strengthening of digital inclusion. Building an information and knowledge society is a complex challenge, and we will achieve it with the joint work of industry, academia, and civil society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main trends in the real estate market, and what are your signature projects?</h4><p>The majority of our focus has been on middle-class and upper-middle-class clients and markets, as well as on building offices; however, in the current economic climate, the real estate industry is in a descending cycle and the prices have dropped, particularly hitting our target markets. As a result, we have taken some technological and financial measures and also focused on buying new products. We are targeting the middle-class segment with small and comfortable housing solutions backed with good prices and easy payments. Under this strategy, clients can buy properties with a 10-15% downpayment, while the rest can be financed through national or private banks.</p><h4>How do you approach environmental sustainability in your projects?</h4><p>Naia, an upper middle-class project, is an eco-efficient project that will be completed in December 2018. For Naia, we are emphasizing electric saving, reusing rainwater, and creating sustainable areas such as gardens and green spaces. We are also implementing bike parking spaces. The Prado de San Mateo project will be completed in phases, with a plan to complete 55-60 apartments every three months.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the sector?</h4><p>The real estate sector is a barometer of any country's development and economic progress. If construction towers are visible across a city, it would be fair to presume that its economy is booming. The growth of the real estate sector relies on the economic growth of the country, foreign investments, the credibility that those companies have in the country, and government policies that allow people to invest in the country. Once a government provides safety, confidence, and stability, economic prosperity follows.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your new projects, GLS Tech — the robotics school?</h4><p>Intellectual richness and knowledge are paramount and without them, growth and advancement are impossible. Knowledge is the base of the development of all countries and GLS Tech was born as a way to help society, not as a business. It is a social promise as a businessperson, so people can acquire education on new technologies. The aim is for young people to look for the new tendencies in society, especially so the children can decide at an early age what they want to study. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you position Kia in the market and what are the major trends?</h4><p>The market is going to shrink slightly during 2019 and there are two reasons for this. First, 1H2018 saw an uptick in the market, maturing it to a certain extent. Second, people have less funds and the government has urged banks to adjust their consumption credits. For automotive loans, car-buyers need to deposit 1.5% of the purchase value. This mostly affects entry-level cars, while the market for mid- or high-end cars remains stable.</p><h4>Are you broadening your portfolio for this entry-level segment? </h4><p>We have indeed done that recently by introducing the newest Picanto model. At present, Kia Ecuador is the second largest operation of Kia in Latin America, and during the last four years, the company's Ecuador operations have maintained a high ranking. Our secret is that when the Korean government started to apply the quotas, we were forced to import only 3,000 cars; therefore, we decided to be creative and advertise not in terms of price but the brand itself. Moreover, we invested those years into building relationships with car dealers. Equally important, we decided to invest in facilities and people; we hired young people and gave them opportunities to intern in other countries while sending some to the company headquarters in Seoul to learn about new markets and market trends. Overall, Kia invested heavily in automation during that period. With these plans in place, we launched three new models in 1H2017 and two new models in 2H2017, growing by 120%. By end-2018, we expect to increase our market share to 18%. Our idea is to hit 20% and then work on a customer retention strategy and grow Kia's market share. For that, we strive to have the right portfolio, which will be further made possible after the launch and expansion of our luxury line. </p><h4>Kia recently launched a line of electric vehicles, what are your ambitions and how do you view this market?</h4><p>The trend of the global market is that by 2025, 10% of the total car sales will be electric cars. Therefore, we have decided to be leaders in that field in Ecuador. So far, we have achieved great success; Kia is renowned for its electric car offerings in Ecuador. The country's youth is fast moving toward sustainability, so it is important for us to keep up with these trends. This is not a profitable business for us, but we are preparing for the future. At present, we have 15 charging stations across Quito and Guayaquil.</p><h4>Do you think the number of factories or manufacturing lines in Ecuador will increase in the near future?</h4><p>I don't expect a substantial increase because Ecuador recently signed an FTA with Europe which, after four years, would allow companies to import cars sans taxes. At the same time, Ecuador has become party to the Pacific Alliance, allowing companies to import Korean cars without taxes. Therefore, the only products with a future to be assembled here are going to be from India and China. In our case, we are planning to launch two new models in 2019, but we will export them to Columbia as well.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the coming years?</h4><p>We aim to capture 20% market share and focus on building a loyal client base; the only way to remain profitable in the long run is to retain customers through superior aftersales service and exceptional customer experience. Our strategy is not reduced to pricing; it revolves around incorporating higher quality accessories and equipment, further building on our competitive edge. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>KLM takes care of one of the two connections between Ecuador and Europe, for both Quito and Guayaquil, and it recently announced adding a direct connection to Paris. What made you decide to open this new route, and what are your expectations?</h4><p>The return of Air France to Ecuador with the new Quito-Paris route, which will be operated by Joon, is a historic moment in the aeronautical operations for both countries, as it is the first airline that connects Ecuador and France with a non-stop flight, benefiting the cultural, economic, and tourist exchange and strengthening bilateral relations. The business case for this route showed an increased demand for Quito as a gateway to the country, from where travelers can reach other cities in Ecuador, including the Galapagos, Guayaquil, and Cuenca. This route complements the offer of Air France-KLM providing greater connection options to Europe and the world through its Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam-Schiphol hubs. The Ecuadorian market will have better access to the 314 destinations from our network in 116 countries. We hope to have a great acceptance during the European summer season, and eventually to turn this operation into a regular one. </p><h4>Ecuador is a popular holiday destination, while the daily Amsterdam—QUI/GYE connection also moves a lot of business travelers from Europe. What are the recent trends, and what is the balance between tourist and business travelers?</h4><p>According to 2017 figures from the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses, the main reason for the entry of foreigners is tourism; 1,237,384 out of 1,608,000 visitors were registered as tourists. This impels us to join the dream of turning Ecuador into a tourist power that the Ministry of Tourism executes as a public policy. For almost 65 years, KLM has believed in Ecuador and has connected Ecuador with Europe and the rest of the world. We have become allies to show Ecuador's tourist potential to the world. At the same time, we became a safe and comfortable option to meet the requirements of business travelers as well. Therefore, air connectivity is one of the main results within the strategic pillars of the government of Ecuador. We understand its relevance to boost the sector, open new markets, and increase the number of visitors. For us, tourism is a key element for the social and economic development of the country and we feel committed to contribute to this development.</p><h4>In the summer of 2018, you announced the intention to create a joint venture with SkyTeam partner Air Europe to strengthen your presence in South and Central America. What do you envision with this partnership?</h4><p>The future agreement will allow us to expand the offer and improve the travel opportunities of our customers. For many years, we have agreements with Air Europe that consist of codeshare agreements, however, deepening the collaboration with Air Europe through a joint venture will allow us to work together even more closely to strengthen our offer on the routes between Europe and South and Central America. This will consolidate our role as a leader in these markets, enabling us to offer our partners greater advantages. At present, companies are conducting an in-depth legal analysis of the modalities of this future agreement in order to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations by force.</p><h4>What do you anticipate to be the impact of the new investment legislation for the aviation industry?</h4><p>As Air France-KLM, we consider that any legal instrument that encourages investment is beneficial for that country and its inhabitants, since new investment translates into employment, payment of taxes, and a boost to the local economy. Our commitment is to align ourselves with the policies established by governments in order to look for greater investment opportunities and form public-private collaborations. We recently signed a cooperative agreement to jointly promote the Ecuadorian Ministry of Tourism in Europe. We hope to work in the same way to promote with Air France the direct route to Ecuador as a tourist destination in the international markets during the coming months. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have TAME's operations advanced in recent years?</h4><p>TAME flies to 11 national and five international destinations. Our market share for local and international flights is 40% and 30%, respectively. Our goal is to recover the 95% national market share we had before. To achieve this, we work with the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Transportation and are restructuring our company and analyzing what is best for us, including better financial management. Our balance sheets had never been audited before TAME became a public company in 2012; an audit of the entire financial process allowed us to better determine the company's debts and the source of its liabilities. We went through operational restructuring and have refinanced and renegotiated our liabilities with our suppliers. In September 2017, TAME had only four aircrafts and today, we have already purchased 10 of the 11 aircrafts that we planned to have by end-2018; they will be delivered in January 2019 due to some issues. In the meantime, we have recovered operation and frequency and our average seat occupancy rate in 2018 is 80%. In addition, we are focusing on providing higher quality service. For perspective, we have 95% punctuality and 95% predictability rates.</p><h4>What is your balance between tourism and business movements?</h4><p>As a flagship airline, TAME's priority is to reach more destinations. Certain destinations, like the Galapagos Islands, have grown in popularity largely due to efforts by the Ministry of Tourism. On top of this, the Ministry of Transport has been active in developing airports throughout the country, making it easier for us to increase our routes. We have increased the frequency to such destinations from Quito or Guayaquil as well as between Quito and Guayaquil and Loja—the city of art. This is part of the development of tourism in those areas because it brings economic advantages. Also, the aviation industry creates employment in the transport, food, business development, and digitalization areas. We are actively digitalizing our sales channels, and the current ticket purchase software is partly developed internally.<br>What is your ambition to grow in the domestic market, for example for the Galapagos and other tourist destinations?<br>The state is committed to developing many of the country's airports. To this end, the Ministry of Transport and Authority for Civil Aviation has formulated a plan. Many of the airports that TAME operates without competition are new, which increases the quality of service and safety. New or renovated airports such as Lago Agrio on the border with Colombia are part of the commitment to develop these regions. We use those airports, and we have created special rates for residents to boost the productive development of the region. TAME Amazonia is a subsidiary of TAME in the Amazon jungle to service inhabitants of that region. The subsidiary does not have an economic function beyond its service to the indigenous communities.</p><h4>What are your plans for further regional expansion, and what investments in your fleet would that require?</h4><p>As part of the company's restructuring plan, we need to define the necessary fleet for the next five to 10 years. We have decided to change the fleet, models, and destinations. Regionally, we fly to Lima, Bogotá, and Cali as well as other routes that were cancelled, but we want to resume them under the new business model. To consolidate this project, we need investment that allows us to renew aircrafts with new generation equipment. We have interlinear agreements with Avianca, and Aerolí­neas is also interested. Similarly, we have a commercial agreement with United Airlines, which acquired our cargo hold for New York.</p><h4>What are your expectative and ambitions for 2019?</h4><p>We want to consolidate the company, renew the fleet, maintain routes and connectivity, generate strategic alliances, and have a self-sustaining model. We want to be the local distribution network of companies that want to come to Ecuador. We have strong competitors, though we are fighting, and we expect to regain 1 million passengers we lost in Ecuador since 2012.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2016, DP World won a 50-year concession to build and operate Posorja Deepwater Port. How has the project advanced thus far? </h4><p>DP World Posorja has been developing four projects in one: the access road, the new navigational channel, the container terminal, and the logistics park. We are building a 20-km access road, all the way to the container terminal. Eventually, this will be four lanes, but in phase one we are limiting this to two lanes. We have developed the drainage, pipelines, and two layers of 9-cm base for the road, along with three bridges. The access road is key for the construction works on the terminal, so we ensured rapid progress for it. At present, 64% of the road is complete, and our goal is to finish it by March 2019. For the channel, we need to dredge a new seaway of nautical miles at 16.5m depth. Flanders Dredging, an international company, is developing that project, and it is 69% complete. Some of the phase one dredging materials are being used to construct two dykes for phase two, which brings costs down. Then, there is the 480m quayside development for the container terminal. We are using a new and more accurate method to position the platform and piles to prevent harm from waves, currents, and wind. Out of the 320 piles, around 60% is put in place in the berth. To create this berth, we have a concrete plant onsite to build the precast molds. For the 40-ha yard, we are already working on the ducting for electricity and drainage systems, and the pipes and foundations for the administration building, workshop, customs, and anti-narcotics. That work started in August 2018 and we have completed 40% and are planning to finish it in May 2019. Aside from the container terminal, we will have a 100-ha logistics park under economic zone environment next to the port. This is what DP World did in Jebel Ali Free Zone and now has over 7,500 customers for regional distribution. Due to the strategic location of Ecuador, Posorja has great potential to become a regional hub for the west coast of South America. By building a port with a depth of 16.5m, the big ships with 12,000-15,000 TEU capacity will be able to dock as well. It will create direct shipping traffic, which is in line with our intention to build a distribution hub. </p><h4>What are some of the innovative container handling solutions DP World is bringing to Posorja Deepwater Port for smoother operations?</h4><p>In terms of technology, we have an existing contract with Navis to manage our terminal operating system (TOS) at Posorja Deepwater Port. We also have Navis' Expert Decking and Pre-Route Control systems to speed up loading. Plans are also in place to have an automatic gate and X-ray scanners to minimize intrusions by anti-narcotics. All these systems are crucial, for example, we will have a lorry park and a vehicle booking system to track and manage the exact number of daily transactions and everyone who enters the premises. This will help us have better organization and more efficient operations in the yard and with the vessels.</p><h4>What do you think of the government's initiatives to promote PPPs and attract more investment through new regulations?</h4><p>For DP World Posorja, the government is creating an environment that gives companies legal security, which is important. It is also giving the tools and fiscal benefits to attract potential foreign investors to come to Ecuador. Our project is a starting point to trigger foreign investment as it is one of the biggest investments in Ecuador. The interaction and relationship we have with authorities and the processes for obtaining all the necessary permits and licenses will show how successful the government has been in putting the mechanisms in place to facilitate investors. In that sense, DP World Posorja should hopefully be a blueprint and an enabler for future investors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you expect to be the impact of the new investment legislation for the industries of your responsibility, and how have you translated this into policy?</h4><p>There is a legal framework in place that provides security to private investment with the purpose of encouraging national and international private investment to inject fresh capital into the national economy and reduce the pressure on the fiscal budget. Thus, it promotes projects that operate under a framework of a healthy and constructive partnership between the public sector and private enterprises. The new investment law establishes the application of incentives for investment, such as exemption of Income Tax (IR) for 10-12 years, for companies from different economic sectors that invest and produce within Ecuador's territorial boundaries. Companies in primary industries will be exempted from IR for five to 15 years or more if investors operate in border states. Moreover, IR will be eliminated for companies that are dedicated to agriculture, technology (creation of software), construction materials, and other industries that are outside of Quito and Guayaquil. The objective of the law is to reactivate production by giving tax incentives, extending the benefit to 20 years for border areas, and 15 years for Manabí­ and Esmeraldas to encourage new investments in the areas of community tourism, ecotourism, EPS, and SMEs. This regulatory framework positively affects the infrastructure and transport management sector, attracts private investments, both domestic and foreign, and contributes to the economic development of the country. Private sector participation is extremely important because we take advantage of the private sector's experience and financing capacity to provide services that have traditionally been provided by the public sector. It also introduces technology and innovation to improve the provision of public services through operational efficiency. Moreover, involving the private sector allows for diversification of the Ecuadorian economy, making it more competitive, while it also guarantees that the investment flow is more strategic. Finally, the private sector assumes the investment and operational risks of the projects and contributes to new capital that reduces the pressure on the fiscal budget. </p><h4>The coordination of PPPs in the transport and infrastructure sectors are among the key tasks of your ministry. What are the main opportunities for the private sector to get involved in public works?</h4><p>Ecuador has an attractive regulatory framework for private investment, both for PPP project initiatives and for concession. For the development of the State Road Network, we work with the private sector under the modality of concession; there is a transparent mechanism with public tenders. The South Viaduct of Guayaquil is currently in the inter-nation public tender stage and all information is available on our website. Another example of a large-scale work to be executed in PPP format is Tren Playero, whose construction process will begin in 2H2019.</p><h4>Ecuador is well connected to travel by sea and the opportunity is there to improve its position as a regional center with its port. How should this position be strengthened? </h4><p>The Ecuadorian port system has ongoing development and complementarity projects through delegation and direct administration in the ports of Guayaquil, Puerto Bolí­var, Manta, and Esmeraldas, with investments of approximately USD2.1 billion. That includes dredging and deepening of access channels, modernization of existing infrastructure, repowering of machinery, and specialization of services. Another project is the construction of a deepwater terminal in Posorja-Guayaquil, set to begin in 2H2019 with a private investment of USD1.2 billion. Additionally, we are in the process of receiving offers for the Viaducto Sur de Guayaquil, a four-lane road project that will allow connectivity from the port area of Guayaquil to the province of Oro 44.2km away, with an investment of USD1.2 billion. Another big project in the works is Tren Playero; with an investment of USD1 billion, its purpose will be to move passengers and cargo from the province of Guayas, passing through Guayaquil, arriving at the Port of Posorja, and to every beach on the coast. With these investments, our international maritime transport logistics will improve, as well as our connectivity with other latitudes, attracting all the major shipping companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Continental positioned in Ecuador, both for the industrial and consumer markets?</h4><p>Continental has been here for over 60 years; we are the only tire manufacturer in the country and have the largest market share. This gives us a strong footing in Ecuador, and we cover the industry end to end, from a natural rubber plantation all the way to retailing our tires. We are extremely vertically integrated, and when we throw in the entire supply chain as well, things get interesting. Value creation is one of the statements within the company's vision, so it is paramount for us to generate value in every single step of the chain. In our retail outlets, we primarily focus on tires, though that gives us an opportunity to look at the car in many other ways. We are able to do the entire maintenance needed, and we have an opportunity to expand beyond tire service.</p><h4>Do you do product development locally or centrally?</h4><p>We rely on a technical agreement with Continental AG, and all the basic innovation is done centrally. Our technical teams focus on customized products to accommodate for regional specifics. For the Andean markets, we consider the climate and road conditions, which are different than, for example, Germany. Many roads put stress on tires, as there are many corners and s-turns going up and down due to the specific geography of the Andes. We benefit from being in a big corporation and having all the innovations and newest technologies available in our plants. Manufacturing standards worldwide are the same. In our production facilities in Cuenca, we manufacture tires for passengers cars, trucks, and buses that are distributed across the entire Andean region, the US, Mexico, and other Latin American countries.</p><h4>Ecuador has strong environmental policies in place. How do you approach the environmental aspects of your business?</h4><p>At Continental, we have a concept called Continental 360° and ContiLifeCycle to re-use tires and minimize the ecological impact. We focus on originating the product from locally sourced raw materials and closing the cycle with recycling, rethreading, and other activities to ensure environment friendliness. It is possible to rethread the tires' carcass two to three times; however, some of the imports coming into the country are not feasible or as easily reused. We are working on legislation to ensure that imported tires have a minimum quality that can be recycled. Remarkably, we are able to recycle 97% of all the waste we generate. In terms of social responsibility, we have many programs. We support low-income communities in becoming entrepreneurs and learning how to make pieces of art out of recycled tires, which they subsequently sell. Similarly, another program in Cuenca provides soft floors made out of recycled tires for children's parks.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the coming years?</h4><p>Aside from profitable growth, generating value, being close to our customers, and being the most reliable brand within the region, we have a great deal of room to grow outside of our boundaries. It is important to have great market presence in regions outside of Ecuador, and we have to make sure we are competitive in terms of production. This is one of our biggest challenges because Ecuador is now becoming a more open market. We strongly support this, as long as it is done in an orderly manner; only then will we be truly ready to compete. Our greatest challenge is being able to compete with any other tire producer coming into the country. In open markets, there should be strict enforcement of anti-dumping regulations, because we all need to play by the same rules. If not, unfair competition will destroy the market. Other markets, like the US or EU, have similar rules for low-quality imports from China; however, Ecuador does not. In terms of efficiency, by 2020, we will try to lower our production costs by 20% to become more efficient. In the last 10 years, Continental has invested USD60 million in production facilities in Ecuador, and we strive to create value out of that heavy investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[cheers-to-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the recent trends in the market for beer consumption?</h4><p>We are conducting a campaign celebrating 130 years in the country. In every country, the main beer company and its brand are part of its identity. In Ecuador, there is a connection between Pilsener and Ecuadorians. CN is an emblematic company in Ecuador, not only in terms of our size but our reach among consumers. The beer industry in Ecuador is relatively small; consumption is 32l per capita per year, compared to 45l in Peru, 48l in Colombia, 80l in Mexico, and over 100l in Europe. In Latin America, beer is associated with parties, where there is a high intensity but low frequency. Our first job is to show how one can consume beer without the bad effects, which has to do with moderation. In Ecuador, we have an opportunity to bring beer to more occasions, for example via better alignment with gastronomy. Our idea is to pair our premium brand Club with certain foods and explain that moderated consumption has health benefits. We have an opportunity to grow the entire supply chain. We have 2,000 employees, though there are over 22,000 people who depend indirectly on our business, such as suppliers, packaging, and labels. With that, we move around 1% of the GDP, and we want to work for a better Ecuador. We are part of a global company, though we operate as a local one; our plants, employees, distribution, and consumers are here. We envision being part of the community.</p><h4>How do you envision broadening your portfolio in the market?</h4><p>Three years ago, we were concentrated on Pilsener, which was not sufficient, as we need segmentation to serve different markets. We took on this challenge and decided to expand our portfolio with global brands such as Corona, Stella, and Budweiser. We are currently expanding Club Premium with different varieties. This is a step-by-step process, and we do not want to have too complex flavors. The craft beer movement is great, as it brings excitement to the category and the kind of culture that we need. Together, we are all developing the market. Another differentiation is in packaging; we are currently the only company with cans in the country. We are currently bringing new sizes, such as liter bottles, to the market to give lower-income consumers access to our products.</p><h4>What is your primary distribution in Ecuador?</h4><p>In Latin America, much of the distribution is via small retailers, and mom-and-pop stores are our main channels in Ecuador. Unfortunately, in the last five years, more than 20,000 of such stores have closed down due to the economic situation and stringent regulations. One of our best bets is to recover and rescue those stores. We have a program to bring 15,000 female owners to teach them to manage the business and give them the tools to sell in a more attractive way. We want to improve the life of the retailer, as unemployment is a problem in the country. Each retailer can employ three or four people, and if we can have 15,000 stores, we will have 60,000 people employed. Over 40% of the population in Ecuador is in rural areas, which presents an opportunity for us all, as most companies do not have extensive reach in those areas. We have invested in the last three years to go directly, as in the past 60% of our sales were indirect. Now, we have 92% direct sales and only 8% wholesale. In our sales service model in Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru, we take orders by phone. Our people in the market do not take orders but provide advice on merchandising and bring promotions to the consumer. Our commercial investment goes directly to consumers. As the only company to work this way in the region, we are now exporting this model to Mexico and Central America. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[boost-of-confidence]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the new investment law change the investment landscape, especially in the industrial sector?</h4><p>The law sends an important message to local and foreign investors because we are moving from an economic model based on public to private investment. Ecuador has many resources, and these hold great potential; however, we should focus more on our people. Confidence is the most important element in human interactions, and this law is a message of confidence to the community of investors. In addition, we hope to benefit greatly from the opening up of our economy; since January 2017, we have had an FTA with the EU, and we are currently in negotiations with the US to join the Pacific Alliance. By improving our productivity and adding more value to our products, we can start considering exports. Already, Guayaquil's economy is centered on the port, and with the investments in the Posorja Deep Sea Port, developed in collaboration with Dubai-based DP World, we have an opportunity to strengthen our geographic position as hub for maritime transit in the region. That will move a great deal of commerce and also has potential to boost our productive output.</p><h4>Is the role of the chamber to move these industries up in the value chain?</h4><p>The agricultural sector in particular offers opportunities to improve productivity because it is relatively low there, though the land is fertile. In our chamber, 40% of our industries are related to food and agriculture: shrimp and tuna farming, cocoa, and bananas. A new trend is tropical fruits and super foods such as quinoa, for which global demand is booming. It is essential that we move these industries up in the value chain and use all our resources—Guayaquil has 3 million people and the Polytechnic University—to work on innovation and launch R&amp;D programs with industry players.</p><h4>What is your vision to attract more foreign investment and activities into the industrial sector?</h4><p>We now have the legal framework to provide reassurance to foreign investors and help Ecuador move on the international indexes. We are analyzing our competitiveness and working with the Minister of Foreign Trade and Investment, Pablo Campana, and his team. Ecuador has a dollarized economy, which has given us stability and confidence to foreign investors. To move up these global indexes, we are now reviewing the exact requirements and looking closely at our institutions. Our administration has invested a great deal in compliance activities over the past year. We are meeting with the tax and customs authorities to speed up processes as well as with the Labor Ministry to discuss easing labor laws to give our industries greater flexibility.</p><h4>How do you find the synergies between the different regions in Ecuador?</h4><p>The diversity makes us special. Ecuador is a small country, with incredibly diverse resources and industries, from agriculture and tourism to oil and mining. In addition, we value that diversity, which is reflected in our federation meetings, where 10 chambers come together. We strive to find bonds that can give us added value. Every province has its special characteristics and issues. Certain regions have more heavy industry, such as automotive, while others are purely agricultural. We do not compete but, rather, complement each another. It has not always been this way, so I am proud to be part of this collaborative attitude.</p><h4>What is your vision for the coming years?</h4><p>What moves the industry is labor, and we should transform industry into a sector where people find quality jobs. That is a task that we have assumed domestically. We are also part of the UN Global Compact, which gives us global benchmarks and best practices. Our industries take responsibility for the reducing, reusing, and recycling of their products. The circular economy has a great deal of potential, and we should take advantage of that. Secondly, we are in talks with the local authorities and the academy to recover all those products that can be used as raw materials. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has construction of your new manufacturing plant for shrimp feed advanced, and how will the plant complement your current production capacity?</h4><p>We currently run three factories in Ecuador that are in great shape, though they are not up to date. When Nutreco acquired the Expalsa feed business in Ecuador in May 2013, it decided to build a new production facility in Ecuador. Our new plant is designed according to the latest available technologies and is set to go into production in 1Q2019. There are new regulations for the construction sector, and to comply with the latest building code, we are slightly behind schedule, though we have a more sturdy and secure building.</p><h4>What innovations have you applied in Ecuador, and what part of the research is done locally?</h4><p>Under Nutreco, we have shrimp feed operations in Vietnam, China, Brazil, Honduras, Peru, and Ecuador, and we are building one in India. The Skretting Aquaculture Research Centre (ARC) headquartered in Stavanger, Norway, is working on shrimp nutrition, health, precision farming, and optimal procession. When Nutreco entered the shrimp market, it was already active in feed for livestock and many aquaculture species. Nutreco, then, decided to validate all the nutritional requirements of shrimp. Following the outcomes of that research, we developed Optiline diet and later our health diet under the brand name Lorica. Another project on our R&amp;D agenda are feeding models. Our feeding model at Skretting called AquaSlim employs artificial intelligence, allowing us to plan feeding by the hour and according to the environmental circumstances of the pond. That is a large innovation project that we are implementing under the brand name Skretting 360+. Skretting is the first company to truly pay attention to automatic feeding and invest in automatic feeding. The world needs to produce more with less in order to feed all the people. That is what we managed to do with Skretting 360+, providing a total solution to our customer. Our goal is to make our farmers the most efficient in the world.</p><h4>What makes Ecuador such a successful country in the shrimp farming industry?</h4><p>The first farm that was built in Ecuador in the 1960s still functions today; we are talking about more than 50 years of farming done in the same ponds. In addition, shrimp is native to this region; the shrimp cultivated all over the world originates from Ecuador. Another differentiator is Ecuador taking a different route genetically speaking. In Ecuador and in most parts of the Americas, we work with SPRs, which means they are pathogen-resistant animals, as opposed to pathogen-free animals. Ecuadorian farmers do not disinfect the water with chlorine, as is the case in Asia. Here, the animals grow in a natural environment and are able to survive what nature presents to them. Also, the density of our country plays a role; it is much lower than in Asia. The lower density models have proven over time to be more sustainable. The Ecuador model has a huge potential to be optimized, though without reaching the densities of Asia. When we say we can double production, we are still talking about less than half of what is produced in Asia per hectare, though in a more sustainable way. We are the regional provider and supply Peru and Central America from here.</p><h4>How have you incorporated environmental sustainability into your corporate philosophy?</h4><p>Within the feed industry, Nutreco is one of the first companies in the world to have a clear sustainability policy. We also measure our impact, which is in turn verified by a third party. For shrimp feed production, this applies to all parts of the production process, from raw material sourcing to CO2 emissions. In our business, sustainability is a license to operate and not merely superfluous. At Nutreco, our sustainability agenda is guided by the Nutera program, which has its own C-level director. All our sustainability efforts are audited and reported annually to our stakeholders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did your services develop in recent years?</h4><p>We started in the agro-industrial sector mainly with coffee factory companies and cocoa export companies. Thereafter, we worked in the agribusiness with an important group from Quito that has a large grape and avocado plantation. Around two years ago, we entered the aquaculture business to solve its problems, and we have since grown from one client to around 40 at present. Aquamar, our only client at that time, was the only company that used electricity instead of diesel in shrimp farming. Aquamar's problem was high electricity prices, and after conducting technical studies, we learned that the equilibrium price for electricity should be less than USD0.07 per kWh. Electricity price was more than double of that, so we started working closely with the National Chamber of Aquaculture (CNA), and one year later the government agreed to have a standard policy and a new price for both agriculture and aquaculture sector. We invited other important companies to have an integrated solution. At present, it has become the priority of the government. We have been able to knock on the doors of leading companies and earn their trust, and as a result, the government views us as its representative.</p><h4>Are there similar issues in the banana industry?</h4><p>We face the same problems in the banana and shrimp industries. Once companies switch from diesel to electricity, they can combine three main achievements. First, they are more efficient because of the new technology, which also makes them more competitive. Second, the government is able to sell energy that it previously could not. Third, since diesel is an imported good, it reduces Ecuador's import bill. Our mission as a company is to focus on sustainable development; that is our essence. It is vital to have an impact in terms of climate change.</p><h4>How receptive is the agricultural industry to your solutions to switch their energy to renewable sources?</h4><p>The reception has been great, and it has become a trend. The leading companies are followed by medium-sized companies, which will then be followed by smaller companies. It is important to have promotion and communication of the project, because in order to be inclusive in the use of electricity, we need resources. The limitation is financial, which is why it is important to have international financial partners who share our mission in terms of environmental impact as well as social impact. We also see huge potential in Ecuador's mining sector, and moving forward, we want to develop a synergy between the bananas, shrimp, and mining industries.</p><h4>What other sectors can benefit from your solutions?</h4><p>We have potential to grow in not only aquaculture, agriculture, and mining, but also in the manufacturing sector. The project of electrification will have another impact on the supply chain. If all primary producers switch to electricity, they will be able to increase their production capacities. That will impact both sides, as both downstream feeding industry and the packing industry will need to grow. All this new capacity will open many opportunities for the industrial sector in general. At the same time, the government will have more opportunities to offer electricity.</p><h4>What will be the impact of new investment regulations on the sectors you are active in?</h4><p>All Ecuador has ever needed is confidence, and now, there is a government with a pragmatic vision. The key to attracting new investment is having strong regulations in terms of attracting investors. The new law has done this, and it will have an important impact. It is key to integrate the needs of the private sector, the government, and the globe. Through such efforts, the private sector will win in competitiveness, the government will benefit in terms of revenue, and the pressure on the environment will reduce significantly. At GPS, our passion is sustainable development, and we measure our success by analyzing our impact on the environment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[minor-adjustments-matter]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the largest shrimp producer in the country, how has the market developed in recent years?</h4><p>From 2011-2016, we had the best years for shrimp producers with great volumes and high prices. This is not a common combination, because typically, prices fall when volumes go up; however, the fall in production in Asia gave us a chance to significantly increase our volumes. In addition, we started exporting to China four years ago, which was a new market for us given that it was previously an exporting country as well. Due to a local drop in Chinese production, Ecuadorian producers were able to fill the gap. Since mid-2018, we have witnessed a fall in prices, which could be the end of a cycle and the start of a new one, with smaller margins on our production. That encourages us to become more efficient, especially since Ecuador as a country is relatively expensive because of its USD-pegged currency. That efficiency should come from capitalizing on our foundation, namely our geographic advantage from being located on the equator. For the agro- and aqua-cultural sectors, that means a steady climate and predictable weather conditions; we are able to plan ahead knowing we are not subject to hurricanes, tornadoes, or significant drops in temperature. In general, there are only four- or five-degree variations in the coastal areas. El Niño has the only dramatic impact on production in Ecuador, though we can predict that to some extent as well. Our country is better prepared now as well; we have new roads, bridges, and areas of modification to avoid large disasters due to El Niño. This ecological stability is the main reason why Ecuador is an exceptional producer of bananas and shrimps.</p><h4>How have your exporting markets developed?</h4><p>Santa Priscila is currently the number-four seafood company in America, and the first in the production of shrimps. With the opening of the Chinese market, we are guaranteed large volumes because of the high and growing consumption there. Therefore, we need to focus on what Chinese consumers will request for in the future. Consumers demand quality, and we need to adapt our production to the market demands. The quality in Europe, for example, is different from the US or China. As an example, in China, consumers look at the eyes of shrimps to establish the quality, while in France they do not. In France, consumers prefer a crunch to their meat, whereas Americans do not care. To provide our French consumers with that extra bite, we need to freeze our shrimps in different machines. Processing shrimp is extremely important to create value as a producer in Ecuador, and we are completing two additional processing plants in addition to our three current ones.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the Sustainable Shrimp Partnership (SSP) that you launched with four other shrimp producers?</h4><p>We are extremely strict about this partnership and have issued three essential criteria to be part of this partnership. First, producers should be certified by Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC), which is the foundation for sustainable shrimp farming and is a strict demand by our customers in Europe. Second, we demand zero use of antibiotics, and this is tested constantly, not by means of litmus tests. We strive to limit the environmental impact on the water that we use and test all the water that comes in and goes out. With 10 parameters, we are able to prove that we are in fact returning better-quality water to the environment. The third criterion is traceability, which is guaranteed by the WWF. In the future, I want to add a fourth element, which is the substitution of oil consumption in our machines with electric powered pump stations to replace diesel. This will dramatically reduce our carbon effect once we are able to implement this machinery. Currently, we are investing in that substitution, though it is a slow process because it's a large investment that requires new knowledge, and the government is slow to implement the new high-voltage substation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[fishing-for-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the mandate of your organization and your main activities representing the sector?</h4><p><span></span>The National Chamber of Fisheries is the oldest chamber in the fishing sector; there are other small chambers in other provinces as well. We take care of the whole supply chain, from small and large boats for tuna and pelagic fishing to processing plants. We represent about 55 large companies in both sectors and along two different steps of the chain—extracting and processing—as well as the commercial side. In the tuna business, the most important fisheries sector in Ecuador, we deal with a global market, and thus the industry needs to be in compliance with many conservation measures and policies regarding the ocean. We have an extremely active role in that regard. Ecuador is the second-largest tuna producer in the world. Our main concern today is taking care of the resources in order to remain sustainable so that future generations can also enjoy the product. We are focused on bringing Ecuador's fishery sector to a high certification level, which is the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), and we are working with a group of five companies in order to obtain MSC certification. We recently started the same process with the pelagic business. Ecuador is also a major exporter of shrimp, and one of the key points of this industry is shrimp feed. The main ingredient is the fishmeal that we produce, and we are part of the value chain and require large investments from Cargill, BioMar, or VitaPro. They want local suppliers to be in compliance with sustainable fishing, and we are putting the industry in order; the chamber has taken leadership of this process, and people are coming together because they believe in the chamber.</p><h4>How has the sector grown in recent years?</h4><p>In 2017, we exported USD1.5 billion in fishery products and sold a large amount of other products in the local industry. We held a discussion with the government because it wanted to raise fuel prices for the fishing sector. We demonstrated that for every USD1 it gives us in a differential price of the oil, we return USD2.04 to the economy. We provide direct jobs to more or less 50,000 people, pay around USD200 million in revenue taxes, contribute over USD36 million to the social security system, and also because of the income taxes we pay, our workers receive around USD23 million in profit sharing. We add value to our products; for example, we catch tuna, process it, and produce enhanced products. There are three ways to bring more dollars to our economy: export more, add more debt, or attract investment. To improve our competitiveness, we need to put in new technology in the production process and also have better trade agreement with the group of countries with whom we deal. If we can do all these, we can compete better and export more.</p><h4>What impact will the new investment legislation have on the fishery sector?</h4><p>The country has old fleets, more than 40 years in most cases, and the maintenance of vessels is becoming more expensive. Today, we need better and faster vessels with engines that consume less. Under the law, new boats from Spain, China, and so on will not have to pay VAT, which represents 12% of the price. Another thing that we are working on is finance. We have held several meetings with Corporación Financiera Nacional and are designing a line of credit for this particular purpose. We want to replace the Ecuadorian fleet, and that will protect us for another 40 years. Getting more value out of the same product is also something that we want to do here with the pelagic fishery. This requires a great deal of R&amp;D investments, which is difficult with private funding alone. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main target markets for your company?</h4><p>The most important market for us is Europe, which makes up about 33% of our total sales, followed by Russia with 27%, the Middle East, and then Asia. We have a strategy of diversification in place in order to not concentrate excessively on a single market. Reybanpac is present in four continents and the company is always looking for major clients because they allow us to be at the forefront of changes. For example, the Japanese market, although with no significant volume, is of great value to us because Japanese consumers value taste and presentation. Over our history, the company has been a pioneer in the Russian, Chinese, and Iranian markets; we have always focused on exporting products and expansion. In the beginning, we partnered with multinationals that dominated the world marketing in the 1980s, but we no longer depend on them. We are proud to say that we have autonomy in the four continents we operate in, directly reaching importers worldwide.</p><h4>Is your distribution channel primarily via retailers directly? </h4><p>Although our main target in Europe, Japan, and Russia are supermarkets, we are glad to work with key importers in Turkey, the Middle East, and Far East regions. Importers are important because they allow us to be present in certain markets with a greater volume. We are not present in the US because multinationals dominate the market. The Chinese market has great potential for Ecuadorian companies and moving forward, it will grow substantially. </p><h4>What distinguishes the Reybanpac banana from others in the market?</h4><p>Ecuador is a unique country in terms of banana production for several reasons. First, we have the best seasonal cycle of all producing countries; our produce is ready when demand in the northern hemisphere is peaking. Moreover, Ecuador is among the countries with the best type of land and climate, making its bananas stable with a long shelf life. In terms of taste, the Ecuadorian banana's long healthy life means it gets the most out of the ripening cycle, translating into better sugar levels. Equally important, Ecuador has more than 4,000 independent producers, whereas Costa Rica has around 50 and Colombia less than 20. Among Ecuadorian producers, Reybanpac differentiates itself by market diversification, generating value for clients, and having several social and environmental certifications that allow us to guarantee what we produce is in harmony and respect of the environment and social regulations. Moreover, the volume we produce as a responsible and sustainable grower has allowed us to continue growing, participate in demanding markets, and be present throughout the marketing supply chain.</p><h4>How important are international certifications to develop your global exports?</h4><p>International certifications are extremely important because supermarkets demand Global Gap, Rainforest, and a series of other certifications from us. Similarly, our company is permanently being audited by third parties, more precisely, our social and environmental commitments. Today, banks, supermarkets, importers, and even unions demand that we be audited on a regular basis. </p><h4>How have you incorporated environmental sustainability in your production philosophy, and what is your vision on organic bananas?</h4><p>Unfortunately, since 1993 Ecuador has a law that mandates that the industry not expand its production areas. This has limited Ecuador's global market share because other international markets have been growing at the same time; however, we must focus more on the issue of productivity because it is the key to reducing costs and staying competitive. Indeed, growing organic bananas is an alternative, and our strategic plan is designed to increase our organic banana production; it is a growing segment though it is still lacking in terms of volume. We believe its potential will grow in the future. We have to find other ways; the Ecuadorian banana industry must incorporate biotechnology, nanotechnology, telemetry, digitalization, and artificial intelligence to have a precision agriculture that will allow us to increase productivity and handle numerous elements at the same time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main activities of your association in support of the banana industry?</h4><p>The association was founded 20 years ago and initially started as a cooperation of five companies. At present, we have 57 companies that represent almost 70% of Ecuador's banana exports. We function as the contact point between the ministries of agriculture, labor, environment, and health, the IRS, the local governments of the various regions with banana plantations, banana producers, and all other companies in the supply chain. We work with the Ministry of Foreign Trade to promote more FTAs with other countries, so that our bananas can be exported under the same tariffs as our competitors. So far, we only have an FTA with the EU after many years of negotiations but in 2020, we will have the same tariffs as Colombia, Peru, and Central American exporters. Hopefully, that will help us capture 40% of the market share in Europe. In the US, we also have zero tariffs, though unfortunately, we are losing that market because Mexico and Guatemala produce at 15% lower costs and are geographically closer. The Ecuadorian banana is the most expensive in the region, though it is still the most desirable in the world for three reasons: flavor, shelf life, and quality.</p><h4>You represent both independent exporters and those that produce for international companies. What is the balance?</h4><p>Back when we had five companies, Bananera Noboa had a market share of more than 50%, and the other associates had the rest. That has changed significantly, and today we have around 200 exporting companies. Part of the reason for this growth is the containerization of the supply chain, making it easier for producers to become exporters. Many large supermarket chains buy directly from producers because they have traceability, certifications, certainty that they will not fail with the product, the knowledge, and the quality. This way, supermarkets avoid intermediaries and buy directly. In Colombia and Costa Rica, all producers come out with a yearly price and contract, but unfortunately, we do not have that level of formality in Ecuador yet. As an association, we make our information available to all players. We do not work according to particular interests but trade interests; we do not participate in politics and do not intend to do so.</p><h4>Exports in the banana market grow around 8% per year and in 2017, it grew by 400% in Africa. What are the reasons behind this growth?</h4><p>Our main market as a block is the EU, and Russia, as a country. Russia is our largest buyer and takes around 25% of our national export. Ecuadorian bananas last seven days longer on hangers compared to other bananas, which is an advantage for both supermarkets and consumers. However, we want to further boost the European market, since we only reach eight out of 28 EU countries. Within the EU, the largest buyers are Germany and Italy, and they distribute the product; however, we want to directly reach other countries in the region. We also want a greater presence in the GCC, in countries such as Qatar and the UAE, and Asia. We will enter the region through Turkey, which is why we are pursuing a trade agreement with Turkey. We want a greater global participation, though we should improve our domestic productivity and our international supply chain to get there.</p><h4>How do you envision further product diversification in the banana industry?</h4><p>In our national production, we have baby bananas, organic bananas, purple bananas, conventional bananas, and plantain. All are perfectly compatible, and that range of different products is generated from the same plant. The current challenge is to brand these new products to the world; we need a R&amp;D department in the future so that our new banana varieties are more productive, consumable, and sustainable for the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Agripac has significantly increased its presence in the country. Could you tell us more about the company's advancement in recent years?</h4><p>Agripac's new strategy is to go directly to end customers—farmers, shrimp producers, growers, and so on. Most of our growth has come from our own retail chain. In 2018, we opened five new stores, reaching a total of 180 stores throughout the country. In mid-sized cities like Quevedo and Machala, we are building larger stores and warehouses to provide farmers with our whole range of products like seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. In addition to our traditional products like shrimp feeds, chicken feeds, and cattle feeds, we have our own brands of dog and cat food, Buen Can and NutraPro, which is a premium brand. Both are produced in Ecuador and compete against imported products of multinationals. We are currently expanding our capacity with state-of-the-art machinery to ensure the quality and growth of our pet food line. In our agricultural division, we have a strong supply line for the production of maize, potatoes, vegetables, and flowers in the highlands.</p><h4>What other products do you produce locally, and which products are imported?</h4><p>Local products consist of around 30-40% of our total sales, while the rest is imported. All our animal feeds are produced locally. Our factory for agrochemicals is located in Ecuador, from which we export to Peru and Colombia. Agripac shifted from being an import company 47 years ago to an agro-industrial company with its own factories and distribution channels. Currently, we have stores in the jungle as far as Lago Agrio to support the local maize industry as well as in the highlands and the coast—all stocked via our own logistics operations. We have developed a domestic supply chain for farmers and shrimp growers. We are primarily focused on Ecuador, though we plan to export to neighboring countries to grow through organic expansion. Five years ago, we had total annual sales of USD200 million, which has grown to a projected figure of USD300 million for 2018.</p><h4>How have you incorporated sustainability and social responsibility in your company's philosophy?</h4><p>We take different actions in social responsibility. One of our programs is “La Escuelita," where we recruit recent graduates in agriculture for on-the-job training. We also provide free technical training to farmers to maximize their harvests. Currently, we are working on a project to develop online training programs for our farmers. Furthermore, we support local governments when they want to develop small farming projects in their regions. In terms of environmental sustainability, we have launched a product line of organic products for the banana sector. With AeroAgripac, we are perhaps the only certified company that offers aero fumigation with a certified organic plain for organic plantations. Five years ago, we launched a dedicated committee for CSR, which has evolved into a focus group for sustainability. In coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture, we participated in a program called “Plan Semilla," which supports small farmers to grow their maize, rice, and other crops, providing them with seeds, fertilizers, and training to improve their productivity. The local Association of Agriculture Supplies (APCSA) is now approaching the new minister to propose something similar, as collaboration between the public, private sectors, and academia is important for the development of our society. These programs should be transparent and provide real support to farmers.</p><h4>How do you envision the agro- and aquaculture sector developing, and what does that mean for Agripac?</h4><p>In the agriculture sector, products like maize, rice, palm, and cocoa will continue developing; one of our advantages is that we have the highest international quality standards for these traditional crops. Moreover, we should continue developing closer relations with international markets in order to know their needs and provide other agriculture products like exotic and tropical fruits. For example, the global market for chocolate is demanding higher percentages of cocoa so we should take that opportunity. The aquaculture sector is still growing although its demand slowed down slightly during 2017 after an aggressive growth for seven years. We are continuously innovating and creating solutions for this sector in order to take new opportunities to grow. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you envision diversifying the country's agricultural output?</h4><p>To properly develop the concept of sustainability, there must be diversification in each agrarian production chain. Rotating banana with another crop is difficult. However, Ecuador has advanced in a positive way in terms of sustainability over the last 10 years. Many labor standards, environmental protections, and the distribution of banana land have been preserved. To sustain dollarization, Ecuador needs more agricultural exports, and our great diversity of microclimates allows us to produce 52 weeks a year. Ecuador needs a public agricultural policy to identify stellar products and encourage their sowing, transportation, and value transformation. There is potential for all tropical and Andean crops that have a market space. The current government, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are working together to make these products shine on the international market.</p><h4>How do you address the ministry's social responsibility and empower smaller communities in the economic process?</h4><p>The public agricultural policy must be developed for the coming years. At this moment, small producers in Ecuador are suffering significantly because the crops have lost their competitiveness in the last 20 years. As part of the agricultural public policy, we must empower and strengthen groups of small producers with a long-term business vision. Our system of public and private banking has to strengthen the associativity and specialized credit for those small producers who can only develop jointly. The increase in productivity, with associative practices and the transformation of the value of their products, might help them compete in international markets. If there are no adequate credits or technical assistance, that project is not possible. Some products work well, and they only need support and strengthening through better infrastructure such as more roads, access to cheaper electricity, and access to essential services to have traceability and certifications.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the new investment law on the agriculture sector?</h4><p>We are reviewing the regulation of the law. The mission of the Ministry of Agriculture is to work together with public and private agencies to add to the new law the necessary incentives to develop the sector. It is extremely important to take advantage of this law to have higher levels of competitiveness. This law will be beneficial for Ecuador, which needs lower costs of fertilizer, supplies, and machinery in order to significantly improve production. This law also seeks to strengthen agricultural insurance and the support of private banks. Our challenge is that the interest rate of public banking for the agrarian sector comes down coupled with the elimination of risks. Risks fall when there is better infrastructure. If the objective of public policy is to increase agricultural exports, we must encourage the diversification of exports through this regulation.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the coming year regarding policies, creating employment, and having a healthy and flourishing agricultural sector?</h4><p>The rural sector contributes a high percentage of employment, though we recognize there is greater poverty in the rural sector. Our goal is to reduce that rural poverty. Another objective is for our agricultural exports to increase. Those two goals go hand in hand. We have to ensure that small family farming is strengthened, which will happen when there is a more transparent market with less intermediation. In Ecuador, there are cost expensive products with inadequate prices that are difficult to balance; however, if we lower production costs, we can help small farmers economically sustain an agricultural activity. At this moment, this way of subsisting is complicated in the country, though not impossible. Another objective of the ministry is to ensure each agricultural sector has its specific credit and the increase of industrialized products, especially of small producers. Ecuador must enter into a process to achieve traceability processes and certifications that guarantee food security and access to markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[factors-of-differentiation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you expect investment activity in the refinery and energy spheres to evolve in the coming years?</h4><p>Regarding upstream investment activities, we have seen new players enter the country with new contracts for smaller, mature oil blocks. However, these new investors continue to seek financing sources to fund their own operations. This places pressure on local contractors to provide financing by means of delayed payments for engineering and construction services. On a positive note, the government is putting these oil fields in the hands of the private sector, which should lead to more efficient and productive extraction of resources. In the downstream sector, there is much to do regarding the rehabilitation of the Esmeraldas Refinery, the largest in Ecuador. Currently, these initiatives are stalled due to legal processes, and once these are resolved, a new stage of investment can begin. We are optimistically awaiting this new period of projects that will stimulate local engineering and construction companies.</p><h4>How much activity is there in terms of hydropower projects?</h4><p>In Ecuador, there are currently small-scale hydroelectric projects in the planning phase because of the significant capacity that has been installed over the past decade. There is still some work to be done as not all of the major hydroelectric plants installed are working at full capacity. When all are operational, there should not be any need for new hydropower projects other than perhaps some small developments. We expect opportunities in thermoelectric power, as there should be proportional balance in order to meet the country's needs during periods of droughts. In the case of Ecuador, we have a significant capacity in hydro but a limited thermal capacity.</p><h4>What are your current projects in Ecuador?</h4><p>We mainly focus on the oil and gas and the power generation sectors, as the industrial sector is limited. There are a few opportunities in the industrial sector for a company like ours, with high quality and safety standards akin to the oil, power, and mining industries. If the country and the current industries enter a growing phase of expansion projects, perhaps we will see more opportunities. We are a full-service engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) and commissioning contractor and currently have the capacity to develop anything the industry might need. We have experience in 18 countries in Latin America; however, we work mainly in Ecuador. We continually look for opportunities in other countries.</p><h4>How do you stay competitive and remain one of the leading EPC contractors?</h4><p>Innovation is difficult when one is trying to survive, which has been the case for the last three years. We have several factors of differentiation with respect to other companies, though the key one is our strict code of ethics, which we have maintained uncompromised for the 45 years of our existence. We have a track record of over 500 projects, all of them completed on time. The third factor is that most clients come back to work with us as they recognize the quality and value in our work.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for 2019?</h4><p>We plan to triple our 2018 revenue. We are optimistic as the resurgence of oil prices benefits our industry. We are in talks with private companies in the oil industry that will be investing in new production capacity, and we have a major opportunity in the rehabilitation of the Esmeralda Refinery. We are certainly optimistic about the future. Political change in the country is slow, though recently there has been a change of course. In the case of Acero de los Andes, we have maintained its production capacity, and are ready for new opportunities. Many of the companies that were competitors of SANTOS CMI are having serious problems; some have disappeared while others are completely inactive due to allegations of corruption. This has given us great wexpectations of what we can do when the country's economic situation improves. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[area-of-expertise]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the primary expertise that Belorusneft brings to the market, and how did your operations in Ecuador advance?</h4><p>Belorusneft is a state-owned company based in Belarus with a history that dates back to the Soviet Union. Already at that time, our expertise and experience in seismic exploration were globally renowned. Internationally, we have mostly been active in Africa and Asia. In Latin America, we started working on seismic projects in 2006, starting in Venezuela where we operate under a joint venture. When the economic crisis started in Venezuela, we started exploring other opportunities in the region and expanded to the Ecuadorian market in 2012. While starting operations here, we realized our equipment, experience, and technologies were pretty advanced, which meant we could be tremendously competitive. In the beginning, we primarily worked with Petroamazonas, although it has largely suspended its seismic exploration activities. Our primary project is in the Armadillo field, which is developing well. Thus far, we have done a number geological studies, modeling, simulation, and reinterpretation of seismic data. We drilled five oil wells in the first phase, and the second phase, which we are commencing soon, includes seven new wells. Importantly, we see possibilities of the increase in reserves for this oil field. Due to the geological studies that we conducted, we found a new oil pool in these oil fields; our expertise allowed us to increase the country's reserves, making this project even more profitable.</p><h4>How is the collaboration with the Ecuadorian state-owned petroleum firms?</h4><p>For its oil industry, Ecuador offers to investors mostly service-type contracts, which is a quite unique approach, as most foreign investors are used to production sharing agreement (PSA)-type contracts. Also, service contracts make it more difficult for investors to obtain financing. There have been significant improvements made to the investment climate, but the country could become more dynamic. From our perspective, it is not about regulations and legislations, but about the legal stability and strict enforcement of regulations and legislations. Amidst the crisis, unfortunately most of Petroamazonas' obligations were not fulfilled, making it difficult for international companies to invest again; however, we have seen some improvements in the recent dialog with the government. Our activities in Ecuador will mainly depend on how our dialog continues and what type of agreements we will sign with the other parties. Oil prices have been recovering, which should improve the volume of investment in the petroleum sector, but Ecuador has been relatively slow in exiting from the crisis. Not having its own currency is another reason for Ecuador's slow economic recovery. This process is only beginning, and the economic recovery will largely depend on the government's approach to the investment stability. In order to prosper, Ecuador has to open dialog with the private sector and focus on improving relations with companies that are already in Ecuador because these companies have a great deal of potential to increase investments in the country.</p><h4>How important is continuous innovation in your industry?</h4><p>Our company has approximately 25,000 people working around the globe, including an R&amp;D institute in Belarus with a staff of 1,500. We employ this institute to solve different situations and problems, including those we come across in Ecuador. The country has huge opportunities to improve its oil industry with all the technologies that are available. Seismic exploration, for example, has not been done in many regions of Ecuador yet. At present, the ball is with the Ecuadorian government, and we are awaiting its investment decisions and fulfillment of undertaken obligations. 2019 will be a key year, and the company will be able to take several strategic decisions, including the possibility of increasing its investments for its operations in Ecuador by mid-2019. Similarly, many other international companies such as Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Sinopec are waiting to take key decisions regarding future investments in Ecuador. </p>]]></richbody0content>

These are important steps and strategies in a world that demands new technologies not only in terms of social responsibility and care for the environment, but also in relation to the cyclicality of fluctuating oil and gas prices. To be competitive in this market, we are obliged to offer a much cheaper solution. The only way to develop a competitive product and service in the market is through innovation. We expand through the added value we offer, as well as our differentiating products. The company was the result of our experience in the area of hydraulic pumping with patented technology from the US, Russia, and Canada. This experience allowed us to take on new challenges, not only the bottom side of the well but also to incorporate integral solutions on the surface, which means design, construction, and early operations for onshore or offshore installations. The knowledge acquired over 28 years allows us to assume the new challenge of developing new energy projects. SERTECPET wants to focus on hydroelectric, geothermal, wind, and solar projects. For this, we have made essential alliances with important centers of science and technology throughout the world. For example, we have an agreement with the University of Bologna, the University of Edinburgh, and MIT. Today, in the era of digitalization and climate change, the world requires lower-cost sources of energy that encompass, in turn, the entire energy spectrum. Our strategy is to collaborate with the winners and the most important companies and institutions to have corporate value and competitive advantages.</p><h4>What are the main developments in the sector currently?</h4><p>Our specialty is oil. The country's commitments determine the opportunities presented in the clean energy and new energy sectors in Ecuador to the UN regarding climate change, as well as the country's success in taking advantage of its natural resources. We have essential solar work related to the luminance capacity per day. In the same way, we have significant areas to apply wind energy; furthermore, the country is in a volcanic zone, which is a great development opportunity for geothermal projects. Ecuador can take a step toward clean energies, more specifically in new energies. When SERTECPET decided to make the leap, it saw the capabilities and environmental possibilities of Ecuador. On the other hand, we have to look for ways to create synergies between the state and attracting investment capital with projects presented to the government as part of new energy solutions. We have a large hydroelectric capacity installed; however, in times of drought, plants cannot perform at maximum capacity. Wind and solar energy can compensate for this situation, as they now offer cheap solutions. We collaborate with solar panel manufacturers, wind turbine manufacturers, and companies specialized in drilling and geothermal energy production. We have an impressive infrastructure and installation capacity that allows us to serve any market, be it oil, gas, or other energies. We can design and manufacture tools and equipment for any of these industries.</p><h4>How have you transformed from an EPC contractor into a technology provider?</h4><p>We still serve the oil sector; however, we manage other projects to provide integrated solutions in different independent areas. In Ecuador, the only thing that makes a difference is that all stakeholders share the same ideal of working together to design a long-term vision to build a first world country. SERTECPET follows that thought and seeks the best technology, human talent, processes, infrastructure, and international business model. For example, in 2017, the company received the Ibero-American Quality Award because our business model was comparable to Malcolm Baldrige's model in the US. To be a competitive country, Ecuador needs to develop multinational companies. When SERTECPET collaborates with other countries, our goal is to improve the general value, and that is our secret weapon. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the major changes in the hydrocarbon transport industry that FLOPEC has had to adapt to?</h4><p>FLOPEC is an Ecuadorian company that has been in the market for more than 45 years. FLOPEC is only involved in oil transportation, and since 2006, it has been adapting to the different changes and trends in the oil transport industry. EP PetroEcuador sells oil on a free on board (FOB) and delivered at terminal (DAT) basis to its clients, so we mostly deal with buyers of crude oil and providers of oil products. Initially, we provided a transport service with limited tonnage, mostly depending on third-party vessels; however, after 2006, we became part of the biggest pool of Panamax vessels in the world. Thus, we have increased our business and are part of international shipping operations because we use the pooling system. This gives FLOPEC more access to shipping routes, allowing it to become an international shipping company.</p><h4>How have you expanded your regional operations?</h4><p>We seek to depend less on the Ecuadorian market and be part of the international market. The Ecuadorian market is shifting; therefore, we need to adapt and compete in the international market. In 2006, 85-90% of Ecuadorian crude oil was exported using Panamax vessels. Over the years, the trend has shifted to bigger vessels, and now, Aframax vessels are the most commonly used vessel for exports. We adapted by transporting 50% of our exports by Aframax vessels. At present, 70% of our business in the Panamax pool is outside the country and is not dependent on the Ecuadorian market. We have operations not only on the West Coast, but also in the Atlantic, Asia, and other regions. As FLOPEC now depends 70% on the international market and because we do not have enough owned tonnage, we have to depend heavily on third-party tonnage. Companies without their own tonnage are even more exposed to market cycles. Therefore, FLOPEC is focused on acquiring more vessels of its own.</p><h4>How do you finance your capital expenditure on new vessels?</h4><p>We have always used financing to buy vessels, mostly through international loans. In 2017, we created a new credit facility to refinance the balance of the Aframax vessels we previously bought. Refinancing after 10 years through to the end of the life of a ship is usually how credit works in the maritime sector. We did the refinancing in 2017 with a shipping fund for about USD50 million. Moreover, we already have pre-approval from several banks for a credit facility of USD130 million. We want to start using that to purchase new vessels at end-2018.</p><h4>What are the main export destinations for FLOPEC?</h4><p>Chile and Peru have always imported 10-15% of Ecuador's crude oil over the last 10 years. When the price of crude is high, a great deal of it goes to Panama for storage or transshipment to Asia on larger vessels. When the price is lower, the crude just goes straight to final destination, which is usually 45% to the US west coast, 7% to the US Gulf, 15% to Chile, and 15% to Peru, while Panama buys 15-35% of Ecuador's crude oil depending on the price.</p><h4>What is your outlook for FLOPEC and the sector as a whole for the coming year?</h4><p>It is important for Ecuador to maintain its level of production. For us, it is important that there are new contracts and products to fully utilize our ships and grow our fleet. We need to be on top of production levels and new supply contracts so that we know how many ships are needed. We have a close working relationship with the ministry and are also taking advantage of our strong relationship with EP Petroecuador. The government is currently seeking more investment to maintain and increase oil production in Ecuador and this is crucial to our future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you estimate Ecuador's potential in terms of mining, and what is your role in the exploration process?</h4><p>Ecuador has always been considered attractive for its geological resources. Moreover, it generated great expectations and interest in the international mining sector due to legal reforms, policies, and incentives. IIGE is developing the Geological Research and Availability of Mineral Resources Occurrences in the Ecuadorian Territory, which aims to create and update geological maps on a 1:100,000 scale and maps of mineral occurrences on a 1:50,000 scale, which is relevant information in order to determine the real geological potential and provide useful information to all stakeholders.</p><h4>In general, what is the primary mandate of IIGE, and what are your main activities?</h4><p>IIGI is the successor of INIGEMM, bringing all the competencies to this new institution. It did not lose its essence of research focused on the geological-mining sector; on the contrary, it was reinforced with the experience of the former National Institute of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (INER). With the creation of IIGE, scientific research in earth sciences has been strengthened, improving institutional capabilities and generating a specialized human and technical resource, with greater scope for scientific work, technological development, and local innovation. Our mission is to generate and promote knowledge in the fields of geology and energy, through scientific research, technical assistance, and specialized services for the responsible use of renewable and non-renewable resources, contributing to decision making for the benefit of society.</p><h4>What is the economic significance of mining operations for the secondary industries around your mining project, for example for the local supply chain and offset for SMEs?</h4><p>Responsible mining projects stimulate local economies with the creation of small businesses and entrepreneurship in order to satisfy the needs of the mining industry. In October, the Minister of Economy and Finance, Richard Martinez, presented the credit, investment, and employment prosperity plan with the participation of the country's public financial institutions to encourage investment amongst large and small companies, in which both metallic and non-metallic mining activities should be immersed. The program will allocate USD650 million in loans for 2018 and USD741 million in 2019. Industry, services, commerce, exports, forestry, and stock will benefit from this program.</p><h4>How have you incorporated environmental sustainability into your geological surveys?</h4><p>Exploratory works carried out by IIGE seek to create a balance and a harmonious relationship between the technicians of the institution, society, and nature. This implies achieving development results without threatening the sources of our natural resources or compromising those of future generations. Geological research projects are a basic and necessary information tool in order to acknowledge the potential of the use of the soil and the existing geological resources. The geological work is also required in order to help decision makers carry out policies and programs according to the real characteristics of the national territory and promote responsible planning.</p><h4>What are your expectations of the impact of the new investment law on the mining industry?</h4><p>Mining is a long-term activity that will outlast governments and different political, legal, and economic situations. In this manner, the new law is definitely an invitation to consider Ecuador as an attractive destination for investment, though there are also other conditions that must be guaranteed, for example the opening of the Mining Cadaster. Regarding cooperation between national and international institutions, we consider it fundamental for the promotion of the country and the exchange of research activities and knowledge. We have developed several research projects with the Canadian International Resources and Development Institute (CIRDI), the Geological Mining and Metallurgical Institute of Peru (INGEMMET), and the Argentine Mining Geological Service (SEGEMAR), to name a few. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>One of Lumina's projects in Ecuador is Cangrejos, in the southeast province of El Oro in the relatively under-explored copper belt across the Andes. How have your operations advanced here, and what are your expectations? </h4><p>We have explored about half of the area and produced the preliminary economic assessment, which has provided important information. We have already identified 8.9 million ounces of gold resource there, which makes it one of the largest gold projects in the country. In November, we will start the complementary in-field, out-step, and hydrological drilling program along with further metallurgical testing, and then soon after, we will take the project into the pre-feasibility stage. There is a great deal of complementary technical information that needs to be obtained, such as resource and geo-technical information, and we need to continue to progress with the infrastructure design. We focus extensively on environmental and community aspects, as the project is an area with low-population density and no indigenous communities. Exploration in the Cangrejos area commenced in 1994, and later Odin Mining del Ecuador formed a JV with Newmont to explore the concessions. During the 2016 tender process, we were able to make the best proposal for the complementary “Cangrejos 20" area, which was a driver for us to keep going and advancing the project. At present, we have two rigs in place and may have at least one more by December 2018. We will be drilling close to 20,000m more in the coming year, just to take it to pre-feasibility. There is a great deal of new infrastructure being built by us, including new roads and camp facilities, and we have highly qualified consultants and internal geologists working on every aspect of the advance exploration program. </p><h4>How have you incorporated environmental sustainability and social responsibility into your corporate philosophy?</h4><p>We comply with all local and international industry environmental standards. Being a listed company, we comply with e3 PDAC CSR standards, which is what we have implemented already. We have strong environmental, safety, and community standards, and we bring in external consultants who review our programs. Our CSR team is a professional group of Ecuadorian employees headed by a Lumina Gold expert from Canada. We provide many opportunities to local environmental consultants. We have 44 concessions, so we are a major operator with more than 140,000ha turned into 11 projects, which requires an interactive team of different type of qualified professionals.</p><h4>In mid-2018, Lumina Gold did a major corporate restructuring with the inception of Luminex. What was envisioned with that strategic reorganization?</h4><p>We have a flagship project that will be a commercial product in the near future. We do not want to have all concessions under the same company because if we do a transaction, it would require us to put the other properties in the deal as well. When we started looking at opportunities for joint ventures for some of these projects, we created Luminex resources. So far, we have two JVs locally, one with Anglo American for the Pegasus A and B Projects in Central Ecuador, and another with First Quantum Minerals for the Cascas and Orquideas projects in southern Ecuador.</p><h4>How is the dialog with the government on fiscal and regulatory environment for large-scale mining investments?</h4><p>The dialog with the government is fairly healthy. Although Ecuador has experienced recent changes in the mining and environment ministries, the fiscal conditions are becoming better and welcoming for international investment at large-scale mining. The new investment law eliminates the application of the windfall tax and reduces the royalties from 5 to 3%. Moreover, companies that reinvest at least 50% of their profits in new productive assets will be exempted from the Currency Expatriation Tax. The private sector has been involved in all the changes and as the presence of international mining companies grows, we will reach a critical mass of companies, able to position ourselves into a more prominent position. Mining should take up 10-15% of the GDP in the next five years; however, at the same time, it is important for industrialization to take the environment and communities into account. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lundin Gold acquired the Fruta del Norte project in 2014. How has the operation advanced since then?</h4><p>The project is going well. Following the completion of a feasibility study in 2016, we signed the main agreements with the government of Ecuador. In 2017, we completed basic engineering and the preliminary site works to prepare for the start of construction. We began detailed engineering and construction in July 2017 and anticipate producing first gold in 4Q2019. We are fully financed through a combination of equity and debt, and our entire focus now is on first production. Fruta del Norte is unique given the high gold grade.</p><h4>What is the economic significance of your operations for the secondary industries around your mining project?</h4><p>Lundin Gold has always been focused on local hiring and procurement. Out of the 3,000 people who are currently working for Lundin Gold, as of the end of September, approximately 59% are from local communities, and 95% of our employees and our contractors' workforce are Ecuadorian. The workforce will soon transition from construction to operations. In terms of local procurement, we take our responsibility seriously. With the Lundin Foundation, we train local businesses to ensure their processes and compliance for tax and social security are in place. In 2017, we spent around USD1 million a month on local suppliers, which has since doubled to over USD2 million per month in 2018.</p><h4>How has the dialog with the government been for such large-scale mining projects?</h4><p>As we were the first company to build a western-style mine in the country, it required some patience on our side and education on the government's side. The challenge has been our schedule, where government authorities do not have the same sense of urgency. Sometimes, that means we have to move slower than we would like as we work with various government bodies. The government is realizing that mining will be a contributor to the local and national economy and an important source of FDI.</p><h4>How have you incorporated environmental and sustainable policies into your operations here?</h4><p>The environmental protection side is extremely important for us. We are a public Canadian company, which already brings certain compliance. We have had three fundamental company principles since day one. The first is to work safely, and we have a strong health and safety record. Protecting the environment is our second principle; we started this project with just 40 employees onsite and currently have 3,000, but still we have continuous green campaigns to pick up litter, as one example. Our third principle is respect, not just for each other, but also for all the stakeholders involved—including the local communities and environment. In addition, because of our financing model, we have high sustainability standards. Part of our financing is debt financing with seven international banks, and we are committed to meet all IFC standards and equator principles for environmental protection.</p><h4>In 2018, you raised USD1 billion of financing to develop the mine. How did that come about?</h4><p>That was one of the largest financing rounds in Ecuador in a long time. The first phase was USD300 million from private equity firms Orion Mine Finance Group and Blackstone Tactial Opportunities fund. We also raised USD400 million in equity with an Australian company called Newcrest. The Lundin family invested an additional USD50 million, bringing its total investment to USD250 million. Orion also invested USD100 million. The final part was debt financing from seven banks: ING Capital, Société Générale, Caterpillar, the Bank of Nova Scotia, KfW IPEX-Bank, Natixis, and the Bank of Montreal. This brought us to USD1 billion in total financing raised, which is purely commercial financing, without the participation of the World Bank or other development banks. This will carry us through to first gold extraction. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SolGold's main project in the country is Cascabel, a copper and gold resource in the northwest of Ecuador. How have your operations advanced?</h4><p>SolGold has advanced rapidly since it arrived in Ecuador in 2012. We have invested over USD150 million in state-of-the-art geoscience and best industry practices with community engagement and social and environmental responsibility. In this short period of time, we have taken what was a stream sediment anomaly to a Tier 1 world-class copper gold deposit at Alpala in the Cascabel concession. We have drilled over 150,000m of diamond core to date and are currently engaged in an intensive program of both exploration and appraisal drilling to increase the size and grade of the Alpala orebody. At the same time, we have commenced feasibility studies with preparation of the preliminary economic analysis. Our head office is in Quito, and we have a base at Rocafuerte and field camp in Alpala. We expect to complete our pre-feasibility study by end-2019 and our feasibility study by end-2020. After that, we will be looking to get a development decision subject to financing and permitting procedures. We are planning a major project and expect the resource size to keep growing along with these plans.</p><h4>As the largest tenement holder in Ecuador, you explore well over 3,200sqkm in the country. How do you currently run these explorations, and have you found sites where you envision new projects?</h4><p>Since our experience investing in Ecuador has been so positive from the beginning, we decided early on that we wwwould like to explore other projects in Ecuador and commenced project generation for the most prospective areas in 2013. We currently hold 72 concessions, which are held in four separate SolGold subsidiaries that are 100% owned by SolGold. Each subsidiary is equipped with separate management and exploration teams as well as community liaison and health safety and environment technicians. Our progress across Ecuador has been as rapid as our progress at Cascabel, and we have already identified 11 high priority targets that have the potential to be major discoveries. We have also relinquished four concessions that we found to be low priority after initial exploration work. Subject to permitting, we expect to be drill testing the five best targets as soon as possible.</p><h4>What is the economic significance of your operations for the secondary industries around your mining project, for example for the local supply chain and economic offset to SMEs?</h4><p>We currently employ over 450 people, of which 95% are Ecuadorian. We also have a growing team of specialized consultants around the world. Many of our employees are female, including 25% of our Cascabel geology team. At Cascabel, we have contributed to many community development projects in coordination with the local government, which empowers local families, and we endorse all the local industries and businesses in our project areas. When Alpala goes into production, we expect employment to peak at about 7,500 and the flow-on effect to benefit many multiples of this. The economic benefits for Ecuador in royalties and taxes and benefits to local businesses and citizens will be substantial.</p><h4>What environmental policy have you incorporated in your operations in Ecuador?</h4><p>We are extremely conscious of environmental responsibility and have put in great effort into operating at the highest industry standards. Our principle concerns are water, fauna, and flora, and the project we are designing will minimize and manage impacts using state-of-the-art technology and techniques. For example, all our drilling rigs use sediment recovery units (SRU), which cleans sediment from water using vibration. When Alpala eventually goes into production, we envisage an underground block cave development, which will have a much smaller environmental footprint than an open cut mine. We want this project to exemplify best practices.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the coming year?</h4><p>We plan to double the size of Alpala, complete prefeasibility studies, progress permitting and fiscal framework discussions, and discover several additional projects throughout Ecuador. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[improved-investment-climate]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the new investment legislation affect the investment climate in the mining and hydrocarbon sector?</h4><p>Following the governmental restructuring, the ministries of hydrocarbons, mining, and energy now operate as one unit. We are in the process of merging Petroamazonas EP and EP Petroecuador into one E&amp;P company that will serve the whole chain. As an administration, we are working to attract foreign investment, with many trade and investment promotion missions to other countries, including the US, China, India, and a number of European countries. Thus far, the regulatory changes have improved the interest of the investment community significantly. This is mainly because of the new legislation with regards to taxation. For many companies that come to Ecuador, there are tax holidays for several years after they commit investments. The mining sector remains a challenge, and I met with ambassadors from the US, Canada, Chile, the UK, and Peru to discuss how we can improve the investment climate. The main issues in the mining sector are our consultations with affected communities and how these processes should be ruled to avoid misunderstandings and misinterpretations, and the approval of the environmental licenses, which currently takes too long. Once these issues are resolved, activities in the sector will move faster.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the progress made in the seven concessions that were made for hydrocarbon extraction?</h4><p>The current government has gone through two positive rounds, where we used the services contracts due to the fact that those blocks were under Petroamazonas, and we had no other option. We have already signed eight contracts worth USD2.3 billion, including the recently renegotiated contracts with the Shushufindi Consortium and the Pardalis Consortium, and we have lowered the tariffs and committed an additional USD800 million in investments. We have already been able to manage USD2.3 billion in investments in these signed and approved projects. In addition, we have reopened the production-sharing type contracts, which has not been done since 2002. We have modified the contracts, because the major issue was all the capital going to the company in case of windfalls. With the new contracts, this is specified and related to the WTI as a marker, and participation changes according to the WTI. This makes the operation smoother and more agreeable. We see this as a great advantage for us, and the companies prefer it as well, because it is the standard in the industry. Additionally, companies can book reserves and finance operations through these books reserves, making it even more enticing. We have had meetings here and in Houston, and we have already received 11 companies that have purchased data packages. These packages are worth USD100,000, and buying them shows a strong indication of their interest. This is still open, and we hope to continue boosting interest so we can start receiving offers, negotiating, and signing contracts—we expect to start the signing process in March 2019. We expect investments for the eight blocks in the order of USD1 billion.</p><h4>What would be your main message to foreign investors considering investing in Ecuador?</h4><p>The combined ministries are here to support investment and make sure that all investments are taken care of. There is a freshly instilled confidence in the country regarding respecting laws and contracts. We are pushing with Foreign Affairs and the Commerce &amp; Trade Ministry for the negotiation and signing of bilateral investment treaties. I am open to receiving companies and explaining to them the options and presenting to them the portfolio of opportunities in Ecuador. We have projects on existing facilities and plants across the country, and in the energy sector, we are pushing for hydroelectric power and renewable resources. We are in the process of amending electricity laws so that all of these projects can be open to investors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Completing the Green Cycle]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[completing-the-green-cycle]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What made BYD decide to establish its operations in Ecuador?</h4><p>BYD focuses its economic activities on four main areas: electronics; energy storage; solar panels and LED light; and transport, including electric vehicles, monorails, and a small segment for gasoline-powered cars. BYD is a multinational company specializing in eco-efficient technology. The largest electric bus production factory in the US is BYD's located close to Los Angeles, and we have other factories in Brazil, Hungary, and France. We place quality before price. We also have country managers in many countries in Latin America. In 2016, BYD decided to come to Ecuador because it saw potential in three areas. 90% of electricity comes from hydropower, and if we add electric vehicles, we will complete the entire green cycle. The country has high subsidies for fossil fuels; however, these are not sustainable. Ecuador was one of the most advanced countries in terms of providing incentives for electric mobility in Latin America. For example, there were no taxes on electric vehicles, 0% VAT and customs, and special prices to charge these vehicles.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your projects for electric taxis in Loja and electric buses in Guayaquil?</h4><p>The city of Loja issued a regulation that stated all new taxis in the city had to be electric. We started with 35 units that would be distributed by public tender. We gained significant recognition for this, and people realized this technology is feasible for Ecuador. We then moved on to the buses in Guayaquil, which were especially designed for Ecuador. That was the initiative of a small urban transport company but was extremely visionary. We now have 20 buses for Guayaquil. This encouraged policymakers, and they started to create new policies. We have signed an MoU with the national government. We want to create a factory here; however, we need a sustainable demand. BYD requested 300 buses per year to set up the factory. Demand of conventional buses is 1,500-1,900 per year, so it is about 20% of the total demand in the country. We established a roadmap with the ministry of production to determine what is needed to achieve sustainability, such as 0% VAT and 0% customs for electric buses. We also made a commitment to work with universities to get human resources and technology transfers and to bring buses for test drives.</p><h4>How do you envision further improving sustainable mobility for consumers?</h4><p>Our cars have 400-km range, and we need 28 fast chargers to cover the main cities. We already have experience with the taxi chargers in Loja, so we know what we need. Even if electricity rates are low, the stations are not profitable right now because we have a small fleet; it will be a business if we have a larger fleet. That is why there should be a national strategy to include this; the promotion of both vehicles and stations should be done at the same time. The total benefit for electric buses is savings plus revenue from electricity usage. For example, in 15 years these 3,000 buses mean a benefit of USD832 million, including the energy sales. We are a dollarized country, so we cannot print our money. Our production capacity is 300 buses per year, 300 direct jobs, a direct investment of USD60 million, and a long-term investment of USD300 million for the factory. It can be scaled up for the production of electric trucks. Another issue is that in Ecuador, if a company has a credit line that is 100% more than its assets, it has to present a guarantee of 120%. For the past project in Guayaquil, the operator has assets for USD100,000, and the project is USD8.5 million, so it needed to present a guarantee of USD11 million. A local operator is not able to provide such collateral.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your thoughts on expanding environmentally friendly initiatives across the country?</h4><p>We have to view nature as a global warehouse; every aspect of the modern world is, at some level, derived from the natural world. In the best-case scenario, the products we derive from nature end up in a legitimate landfill; however, in other cases these products and waste materials are dumped into the natural world. Thus, we have two problems: Mother Nature is slowly becoming emptier and the waste products from the global industrial economy are going straight back into the environment. The single-use bag ban is designed to create a balance between supply and demand while also protecting the natural world by requiring that these types of products are created using 70% recycled materials. These products are primarily ones not being used with foods and other consumables. However, we are developing the ability to utilize recycled materials in a host of products that have traditionally used totally fresh inputs. We seek to lower the total pressure being put on the natural world while supporting industrial and economic production. The bag ban is the first step in getting the city and the country to move in this direction—after Guayaquil, the country should follow. We want to be a sustainable model that the National Assembly can look to as they craft the national legislation. Within 36 months we can transform this area of the economy by phasing out plastic bags and utensils, straws, and styrofoam.</p><h4>How does SAMBITO serve as a facilitator to players in the public and private spheres?</h4><p>SAMBITO is a holding that is an ecosystem of interests dedicated to promoting ways of doing business that save the planet. In 20 years, we have completed 2,000 projects. We are strong in both the technical and commercial aspects of the industry, and our focus on the latter sets us apart from our competitors. Every year, we visit 2,000 companies, out of which 400 articulate an interest in our services and 100 sign contracts with us annually; thus, we sign a new contract around every three days. We operate across four business lines. The first line is our consultancy business. The Ecuadorian Constitution enumerates specific rights for the natural world, giving us a large umbrella of various businesses to consult on the regulatory requirements. Our second business line relates to everything that is voluntary; we have signed more than 50 contracts for carbon-neutral companies. We created the first and only platform that connects nature to lawyers, and we have supported the defense of numerous causes on a pro bono level. The third line of services relates to the support and development of the environmental industry. This is where our water company takes water from industrial waste, treats it, and returns it to the natural world. Fourth, we organize the Latin American Green Awards (LAGA), which provide an opportunity to spotlight the people taking action for the environment. The UN is the main strategic partner for this event, together with the municipality of Guayaquil. SAMBITO is the organizer of this event, and we exhibit, reward, and connect the best 500 projects from Latin America. In the latest edition, 2,733 projects were subscribed from 713 cities across 38 countries.</p><h4>What other notable environment initiatives have you launched?</h4><p>We are the executive director of the national recycling corporation of tires. For 2018, our target is to recycle 2.4 million tires. We can transform 60-70% of these materials into energy for the concrete and other industries. We also represent a US company called FMS, which creates products that allow industries using diesel fuel to reduce their CO2 emissions by 15%. We have another partnership with a German investment fund and are heavily involved in reforesting. This means we are in the business of producing oxygen. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[generating-true-value]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us a bit more about the UN Global Compact and its guiding principles?</h4><p>UNGC focuses on four key areas: human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. UNGC has become the most important global initiative focused on planetary sustainability, bringing together the UN, the private sector, and academia. This is a voluntary initiative; however, whose robust proposal has motivated over 10,000 business leaders around the world to include their companies in broader effort. In Ecuador, the network is growing with a strong show of commitment. It is clearly the fastest-growing network in our region. In 2016, when Ekos took over the network's presidency, we had only 41 affiliated organizations, and by the end of 2018, we expect that number to grow to almost 200. This is possible as a result of both broad awareness generated about our efforts and a value proposal that truly makes businesses stand out.</p><h4>Ecuador's economy has traditionally been based on low added-value products and been highly dependent on oil. How can it move up the value chain in a sustainable fashion? </h4><p>There is a major opportunity for us to really focus on sustainability, which means everyone working purposefully. What we need to do is generate stronger productive chains, apply new technologies, and migrate to using clean and renewable energy. Ecuador has enormous potential for these types of energies. To generate value, we need to promote technology transfer programs and boost heavy industry, eliminating our nation's dependency on imported supplies and creating efficient mechanisms to attract investment.</p><h4>How can the political and capital forces driving the country's industry commit to a future that includes sustainable energy?</h4><p>Progress has definitely been made in creating a regulatory framework that protects the environment. Despite the many issues called into question relating to the recently built hydroelectric plants, they give the country the possibility to generate clean, renewable energy; however, we need an actual change that will force industries to use renewable energy sources, since at this time, most of them run on fossil fuels—mostly diesel and natural gas. This is the area where authorities and business leaders are facing the greatest challenge. If we do not change our sources of energy, the earth's resources will be used up, and no businesses will be sustainable in the future. One important part of this change means that it is time to rethink Ecuador's fuel subsidy, since it constitutes the main obstacle to making the changes that are truly needed.</p><h4>In August, a new law was passed to promote production. What impact will this have at a nationwide level? </h4><p>The law does make some interesting contributions, though it is insufficient to achieve its stated goals. On the one hand, it creates tax incentives for companies and their investments; at the same time, however, it does not resolve the underlying problems that keep investors from seeing Ecuador as a country that is a safe and attractive destination for their investments. It resolves neither the problems related to our economy's competitiveness nor our strict labor and tax policies. It is expensive to produce in Ecuador, and we are isolated from international markets. To attract investment, potential investors need to have guaranteed tax breaks combined with the ability to do business in a safe, sustainable environment with clear rules that are maintained over time. Competitive production costs—wages, taxes, and services—are needed, as well as the ability to reach international markets through bilateral agreements. To do this, the country needs to redefine its objectives. This process should begin by changing an out-of-date labor system that protects the small minority of Ecuadorians who actually have a job. The fact that the majority of people in this country do not have a formal job is an abomination. It is also important that we work to create strong institutions and legal security, which are two key changes that will attract investment. We also need to put an end to the absurd capital outflow or remittance tax, which creates an extra cost that puts Ecuador at a disadvantage compared to more attractive markets. These changes can be made gradually, though the decision to do so needs to be made immediately to implement a serious plan that includes measures to stabilize the economy, especially in fiscal terms.</p><h4>To move the country up in the world business rankings, improved transparency is one of the key priorities. How can this issue best be addressed?</h4><p>The Odebrecht scandal and other political corruption situations throughout Latin America are a clear sign of how sensitive the issue of corruption is in our societies and how it permeates every level of our communities—businesses, households, and government. Corruption and the lack of transparency is the main problem that needs to be resolved in Ecuador and Latin America. There is no easy solution, since it is an epidemic that has expanded so rapidly and yet existed for so long, at all levels of society, that the only way to control it is by enforcing the law as strictly as possible, with no special treatment. Doing that means guaranteeing the independence of our various branches of government and eliminating political influence in the justice system, our prosecutors, and control agencies. This is not happening in Ecuador right now, though it would be the first step in beginning to work toward wiping out corruption at all levels. The issue here is not making stricter laws, but rather enforcing the existing ones, no matter who is affected.</p><h4>What is your outlook for next year?</h4><p>Ecuador's economy is going through a delicate period following fiscal, commercial, and price imbalances that we inherited from 10 years of policies focused on favoring public spending over private investment. As a result, our economy needs to make certain adjustments that have a direct impact on commercial activity. This means we are looking at 2019 with a low level of economic performance, with growth of somewhere between 0 and 1%; we continue to have latent needs to take on debt and at the same time are facing potential restrictions on lending due to the low level of liquidity in the economy. While it is true that adopting the US dollar as our national currency took away a certain level of competitiveness from Ecuador, the policy allows our economy to make it through these challenging times with monetary stability. This, added to the strength of our financial system and the recovery of oil prices, will help sustain the economy without continued deterioration. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your service portfolio expanded in Ecuador?</h4><p>We have been operating in Ecuador for the past 10 years. Currently, we offer two services: credit insurance and credit information services. We primarily tend to large manufacturing companies, both multinational and local. In Ecuador, our product is progressively gaining awareness, as the credit insurance policy is a relatively new product here. Big companies are more exposed to this type of product, and at the top of the market pyramid we are reaching a maturity level with industrial clients. Moving forward, we aim to target SMEs, which have to be linked with the right promotion campaign. In Ecuador, there are just three players, and we are the market leader with 52% market share. Regulations for insurance companies are strict and overseen by the Superintendencia de Companias Valores y Seguros.</p><h4>How well do people understand credit insurance?</h4><p>We are intensively working on raising the awareness of credit insurance and its benefits compared to other financial instruments. There are many opportunities there, and financial managers that have tried our product know about its credit insurance benefits. However, in some cases they work with other types of financial instruments, principally from the banking system. For example, letters of credit for exporters are a common instrument to guarantee against defaults on payments for export activity. However, a credit insurance policy is cheaper, and it covers all export transactions for a one-year period, as compared to letters of credit, which are issued on a case-by-case basis. Coface is present in 100 countries around the world, and if companies have a problem exporting with the risk of a default in payment, then Coface is the best market alternative, as it has a physical office there to support and recover the amount. </p><h4>What is your approach to digitalization for internal processes and client interactions?</h4><p>Technology is in every single aspect of our lives, not merely the financial industry. Coface has done a great job understanding this dynamic global opportunity, and one of our strengths is Cofanet. This is a cloud-based platform where we provide risk information, and companies can navigate through our big data with input from 30 million companies worldwide. This is one of our most important competitive advantages over other firms; we are the only credit insurance company offering this service in all of Ecuador. In 2018, we committed another USD10 million to develop and upgrade this platform, and the next step is to develop it for brokers.</p><h4>What is your growth strategy to target the SME segment?</h4><p>First, we strive to grow organically following the growth of exports. International investment is another important pillar, though it takes more time to develop and see results. Therefore, it is better to focus on exports. Historically, we have been an exporting country of agricultural goods and limited value-added products such as bananas, cocoa, petroleum, flowers, and shrimp. We thus need to develop that not just because it is a source of income but also because it is a way of guaranteeing a hard cash flow in the economy. The government is moving in the right direction and developing the export industry apparatus, and Coface has to be a key stakeholder there. We are currently discussing with the private sector and its chambers to propose the creation of an incentive tax structure for those companies that count on credit insurance, the idea of which is to encourage the private sector to boost exports while minimizing the risk of default. We are the best option for exporters. Second, we are targeting the SME segment. At the top of the pyramid, there are 113 companies with an annual turnover of USD18 billion. We have 62% penetration in the segment, well above our 52% general market share, but we still seek to grow here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us more about your service portfolio and client range in Ecuador?</h4><p>Kreston International is a global network of audit firms that targets a range of companies worldwide, primarily SMEs. As members of Kreston International, we have access to technology and a global knowledge of this network. Although our main target is SMEs, we also have large clients such as La Fabril, Cerveceria Nacional, Novacero, and Schlumberger, among others, so we have a quite varied client portfolio. We serve both the public and private sectors in Ecuador, although the public sector is slightly more complicated. Legal uncertainty remains a challenge; for example, a contract signed with a public entity was once terminated due to administrative changes. We have a team of 80 in Ecuador, and our main service is auditing private and public companies. </p><h4>What are some common challenges for international companies in Ecuador?</h4><p>Legal insecurity is the biggest challenge. Unfortunately, during the past decade, the philosophy of the overbearing state has only been exacerbated. As a result, the regulations to which we are exposed to in the private sector are excessive and costly. This scenario prevents private companies from developing. The public sector rarely produces wealth, but always leans on the private sector to do so. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the new legislation? </h4><p>The current government is trying to create an opportunity for the economy to change trends by opening the market up to the world, in contrast to the previous government. As such, the new legislation brings certain incentives through laws and regulations, but we might need more action to improve the general investment climate. For example, there are still high tariffs on imports, and a tax on transferring foreign currency abroad. The public-private partnerships have not yielded good results to date because there is no confidence in the country. Due to the series of obstacles that exist and the difficulties for investors to repatriate capital, the majority of foreign actors are unwilling and hesitant to invest here. Equally important, the percentage of taxes we pay is too high, which prevents us from being more attractive for this type of investment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where would you position Oriente Seguros in the insurance landscape of the country, and how have your operations advanced in recent years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JULIO MORENO ESPINOSA</strong> Oriente Seguros was the first company to actively have a corporate agenda, not just in individual insurance but also for packaging programs. The starting point was four years ago, and our portfolios have developed even more in the last few years.</p><p><span></span><strong>ESTEBAN CADENA NARANJO</strong> Our company has changed drastically since 2015, a year of consolidation in terms of reformulating the company's management. We sold an automotive portfolio and moved away from individual business lines to doing corporate business. To strengthen this change, we went through an overhaul of our image, offices, and even our staff and corporate governance. We wanted to present ourselves as a renewed company. 2015 was also a critical year for the economy in general, and 2016 was no different; however, we wanted to convey the message that the company was not retreating due to the crisis but reinventing itself to offer an interesting alternative in the insurance market. At that point, we started sales focused on SMEs, considering ourselves capable of satisfying an integral demand of customers under a corporate scheme. This change of direction meant a complete change of the model the company had been using for 15 years. The company was corporatized, as well as the way we make decisions. At first, we slowed down the business dynamics to strengthen ourselves internally and start growing again. Since then, the company has been growing and moved away from the public contracting business line to a private scheme with a more direct search of business and customers.</p><h4>What regulations would help the insurance industry to develop?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JME</strong> Insurance companies can be a central actor in the economy, which is has not been yet in terms of GDP. We were useful for public contractors because we were partners. Over the last few years, we have not had the best environment in which to grow. If we can manage our repositioning well to make some decisions together, the industry will be useful for the economy, and we take a more central role in the economy. We want to go to other markets, especially because the insurance business has a low penetration rate. We have a great opportunity in all types of business, from life insurance to accident insurance.</p><h4>Do you have a better understanding of how insurance should be useful for both countries and individuals?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ECN</strong> Ecuador and many of its industries lived in a bubble before 2015. The insurance market presented double-digit increases, which was unprecedented. There was no need to educate people or look for business. Companies cared little about innovating or serving segments that were not considered. This resulted in regulations being strengthened; however, that system became extremely demanding. The tax pressure on insurers was strong. There were taxes on premiums, remitting money, rent, and contributions to an insurance fund. However, as there were growth and business development without much effort, this pressure did not matter. In 2015, when the crisis hit, the impracticality of that regulation was not considered. Now, we have clients who are worried about the price because they are facing a crisis and have to reduce their budgets for insurance. At this point, insurance companies start thinking about educating and looking for new segments and business. The market grew, but it does not satisfy everyone, and we are unlikely to see the growth of yesteryear.</p><p><span></span><strong>JME</strong> We need to show people how we can be with them. We try to focus on basic products that in a short time can become commodities.</p><h4>How do you approach innovation, such as with your digital strategy?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ECN</strong> We want to be closer to our customers and facilitate interaction. We are developing some projects and tools to alleviate clients' relationship with the insurer, but at this time, the market does not respond well to innovations because clients still want to see the company directly, not merely through technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-little-disruption-never-hurt-anyone]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where do you position Banco Amazonas within the Ecuadorian financial landscape?</h4><p>We started as a niche bank focusing mainly on automotive loans and have now decentralized our portfolio by entering consumer and business banking. Due to our size, we can provide preferential attention to our clients.</p><h4>The Ecuadorian government is encouraging entrepreneurship. What is your vision as a bank on providing loans to encourage small- and medium-sized companies to grow? </h4><p>At present, the country is in a situation of economic reactivation. Our goal is to serve companies with annual sales of USD1-15 million, which means that most of our customers are SMEs. SMEs represent 30% of GDP and are a great productive force, which is why we are focused on serving them with a portfolio of services and simple financing and transactional products that can be adjusted to their needs. A great benefit is that an SME does not require seniority in the bank to acquire lines of credit for working capital or fixed assets.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the UN Global Compact affiliation, and how you plan on remaining sustainable in the future?</h4><p>Being a part of this affiliation is a guarantee for our employees, clients, and different interest groups. It is part of the policies and culture of the bank to ensure our employees have favorable conditions. We are also working on implementing a division of green credits in order to promote the conservation of natural resources and increase energy efficiency.</p><h4>Can you tell us more on about your digitalization agenda, both for internal processes and customer interaction?</h4><p>A bank's digitalization process has three steps. First, we have to make internal digital processes. In this regard, we are working on two important things: moving the central banking system from servers and computing centers to the cloud, and facilitating the processes that our customers require to acquire their products. Second, since last year we have renewed channels in both electronic and mobile banking to serve customers in real time, 24-7. We can finally accelerate the processes for opening up credit and accounts in an efficient and paperless manner. After the launch of the mobile application we have experienced a significant growth in the number of transactions and customers on the website. Our current goal is to complete this first step in 1Q2019.</p><h4>Does that mean growth will come more from your digital or phystical presence?</h4><p>The bank's growth will be focused on the optimization of digital processes and an efficient commercial team focused on customer service, advice, and the offer of benefits according to their financial needs. We have two offices, in Quito and Guayaquil, and already have a digital ADN, but we are complementing our transactional coverage at the national level with the Servipagos network with 69 total service points. While we are not focused on physical expansion, we are considering opening two or three more offices in high-value segments, such as investment clients and private banking.</p><h4>What is coming for Banco Amazonas in the next two years?</h4><p>We want to consolidate as a multipurpose bank and provide an excellent personalized service. Our objective is to make life easier for our clients with efficient processes oriented at their well-being and comfort. In the same way, we want to promote new products and services and disrupt the market through digital platforms.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you position Banco Pichincha within the country's financial landscape?</h4><p>Banco Pichincha is the largest bank in the country, and we work in every segment in Ecuador, from the largest corporations to micro-entrepreneurs in small communities. There are synergies between corporations and other suppliers, and we want to work with the entire supply chain, which helps us better serve our clients and assess credit risk. We have the largest network in the country and have a presence in every province.</p><h4>What are the main trends in the loan market?</h4><p>In the last year, we have seen more demand for financing capital investments. In previous years, they were demanding just working capital, now they are investing to increase productivity, automatize logistics, and improve and renew technology to reduce costs. We have seen investments in shrimp, cement, retail, and mining since the legal changes were put in place. In the mining sector, large companies are entering the country, which is something new because before we just had small-scale mining. For the bank, it is important to see our clients trying to grow and innovate, and given our solid deposit base, we can afford to lend for the long term.</p><h4>What trends have you noticed in terms of entrepreneurship?</h4><p>Entrepreneurship is something the country needs to support. There are limited funds to promote entrepreneurship, and in the case of the group, this kind of work is done through our NGO. </p><h4>What are your expectations for consolidating the banking sector?</h4><p>The banking law is not that friendly to investors; there are still too many restrictions. For example, in terms of ownership, a shareholder of a bank cannot have any other business. The capital outflow tax is in practice a restriction on foreign investors entering the country. We do not have international banks here, nor do we have much foreign investment. We need legal reforms to make the landscape friendlier for foreign investors.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the new regulations on the financial sector?</h4><p>Actually, there have been no changes in the regulation of the financial sector, though there are certain incentives for local and foreign investors that would help the overall situation of the country. Something that helps banks and local firms get additional financing is legislation that eliminates the capital outflow tax on external financing for tenures longer than one year, even if they come from what according to Ecuadorian law is a tax haven. In general, there is now a different environment for the private sector, which we expect to take the lead in terms of growing the economy, as opposed to the previous 10 years, when public expenditure created a lot of distortionary growth. </p><h4>How do you evaluate the dollarization of the country? </h4><p>This has been favorable to the country and given us greater stability. It helps the country focus on real sector productivity, not just financial variables. It helped the country stand despite a negative overall economic policy. The other important thing is having a longer-term vision; for example, people used to only be able to get a five-year mortgages, making it difficult to afford a house. Now, the tenure is 15-20 years.</p><h4>How do you approach digitalization? </h4><p>The great thing about the digital world is that it helps us be more customer-centric. In 2018, we launched an application for credit and opening accounts. However, a large number of our clients come to our branches, so the challenge is to use digitalization to reduce the time it takes to open an account. We even have a mobile app that works with facial recognition, among other projects. Analytics is another important area in which the use of artificial intelligence and all the information we have from our clients comes in handy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your main mandate as the national development bank, and how does that encourage economic growth in the country?</h4><p>CFN is a public bank that by nature has a structural difference from private institutions that take part in the local financial system. CFN does not depend on deposits in order to provide credits to the market, meaning it is a self-funded institution based on the paybacks of previous credit operations. Moreover, being a public financial institution, CFN has a mandate that is not focused on profit but on providing as much financial resources as possible to economic agents who are willing mainly to increase and renew their capital stock or diversify and explore in other economic activities. All this framework is what allows us to design products that, in addition to satisfying our potential demand, creates signaling in the whole market in order to promote better conditions for interest rates and credit terms; as well as mechanisms that are designed to decrease the barriers to financial access to SMEs, another of our major priorities.<br></p><h4>How do you advance SME growth in the country?</h4><p>We promote SMEs in the financial market in different ways. First, we offer low interest rates, long loan terms, and grace periods to this group of enterprises, compared to what they can get from other financial institutions. Thus, we try to reduce the financial weight over their flows in order to increase their likelihood of success. Second, SMEs are still on a growth trend, and therefore in a process of consolidating their business. Hence, SMEs in several cases do not have proper assets to secure financing and face a clear barrier in accessing financial markets. In this case, we offer SMEs the opportunity to access credit markets through a fund created by CFN, which assumes 80% of the guarantees required by other financial institutions who already decided to work with this fund. In particular, Banco del Pací­fico is a unique bank where SMEs could get a line of credit, after all the risk analysis process, without needing to present a guarantee. In summary, adequate conditions and increasing access to credit markets are the main tools for reinforcing SME growth in Ecuador. </p><h4>What were the main adjustments to make your funding more accessible to entrepreneurs?</h4><p>We have recently extended the terms for all credits. Before, it used to take 10 years for financing fixed assets, and now it is 15. Working capital used to be financed at most for three years, which we have now extended to five. In both cases, we also extended the grace period. We have also established a new procedure for credit applications, a very important advance for promoting more access. It used to be hard to get a credit from CFN, and took a long time. We shortened this period to an average 15 working days. Moreover, the process was previously not that transparent. We have now worked to clarify the process and have extended formal communications to potential customers. We want people to have a great experience from a customer service point of view, and try to reduce the possibility of moral hazard every part of the way. Finally, with the aim of amplifying Ecuador's export base and creating incentives for the agricultural industry, we designed a new financial product to provide a total grace period to non-traditional exportable agricultural production. We are creating solid incentives for different entrepreneurs to promote access to these areas so that Ecuador can increase its medium-term capital inflows from abroad and help stabilize its dollarized economy.</p><h4>How have you enlarged the scope of those eligible to your financing?</h4><p>We did not have the opportunity to finance service industry firms before, having focused on more “hard" industries. However, when you look at the big picture, services are related to 40% of GDP and 35% of the workforce, which is why we started financing them recently. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-rosier-picture-to-come]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you maintain a healthy and sustainable monetary policy?</h4><p>The dollarization of our economy certainly presents us with a different set of monetary policy tools. These are the interest rate, the liquidity minimum reserves index, and the domestic liquidity ratio. In Latin America, only Ecuador and Bolivia have a maximum interest rate policy, which means we can fix the limits for banks and financial institutions when charging interest. If they do not uphold this, it is considered a crime, and they will be disciplined by the superintendencies. For several years now, we have been working dutifully on interest rates and currently have 15 different kinds of interest rates to strengthen the economy. Second, banks and financial institutions must have liquidity minimum reserves in the Central Bank. We have had requests to change the minimum reserves; however, we need them, as the Central Bank cannot be the lender of last resort like many other banks in the world. The cash flow from minimum reserves would help us in difficult times. In terms of the domestic liquidity ratio, 60% of a bank's assets must be in Ecuador in order to remain prepared for any eventuality. These are the three main tools concerning monetary policies that we drive as a Central Bank. A fourth instrument is our liquidity fund, since we do not have a lender of last resort. Despite the fact that this is not a monetary tool, it is an instrument used by the bank. Currently, this fund is around USD2.5 billion and was contributed to by many different financial institutions. We consider these significant actions to strengthen the dollarization. Another role of the Central Bank is measuring liquidity in the economy and looking out for the present situation of the foreign exchange reserves, which is a concern of many investors. The work of the Central Bank is to restrict a part of the economy, because if it could move freely, money would leave the country on a large scale.</p><h4>What is your current vision for the interest rate to encourage structural investments in productivity?</h4><p>Currently, we are working on whether or not to reduce interest rates in the productive sector to encourage access to credit for the agricultural and livestock sectors through exclusive interest rates under the mechanisms of the Fomento Productivo law. In regard to capital investment and the productive sector, interest rates could still be lower. Currently, it stands at 8.5%, which is not that high in comparison to other countries in the region, though it could be lower. </p><h4>How will the new investment law impact the economy and your monetary policy?</h4><p>The Central Bank, prior to the monetary and financial code of 2014, had its own inner cabinet made up of independent people. We now have a regulation bureau made up of state ministers. With the new investment law, the Central Bank needs to enhance its international reserves and strengthen the economy, so that the market will have greater trust in us. Two main changes were implemented in order to build this trust. First, the Reactivación de la Economí­a law seeks to generate new economic incentives. Beforehand, loans given out by the Central Bank needed to be paid with cash. At a certain point, the bank was accepting public bank shares, and around USD2.2 billion were paid in shares. Second, under the Fomento Productivo law, the Central Bank can no longer invest in the Ministry of Finance and Economy, and the shares that were paid must be returned, with the Central Bank receiving cash or bonds, which would increase profitability. Both measures would strengthen our reserves, painting a more positive picture for the international market. </p><h4>How can the financial system be more transparent? </h4><p>Recently, we launched a web portal where one can access historical information not previously available. Now we have information from the 1940s and 1950s, which enables greater transparency. We are working in cooperation with the national government, which is also concerned with being more open. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main activities of British companies in Ecuador?</h4><p>The British Chamber in Guayaquil is linked to the British Chamber in Quito, although we work as two independent offices in order to best serve these two culturally different markets. What's more, we do not limit ourselves to working with British companies, as we are a bi-national chamber. The identities of our members sometimes evolve. For example, we work closely with Cervecéria Nacional, which is now a part of AB InBev. Other large companies include Unilever, Group G4S, Intertek, Eurofinsa, PWC, Deloitte, and Agripac.</p><h4>How does the chamber help its members in the business landscape?</h4><p>We fulfill multiple roles. We tend to be a point of reference for companies looking to break into the UK with new products. We strive to make it a two-way channel, so it is not just Ecuadorian companies targeting the UK but also an entry point for companies looking to enter Ecuador. This could be in many different fields, from language and higher education to insurance and financial services. We work as an initial point of reference: we guide people and are active in terms of communicating know-how to the business community. This could be in terms of new certification requirements for exporting to Europe and the UK. We also use our position and network of contacts with ministries, and when ministers want to communicate changes to tax and labor laws, they communicate via the chamber. We also have an excellent working relationship with the other bi-national chambers, which allows us to organize events on a larger scale. We strive to make our events relevant and practical rather than just theoretical and informative. </p><h4>What will be the main impact of the new investment law?</h4><p>It is not just about creating the right playing field, but also about guaranteeing certain rights and a certain amount of stability. Labor and tax laws are an issue here, as they seem to change constantly. With the previous government, for example, there were 14 different tax reforms in five years. These are the bigger concerns for an investor coming into a country like Ecuador. If companies know how to navigate these changes and read the market, Ecuador can be a very profitable market to operate in.</p><h4>How are you positioning the chamber for the coming year?</h4><p>As a chamber we are always looking for ways to add value for our members, not just through conferences, coaching, and networking, but also through sporting activities where we work to promote the practice of very “British“ sports such as golf or tennis. Currently, under the banner of “Sport is GREAT,“ we are organizing for Britain's ex No.1, Tim Henman, to play a tennis exhibition match against Ecuador's ex No.1, Nico Lapentti. Tennis is big here, so we can use this as a business and networking event as well. For 2019, we strive to gain greater relevance, build up more presence, and diversify our activities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the relationship between private parties and public interests in Ecuador and China over the past few years?</h4><p>The development of the relationship started in 2007 and continues to progress. Apart from this, the government has a new initiative to open up to partners across the world. For example, in the recent past, US-Ecuador relations have strengthened, and Ecuador has opened up its commercial relations with the EU. As a country, the more we open up, the more partners we seek out for investment or different loan options. One of the main reasons for developing these relationships is to establish a commercial agenda. Ecuador has developed an investment and project agenda, but over the last 10 years most of the relationship was on a public and political level, with less involvement of the private sector. We believe the relationship should take a step in this direction, attracting real Chinese investment. Ecuador has around USD3 billion in FDI from China, ranking eighth in the region for Chinese direct investment. However, those figures don't match other capital flows, which are worth around USD50.2 billion. In terms of the commercial agenda, we have limitations as a country in exporting to China. The basic limitations are the distance, 7,000km, and obvious cultural differences. As a country, Ecuador can only export two products to China: bananas and mangoes. We do not have a trade permit for other types of products because the country has not negotiated this over our 10-year relationship with China. This is a political rather than technical issue. If a commercial agenda is put forward on the state level, trade could be opened up within six months. For example, Mexico achieved this, and the commercial agenda is now an important part of the Mexico-China relationship.</p><h4>What might further ties between the two countries look like?</h4><p>The Minister of Foreign Trade is doing a good job by opening up new markets and being open to different proposals. The Minister of Finance is also doing an amazing job by opening up different options for financing. This is positive for us because at the chamber, we have around 300 members from various sectors, and the export companies are looking for opportunities within the Chinese market. While trade can be improved on many fronts, there have been significant improvements. Ecuador's sales of shrimp have grown a lot, and 50% of Ecuador's production goes to the Asian market, with the majority going to the Chinese market. Ecuadorian shrimp has grown in its reputation as a brand of excellence in the Chinese market. That is great, but these markets have to be grown through a strong, strategic platform that allows them to remain so. We also have to diversify into other products. In comparison, Chile holds 72% of China's fruit import market, and that market is set to grow over the next 20 years to around 60kg per capita per year. This is because Chinese consumers prefer imported fruits that come from Latin American countries, Africa, or Southeast Asia—regions that don't have high pollution levels. Ecuador should take note of this perception and look at how its neighbors are responding to this trend. Ecuador needs to capitalize on its export strengths and how it handles FDI. </p><h4>Other than food and fisheries products, what sectors are of interest for Ecuadorian-Chinese trade?</h4><p>We have to focus on tourism. Ecuador as a country has a lot to offer the Chinese market in terms of another type of experience. Other countries' agencies have worked together to create packages for Chinese consumers to attract the biggest influencers and bloggers within Chinese social networks to their country to experience it. Ecuador has to make use of the potential presented by the 100 million Chinese tourists that travel every year. It requires a strategy that works through Chinese social media, which means public and private sector involvement must be aligned. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us more about your commitment to invest USD750 million and create 6,000 jobs over the next five years? </h4><p>At the beginning of 2018, we committed ourselves to an investment of USD750 million over the next five years, with the goal of creating 6,000 new jobs. That means USD150 million per year to create around 1,200 new jobs annually. In 2018, we invested USD170 million, creating 1,200 direct jobs in the provinces of Carchi, Cotopaxi, Tungurahua, Azuay, Manabi, Los Rios, Guayas and Pichincha, not including the significant increase in temporary jobs each year in December. Among the 21 main projects that we implemented, there is the expansion of the distribution center in Amaguaña, the development and implementation of MAX software, the construction of multiplaza shopping centers in Tulcán, the first stage in Quevedo, and Plaza Batán in Samborondón. A series of projects of similar magnitude and investment amount is already under development by 2019. The commitment to invest USD750 million in our country is separate from our recent acquisition of a large shareholding in Grupo Rey.</p><h4>In November 2018, you reached an agreement to acquire control over Grupo Rey, a leading commercial chain in Panama. Could you tell us more about that acquisition? </h4><p>Foreign investments are not new to Corporación Favorita, and we already have a presence in Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, Chile, and Paraguay with different concepts. The purchase will open a range of opportunities to increase the local production and export of Ecuadorian products and services. This will mean a new source of income and allow Ecuadorian talent to transcend borders. This productive investment has international financing, which reflects the strength of the company and broader confidence in Ecuador. Corporación Favorita will acquire the majority of shares in Rey Holdings and its subsidiaries, including its shares on the Panamanian stock exchange and its Rey, Romero, and Mr. Precio supermarket brands and Farmacias Metro and Zaz chains. Grupo Rey has an annual turnover of around USD700 million, and its acquisition is one of the most important milestones in the history of Corporación Favorita. The transaction will open the doors of the region to the Ecuadorian company and its entire value chain, allowing Ecuadorian products from value-added industries that are competitive in this new market to have new opportunities. Grupo Rey is currently the most recognized commercial chain by Panamanians and has a portfolio of 51 supermarkets, 76 pharmacies, 17 convenience stores, and three large production and distribution centers in Panama.</p><h4>What values drive your company's growth? </h4><p>Human talent is a priority at Corporación Favorita. We encourage our employees to grow hand in hand with the company beyond the benefits and tangible values. For this reason, jobs at Corporación Favorita are in high demand, and we receive more than 13,000 monthly applications. We recently obtained the seals Hace Bien and Hace Mejor, certifications issued by the Ministry of Production, Foreign Trade, and Investment for our great corporate social responsibility practices.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the new investment legislation?</h4><p>It is important that the national government promote private investment, and many companies have pledged to support the new legislation because it will spur the economy. With more employment, a higher national income, and more purchasing power, our business activities will also grow. At Corporación Favorita, we are also analyzing how to create jobs through investments. The construction of new premises requires a large number of qualified labor. The new projects of our different branches inject capital into the national economy, generating a fair amount of indirect employment.</p><h4>What are the ambitions and plans of Corporación Favorita for 2019?</h4><p>We continuously monitor the behavior of the market and have recently seen renewed growth in the commercial sector and a recovery in sales. Inflation remains at low levels, which is positive, although fuel prices are rising. All these factors will help to maintain the economic stability of our planned investments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you manage your diversified portfolio, and what synergies do you strive for?</h4><p>Keeping a diverse portfolio competitive in today's environment has become an incremental challenge. At Consorcio Nobis, we believe in talent and the power within people to manage. I have the best leaders in negotiation, finance, human resources, legal, and technology, and together with this team and our international board, my children and I analyze the challenges we face and set objectives for the future. We have monthly board meetings with each business division to find synergies and analyze the individual challenges. These synergies include centralized purchasing, sales, and technology development. Above all, we align our values such as: faith in our country, an emphasis on entrepreneurship and innovation, professionalism, an international focus, and strong ethic principals. We focus on economic sectors of the country that have growth opportunities and where the government needs the trusts of the private sector to make things happen. We are committed to the development of our country.</p><h4>You have worked on many landscape-defining projects, including the development of Puerta Santa Ana and Mall del Sol. What is your vision for mixed-development projects? </h4><p>The new economy is organized around supercities. We believe in smart growth, improving the environment, and narrowing wealth disparities, which should be achieved through public-private collaboration. The new generations are looking for urban development projects where they can live, work, and readily access nearby leisure activities. We are going a step further and building walkable cities that not just have everything nearby, but also incorporate the environment and invite us to really take in the coexistence of a developed city at peace with its natural surroundings. </p><h4>Ecuador is traditionally a primary-materials economy. How can it move up in the value chain in these industries?</h4><p>The potential of the country in the agro-industrial business is enormous. It is our vision to find the best way to make extra gains by adding value and sustainability. In this sense, we are making multiple bets on the future. First, we are continuously participating in international fairs and events to be connected with the latest trends in global demand of our products. Second, we are building long-term relationships with universities around the country to develop research programs that can be applied for our production. Finally, we are actively investing in our team and building a culture that is conducive to sustainability and creating added value. As our lands are so rich in quality, our agricultural products sustain the best nutritional values in the world. </p><h4>What will be the impact of the new legislation on industries you are active in?</h4><p>The new legislation generates positive adjustments for investors, who first and foremost seek legal security. As an example, the law is positive for the mining industry, as it abolishes an extraordinary tax for them and reduces the tax on mining royalties. These, and other changes, incentivize an increase in mining production, and, therefore, more investment in the industry. Ecuador offers a new mining frontier investment, and in 2017 alone, we had around USD1.6 billion of investment from the world's largest miners. We are also involved in the ongoing exploration programs for gold, silver, and copper, whose geological surveys should be completed by the end of 2018. Similarly, the law seeks to prioritize investments in tourism. There are considerable benefits for companies that invest in new projects, including a 12-year income tax exemption. </p><h4>What are your ambitions for the years ahead? </h4><p>Our ambition is to see our country grow, a growth that must come through private investment. Committed to Ecuador's long-term growth, we are continuing our investment in logistics, where we are working with our strategic partner DP World on opening the first phase of the deep-water port in Posorja by July 2019. The project consists of four phases with a total investment of USD1.5 billion, which will also include a technical park and a free logistics zone. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[la-bonne-nouvelle]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What primary sectors are you targeting to attract more foreign investment, and how do you envision the new law boosting investments?</h4><p>The Ecuadorian government has by legal mandate divided the economy into priority and strategic sectors, and this new regulation is designed to enhance investments in both. For example, in strategic areas related to mining, refining, copper, aluminum, and oil, the government is looking to attract more foreign investors because local supply is insufficient. The Foreign Trade Ministry has worked hard to promote large investment projects in those areas, which have an estimated USD25 billion in projects needed. On the other hand, the government aims to provide strong incentives, with exemptions from income taxes ranging from eight to 20 years, depending on the sector or province, in agro-industry, technology, renewable energy, road services, and logistics, among others. These new legal rules, plus the extensive promotional activities being done with the Ecuadorian commercial offices around the world, are generating a great deal of international attention.</p><h4>Addressing unemployment, currently at 5%, is another objective of the new law. What are your expectations with this policy change?</h4><p>By the middle of 2019, we should have an adequate accounting of how these policies have helped us reduce unemployment. We have estimates of investment and employment growth, though exact unemployment reduction figures have not yet been made clear. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the tourism sector with the new legislation?</h4><p>Tourism in Ecuador has grown considerably in recent years; in fact, it became the third-most important source of income for the country. We have a growing tourism sector, especially from overseas. For example, Quito is now one of the most visited capitals in Latin America. Investments in hotels have also been considerable. In 2018, we approved three new important hotels in investment contracts, and we know of a request for a new chain being installed on the outskirts of Quito. Investments and incentives are strong in this sector, and tourism is exempt from income tax for up to 20 years if the investment is made in the provinces of Manabí­ or Esmeraldas. This will have an interesting impact on the results.</p><h4>What is the most important aspect of these new tax incentives and fiscal policies?</h4><p>For starters, Ecuador used to have a regulation prohibiting investment from companies based in tax havens, which is no longer the case. Ecuador can now receive capital from everywhere, on the condition that companies remain transparent about their corporate information. On the other hand, the policy of tax incentives encourages companies making foreign currency to enter the country, thus generating new sources of employment. In this way, we promote productive development, take care of dollarization, and boost employment.</p><h4>What are the main challenges to implementing the new legislation and how will you overcome them?</h4><p>We have identified two main challenges: the materialization and diffusion of the new legislation. To overcome the former, we are working on a regulation that will allow investors to easily apply for benefits. On the other hand, we are working with institutions directly related to the places we are visiting to promote the benefits of the new regulation. We want to communicate the importance of this new legislation locally and internationally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>A new law to improve productivity, attract investment, boost employment, and bring fiscal stability was approved by the assembly in August. What are your expectations for it?</h4><p>The main objective of our administration and this new legislation is to enhance the dialog between the public and private sectors. In the previous administration, there was a big distance between the public and private sectors, as well as between the Ecuadorian government and our strategic partners such as the Pacific Alliance, the US, South Korea, and Japan. We are refreshing the image of Ecuador and strengthening Ecuador's relationship with other countries, while at the same time strengthening relations between the public and private sectors at home. The new law provides a solid legal framework with international arbitration, in addition to tax incentives, ranging from eight up to 20 years of zero income tax in certain sectors and provinces. This has eliminated earlier obstacles for investment while opening new doors. For example, we eliminated the outflow tax for new investments and the windfall tax for the mining sector, and are offering participation contracts for hydrocarbons instead of service contracts, which will open our economy and entice large oil companies around the world to invest here. Furthermore, we reduced the tax for the transfer of shares from 25 or 35% to a maximum of 10%, which has made us extremely competitive in the region. We also changed the regulations with regard to countries considered tax havens, which are also now welcome to invest here. We eliminated the legal responsibility that used to fall on the shareholder or management of a company, measures that led to more transparency, and if there is a problem with the administration of a company, the responsibility falls on the company and not on the last beneficiary of that company. This transparency, in combination with adequate international arbitration, is the new foundation of our investment climate. </p><h4>In 2018, you assumed responsibility for the ministries of Industry and Aquaculture and Fisheries. How do you envision integrating these entities with your own?</h4><p>The president decided to review the size of the public sector in a bid to better align responsibilities. From 40 ministers, we are now down to 20, significantly reducing the size of the government, which encourages us to become more efficient and lean. That includes transferring tasks to the private sector and encouraging more private investment in general. Still, the success of every executive, minister, or CEO depends on the team, which is our main focus right now. Bringing together the ministries of industry and foreign trade presents us with a unique opportunity to better align our public policies. Merging the two entities will better support our local industries to start exporting and build a broader export portfolio, which in turn should bring a more favorable trade balance. For the productive sector, we need to improve competitiveness, which means we will better assess the strength of our provinces and establish PPP models to encourage investment, rather than developing with public funds. Our mission is to create a state policy for production. Our neighboring countries Chile and Peru have managed to do so and increase their GDP growth as a result. </p><h4>You have deepened bilateral relations with the UAE, and Dubai-based DP World has invested in a multipurpose deepwater port in Posorja. Could you elaborate on this?</h4><p>One of our objectives when we started the new administration was to visit 20 countries in the first year. Thus far, we have visited 29 cities, including two trips to the UAE. We have excellent bilateral relations, which are resulting in large-scale investment projects. For the Posorja project, USD1.2 billion has been committed, and construction is on track. The ministry is a firm believer that infrastructure, ports, airports, railways, and roads are one of the key enablers of economic growth, and we invite international investors to participate in these projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are currently overseeing a large project to redesign the organizational structure of the central government. Could you tell us more about this? </h4><p>The new national administration began implementing the optimization plan at the state level because Ecuador had a sick economy, and it was necessary to take measures to fix it. One of the first projects was to optimize the size of the government to better allocate the country's resources toward the most important priorities. That included, for example, focusing on the poorest sectors to guarantee their access to services. It was not possible to maintain an administration with 40 ministries, and at the same time, invest resources in the necessary social programs. This social agenda was the basis of President Lenin Moreno's initiative to restructure the government. From 40 ministries, we went to 27, and the plan is to reduce the number to 20. In parallel, the Law of Productive Development was implemented to create better conditions for the private sector. In Ecuador, nine out of 10 jobs are generated by the productive sector, so it is the government's responsibility to create better conditions for this sector and train people to move into the most productive industries.</p><h4>How is the integration process of the ministries proceeding?</h4><p>Our objective is to consolidate the institutional design and monitor the new institutional arrangement within 90 days of launching it. The process is aligned with some key principles: first, no service of the ministries that we are merging will be suspended; second, interaction with citizens must be improved; third, public officials who are attached to employer changes will maintain their seniority and employment package, depending on their contracts. After the institutional design phase, each ministry will adapt to the new structure.</p><h4>How will you improve interactions between the public and private sectors?</h4><p>It is necessary to have clear rules to create a better business environment. As a national government, we focus on fighting corruption and building a transparent institutional administration. It is impossible to have a healthy and growing business environment when public policy is not done well. Thus, the biggest challenge of our administration is the fight against corruption. </p><h4>How do you plan to address education and better prepare the leaders of tomorrow?</h4><p>The problem of the traditional educational system is that it privileges rote memorization, whereas we must move on to a system that privileges knowledge and technology. By having an educational system connected with real needs, we will be able to transform the current economy, based on raw materials, toward one generated by services and knowledge.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the Ecuador 2030 project?</h4><p>The project focuses on 2050, but 2030 is a special year since it marks the 200th anniversary of the creation of the Republic of Ecuador. Currently, the Ecuadorian economy is comprised of 55% services, 30% manufacturing, and 15% primary agricultural production. We want to move to a bigger economy, with more services and manufacturing and less primary agriculture. A service economy requires more skilled people and a value-added industry. Therefore, our National Development Plan has three axes: rights for everyone, an economy at the service of society, and a wider space for the generation of public-private partnerships. One of our current priorities is to study how we can involve all stakeholders in this project. The transformation implies changes in the sectors of education and production, as well as in the mentality of Ecuadorians. We are a country rich in natural resources, but we should go beyond to become one that is rich in knowledge. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you consider to be your main legacy in Guayaquil as you prepare to leave office?</h4><p>In the 19 years of my administration, Guayaquil has made great progress in improving the quality of life of its inhabitants. The city has become an international benchmark because of its strict regulations for public administration. Amongst these rules, we have committed to investing USD85 of every USD100 that we receive in public works services and only 15% in our own labor and administrative expenses. Secondly, we borrow conservatively, long term, with convenient grace periods and at very low interest rates to invest solely in public works and services, and never to finance or refinance unproductive spending. The best partners of a public administration are local and international private companies that receive legal security and incentives and can work through PPPs to expand the investment radius and service level. This allows us to have a prudent and effective administration and enough funds to invest in improving the quality of life of our citizens. If it can solve an economic problem, it will solve social and political problems, as well. Lastly, we always aim for innovation and creativity in education and business.</p><h4>How do you plan to attract more tourists and business travelers to Guayaquil?</h4><p>The two main engines of economic growth and employment generation are construction and tourism. Around 20 years ago, Guayaquil had no domestic or international tourism, while today it is the most visited city in Ecuador, both for domestic and foreign tourists. We have made a strong commitment to tourism, in combination with the private sector, through urban development projects and building attractive city elements like boardwalks and a commitment to gastronomy, music, theater, and urban art. The city has a new airport operating 365 days a year that was recognized as the best in the world in its category, while we offer free wireless internet access at 6,000 connection points around the city. While attracting investors and business visitors is key, everyone enjoys coming to a location where they can relax. The city has well-equipped convention centers that have attracted international exhibitions and fairs. Business and leisure tourism are very important for the urban development of Guayaquil.</p><h4>In August, a new investment law aimed at improving productivity, attracting investment, creating jobs, and achieving fiscal stability was approved. What are your expectations?</h4><p>The new investment law includes a provision on international arbitration, which is important as an investor needs to know that any legal issues can be resolved by international, trained, and impartial third parties. Meanwhile, both investment contracts and PPPs are exempted from income tax, tax on capital outflows, and other interesting incentives, which makes it a law that provides investment guarantees.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the project to connect Durán with Guayaquil with Aeroví­a, and your vision on further infrastructure development in the city?</h4><p>During my tenure, the new airport, convention center, several tunnels and overpasses, motorways and highways, bridges, and traffic control were developed. We are currently developing the Aeroví­a project, which will transport 40,000 people daily between Durán and Guayaquil. The project is developed with the environment in mind, as well as with the hopes that it will raise people's quality of lives by saving them time—a journey that takes an hour can be reduced to just 15 minutes. The project will be connected to the Metroví­a, the city's rapid bus transit system. We work with companies with great expertise, like the French Poma, which is highly regarded in suspended air transport. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your operations advanced throughout the years?</h4><p>Luberef is a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Jadwa Industrial Investment and started producing and supplying base oil in 1978, celebrating its 40th year in operations in 2018. Since its inception, Luberef has sought to be a company that seeks innovation and growth, produce high-quality products, and be a leader in the market. Thus far, we have grown from one to two refineries—in Jeddah and Yanbu—with a major expansion at the Yanbu refinery in 2018 that doubled the size of the total production of base oil to around 8 million barrels per year. Following the Yanbu expansion, Luberef has become a substantial market player in the industry and supply side influencer, with a production volume that represents about 40% of Middle East production capacity.</p><h4>How do you approach diversification and innovation?</h4><p>The recent Yanbu expansion was not just about volume; it introduced a modern production technology that makes new types of higher performance base oil products—Group II base oils. With the expansion, Luberef is the first producer to offer a full range of Group II base oils within the Middle East region, and as such is taking a leading role in facilitating a change in the market that enables and supports the market drive to provide higher quality lubricants. Luberef has developed into a global company, moving from supplying the GCC to markets in Africa and Asia. This encouraged a new marketing approach with the introduction of branded products. These brands are developed in conjunction with Aramco, aligning the portfolio of the three base oils: Luberef, S-Oil, and Motiva. For the new series of Group II base oils, the aramcoPRIMA brand was launched, in addition to aramcoDURA for the Group I base oils.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Leading the Digital Transformation]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jose-goncalves-country-managing-director-accenture-portugal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief synopsis of Accenture's operations in Portugal? </h4><p>At Accenture Portugal, we provide professional services from strategy and consulting to technology and intelligent operations, leveraging digital in all these areas. We work in the vast majority of the biggest national layers across all the industries. We are 3,000 people, with a strong focus in the local market while leveraging the export opportunity of services to our international clients. In fact, Portugal has a unique position in terms of talent and competitiveness to explore global markets.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Portuguese market for Accenture? </h4><p>We are a mature but small market in terms of business size for Accenture globally, but strategically we are very important mainly due to the increase of our international relevance, namely by exporting digital and technology services to our biggest clients worldwide. We also have a significant presence and penetration in the local market. Portuguese economy is improving, positive signs that are helping our business to growth. And therefore, Accenture has a unique opportunity to help organizations to be more efficient and effective by addressing the digital paradigm. It is clear now that Digital is a reality. Today, it's not possible to transform or create businesses without thinking in digital and technology since the very beginning.</p><h4>The company continues to lead to the strategy, consulting, digital, technology, and operations services market. How have you done this? </h4><p>Our DNA is based on innovation and value creation. We incorporate digital into everything we do across the value chain improving organizations performance. Transforming companies into digital and intelligent organizations is our focus. Accenture is a case study in its own digital transformation, having created create new offerings, solutions and services that became 60% of our global company's business. During this process our market cap multiplied by more than 10.</p><h4>Aside from providing analytical software and consulting services, what other industries are you planning to target in the near future?</h4><p>Our strategy in this market is to work within the biggest organizations in Portugal providing an end-to-end service, from strategy &amp; consulting, technology and operations, always leveraging digital. We are working today with 70% of PSI20 companies. There are some industries where we have good opportunities to continue grow, such as banking, retail and transportation. But we have also a strong competitive position in the communications and energy industries.</p><h4>With the implementation of machine learning via AI, how will cloud computing change the nature of business?</h4><p>Accenture is the leader in digital transformation space. The challenge is to accelerate the digital transformation in Portugal, overcome the traditional digital strategies based exclusively in the customer experience. Now, we changed the focus and make organizations understand that the value is inside the enterprise and help them deliver the most competitive and relevant solutions.</p><h4>You are partnering with Microsoft for the 'Building the Future' summit in Lisbon. How important is this?</h4><p>Today Portugal is at the forefront of innovation and start-ups ecosystem. Web Summit will be in Lisbon for the next 10 years and that's a very good example of how innovation is increasing across Portuguese organizations. Thus, having a good ecosystem of start-ups and digital native enterprises in Portugal with a good entrepreneurial skill set, can make an important difference to start incubating businesses from Portugal. Intelligent organizations that think globally for international markets but based on Portugal and powered by Portuguese talent.</p><h4>You were chosen as the top employer in Portugal for a third year in a row. How did you do this? </h4><p>It's a strategic priority to be a company of the best talent. The culture of meritocracy we have attracts many talented people to work here. Additionally, an increasing amount of people want to be part of something with a sense of purpose to society. Working at Accenture means you want to make the change happen and actively contribute to improve the way the world works and lives. We also have been named the top company on the Thomson Reuters Diversity &amp; Inclusion Index which recognizes the 100 most diverse and inclusive companies in the world. We believe that diversity is a source of innovation, creativity and competitive advantage and creates a workplace where everyone feels equally accepted with a real sense of belonging.</p><h4>What are your priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have three. The first is to continue growing at double digits and faster than the market. It is a challenging ambition because the economy is growing at 3%. Second, we want to remain leaders in the digital innovation space; every time a client thinks about digital transformation, they think of Accenture and our global expertise and knowledge. The third is ensuring that high value nearshore continues to grow significantly, creating qualified jobs and “exporting" unique talent from Portugal.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Well-thought-out  Expansion]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[well-thought-out-expansion]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us more about CEPSA´s developments in the past four years, and how has your business portfolio expanded?</h4><p>We have maintained our three divisions: lubricants, tires, and vehicles. Our strategy is to diversify our suppliers in each of the three areas. For lubricants, our main partner, BP, supplies us with Castrol. At the same time, we keep our own brand, CEPSA, for low-end products. As part of our diversification plan, we signed a contract with a US-based company to import lubricants. In relation to the tire division, we are also diversifying by partnering with Yokohama (Japan), Roadstone (Korea), OTR (India), and four Chinese brands. Moreover, we recently signed a contract with Apollo Industries, a large tire manufacturer for which we will have the distribution in Colombia, Panama, Peru, and Ecuador. In March 2018, we started operations in Colombia with a Colombian company, selling tires and lubricants. We also plan to start operations in Peru, and we are carrying on negotiations to expand into Panama as well. These companies will operate independently, with CEPSA as the main shareholder. As for vehicles, we are Volkswagen distributors since 2010 and have three Volkswagen stores in Quito. In 2019, we want to grow internationally and start distributing Hyundai and open related facilities in Guayaquil.</p><h4>How have CEPSA's plans for wider distribution and warehousing developed?<br></h4><p>We have a great warehouse system in the large Ecuadorian cities. This system is considered Castrol's best-operating one, from Mexico to Argentina, passing through Brazil. The Quito warehouse has set a high standard for other Castrol distributors in the region. </p><h4>To what extent is CEPSA localized in Ecuador?</h4><p>We blend lubricants in our country. We import the base oils and the additives, though we have a bottle supplier to produce our own packaging. We consider ourselves to have a good vertical integration of lubricants. In terms of future plans, we have not written off the possibility of supplying lubricants to the countries in which we will operate. Ecuador has an excellent geographical position and port capabilities for this to materialize. </p><h4>What is your vision for recycling in the automotive sectors you operate in?</h4><p>At present, the Ecuadorian law requires us to recycle a percentage of our tire imports—we must also comply with such percentage. We signed an agreement with a company called Green that owns a recycling facility in the northern area of Quito where we recycle tires received in our tire shops. Additionally, we have agreements with two other retreading companies from which we collect recyclable truck and bus tires. In total, we retread about 1,000 tires per month. During 1Q2018, we sent 26,000 tries for recycling. We own seven tire shops, including the one we opened in Guayaquil in 2017. This one is a great project because our shops are extremely different from those existing in Ecuador. </p><h4>What impact will the new law on improving productivity have on the automotive industry?</h4><p>In terms of the local industry, I do not have high expectations. In fact, taxes will decrease for imports and the competitiveness of the local industry is not as strong as global players such as Volkswagen, which can provide significantly cheaper products. The local manufacturing industry will not necessarily have a better future with a more open economy; they will have to work hard to produce vehicles at the same price as the imported ones. Nonetheless, the new legislations are great for the country because we can take advantage of the competitiveness of agribusiness and tourism.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the coming years?</h4><p>We want to install the same business model we have in Ecuador in other countries. Starting with lubricants and tires, we are also considering distributing vehicles in those countries. We have identified the countries and cities where we would like to start with our expansion plans. These are Lima in Peru and Bogotá, Cali, Medellí­n, and Barranquilla in Colombia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ecuador is traditionally a primary economy, with great strengths in agriculture and aquaculture, and rich in resources. How do you plan to give more emphasis to these industries in the value chain?</h4><p>With the policy of the energy and mining sector, we seek to attract and promote new investments, taking advantage of synergies with the private sector and applying new contractual models, such as production-sharing contracts and concessions, in the framework of transparent negotiations where national interests will prevail. In the oil sector, we are strengthening the four smaller fields of oil and gas, Ronda Intracampos and Ronda Suroriente, through private investment. In addition, we are working on proposals to diversify our energy matrix by introducing natural gas, improving the quality of fuels, and reducing the import of derivatives. In this framework, energy-efficiency measures have also been adopted throughout the entire hydrocarbon chain. In the mining sector, we aim to create a national mining cluster to strengthen small-scale mining and artisanal mining while developing strategies for articulation and productive linkages. Ecuador has a high-potential portfolio for investment; with our six second-generation projects, investments of over USD10 billion could be obtained. Ecuador has high agricultural and livestock potential and it is focusing on the industrialization of agricultural products. International demand forces innovation and technology, though there is also significant local demand. We will generate an organized agricultural sector that is valued locally and internationally.</p><h4>Ecuador has strong environmental preservation policies. What is your strategy to implement such an environmental policy across all sectors of the economy?</h4><p>We will continue to bet on clean and renewable energies. Currently, 71% of the energy consumed in the country comes from water and wind sources. Additionally, other projects that will contribute to the energy matrix are already being studied and built. The environmental policy is applied in all economic sectors, especially those engaged in extraction. The government has reversed 2,000 mining concessions and, through dialog with environmental sectors, promoted a popular consultation to limit the exploitation of crude in Yasuní­ National Park, which was approved. In addition, the state has signed new oil contracts with the highest environmental standards. Environmental conservation is a joint effort; every country must move toward development with its natural environment in mind. That is why we have also signed cooperation agreements with countries like Qatar to promote environmental care. Ecuador seeks to improve its economy sustainably.</p><h4>How do you plan to open the economy through the country's numerous FTAs?</h4><p>We seek to consolidate Ecuador's participation in the global economy via commercial groups and thus strategically expand its presence in the international context. The signing of FTAs with some of our main partners is viewed as a fundamental tool to not only achieve a substantive reduction of tariff and other barriers for our products, but also to seek to match the competitive conditions of our exportable basket. With our agreement with the EU, in the first instance, we aimed to consolidate Ecuadorian exports that benefited from the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which expired in 2016. Having such commercial instruments allows us to generate a space for dialog between countries, conducive to monitoring bilateral trade through the review of difficulties generated by the commercial dynamics. As a government, we responsibly think about the future of new generations.</p><h4>What are your main ambitions for the coming years?</h4><p>The country is in the process of democratic, economic, and productive consolidation. The new policy aims for the private sector to be the engine of development. We aspire to have sustainable economic growth based on production and foreign investment. Ecuador offers legal security, strong and secure dollarization, political stability, and, above all, transparency in its administration. The Law of Productive Development, which generates stimuli for investment and entrepreneurship, is already in force; our efforts are focused on increasing production, exports, and new sources of employment. We will continue to make decisions to consolidate ourselves as an investment destination. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you consider to be your main legacy in Guayaquil as you prepare to leave office?</h4><p>In the 19 years of my administration, Guayaquil has made great progress in improving the quality of life of its inhabitants. The city has become an international benchmark because of its strict regulations for public administration. Amongst these rules, we have committed to investing USD85 of every USD100 that we receive in public works services and only 15% in our own labor and administrative expenses. Secondly, we borrow conservatively, long term, with convenient grace periods and at very low interest rates to invest solely in public works and services, and never to finance or refinance unproductive spending. The best partners of a public administration are local and international private companies that receive legal security and incentives and can work through PPPs to expand the investment radius and service level. This allows us to have a prudent and effective administration and enough funds to invest in improving the quality of life of our citizens. If it can solve an economic problem, it will solve social and political problems, as well. Lastly, we always aim for innovation and creativity in education and business.</p><h4>How do you plan to attract more tourists and business travelers to Guayaquil?</h4><p>The two main engines of economic growth and employment generation are construction and tourism. Around 20 years ago, Guayaquil had no domestic or international tourism, while today it is the most visited city in Ecuador, both for domestic and foreign tourists. We have made a strong commitment to tourism, in combination with the private sector, through urban development projects and building attractive city elements like boardwalks and a commitment to gastronomy, music, theater, and urban art. The city has a new airport operating 365 days a year that was recognized as the best in the world in its category, while we offer free wireless internet access at 6,000 connection points around the city. While attracting investors and business visitors is key, everyone enjoys coming to a location where they can relax. The city has well-equipped convention centers that have attracted international exhibitions and fairs. Business and leisure tourism are very important for the urban development of Guayaquil.</p><h4>In August, a new investment law aimed at improving productivity, attracting investment, creating jobs, and achieving fiscal stability was approved. What are your expectations?</h4><p>The new investment law includes a provision on international arbitration, which is important as an investor needs to know that any legal issues can be resolved by international, trained, and impartial third parties. Meanwhile, both investment contracts and PPPs are exempted from income tax, tax on capital outflows, and other interesting incentives, which makes it a law that provides investment guarantees.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the project to connect Durán with Guayaquil with Aeroví­a, and your vision on further infrastructure development in the city?</h4><p>During my tenure, the new airport, convention center, several tunnels and overpasses, motorways and highways, bridges, and traffic control were developed. We are currently developing the Aeroví­a project, which will transport 40,000 people daily between Durán and Guayaquil. The project is developed with the environment in mind, as well as with the hopes that it will raise people's quality of lives by saving them time—a journey that takes an hour can be reduced to just 15 minutes. The project will be connected to the Metroví­a, the city's rapid bus transit system. We work with companies with great expertise, like the French Poma, which is highly regarded in suspended air transport.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Three Ps]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[leste-aihevba-mdceo-energia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you bring to the company, and what will be your main focus?</h4><p>I am focusing on three things, my three Ps: People, Production, and Probity. People take priority because coming out of the recent price dip in the oil industry, there was low staff morale for many reasons. Getting staff back to a level of engagement where they are happy to work for Energia and the oil industry has been a key priority and based on the feedback from staff on a number of the initiatives taken so far, we are on track. Secondly, the company's main objective is to produce oil safely, efficiently and cost effectively.  With the focus on production, many of the systemic inefficiencies have been addressed and production has almost doubled with minimal infusion of capital. The third focus area is probity and integrity for our corporate image and accountability. We must be able to approach the regulators and communities in which we do business for license to operate and the contractors to bring quality services in for us to get products out must trust us. If we do not have these three priorities (3Ps), properly lined up, staff will not be engaged and be less productive, the company will have problems with its corporate image, there will be no accountability in the system and everything we do will be disrupted by misrepresentation in the press.</p><h4>How do you plan to work on improving the corporate image and accountability?</h4><p>To address the multiplicity of governance failures that people have not been able to talk about openly for fear of reprisals, we launched a whistleblowing policy in April. This process is managed by an external company, namely PwC. If anyone has suspicion of unethical practices in relation to any of the company's dealing with the contractors, regulators, local community, government, or staff, they are now encouraged to report, (anonymously, if they so desire). The managers of the transparency platform will initiate investigations and take corrective measures where necessary. This process ensures that everyone is now conscious of their actions, and makes people understand they can actually do business in a clean and transparent environment where everyone plays on the same level.</p><h4>What is your current production and what are your targets?</h4><p>Though our plant capacity is 10,000 bpd, we were producing less than 3,500 bopd in March 2018. We have since increased that by 80% to over 6,000 bopd by October 2018 and we are looking at further increases in 2019, (possibly 150% of the March 2018 level), with a target of 15,000 bpd in 2021 and possibly 20,000 bpd by 2022. To achieve this ambitious goal, we need to increase the flow station capacity and inject some capital. Over that same period, by managing contractors more effectively and focus on more ethical practices, we plan to reduce our cost of activity by over 30%.</p><h4>How are you finding such investment?</h4><p>The cost of capital at Energia is relatively high because we are currently relatively high on gearing and that affects the market view of our corporate image and financial prudence. Based on which investor you talk to, offered cost of capital can be anything between 12% and 23%. We have been able to reduce our interest rate on existing loans from 14% to 11% and we do not want this to increase. Because the cost of external funding is so high, the banks get much more than the shareholders as returns. Our near-term strategy is to reverse this by taking advantage of the increased revenue from our increased production, the strategically reduced cost structure, and a more ethical contracting strategy to put more of our own money into our projects, reduce gearing, and thereby become more competitive in the capital market.</p><h4>Why are banks still apprehensive about lending to oil and gas companies?</h4><p>There has been a significant amount of money invested in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria that did not yield the desired returns, so some of these loans were either not repaid as planned, or not repaid at all and several companies have since gone bankrupt. When a company demonstrates that it can repay as planned, it generally gets better considerations, and its subsequent request for loans are more favorably received by the market; sad to say, however, many companies have not been able to do this. At least 50% of the oil companies in Nigeria have restructured their loan conditions and extended the terms of payment. This does not encourage lenders to advance funds or create an attractive environment for investors who want to inject funds to do business.</p><h4>How are the plans for a new refinery progressing?</h4><p>There was a delay, and this necessitated a change in the plans. The initial 10,000 bpsd refinery was estimated to cost some USD100 million, and Energia was not ready to invest that amount money and would have needed to seek third-party funding, which we were not that excited about. We have had to reformulate the idea and redesign the plant for a smaller capacity of 5,000 bpsd topping plant with a slightly different product mix. In addition to the cost requirement, the decision to go into a refinery would also involve restructuring the company or creating a new subsidiary company, hence a more detailed look at the entire scheme, including tankers and transport, the markets for all the product streams, and a proper business case for the venture was necessary. The whole scheme is being reviewed now, and hopefully we will have an improved proposal with better financial metrics for all stakeholders out to the market in the near future.</p><h4>What are your prospects in terms of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) and how will it enhance the industry and investment climate?</h4><p>In theory, the PIB addresses many issues. It brings transparency into the tax regimes. Whether a company is in exploration phase or gets into production, the PIB provides incentives. It also seeks to look into gas utilization, (of which still more than 50% flared in Nigeria), and make a sustainable business sense of it. The petroleum profit tax, which is currently at 67% is also proposed to be reviewed. If the PIB gets passed, it will make the oil and gas business more interesting for private investors to enter the oil and gas industry. The difficult side is that the country's budget and foreign exchange earnings is almost entirely based on oil revenue, as it is almost the only source of foreign income. There is therefore a great deal of political control over what the oil companies brings to the table. The current lack of transparency, which is being addressed by NEITI, results in a great deal of corruption in the industry, which the PIB, if properly implemented, will also hopefully address.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Energia in 2019?</h4><p>We look forward to a happier and more engaged efficient staff who feel valued by the company and are proud of what they achieve. We look forward to an exciting year, with production at about 8000 bopd, (over 150% higher than it was in March 2018). We look forward to seeing our cost base reduced by at least USD5 million. Our unit cost per barrel should therefore fall significantly by at least USD5 by focus on both increase in production as well as reduction in costs, a level of year-on-year drop that is almost unheard of in Nigeria. We have something that the entire industry in Nigeria agrees on: the best community partnership and CSR program. The extant MOU cedes a total of 3% of our revenue to the community, though the money is not being spent as judiciously as we would like. Building on our initiatives from 2018, more of this money will be spent on securing empowerment and capacity building for the women and youth in the communities in which we operate. This is aimed at getting them more involved in trainings and local business ventures that will benefit them in a sustainable way. During 2019 we hope to start a couple of community development projects initiatives that ensures sustainable partnerships with about 1,000 members of the youth and women groups.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Costa Rica and Ecuador have long enjoyed mutual promotion and protection of investment. What are the current and future conditions of investment flows between the countries? </h4><p>Costa Rica and Ecuador do not have any current reciprocal protection or promotion agreement in regards to investment, or a free trade agreement. Between 2007 and 2009 $14.2 million in foreign investments in the real estate sector came from Ecuador. Between 2010 and 2013 there were no investment from this country. In the third quarter of 2014, we registered direct foreign investment flows from Ecuador for $19.5 million, also in the real estate sector. </p><h4>Costa Rica will celebrate its third summit of the CELAC at the end of January. What is the perspective on the transfer of the presidency to Ecuador? </h4><p>During the year that Costa Rica held the temporary presidency, we managed to agree on 50 declarations during the last semester. We also had a very productive leadership. We established effective mechanisms for dialogue in the region and with the region's partners, for example our meeting with China. During the summit, the commitment to implement the food security plan was consolidated in order to eradicate famine by 2025 and a plan to end illiteracy in the country was generated. Working together in these processes will be the key to success. The Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)'s voice has to be heard and valued in the international arena, contributing new experiences to influence fresh results. What is at stake concerns us all. It is about the development agenda that will guide humanity till 2030. CELAC's value is in its provision of a medium for dialogue and the influence that we manage to have in our political integration and in the ability to conciliate positions in diverse and urgent matters such as the environment, human rights, and nuclear weapons. In maintaining these scenarios and in working together lies our vision for our continent's future. </p><h4>How will Costa Rica joining the Organization for Economic and Cooperation Development impact commercial ties with the international community, and in what sectors will it propel growth the most?</h4><p>The OECD is an assembly of 34 countries and its objective is to encourage policies and strategies for improving social and economic conditions of people around the world. As we know, this supports the objectives of this administration: providing better living conditions, social inclusion, work, education, environment, health, and housing for all men and women in Costa Rica. For this, we have propelled our national development plan and, from day one, we have focused on the recovery of social policies neglected in our country for the past 30 years. In other words, redirecting public policies towards those in need, dealing with extreme poverty, and reactivating the internal economy. This administration immediately prioritized Costa Rica's entry to the OECD. Becoming a member will give a frame of reference that will undoubtedly facilitate many investments through the application of good practices in our productive model. This will make it easier for us to become a modern and competitive economy. Direct foreign investment, thanks to the talent of our productive force, will position us with great advantage for the creation of commercial and economic ties with several countries. We hope to encourage the same sectors and areas that we have been working on and committed to since the beginning: the productive sectors, the environment, human rights, employment generation, energy, agriculture regeneration, transparency, the fight against corruption in civil services and the development of infrastructure. At the center of this government is the encouragement of economic development and, at the same time, enrichment, improvement, and strengthening of the quality of public management for the benefit of all Costa Ricans. We are aware that by the end of June, when we hope to have our candidacy approved, we need to have improvements in the plan of action that, as a country, we carry out through the work of 27 ministries and public institutions involved. These actions allow us to compare our conditions with those of other member countries in key areas, considering what I have previously mentioned: public policies, efficiency and transparency in internal markets, the functioning of the productive apparatus, productivity, competitiveness and the inclusive growth we aspire to.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does the Riyadh Metro project stand today?</h4><p>Around the world, there is currently no project of this magnitude and ambition that is performing better from a cost, technology, and integration perspective. Any project of this magnitude will have immense challenges with the public interface, and with changing the culture of travel. There is no established history of bringing six urban metro lines into service on this kind of scale. Challenges for all parties continue to increase, making the milestones more significant. Therefore, it is extremely critical that all parties work together to achieve the best outcome. The project remains a symbol of transformation, an anchor of Vision 2030 that is visible and accessible to millions of people; it will certainly be a recognizable attribute of Riyadh itself. This will be the 19th-largest transport network in the world, and notably, the entire network will be implemented simultaneously. All trains for the BACS package are now manufactured and ready to go. We are testing, running, and maintaining the trains in Europe today as we have full testing facilities in Europe. Moreover, the first trains for BACS have arrived in Riyadh and the testing has started on site.</p><h4>What are the main challenges before the trains start running in 2019?</h4><p>The next period consists of testing and commissioning to see the trains running on the infrastructure. The entire integration requires three consortiums working together with Arriyadh Development Authority (ADA). During first three years all the construction was underground, but now the work is fully visible to the public; ADA should be proud of what has been accomplished. The big iconic stations, bridges, and train depots are all nearing completion. The Riyadh metro iconic station at King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD) is becoming integrated with the revitalization of KAFD, which is envisioned to become an iconic architectural symbol of the metro; the station there would help revitalize that project. Some of the other major existing facilities serviced by the metro also come into play. Government facilities, King Saud University, and King Fahd stadium are ready to reap the benefits of the system. The metro's success has people of Riyadh excited about the next steps and the evolution of the public transport. The integration of the bus feeder system has gone well, which is an integral part of giving people access to the system so they can generally go from their neighborhood to where they need to go without using a private vehicle.</p><h4>What innovative solutions are you implementing?</h4><p>This metro system has a state-of-the-art driverless radio technology-based system. One of the advantages of building this all at the same time is that all trains in the system will operate under the Unattended Train Operation (UTO). Whereas, for other systems that were built over time, it is more complicated to start with such an integrated foundation. By building all the lines at the same time, ADA has created an impressive integrated network of the highest standards. All the consortia have used leading innovation from a construction and a building technology perspective, whether that is modeling with different laser technologies or the latest in engineering and equipment technologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the scope of your operations advanced in recent years?</h4><p>BAE Systems has been working in partnership with Saudi Arabia for over 50 years. Developing Saudi industry, recruiting Saudi Nationals, and transferring technology and capability into Saudi Arabia is the core of our strategy. The recent introduction of Vision 2030 has articulated our strategy clearly and strengthened our resolve. BAES SA is a Saudi company with approximately 7,000 employees in KSA, 72% of which are Saudi nationals. Furthermore, half of BAES SA's board members are Saudi Nationals. We have established comprehensive systems intended to support the transfer of knowledge and technology to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, whilst also supporting the long-term development of our Saudi employees. As part of this, we have a number of in-Kingdom partner companies including BAE Systems Saudi Development and Training, International Systems Engineering, Aircraft Accessories and Components Company, Saudi Maintenance Supply Chain Management Company, and Advance Electronic Company.</p><h4>With the current administration's plans for localization, do you anticipate any changes to BAES SA?</h4><p>We have ambitious plans to continue to expand our presence here. We have just started setting the facilities for the assembly of military fast jets, something that has never been done before in Saudi Arabia. The first major components have been delivered and assembly has commenced. To support this, we have Saudi nationals in training and gaining the experience of working on the production of these aircraft. In addition, much of the equipment that we put onto these facilities has been manufactured in Saudi Arabia, so it will be a proud moment when the first fast jet aircraft made in Saudi Arabia flies out of our facility. We are making a considerable investment, and looking forward we would like to establish joint ventures with the Saudi Government and the Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI). Our activity here supports the strategy articulated by SAMI extremely well in creating jobs, transferring technology, and training Saudi nationals to create innovative and modern products.</p><h4>How can global firms like BAE Systems play a role in Saudi Arabia's goal to become a knowledge-based economy?</h4><p>We are extremely proud of our graduate scheme, which provides focus training and work experience and prepares fresh graduates to become leaders of the future. We also provide many apprenticeships and on-the-job training, which is about giving people craft rather than academic skills. To enable them to physically do work in maintaining aircraft and supporting high-technology equipment is of utmost importance. We have great products and opportunities for people with inquiring minds. For those who are innovative and enjoy engineering and technology, we have the best high technology products to work on across our operations.</p><h4>Can the Kingdom also become a center for product development on innovation for BAE Systems?</h4><p>We are already working on this and have joint ventures with a number of KAS research institutes, including King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology. We provide sponsorship and send our engineers and other employees to give lectures to share our work and technology. Under our university collaboration program, we have relationships with a number of universities around the country. Collaboration with the academic world takes place not only in the Kingdom, but also via our strong ties with British and American universities.</p><h4>What would you outline as your main objectives and ambitions?</h4><p>For 50 years, our work carried out in the Kingdom has played a crucial part in supporting the country's national objectives and helping to maintain its security. Today, we look to build upon our proud heritage and enjoy new successes through our partnership with Saudi Arabia. We are focussed on the goals of Vision 2030 and working together with the Saudi Government to create a strong sovereign defence industry. The Vision 2030 goal of Saudi Arabia becoming the hub that connects Europe, Asia, and Africa reflects our ambitions; our goal is for Saudi Arabia to become BAE Systems' regional hub from where we can service our global clientele.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[More Efficient and Effective]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ahmed-albalawi-director-general-mashroat]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Mashroat's primary project management activities and overall mandate?</h4><p>The National Project Management Office (NPMO) was announced by royal decree in September 2015 with the mandate to improve efficiency in the delivery of projects by adopting the best international project management practices, developing a project management approach for implementing the best international practices, setting criteria for the establishment of project management offices within government entities, and preparing a standard contract template for government entities to engage project management companies. A subsequent royal decree issued in August 2017 extended the scope of the NPMO to include operations and maintenance, which resulted in changing our name to Mashroat. Our approach to realize this mandate is built on four pillars. The first is alignment and ensuring a more consistent and standard approach to the planning and execution of projects that reflects best international practices. These are captured in the Mashroat Projects White Book. The second pillar is enablement, namely supporting the restructuring of entities to be more capable and competent in the delivery of public infrastructure in line with our developed best practices. Third, we strive to provide the necessary support and resources, both people and training materials, to help entities adopt and implement the Mashroat methodology. Our last pillar is evaluation, for which we are developing a national projects dashboard to monitor project performance metrics and facilitate analysis of project performance in ways not currently possible, thereby providing greater transparency at different managerial levels.</p><h4>How is Mashroat equipped to provide the necessary training and consultations to these entities?</h4><p>We have captured our methodology in the Mashroat Projects White Book. This contains a complete and comprehensive set of processes, procedures, and templates for planning and execution of infrastructure projects across the entire project lifecycle. These materials have been informed, refined, and developed to reflect best international practices. We have been supported in these endeavors by Bechtel and are building Mashroat's capacity through a structured knowledge transfer program. All the materials developed by Mashroat to support its approach are available to government entities and their suppliers via a portal on our website. In total, this represents over 800 separate deliverables, which include 28 packs of training materials covering of project management, professional development, leadership development, and leading change. For government entities, our approach involves analyzing their projects portfolio and sitting down with them to understand how they deliver infrastructure projects. With this information, we provide support by advising them on organization and structures that reflect best international practices, and how they will facilitate more efficient and effective delivery of projects. In addition to this organizational support, we place enormous importance on the personal development of Saudi nationals. This will be realized through an entity-specific knowledge transfer program, whose objective is to support the entities to become more competent, capable, and self-sufficient over time.</p><h4>How do you interact with other organizations striving to make public entities more efficient and better equipped to deliver on their projects?</h4><p>There are many other organizations that have national responsibilities that touch on, or impact, Mashroat's activities. To reflect this importance, a key position in the organization is the director of external stakeholder management, who is responsible for engaging with these organizations to understand where we have common interests and how we can work together. Among the most important external organizations are the Ministry of Finance (MoF), the Bureau for Spending Rationalization (BSR), and the National Center for Performance Measurement (Adaa). Mashroat works closely with MoF and BSR to develop project appraisal processes and procedures that will be used to develop robust business cases for infrastructure projects. We have also developed a suite of procedures to support five-year project portfolio planning, and are working with BSR on the execution of an outreach program to support entities employing these methods.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[abdullah-al-hossain-president-al-baha-university]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where would you position the university within the education landscape, and what are your distinctive strengths?</h4><p>Al-Baha University is a relatively new university, and its initial positioning was to provide a broad range of disciplines to both male and female students. Currently, 14 of our 15 colleges have male and female branches. Al-Baha is a mountainous area, so aside from our main campus, we have four small branches in and around the city where we provide around 60% of our programs to make them more accessible. Furthermore, we have a research, a business, and a medical center. Currently, we serve 26,000 students, mostly from Al-Baha region, but also a batch of international students who come for Arabic language and Islamic studies. All together, we host around 166 international students from 20 different countries.</p><h4>How do you envision better aligning graduation programs with industry requirements?</h4><p>Vision 2030 has given us a wide range of thinking, and the focus on the young generation is the key here. At Al-Baha University, we guide students to build up relevant skills for jobs of the future, specifically in engineering and computer science. The business center plays an important role here as well, where we aim to develop the entrepreneurial skills of our students and teach them how to set up companies. Already, 60 students, male and female, have worked on comprehensive business plans that they pitched in a competition. The top three receive full support to develop their plans as real companies. Apart from this competition, we continue to provide inclusive programs to encourage our students.</p><h4>How do you strive to bring more technology into classrooms?</h4><p>Our computer science college and engineering colleges offer various programs in the field of technology, including ICT and mechanical engineering. The internal IT infrastructure is extremely technologically advanced to stay on par with international practices. The university network allows students to do all their interactions online. To encourage our students, we have a computer science club for both males and females with additional workshops and training programs. On top of this, our staff can follow programs to improve their own skills.</p><h4>What are the main fields of research at the university?</h4><p>Research is an essential part of the university. We have a deanship and a vice president for research, and we encourage our staff to conduct research and apply for funding. In 2018 so far, we have approved funded research for about 90 staff members in different areas. Staff typically apply to that fund, and there is a committee that reviews the ideas and selects the best ideas to support. Also, we work with King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) to support research projects. We hope to have this funding in the near future to fund specific research for staff members of Al-Baha University.</p><h4>What is the typical mentality of an Al-Baha graduate?</h4><p>A mountainous environment like Al-Baha inspires to think more about nature, ecology, and agriculture. At Al-Baha University, we think about bringing the university and people closer together to think about the natural aspects. Also, we can develop our tourism, as Saudis like to come here during the hot summer months. That includes thinking about a summer program at the university, for example for the youth traveling with their families. There could be training workshops or programs in our business center. We need to think about programs that we need in the future. We need to be able to change our programs going forward to meet the needs of Vision 2030; programs need to be changed to be ready for the new generation of jobs. The majority of the Saudi population is below 30 years old, and this is our advantage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mohammed-bin-saud-al-ghazwani-secretary-general-wafi]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us more about the newly established Wafi and your mandate for the real estate development sector?</h4><p>Wafi was developed to deal with the organization of the sale and rentals of off-plan real estate units, regardless of their purpose or method of development, before or during the construction phase. The program also requires real estate developers to implement approved models and specifications according to the timetable of each project. The program is supervised by a committee set up by a decision of the Council of Ministers, comprising representatives from the Ministry of Housing, the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs, the Ministry of Trade and Investment, the Ministry of Justice, Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA), Saudi Industrial Property Authority (MODON), and two members of the public sector. The committee is also involved with a number of other government agencies, such as the Real Estate Development Fund as well as ETMAM. Wafi seeks to be the leading and distinguished program in the supervision of real estate development projects, serving the country and citizens in the field of real estate development through supervision and follow-ups and the development of effective policies and operational mechanisms. The committee's tasks are focused on granting licenses within a maximum period of 10 days from the completion of the license application for the project and outlining the conditions and requirements necessary for the licensing, sale, marketing, and presenting of off-plan real estate units.</p><h4>What is Wafi's vision for the development of the residential sector in the Kingdom?</h4><p>Wafi works in accordance with the mechanisms and rules that will facilitate the mechanism of citizens' ownership of housing, support supply, enable demand, increase ownership, and facilitate access with various options, high quality, and favorable prices in line with the NTP and Vision 2030. Off-plan sales and rents are tested and proven global concepts. The best way to ensure citizens are able to obtain suitable housing through multiple guarantees provided by the program is to protect them from fraudulent sales and safeguard the rights of buyers and tenants through systems and procedures. These measures are the result of the ministry's vision and dedicated work of Wafi employees. In order to improve the quality of services provided, an online platform was launched to facilitate services for citizens and to follow up on off-plan sales and leasing across the entire country with ease and efficiency.</p><h4>What role can Wafi play to support the ministry's objectives to promote transparency in the real estate sector, encourage competition, and improve the residential sector?</h4><p>The resolution by the Council of Ministers to develop a program to regulate the off-plan sale and leasing sector reflects its interest in boosting the real estate market, organizing it, and encouraging fair competition, which will subsequently benefit the housing sector. The program was based on fulfilling contracts, and the vision is to achieve a transparent real estate environment wherein everyone is on equal footing and the conditions and mechanisms are equally applied to all. Today, Wafi works to apply the highest standards through clear and published requirements. It also enables everyone to engage with the off-plan sale system without differentiation or favoritism in accordance with clear and consistent standards and timeframes. Wafi protects buyers' rights by annotating the title deed of the property, depositing funds in the project's escrow account, requiring an engineering consultant and a legal accountant, as well as field monitoring of the licensed projects and working to qualify and evaluate the developers' assessment. The program also prohibits developers from selling or leasing any off-plan real estate units, whatever their purpose or method of development, advertising in local or foreign media, or presenting them in exhibitions without first obtaining the necessary license from the committee to carry out the activity.</p><h4>How can Wafi drive collaboration in the coming years?</h4><p>Wafi has held a number of joint workshops with real estate developers, specialists in the field, legal accountants, and engineering consultants, with the aim of promoting partnerships and development in order to boost the real estate market. We envision becoming an entity that protects the rights of citizens and an important custodian of the real estate sector investments in the Kingdom, working continually to protect the rights of beneficiaries and ensure their satisfaction. We want to organize the sale and lease of off-plan activities in the real estate market by 2022 to stimulate the supply of real estate and raise productivity, providing housing products at the right price and quality, improving the performance of the real estate sector, and increasing its contribution to gross domestic product.</p><h4>ETMAM was set up as developer services center for the real estate sector and as a governmental central connection point for developers. What are your mandate and activities?</h4><p>ETMAM rules as a connection point for developers and is currently working to raise awareness among real estate developers about the services provided by the center. We participate in exhibitions that publicize the center's role in servicing real estate developers so that citizens will benefit from our services. We held a series of workshops with participation from both public and private sectors to develop ways of cooperation and to identify and analyze the challenges that developers might face.</p><h4>For greater private sector involvement, it is instrumental to have an attractive investment climate. How is ETMAM equipped to pursue this?</h4><p>Like other programs of the Ministry of Housing, ETMAM contributes to creating an attractive investment environment that allows the increment in the domestic and international investments at the real estate sector within the Kingdom. Our common objective is to increase the volume of investments in the real estate sector and to accelerate the pace of work in residential projects. ETMAM works as the connection point through various service-level agreements with different governmental entities. Developers can submit their applications for permits, approvals, and handovers, and ETMAM ensures that these are done quickly and in compliance with the regulations. ETMAM also monitors the real estate development process to develop the necessary system of rules and regulations that facilitate procedures, with the participation of all relevant entities.</p><h4>What are your objectives and expectations for the coming years?</h4><p>For Wafi, we are keen to work on bridging the rapidly growing gap between demand and supply, and to develop a comprehensive and integrated plan to address the problem of both supply and demand through various products. One of our most important achievements is the integrated supervision of the real estate development projects in all regions of the Kingdom led by a Saudi team of distinguished competencies. This reflects the efficiency of the team and the keenness of the committee to conduct business with quality and effectiveness in line with the ambitions of Vision 2030. ETMAM aims to propel the real estate sector in the Kingdom and improve residential development activities with more and better private sector participation. We also aim to improve the performance of the real estate sector and increase its contribution to GDP. Our ultimate objective is to raise home ownership to at least 70% by 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you envision developing the valuation profession in the country?</h4><p>Taqeem started three years ago as a regulator for the business valuation profession. Today, the Saudi market has become more transparent and is gaining more public trust. Before the regulation, valuation was a mere practice in Saudi Arabia, so realtors valued real estate and accountants valued businesses. It was mostly based on experience; there was no education and no standards for valuation. We established four goals to shift valuation from a practice to a profession. The first goal was to set valuation standards. Thus, we joined the International Valuation Standard Council (IVSC) and translated the International Valuation Standards (IVS) to be implemented in Saudi Arabia. It is our ambition to be the regional leader for Arab countries for the valuation profession. With one of our staff as a member of the Standard Committee, we have qualified valuation professionals who work with global experts to bring standards up to par. Second, we enforced the regulations for the business valuation profession. As a result, we worked with the government to implement standards across the board, which included requiring valuers to have licensing. This means that asset valuations are based on standards and principles rather than opinions. Furthermore, we have set a code of conduct for valuers. Third, we are committed to educating people about valuations. It is our goal to distribute the knowledge to the community that there is something called valuation, and that you have to go to a valuer, a trusted source, before making your decisions. Our fourth focus point is the standardization of valuation, which is something we are working on thoroughly. Half of the country's business is in real estate, including renting, selling, and investments, so these valuations should be based on standards and actual value rather than expert opinions. Similarly for IPOs, it is good when professionals issue valuation reports before decisions are taken.</p><h4>What fields of valuation are you currently prioritizing?</h4><p>Taqeem has various valuation designations, including accredited real estate valuer (AR Taqeem) and accredited business valuer (AB Taqeem), but currently most of our activities are in real estate. We have around 900 licensed real estate valuers. Our business valuation primarily looks into intangible assets. A lot of companies here do not realize the value of their trademark, name, or goodwill, so we are trying to show them that they have an actual value. Moreover, we have a program with the SME Authority to help companies understand the value of their businesses and tell them whether to raise or lower their expectations. As for automobile damage assessment, our goal now is to provide information on how much the insurance company should pay to repair a car. Valuers can independently establish a value that is fair for all parties involved. Furthermore, we started a new program for valuers to specialize in valuing SMEs. It is actually more challenging to value SMEs than big companies because they lack historical data, and the risk for the business in SMEs is higher than in well-established large companies.</p><h4>What is the purpose of Taqeem Academy in the practice of valuation?</h4><p>Taqeem Academy consulted many international institutions such as the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), the National Institute of Valuation (INSPEN) in Malaysia, and the International Institute of Business Valuers (iiBV) to localize, translate, and deliver courses in Arabic. We have now graduated 32 Saudi nationals as internationally accredited business valuers. Women are also participating heavily in real estate and business valuation sectors. In automobile damage assessment, we cooperated with KPMG and Thatcham, a UK-based, non-profit research center. Thatcham is currently working with us to build our internationally approved curriculum. A fourth program is in machinery and equipment valuation related to factory product lines.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the mandate and the activities of NHSC?</h4><p>NHSC is 100% owned by the Ministry of Housing. The ministry offers both services to citizens and products, and NHSC takes care of the services. We have four main services, the first of which is the Home Owners' Association, or Mullak. For a variety of demographic and economic reasons, Saudis are moving into jointly owned properties. For smooth living in these communities, we need homeowners associations that take care of common areas and assets through the collection of appropriate maintenance fees from owners. We have to tackle this carefully to make sure our projects with apartment buildings are accepted by end users. Secondly, we launched the Saudi Real Estate Institute (SREI), a training center focused on raising the maturity level of real estate practitioners in the market. Previously, anyone could become a broker, though this is no longer the case. To practice real estate professions, individuals need to have the appropriate training and credentials that are facilitated through SREI. The third business line under NHSC is the Sustainable Building, a brand seal we are investing in and quality stamp that will be placed on every individual house. For those who purchase property, this stamp will assure them of the quality of the building in terms of livability, energy savings, and other important aspects. It is a significant and ambitious project and requires a great deal of inspections. Our services are anchored around the newly established Sustainable Building Platform. We are working with all the related government agencies and service providers to roll out services rapidly. Our final business line is the Title Subdivision program, or Farz, which is purely an engineering service offering to subdivide jointly owned properties and ensure owners' entitlements. In the future, new business lines may be added based on strategic alignment of new services that need to be offered by the ministry.</p><h4>What is envisioned with this restructuring of services under the ministry?</h4><p>On a national level, we intend to lower the government's expenses while ensuring citizens receive better services. Vision 2030 has outlined some of the most essential programs as game changers, and the Building Technology Initiative will be a prime example. We are mandated to supply the market with 680,000 units by 2022; the allocation should be completed by 2020 and delivery of keys should take place by 2022. Achieving this fairly ambitious mission is impossible if we continue to follow the traditional methods of building. Therefore, we are moving toward industrializing construction, and instead of building everything onsite, we seek to build offsite in factories, replacing low-skilled labor with high-skilled labor. We have economies of scale and volumes, which makes the business viable for any investor. The government has committed SAR13.9 billion (USD3.7billion) as a stimulus package for the private sector to invest in those factories. This will significantly fix the housing problem, create jobs, and boost GDP overall. NHSC is an enabler for the private sector, and we are opening the market to foreign investors for them to understand the opportunities available here in Saudi Arabia. Thus far, we have brought Turkish, Chinese, and American investors on board.</p><h4>How does the financing organization fit into that new set up of the housing and development ecosystem?</h4><p>The ministry's vision is anchored by three pillars: supporting supply, which we are a part of; enabling demand, which is done by newly established companies like the Saudi Real Estate Refinancing Company; and putting the necessary regulations in place to make it an attractive market. Once we complete our mandate of constructing the housing projects under the set programs, we will have the opportunity to utilize this extra capacity for the region. Saudi Arabia can become a construction hub and support countries around us that have seen the destruction of their cities in recent years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Costa Rica has created a particular identity through commerce and diplomacy. What is Costa Rica's role concerning economic, political, and social dynamics in Central America?</h4><p>Costa Rica must use its strengths. The country has built these strengths over almost 200 years of independence, which has enabled sound commerce. Also, Costa Rica's diplomacy has legitimacy; its strengths include a democratic institutional structure, peace, the environment, human rights, and inclusion. All these are the elements that we can share, as an army's obligation is to send a message of peace, or that natural parks reflect a vision of an economy that is growing together with care for the environment, or an average income country that is able to have higher standards regarding health and education. We have many areas of opportunity, and there is still much to be done, though we also have achievements to show.</p><h4>In your administration, what are the main priorities for the Central American integration progress?</h4><p>Concerning the integration, an important aspect is the forum for permanent dialog. There are critical junctures regarding migration, security, economy, and politics. The prosperity of our neighboring countries means prosperity for us as well. That is why we worry for the democratic institutional structure in each region. The Central American Integration System (SICA) must become an organization with less instances and look forward to becoming an organization that transforms Central American's life experience.</p><h4>Can Costa Rica become a member of OECD, and how are you working on this?</h4><p>This is our goal; we aim to be a modern and developed country for our citizens' wellbeing and being a member of OECD plays a key role in achieving that goal. We are defining the terms so we do not lose our own characteristics and development style. We are working hard on this and have created a legislative committee, a group of specialized deputies who know all the projects.</p><h4>What are the priorities of this administration?</h4><p>The first priority would be financial, institutional, and legal stability. Costa Rica is a growing country, with stable inflation and many opportunities for investment, and an excellent location and human talent. That is why we want to strengthen this development platform and resolve the public deficit. By doing so, we can move and work with other issues, especially education. We are investing heavily in education and aim to become a bilingual country in the medium term. We are also working on connecting our educational centers with broadband for 2021. Apart from that, we are also working on the decarbonization of our energy. 99% of our electrical energy is clean, and we want to bring this concept to transportation and other aspects in order to reduce our carbon footprint and prove our economic growth is independent of the use of fossil fuels. Therefore, we need to electrify and digitalize our economy and foster sustainable agriculture. We want to abolish fossil fuels within 70 years, as we did before with our army. This is an extremely strong message for the world, especially today, when climate change is a threat to humanity. We also need to upgrade our infrastructure in order to improve our competitiveness. For the next four years, we plan to invest USD4 billion in road infrastructure and USD1.3 billion in an interurban electric train. We also want to transform our Caribbean harbors and will launch a container terminal project in February 2019. As well, we are working on a harbor in Caldera, on the Pacific, which will strengthen commerce with the Pacific region and Asia. We are working hard to reduce income inequality and poverty, which is why we need to generate more jobs and work on territorial specialization.</p><h4>Regarding Costa Rica's payment capacity, fiscal reform is one of the keys of this administration. How would you evaluate the landscape of this reform?</h4><p>This has been our priority since the start of our administration. We have had our first debate as well as some results, despite the opposition. Also, we already have the federal budget for 2019, which has not been increased and will not affect the government's functions. By using AI, we have been able to cover emergencies, prevent droughts, and improve our infrastructure. We have achieved significant reductions without neglecting our services or announcing redundancies. This plan is currently awaiting approval from the constitutional chamber. In terms of taxes, there is a strong message of confidence. This will be reflected in economic stability and confidence, which will attract investors.</p><h4>What message are you sending to the private sector, and how keen is the administration to work with PPPs?</h4><p>In this first budget, we reinforced the National Concessions Council with more than CRC5 billion (USD8.33 million). There are also USD15 million in opportunities for public-private partnerships. We are interested in economic growth and understand that such partnerships are a tool that will take us in that direction. These include projects such as airports, the interurban electric train, and a freight train line. Costa Rica has high-quality talent, though it is not enough to meet private sector demands. </p><h4>How can the government boost the educational agenda to adjust to Costa Rica's private sector present and future needs?</h4><p>We have the human talent, and education is a priority; however, we need to create more opportunities general, which is why we are working on English training. This is so there are more people who speak the language of business, knowledge, and communication around the world. We are also preparing our students with technologies and knowledge in general. In public education, we have a difficult task ahead, namely the academic formation of our youth. In the end, it will have returns on investment. The aspects we are working on are dual training and improving the higher education regional offerings. We need to find a balance between what universities offer, what the private sector needs, and where the country wants to go. We also want to work on reducing inequality, since the majority of development in Costa Rica is in the central region. By distributing the opportunities across the country, we will break down economic, gender, and age inequality.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[juan-carlos-jacome-ruiz-president-director-corporacion-financiera-nacional]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your main mandate as the national development bank, and how does that encourage economic growth in the country?</h4><p>CFN is a public bank that in its nature has a structural difference as compared to the other private institutions that take part of the entire local financial system. CFN does not depend on deposits in order to provide credit to the market, which means that it is a self-funded institution based on the paybacks of previous credit operations. Moreover, being a public financial institution, CFN has a mandate that is not focused on profit but on providing as much financial resources as possible to economic agents who are willing mainly to increase and renew their capital stock or diversify and explore in other economic activities. All this framework is what allows us to design products that, in addition to satisfy our potential demand, creates signaling in the whole market in order to promote better conditions for interest rates and credit terms; as well as mechanisms that are designed to decrease the barriers to financial access to SMEs, being one of our main objectives. Now, in order to link all previously mentioned with the economic performance of the economy, we can take two approaches into account for this aim: short and long run. Short-run GDP positive fluctuations are commonly associated with increases in money supply, where the multipliers play a relevant role. On the other hand, these kind of fluctuations in the long-run are said to be driven by technological changes and increases of the stock of capital in the economy. Hence, based of this framework, CFN certainly encourages the growth of local economy due to the allocation of financial resources in activities with multipliers of high power and with its particular focus on financing machinery, land, infrastructure, and similar physical assets.</p><h4>How do you advance SME growth in the country?</h4><p>We promote SMEs in the financial market in different ways. First, we offer low interest rates, long loan terms and grace periods to this group of enterprises as compared to what they can get from other financial institutions. Thus, we try to reduce the financial weight over their flows in order to increase their likelihood of success. Second, SMEs are still on a growth trend, and therefore in a process of consolidating their business. Hence, SMEs in several cases do not have proper assets to secure financing, facing a clear barrier for accessing to financial markets. In this case, we offer SMEs the opportunity to access credit markets through a fund created by CFN in order to assume the 80% of the guarantees required by other financial institutions, the ones who already decided to work with this fund. In particular, Banco del Pací­fico is the unique bank where SMEs could get a line of credit—after all the risk analysis process—without the need of having to present a guarantee. In summary, adequate conditions and increasing access to credit markets are the main tools for reinforcement of SME growth in Ecuador.</p><h4>What were the main adjustments to make your funding more accessible to entrepreneurs?</h4><p>We have recently extended the terms for all credits. Before, it used to be 10 years for financing fixed assets, and now it is 15. Working capital used to be financed at most during three years, and we have extended that to five years. In both cases, we also extended the grace period. In addition, in order the provide a better service, efficient and clear, we have established a new procedure for credit applications. This is a very important advance for promoting more access.  It used to be hard to get a credit from CFN, and it took a long time. We shortened this period and now take, on average, 15 working days to approve or deny an application once the application is complete and consistent. Moreover, the process was not that transparent before. We have worked to clarify the process and have extended formal communications to potential customers. We want people to have a great experience from a customer service point of view, and we try to reduce the possibility of moral hazard along every part of the chain. Finally, with the aim to amplify the export base of Ecuador and to create incentives for the agricultural industry, a new financial product was designed providing total grace period to non-traditional exportable agricultural production. We seek to create solid incentives to different entrepreneurs in order to promote access to these areas so that Ecuador may broader in the medium-run its inflow of money from abroad and bringing more stability to our dollarized economy.</p><h4>How have you enlarged the scope of those that are eligible to your financing?</h4><p>We did not have the opportunity to finance service industry firms before. CFN initially focused on more “hard“ industries. However, when you look at the big picture, services are related to 40% of the GDP and 35% of the workforce. We have since introduced this activity into set of activities available to be financed at CFN. Actually, we are currently in the middle of a large communication campaign to make it clear that all the people involved in this activity should look for CFN if there are financial needs for expanding, improving or initiating projects related to the activity of services. We have worked hard to boost and support the economy in a rational way. In this sense, CFN has also created products that are focused on the needs of certain regions. Ecuador suffered a major earthquake a few years ago that destroyed key areas, and despite our recovery efforts, there is a gap that needs to be filled. We have given credit to the businesses located in the regions most affected by the earthquake as well to any project that will take place in these places, allowing them to truly focus on restructuring and developing their businesses and homes.</p><h4>How has the investment climate developed, and how have entrepreneurs been able to find you?</h4><p>The goal for 2018 was to provide to credit market of USD645 million. CFN reached that amount on the last day of September, meaning an 89% increase in credit compared to the same period in 2017. This figure can only be explained by two main key factors. One of these two is the business environment, which has been significantly better than last year and has pushed demand forward. The second factor is on the other hand the more efficient process for resolving credit applications. Both elements described above allow to depict undoubtedly a very strong picture of the actual state of the climate and how agents could find us. We are always looking to support different businesses with our credit. However, at the end of the day, we deal with risk management and despite the goodwill and desires of some entrepreneurs, we cannot take risks that are out of scope.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights of 2018?</h4><p>We have seen entrenched macroeconomic stability and continued reduction in our public debt. Traditionally, high indebtedness has been one of the main challenges of the Jamaican economy. Public debt was probably the highest at 145% of GDP in 2013, but is expected to be around 98% by the end of this fiscal year 2018/19. This continued downward trajectory is good. We have also seen tremendous improvements in fiscal balances, driven by our relatively high primary surpluses in addition to continued downward trends in interest rates. Overall, growth has been increasing over time. In 2Q2018, we saw our highest quarterly growth since 2Q2007, at 2.2%. This positive outcome has been driven largely by certain sectors, such as Mining &amp; Quarrying. Activities have resumed at one of our main alumina refineries, JISCO Alpart, which has been increasing its capacity utilization rate. In tourism, we are also seeing new hotel rooms, increased flight frequencies, and new routes: new markets are being explored and developed across the board. The agriculture sector has been susceptible to adverse weather impacts, but we have still seen good growth this year. In construction, we are seeing quite a bit of infrastructure development in terms of roadworks and residential and nonresidential building, which can be accredited to broader macroeconomic indicators pointing in the right direction. A lot of reforms have been undertaken, which has led to progress, especially as it relates to macroeconomic stability. Public Financial Management strengthening and Central Bank modernization have also been significant features.</p><h4>What have been the latest impacts on Jamaica's growth?</h4><p>We have seen robust growth in the Mining &amp; Quarrying industry, however, weather related shocks has led to a downward revision in Agriculture, due to drought conditions in 3Q2018. However, we still expect growth to continue to improve, with those industries being the key drivers. In the labor market, unemployment stood at 9.7% in April 2018 and approximately 1.22 million people employed, the highest level ever recorded. This is against the background of the 2008 Global economic and financial crisis during which we lost 90,000 jobs up to July 2011. Since then, we have added more than 133,000 jobs, a tremendous achievement. Additionally, in April 2018 The majority of sectors, 11 of 16, have shown increases relative to April 2017. From a planning standpoint, we are looking at how to build on these successes.</p><h4>How would you highlight the economic prospects for the upcoming year?</h4><p>There is a positive outlook for the country, and the international community has improved our ratings from stable to positive. Anyone looking at the same indicators will share this level of optimism. Our baseline projection for economic growth is between 2% to 3% through to 2022. We continue to build resilience to climate impacts, through appropriate building codes, adapting climate-smart agricultural practices, and adhering to overall areas of readiness and preparation. Our program with the IMF ends in 2019, before which time we want to be in a position of self-sufficiency. In addition to developing a Fiscal Council, we are also modernizing the Central Bank to be more independent. With that comes increased transparency and predictability in the monetary sector. The capacity of the economy is growing from an overall macroeconomic standpoint, of which the increased investment, particularly in transportation infrastructure (road, sea, and air), energy infrastructure, telecommunications infrastructure, and build out of office spaces for businesses and new and refurbished hotels are critical.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>We want stronger and more inclusive growth, for which the Government of Jamaica has established a Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation to achieve that mandate. To be inclusive you want to ensure that jobs are created and that the economy's linkages are strengthened. There are many ongoing developments, the benefits of which we have clearly seen. The building of infrastructure, especially our road network, is also a priority for 2019, in addition to building resilience in the built and natural environment, as well as continued debt reduction, remains key to continued macroeconomic stability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the mandate and the activities of NHSC?</h4><p><span></span>NHSC is 100% owned by the Ministry of Housing. The ministry offers both services to citizens and products, and NHSC takes care of the services. We have four main services, the first of which is the Home Owners' Association, or Mullak. For a variety of demographic and economic reasons, Saudis are moving into jointly owned properties. For smooth living in these communities, we need homeowners associations that take care of common areas and assets through the collection of appropriate maintenance fees from owners. We have to tackle this carefully to make sure our projects with apartment buildings are accepted by end users. Secondly, we launched the Saudi Real Estate Institute (SREI), a training center focused on raising the maturity level of real estate practitioners in the market. Previously, anyone could become a broker, though this is no longer the case. To practice real estate professions, individuals need to have the appropriate training and credentials that are facilitated through SREI. The third business line under NHSC is the Sustainable Building, a brand seal we are investing in and quality stamp that will be placed on every individual house. For those who purchase property, this stamp will assure them of the quality of the building in terms of livability, energy savings, and other important aspects. It is a significant and ambitious project and requires a great deal of inspections. Our services are anchored around the newly established Sustainable Building Platform. We are working with all the related government agencies and service providers to roll out services rapidly. Our final business line is the Title Subdivision program, or Farz, which is purely an engineering service offering to subdivide jointly owned properties and ensure owners' entitlements. In the future, new business lines may be added based on strategic alignment of new services that need to be offered by the ministry.</p><h4>What is envisioned with this restructuring of services under the ministry?</h4><p>On a national level, we intend to lower the government's expenses while ensuring citizens receive better services. Vision 2030 has outlined some of the most essential programs as game changers, and the Building Technology Initiative will be a prime example. We are mandated to supply the market with 680,000 units by 2022; the allocation should be completed by 2020 and delivery of keys should take place by 2022. Achieving this fairly ambitious mission is impossible if we continue to follow the traditional methods of building. Therefore, we are moving toward industrializing construction, and instead of building everything onsite, we seek to build offsite in factories, replacing low-skilled labor with high-skilled labor. We have economies of scale and volumes, which makes the business viable for any investor. The government has committed SAR13.9 billion (USD3.7billion) as a stimulus package for the private sector to invest in those factories. This will significantly fix the housing problem, create jobs, and boost GDP overall. NHSC is an enabler for the private sector, and we are opening the market to foreign investors for them to understand the opportunities available here in Saudi Arabia. Thus far, we have brought Turkish, Chinese, and American investors on board.</p><h4>How does the financing organization fit into that new set up of the housing and development ecosystem?</h4><p>The ministry's vision is anchored by three pillars: supporting supply, which we are a part of; enabling demand, which is done by newly established companies like the Saudi Real Estate Refinancing Company; and putting the necessary regulations in place to make it an attractive market. Once we complete our mandate of constructing the housing projects under the set programs, we will have the opportunity to utilize this extra capacity for the region. Saudi Arabia can become a construction hub and support countries around us that have seen the destruction of their cities in recent years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What projects have you completed since establishing the company?</h4><p>Since we closed the fund, we have invested equity in two major projects. One is in Nigeria, the Azura-Edo independent power plant (IPP), a 459-MW open cycle power generation plant constructed on the outskirts of Benin City in Edo State. The project went into commercial operation in May 2018, and has on average been contributing between 6% and 9% to the national grid since then. The second project is in Ghana, also in power generation. It is called the Amandi IPP, a 200-MW combined cycle power plant that we are currently constructing in Aboadze, in the country's Western Region. That should supply power to Ghana in 2019. Also in Ghana, we are in the process of closing a port deal, which, when complete, will provide world-class ship and oil rig repair and maintenance facilities. It will be critical and value enhancing for ship operators, because today many vessels operating in West African waters are compelled go to Spain or South Africa for maintenance services owing to the lack of such facilities locally.</p><h4>What geographical areas and sectors do you focus on?</h4><p>Geographically, we focus on West Africa. In terms of sectors, we have three pillars: transportation, energy, and utilities. In transportation, we are interested in everything from toll roads and bridges to airports, sea ports, and railways. In energy, we have power generation assets and are also focused on processing gas-to-power. Utilities include water and wastewater treatment and management, and selected parts of telecoms and data traffic. We currently have projects in all those spaces in our pipeline.</p><h4>How challenging is it to find local investors willing to invest in infrastructure?</h4><p>Infrastructure as an asset class has been known for a long time to international investors; what they might struggle with is the risk profile of Nigeria and other countries in the Sub-region. Conversely, while local investors are familiar with the risk profile of the country, they often struggle to understand the complexities of the infrastructure legal and financing aspects. This is partly owing to the environment in which we operate in Nigeria; political and regulatory risk is an issue, and roads, power, water, healthcare, and every other strand of infrastructure is currently in poor condition and insufficient for Nigerians' needs. Historically, it has been the privy of government to be the sole providers of infrastructure; and only recently, with us being among the pioneers, has private investment started to come into that space. The involvement of private investors sometimes leads to end user reluctance to pay if, for example, there is a belief that this would be lining private pockets, and in the extreme, may fuel corruption. But there have also been genuine concerns about whether value for money is being provided through such privately financed infrastructure projects. Without proper funding, including through people paying tax or paying directly through tariffs or tolls, the country's infrastructure is bound to remain dilapidated. Another issue with local investors is that they do not want their funds to be tied down for a 25 or 30-year concession because of the short economic cycles historically driven by high inflation, high currency volatility, and political uncertainty. People are not fully accustomed yet to taking long-term investment exposure. We need an entire cultural transformation to get people to understand it can be done. Lastly, there is a lack of a maintenance culture. The entire ecosystem of someone providing, regulating, and maintaining it is essential for infrastructure to be sustainable.</p><h4>In 2006, you built the first PPP toll road in Nigeria. Are you trying to replicate the model, and if so, in which sectors?</h4><p>That was the first project not financed through the traditional bricks and mortar security route, which in itself was also a major mindset change. we prefer to think more about the PPP model, the concession model, and project financing, as a concept of delivering essential infrastructure and related services rather than just about tolls. Across the geographies in which we operate, we are looking at investing in all sorts of different segments. It is that model at the macro level that we are rolling out, which can apply to bridges, roads, airports, or sea ports as appropriate. Many people focus purely on economic returns; however, there is also risk, and different sectors have different levels of risk. There is a trade-off between risk and returns, which must always be carefully considered. If we look over an entire life cycle, one gets more steady returns from a low-risk investment, however, with a higher risk investment the returns are likely to be more volatile given that risk itself is an indication of volatility.</p><h4>Where would you advise a risk-averse investor to put their money?</h4><p>Infrastructure is a great asset class to invest in because roads, ports, power plants, and water treatment plants, among others, tend to have quasi-monopolistic characteristics. Unless one wants the inconvenience of bypassing something, then they will likely have to use that infrastructure. Also, infrastructure is not as susceptible to the influences of economic cycles. Regardless of shocks in demand or supply, one still needs roads, water, and electricity. Infrastructure also has an almost predictable income stream once it is built and put into operation. Moreover, international debt default reports show that infrastructure exhibits lower default rates than petrochemicals, manufacturing, telecoms, and other sectors. A key reason for this is that project finance is like a straightjacket, as financiers place more belts and braces on such projects when done in Africa than they might do in the developed world. This does not give much room for error while also providing strong protections for financing parties, especially debt providers. Once it is stabilized, and the asset begins to perform, it is fairly constant and predictable. With these contracts, there is typically index linking for inflation and currency movements, so there are risk-adjusted returns. That is why infrastructure is a great bet; for investors like a pension fund, insurance fund, or investment trust with an extremely long-term outlook, this is a good match.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the company in 2019?</h4><p>We always tend to maintain a positive outlook and believe in the impossible. At the same time, we can be reserved in our approach. Nigeria is a key barometer of sub-Saharan Africa and certainly West Africa. The economy has not been sufficiently deregulated and liberalized to truly empower the private sector, since too much money and resources still lie in the hands of the government. Efforts are being made by government in this direction nevertheless. Because of the dampening effect of the elections, there will likely be a lag in activity and investment until we know what the outcome of the elections is. Taking the 2015 election as an example, it took six or seven months for the new administration to appoint a new cabinet. I see that unfortunately clouding issues in Nigeria for a while; however, because our Fund has a regional focus, it will not prevent us from looking elsewhere in the meantime. Our strategy is to stay focused on Nigeria and look for opportunities there so that if the fundamentals are right, we can invest. Equally, we are looking at opportunities outside Nigeria. As we close more transactions, we will continue to demonstrate the case for infrastructure and hopefully attract more investors along the way.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Jordan’s First Credit Bureau]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ahmad-amoudi-general-manager-crif-jordan]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>October 2018 marked two years for CRIF Jordan. What have been your focus and main achievements thus far?</h4><p>The Credit Bureau Law was passed in 2010 in Jordan, making it possible to establish a credit bureau. Since the law mandated that banks join the credit bureau once it was up and running our focus in the first year was on getting banks into compliance. The second year was about bringing into the credit bureau the non-bank financial institutions, which is all the lenders in the financial sector that are not obligated to join. The efforts were highly focused on adding value to the credit bureau by having more members outside of the banking sector. In 2018, we focused on the leasing and microfinance sectors, as well as insurance companies and telecoms. We have succeeded in engaging seven out of eight microfinance institutions who are members of the MFIs network “Tanmeya." Telecoms are extremely important and we hope that they will be joining very soon. If you follow the Doing Business report which is published annually by the World Bank, Jordan receives a rating (in the getting credit section) that is highly dependent on the credit bureau coverage. The data that comes from these entities is important to us, and it improves access to finance, especially for non-bankable people and small entrepreneurs. Currently we have 53 members in the Credit Bureau, 25 are banks, while 28 are non-bank members from across all the different sectors.</p><h4>What role does digitalization play in CRIF, and which innovations are you focusing on?</h4><p>Financial institutions nowadays are competing for customers through innovation. One of which is offering and processing loans online in a digital format. As well, the Central Bank of Jordan is making efforts to promote digital finance. We are working with banks to ensure that they are working digitally with us rather than printing and processing reports. Basically, we are offering our service in a digital format (application to application-A2A) and supporting the banks to adopt and integrate into their systems, that is in addition to introducing other services that would support the digitization process such as the bureau score. Through A2A and bureau score, banks can streamline the entire process of the application, credit risk assessment, and then loan origination and disbursement. It increases the competitiveness of the banks, speeds up the process, removes subjectivity, and gives consumers the opportunities to shop around. We are working with the World Bank on a Digital Lending Platform project for energy efficiency and renewable energy loans specifically. It is a digital platform that allows you to shop around for energy efficient products. After the product is selected, you can apply for a loan where all the banks are already on that platform. You can then get pre-approved by several banks and select which one you want to work with based on the terms offered. World Bank is planning to implement this project during 2019.</p><h4>Are there services you are planning to expand?</h4><p>When CRIF applied for the license as the country's first credit bureau, we agreed with Central Bank of Jordan on multiple services to be introduced over five years. That is the natural evolution of any credit bureau; it starts with reports, then scoring, and then other value-added services. We are now in the process of getting our scoring service approved by our regulator so we can launch it early 2019. Banks are ready and waiting for it too, we hope to be receiving the approval soon. In 2018, we received approval from CBJ on a list of additional services that we aim to introduce to the Jordanian market. These are not value-added services, but complementary services such as business information reports for institutions to be able to pull on local and non-local companies, which is also valuable for import and export operators. We will also be producing a public information report, which is information gathered from public sources and consolidated in one report. If you need to inquire about the general behavior of a client from noncredit standpoint, you can look it up there. We are also planning to introduce a service called Legal Entity Identifier in which we act as a Local Operating Unit issuing IDs to companies using the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation system which companies can use to identify themselves globally. We are also looking at introducing a blockchain based identity verification for individuals using distributed ledger technology, which offers identities for individuals that can be used globally. We aim to create a digital wallet that contains a lot of information from authenticated sources. If you want to buy something online or sign up for classes at a university, as well as do taxes or register a vehicle, for example, everything is there in that wallet. It begins with a digital identity for that person and then uploading data to it to get in control of releasing the information to any source globally. All these projects are in the pipeline ready to come online one at a time. Some of the services are sequential, and we have to offer one before we can move to another. Others are more independent like blockchain identity and legal identifier. We also have another service called SkyMinder, which is a global business information report on companies around the world which we will make it available in Jordan. We will make it available in Jordan so that institutions can inquire about companies in other countries.</p><h4>What is your outlook going into 2019?</h4><p>I am optimistic. The way we look at it, we want to show our older members how much effort we have been putting in to bring more value to them. Second, we want to extract more value out of the data that we have, and scoring is a part of that, as are the value-added services. Third, we want to present some of the services that have been approved and introduce them within the next year or two. We want to focus on the retailer side and include them into our platform. There is a part of the market that is in the shadows still, and we can reveal it. We believe we play an important role in bringing all of these people and sectors together. We do feel that we are in a hurry; we have been talking about the credit bureau since 1989, but we only launched two years ago. We are satisfied in terms of go live speed, bringing services to life in a short period of time and working with the contributors to improve data quality. To that end, we also believe that the work done by Crif Jordan and the bureau members has amounted to a an excellent job as the hit rate reached 78% within the first two years of operation, which means that out of 100 people you may inquire about, you will find the information you are looking for 78% of the time. And that is a very good rate. We hope to reach 80-82% by the time we engage all the rest of the sectors in Jordan. The higher the hit rate, the higher the chance of people accessing finance, as long as they have good credit. Even though the economy is weak and consumer confidence is low, one of the things I am optimistic about has to do with the borders between Jordan and neighboring countries such as Iraq and Syria. We will soon resume export and import with them and banks and merchants have to be ready.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>QIB has received for the six-consecutive year the “Islamic Bank of the Year-Qatar" award by The Banker, part of the Financial Times Group. What does this recognition reflect?</h4><p>Being awarded the “Best Islamic Bank of the Year" from The Banker for the sixth-consecutive year reflects the efforts and hard work of every single individual working for Qatar Islamic Bank. This continual success is a result of the support of our Board of Directors and the focused implementation of our business strategy. There are many other factors that have led to this recognition; QIB's major contribution to Qatar's financial sector, the government's commitment to diversify the local economy and develop a strong private sector, QIB's leadership stand in the provision of Sharia Compliant banking services, and the commitment and dedication of our teams to each one of our customers. Due to these factors QIB has doubled in size in the past five years. Our assets that were worth QAR73.2 billion in 2012 reached QAR150 billion by end-2017 and as a result, we are now holding approximately 12% of the total banking assets in Qatar, making us Qatar's second largest bank. During the same period, we have also outperformed the market in terms of profitability growth, having grown with a CAGR of 14.1% for the last five years. This growth trajectory continues into 2018 as we have announced a strong 13.8% net profit growth as of June 2018. At the same time, we are closely managing the ratio of non-performing financing assets to total financing assets, which at 1.2% in 2017, were one of the lowest in the industry. Such initiatives reflect the quality of the bank's financing assets portfolio and its effective risk management framework. Furthermore, the award reflects our leadership position in terms of Sharia compliant banking; QIB the first and largest Islamic bank in Qatar with a current market share of 42.3% in Islamic assets.</p><h4>How is QIB working to increase banking culture in Qatar?</h4><p>QIB is constantly evolving and promoting Qatar's banking culture. During the last few years, we have introduced banking propositions specifically designed to address the financial needs of untapped or underserved market segments. I am referring to the introduction of Aamaly, our SME value proposition, which offers a comprehensive bundle of products and services tailored to the needs of this segment of companies, depending on their size, life cycle, and area of business activity.  Furthermore, we have introduced an online Wages Protection System (WPS), meaning that our corporate customers have an easy, fully automated, and efficient way to pay monthly salaries to their entire workforce. Equally important, our banking package for women is offering dedicated channels of service, personalized attention, and customized offers. We have also introduced products supporting parents to secure their child's financial future, such as the “Walady" education plan, which is a long-term savings and investment plan coupled with Takaful protection for the parent, and a “Children Saving account." Furthermore, we have recently signed an exclusive agreement with INJAZ Qatar, a leading non-profit organization focused on youth economic empowerment, to sponsor and co-run a three-year financial literacy program for high schools and universities in Qatar. The program, entitled “How Money Works," is a five-hours training with interactive and engaging sessions tailored specifically for high school students and university freshmen. The first course will be delivered in October, and we will offer the program to 1,250 university and high school students over the next three years. To achieve this, we have identified a large pool of QIB expert staff who is committed and excited to deliver.</p><h4>How does QIB work to attract both Sharia compliant sensitive customers and conventional customers?</h4><p>Today, we are at a stage where we compete with all banks across all segments. As is the case with the majority of Islamic banks, during the last years we have been simplifying our processes, introducing new innovative products, and offering competitive pricing. I can say with confidence that our offering today is at least at par, if not better in specific areas, to any of our competitors. Those changes are coupled with highly educated and competent employees who are there to serve and offer advice to our customers. A key reason for attracting new customers, even ones that have not used an Islamic bank previously, is the significant progress we have achieved in the past couple of years regarding digital and technological advancements. We are constantly investing on this front, as we have realized that the Qatari market and our customers' expectations, following the global trend, are being driven by technological advancements. As a result, we enhanced our online presence by introducing a new mobile banking application which offers enhanced functionality, easy to use screens, and simple navigation, eliminating the need for our customers to visit a branch for the vast majority of their financial needs.</p><h4>How do you expect the market share of Islamic Banking to develop in Qatar's banking sector? </h4><p>Islamic banking is a growing sector in Qatar. QIB, being the first Islamic bank in Qatar, has shown impressive growth and progress over the years. Over the past decade, the regulatory authorities have enacted several changes to further improve governance standards in Islamic financial services. From their side, Islamic banks in Qatar have recorded significant achievements. Recent investments and focus on innovation, technology, and people have allowed us to introduce advanced products, efficient processes, and competitive pricing. As a result, the current share of Islamic banking assets in the local banking sector accounts for quarter of the total banking assets, while the share of deposits is 26% (as of June 2018). Based on that Qatar's Islamic banking sector will keep on playing a vital role in the future. Going forward, the operating environment in Qatar is supportive to continued growth for the banking sector with the real GDP growth forecast for 2018 one of the highest in the region. Qatar's economy has been enriched with different investors taking interest in the country due to 2022 World Cup and a number of billion-dollar mega projects related to the National Vision 2030. The economic diversification, strengthening foreign investments, and upgrade of Qatar's financial capabilities are key factors pointing to further domestic business growth and opportunities for all banks in Qatar.</p><h4>Fitch Ratings has upgraded QIB outlook to “Stable." What have been the contributing factors to this decision?</h4><p>International financial credit rating agencies such as Fitch and Moody's have upgraded ratings of Qatari financial institutions and changed their outlook from negative to stable as an act of reassurance to global investor's growing confidence in Qatar's economy. Moody's recently affirmed QIB's deposit ratings to A1 with a “stable" outlook, Fitch affirmed QIB at 'A' with a stable outlook, S&amp;P affirmed the bank's credit rating at 'A-', and CI affirmed QIB's Financial Strength Rating (FSR) at 'A'. These ratings reflect QIB's strong and well-established franchise in Qatar. As per the analysis of the rating agencies, the upgrades factor our adequate profitability, sound asset-quality metrics, satisfactory capital ratios and sufficient liquid assets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[chris-lu-ceo-huawei-portugal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Huawei's main operations and business lines in Portugal?</h4><p>Portugal was one of the first countries for Huawei when it entered Europe. In 2005, we built Huawei's first 3G mobile network in Europe, in Madeira. Afterward, we continued to support the telecom operators to build 4G &amp; 4.5G and Fiber-To-The-Home networks, as well as submarine cables providing best-in-class telecommunications service to Portuguese consumers and Enterprises. In the future, we will work on a connected intelligent world with 3 features: All Things Sensing (sensing the physical world, mapping it to digital signals); All Things Connected (all data will go online); All Things Intelligent (Big data and AI will power our new applications, making all things intelligent). These advances will not be possible without leading ICT technologies, ICT infrastructure will be the foundation of our future intelligent world. This is where Huawei seeks to add value.</p><h4>What are your strategies to maintain Huawei's leading position in the smartphone sector?</h4><p>In 2018H1, Huawei shipped 95 million units globally, and we are now in the top two position for global market. In Portugal, we have reached top one for several months. The rapid growth in our market share comes from our strong innovation in new technologies. Huawei is a technology company that invests heavily in R&amp;D: globally, we have 180,000 employees and almost half are involved in R&amp;D. Huawei spends more than 10% of its total revenue on R&amp;D globally every year (over the last 10 years Huawei invested more than USD60 billion). In 2017, we were listed as one of the European top 10 industrial R&amp;D investors.</p><h4>Huawei will launch the MateBook series in Portugal. What are the highlights of this product, and what are your expectations from the launch?</h4><p>Traditionally, the laptop business is a ready sales business because there is already enough competition; however, when we entered this segment, we brought in many new ideas and innovations because Huawei is an expert in connectivity and the cloud. We have given the laptop business a new concept. The MateBook X is a powerful laptop that also has an elegant appearance and excellent features. It is extremely slim and has a long battery life, making it extremely convenient for business people.</p><h4>Can you provide further details on Huawei's project with Altice to deploy 5G networks in Portugal?</h4><p>5G is a hot topic. Over the past few decades, we mainly sought to improve connectivity between people to people in the 2G, 3G, and 4G eras. With 5G, we are now extending that connectivity to machine to machine. This will bring significant changes in the way we live and work. 5G will bring ultra-high speed up to 20Gbps.  The ultra-low latency will enable concepts such as autonomous driving. It will also allow us to connect millions of devices. However, it is important for the entire ecosystem to work together in creating a 5G environment. This includes not only telecom operators, solution providers like Huawei and governmental entities like the Portuguese regulatory authority, ANACOM, as well as all different vertical and industries partners. Many enterprises will be able to combine their industry knowledge and data with ICT to reshape the way they produce and deliver their services. We are already working with our partners in Portugal and have launched the world's first narrow-band IoT smart meter in the utilities segment. We are also working on smart water meters, smart parking, smart agriculture, smart waste management, etc,. All these require an extremely fast 5G infrastructure network first, as well as excellent collaboration in the whole ecosystem.</p><h4>Are you partnering with Portuguese companies to develop your smart solutions?</h4><p>Yes; for example, the world's first narrow-band IoT smart meter is a design collaboration between Huawei and Janz, a Portuguese meter company that has many years of experience in the power meter field. Now using Huawei's IoT smart chip, meters can be connected to service providers like EDP. They can constantly transmit power usage data and detect any power failures; therefore, the service provider can manage the energy supply in the most efficient way. All this came from the innovation we did with our local partners. We have connectivity and cloud experts, and we need to work with partners that have an expertise and experience in other industries, such as utilities, manufacturing, transportation, tourism, or others. It requires a great deal of collaboration in the whole ecosystem to make these ideas work. For example, at the moment all cities worldwide, are becoming smart and embracing a digital society to drive economic competitiveness and sustainability for the future. The digital platform will be the engine powering the smart city development by enabling the integration of Big data, Cloud, Edge computing, AI, and IoT technologies which are the foundation of a smart city.  The development of a smart city, namely the integration of all these digital technologies that improves city governance and intelligence, could be a highly complex project. However Huawei's digital platform is highly efficient and open to facilitate collaboration with our Portuguese partner's ecosystem, as it will be them to customize the 'smart brain' based on each city's different development requirements. Huawei Portugal is committed to bringing digital to every person, home, and organization to create a fully connected and intelligent world. This is Huawei's main ambition. To do this, we are cooperating with all our partners, and with effort by the industry, we can truly achieve this goal in the future.</p><h4>Huawei has a program called Seeds for the Future. What is this program about, and what have the results been to date?</h4><p>Portugal has an open environment, where the government encourages innovation and the development of technology. There is a start-up spirit here. Huawei is a member of the Industry 4.0 Program initiated by the government, and we are constantly contributing innovations and ideas to it. The development of ICT requires young talent, and we have been contributing significantly to the training and development of talent in Portugal. In the past, we did the E-Escola program, bringing internet into schools. We also did FCCM, a national transmission project connecting major Portuguese universities. Our Smart Bus also went to different cities delivering basic ICT training to more than 4,000 students. For our Seeds for the Future program, every year we bring some of the top Portuguese university students in the ICT field to our headquarters for intensive training. They have the chance to get experience in the world's top laboratories and speak with the world's top engineers. We hope these students will be the seeds for future ICT development in Portugal.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE is ranked 12th globally in terms of FDI between 2017 and 2019. What contributed to its high position in global FDI rankings?</h4><p>The UAE maintains continuous efforts to ease the process of setting up and doing business. As a nation, we have relentlessly sought to improve procedures to access credit locally, reduce bureaucratic interruptions, and launch processes that improve transparency. Such meticulous strategies have contributed to our high position in the global FDI rankings and will continue to do so. Sharjah seeks to become the SME and start-up capital of the region. The SME segment currently contributes 60% of the nation's federal non-oil GDP, a figure that the UAE Ministry of Economy wants to raise to 70% by 2021 through diversifying into new and innovative sectors. More importantly, our leadership is issuing numerous new initiatives and regulations to support the growth of foreign investments across several sectors across the UAE. The UAE President, His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, has announced the immediate effect of the game-changing UAE investment law, which aims to promote and develop the country's investment environment. The new law will consolidate the country's investment promotion agencies (IPA) and is expected to attract increased FDI in line with national development policies. FDI inflows in the UAE were valued at USD11 billion in 2017, accounting for 22% of total flow to the Middle East and North Africa region.</p><h4>How have free zones contributed to promoting this investment climate?</h4><p>Sharjah's investment market is not only expanding but is also highly diversified, and the opportunities behind communicating and promoting such economic benefits provide a wide range of possibilities. State entities are still encouraged to create innovations and solutions to further promote the existing and growing investment potential of Sharjah, such as establishing free zones for businesses. In 2017, the government established Sharjah Publishing City, a tax-free zone with modern infrastructure and services. This was the fourth free zone in the Emirate, after Hamriyah Free Zone, Sharjah Airport International Free zone, and Sharjah Media City. Whether it is a question of facilitation or viable investment opportunities, Sharjah is well equipped. The oil and gas sector contributes less than 6% to GDP, and no individual sector accounts for more than 20%. The four largest sectors are manufacturing at 16.9% of GDP, real estate at 13%, wholesale and retail trade at 12.8%, and financial services at 10.3%.</p><h4>Sharjah has been growing ties with Asian nations, such as India and South Korea. What do such developments say about the changing focus in international relations for Sharjah?</h4><p>Sharjah has always maintained a robust profile of international relations and will continue to do so. India and UAE are working together to use technology to improve government and governance, and the recent MoU further facilitates that process. Trade between India and the GCC has risen by 49% YoY over the previous decade, according to Dubai's Department of Economic Development. This was the highest growth rate among the region's major trading partners, with imports from India rising by 39%. In addition, the first Korean hospital, Sejong General Hospital, will be established in Sharjah by REI's Haewon Medical Foundation. In 2018, our office participated in three globally leading investment events in China as well, where common investment and business interests were discussed. We also organized the Sharjah-ASEAN Business Roundtable. Economic growth happens organically when nations collaborate on skills. There is a wide spectrum of technological advances occurring, and each nation offers its expertise. The only way to advance is via collaboration.</p><h4>When it comes to technology, what are the latest achievements at Invest in Sharjah on this front?</h4><p>The fourth edition of our business forum, “Shaping the Future of Economies," will harness developments and ideas we need to adopt during the fourth industrial revolution and critically analyze and identify leading technologies that nations such as the UAE can use to position itself at a more competitive advantage globally. Invest in Sharjah enjoys a strong research team that has studied various sectors, markets, and global economic challenges and brought together a number of different case studies on this topic. Our objective behind organizing the forum is to create and promote a global platform to address the most essential topics and challenges in our global economic markets, and to continue in positioning Sharjah as a central hub for organizing and hosting global economic conferences, summits, and expos that address a variety of topics and sectors.</p><h4>Looking ahead, what else is on the agenda for Invest in Sharjah?</h4><p>Invest in Sharjah will implement new integrated solutions to further improve its services to investors in Sharjah. We are currently undergoing preparations for major developments across Sharjah's business and social infrastructure. Earlier in 2018, we announced the plan to establish the Sharjah Investors Center that offers world-class services and high-end technologies, which will not only enhance economic growth but also facilitate business procedures. We will also conduct more international visits, engage in global and local partnerships, and organize international roadshows and seminars to accentuate Sharjah's potential as a prominent investment destination.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What new projects or future growth are you expecting to come from the MoU Shell recently signed with the government of Oman?</h4><p>Today we are looking towards a new chapter in our partnership with the Sultanate of Oman. As part of Oman's new strategy for gas, we are proud to have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Government of Oman that was announced earlier this year. It covers upstream gas exploration and development, gas-to-liquids (GTL), LNG and renewable energies. We hope this MoU leads to exploring and developing important new sources of gas. And if so, it will pave the way to monetising the country's natural gas sources. In particular, I am referring to GTL. As we know from Shell's experience in this space, developing a GTL project is highly complex and investment-intensive, but the end result is worth it. Shell's GTL technology converts natural gas — the cleanest-burning fossil fuel — into high-quality liquid products that would otherwise be made from crude oil. These products include transport fuels, motor oils and the ingredients for everyday necessities like plastics, detergents and cosmetics. GTL products are crystal-clear, colourless and odourless. They contain almost none of the impurities — sulphur, aromatics and nitrogen — that are found in crude oil. Today, GTL products are used in airplanes, cars and even Formula 1's Ferrari cars. GTL in Oman would generate valuable revenue and create wider social and economic opportunities for Omanis in the process. The government of Oman has rightly placed emphasis on new energy projects that focus on economic growth and job creation, on developing Omani talent and contributing to In-Country Value. Our company is keen to build on the things we have achieved with our partners in Oman. Throughout our history, we have experienced how strong partnerships are the bedrock for successful projects, benefiting our partners and shareholders alike. Oman is no exception and the accomplishments of Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) and Oman LNG speak for themselves. They are world class companies and we are proud to be part of them.  </p><h4>How is shell using enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies within Oman? </h4><p>Our 34% stake in PDO is our biggest involvement in EOR, and we have had a long strategic alliance with PDO on EOR technologies. We have strategic alliances on a range of technical issues, but EOR is the centerpiece. PDO is interesting because it has chemical, thermal  and gas EOR. Oman is the only country that is using all three techniques at a full scale. There are another 19 or 20 pilot projects that PDO is working on, and we are helping with several of those. We are now looking at ways to make these techniques cheaper so that EOR technologies become more robust in periods of low oil prices. Soon, we will operate in Oman ourselves, with our 50% stake in block 42, but at the moment we are only involved in non-operated joint ventures.</p><h4>How does Shell support efforts to improve production efficiency and cost efficiency within Oman?</h4><p>This is essentially the core purpose of our work in Oman. We are trying to enhance the abilities of our joint ventures and make them even more world class organizations than they already are. We do that by leveraging our global expertise and by learning from our partners, so it is a collaborative relationship. Our interactions cover the areas of people, technology, processes, and more.  All in all, we bring in our Shell expertise and share knowledge with our joint ventures, and where necessary we support them in delivering improvement programs.</p><h4>What is Shell's strategy for reaching Omanization targets?</h4><p>We fully support the increase in employment prospects for Omanis. One of the key drivers for putting together our proposals for the projects that were mentioned in the MoU was employment creation, and we want to maximize the number of Omani jobs. That is our objective, which is why we proposed a GTL plant and extending the longevity of Oman LNG beyond 2025. It is also why we are looking at renewables as an area that is particularly well suited to Omani SMEs. Shell Oman Marketing Company has been awarded for its Omanisation efforts, and they are close to 90% Omanisation rate, putting them way beyond the targets established for fuel marketing companies. In oil and gas sector, the Omanisation target is 90% and both PDO and Oman LNG are on their way to hitting that. The potential downside for PDO is that they might lose experienced expatriate hires; therefore, we are focusing on a good set of programs for transitioning people into positions of technical independence. What I like about the Omanization targets is that they really focus on talent development. It is a pipeline, and you need to start the pipeline early if you are going to get the talent that you need at the top. We have also been training SMEs on how to build their own companies and increase their employment numbers as a direct result of the contact they have with us.</p><h4>How has Shell's Solar into Schools initiative impacted the schools it targets? </h4><p>We developed the project in 2015 as our Gift to the Nation. The first five schools are up and running, and soon we will be able to find out exactly how much the program contributed to the energy requirements of the schools. One of the great upsides of the program has been helping the Authority for Electricity Regulation introduce regulations that allow people to feed electricity back into the grid from rooftop solar, or what is now called “Sahim" initiative. Though the solar panels do not necessarily meet the schools' daily energy requirements in full, the fact that they pump electricity into the grid during holidays reduces energy bills in the long-term; we will have the exact results of these programs very soon. There are another four schools in the pipeline. Reverse metering and other new advantageous energy usage schemes are key in allowing schools to put energy back into the system.</p><h4>What are Shell's long-term commitments to Oman?</h4><p>We have plans in place for 20-30 years. We are proud of our history in Oman, and completely committed to the country's future. We see the new business in block 42, the upstream gas and related projects in GTL, and renewables as setting a growth agenda for Shell in Oman. This growth agenda is aligned and integrated with Oman's own growth projections and perspectives.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Who was your target demographic when designing the Ghadeer Parks Townhouses and Juman two marina apartments?</h4><p>It is no secret that we hold 75% of the market share of freehold sold properties in Oman, such strong performance could not have been achieved without deep understanding and meeting of customer needs. Ghadeer parks townhouses target the growing young families with its three bedroom homes, which includes a uniquely designed courtyard where the family can enjoy an indoor park and creating a fun and memorable experience every day. With the Ghadeer precinct itself, we will be creating a place where residents can not only live an urban lifestyle but enjoy the unique spaces that allow for social interaction between residents as well as the opportunity for a healthier and active life. It will include a central park with a running creek, toddlers park, a community hub, masjid, community pools and a proposed international school which makes it a prime example of our commitment at Al Mouj Muscat to provide both residents and local community unparalleled experiences. Juman two is our most recent marina front apartment product release, and it comes in line with the increasing demand we are witnessing for this exclusive waterfront properties in Oman. The apartments have been designed to augment the lifestyle of the residents. The project offers luxury marina living along with exclusive finishes and world class amenities. Juman Two is the reflection of what it means to live in the most exclusive address in Oman.</p><h4></h4><h4><br></h4><h4>What was the vision for Marsa Plaza?</h4><p>Marsa Plaza is the first public square built by a private developer in Oman, it is masterpiece in urban design, with traditional Omani architectural influences. As you know public spaces play a significant role in the social life of communities and this modern interpretation of a town square gives residents and visitors a unique space to gather and enjoy a world-class lifestyle experience.  So with no surprise to us Marsa plaza has quickly became a perfect setting and platform for Oman's diverse artists to showcase their works, sharing and celebrating our rich Omani culture with both visitors and residents. In addition to culturally connecting people, I believe a year-round public outdoor space like ours also encourages healthier lifestyles and promote happiness and more quality time spent together amongst families and friends. Moving forward, we are going to anchor it with two international F&amp;B outlets &amp; small local SMEs by offering various new kiosk concepts; therefore, we can further enrich the experience.</p><h4>How is Al Mouj Muscat planning to expand its hotel capacity?</h4><p>Al Mouj Muscat is an Integrated Tourism Complex (ITC). The tourism aspect is thus an integral part and is one of the main reasons the government has been establishing the ITC projects to unlock the huge potential of Oman's Tourism industry. We have aggressive plans in the tourism sector and are located at the heart of Muscat and close to the newly opened state of the art Muscat International Airport. On hotels front, we have successfully opened Mysk Al Mouj by Shaza a 4-star with 190 room hotel in December 2017 and Kempinski Muscat a 5-star with 310 keys in March 2018. We are currently building Rayhaan by Rotana, 4-star hotel and service apartments with 255 keys and will be completed in the next two years. We have concluded two major hotel transactions, one is beach front and the other with golf views which will be announced to the public soon. This will take total committed hotel keys at Al Mouj Muscat to around 1,500 keys and beyond this we will be adding marina and golf views hotels to meet the market demand, so stay tuned to the exciting upcoming announcements!</p><h4>How is Al Mouj Muscat working to fulfill the demand in the sports tourism segment?</h4><p>We have managed to deliver an internationally awarded tourism infrastructure such as Al Mouj Golf and Al Mouj Marina. These facilities in Al Mouj Muscat have enabled the country to increase in touristic appeal and allow it to host international sport competitions such as the America Cup, Extreme Sailing, and European Golf Tour to name a few.  We are also working now on the third edition of Al Mouj Muscat marathon and expect the 2019 edition to host 10,000 runners, this ties very well with our aim to promote a healthy lifestyle. Similarly, we are working with Muscat Municipality to promote “Tour of Oman", a highly successful international cycling event which highlight Oman touristic appeal by its worldwide TV and media coverage.</p><h4>How does Al Mouj Muscat plan to use the remaining balance of its land?</h4><p>I joined the company in 2007 and was very excited to kick start this project with the rest of the team, we are proud of what we have achieved till date but the best is yet to come! and our excitement and ambition has grown higher.  We will continue to use the principles of place-making and customer experience to look beyond the bricks and mortar, investing in natural landscape, open spaces and social activities to offer balanced community living, crafted around the needs of our customers and nurturing those simple, human activities, that bring people together to celebrate life to its fullest.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<title><![CDATA[5,000 New Jobs in Oil & Gas]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ibrahim-al-harthi-managing-director-takatuf]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Takatuf involved in helping the oil and gas industry reach its target of supplying 5,000 new jobs to Omanis?</h4><p>Takatuf has been an ambassador for a new business belief where human capital is not just about investing in people and training them, but seeing them as strategic drivers of change. Takatuf was formed as a people consulting company five years ago, and in very short time, we have established a reputation for providing sound strategic thinking and effective human capital solutions — from consulting, assessment, coaching, learning and development to training institutes. In this regard, we have deployed a number of these solutions to help many organizations in the energy sector in Oman achieve their hiring targets of Omanis as set by the Government. With Omanization high on the agenda, one of the key challenges that companies in Oman face today is to meet the targets whilst being mindful of making it sustainable and effective. Omanization is not just about numbers, but about finding the right people for the right roles and adding value to people's functions rather than burdening the system. At Takatuf we have identified two distinct types of Omanization. One, linked to growth and job creation as a result of progress. Second, for organizations that are not looking at an aggressive evolution curve, the challenge is to identify functions and roles that qualified Omani nationals can take replacing existing resources.</p><h4>What training do new Omani employees need?</h4><p>One of the core themes formulated in the Vision 2020 was the development of human resources and capabilities of Omani nationals to keep pace with technical development, manage the changes therein with efficiency and be prepared for the dynamic domestic and global environment. The government has taken a number of significant steps in that direction and today the results are visible for all to see. Being part of the Oman Oil group, Takatuf shares this vision and national agenda. Takatuf is not just a consulting company, but a strategic investor in the human capital requirements for the nation. We have partnered with Petrofac, a world-leading oilfield service provider with a 35-year track record in the development of training and competence programs and facilities to set up Takatuf Petrofac Oman Institute (TPO), a new purpose-build training Institute in Oman. TPO will deliver a range of world-class, internationally accredited technical training programs, tailored to meet the needs of the industry Similarly, we have partnered with Schlumberger, another Oil &amp; Gas giant to set up Oman Institute for Oil &amp; Gas (instOG), a premier state-of-the-art institute dedicated to training and development of individuals in the upstream Oil &amp; Gas industry. Aside of these business focused people development programs, Takatuf has also established a successful national initiative, the Takatuf Scholars Program, which is aimed at identifying and building the next generation of young Omani leaders through a global academic enrichment program. To date, the program has helped provide close to 350 graduates with over 100 of them receiving international scholarships.</p><h4>How does the public sector compare to the private sector in Omanization advances?</h4><p>In well-established, government-owned organizations, Omanization is not a major issue; in fact, Omanis lead at all ranks. And it is working in these companies because they have put in enough effort to develop their people and make them ready to take those roles. However, the reality in some sectors in the private sector, is not the same. The Institutes that we built are expected to play a major role in providing highly qualified, competent, and job-ready local workforce who can fill the gap in the private sector as well as grow Omanization targets especially in highly skilled jobs.</p><h4>What gap do your training institutes fill?</h4><p>instOG and TPO are supporting the Sultanate of Oman's vision to secure a skilled, competent and job ready workforce for the oil and gas, energy, and related industries sectors. It is of strategic importance to the economic future of Oman. These institutes will ensure that all of its graduates meet this criteria and, in doing so, they will fulfill its mission in supporting the future workforce demands of the industry. The global knowledge economy is no longer a milestone, but a dynamic, continuous, and evolving journey. Oman has made giant leaps in the last decade to not just catchup but be a torchbearer in the region for scientific research, technology, and innovation. Over the last few years, there has been a focus on developing public-private partnerships, which is expected to support a wider innovation agenda. Initiatives such as Innovation Park Muscat, the campus that hosts instOG, and KOM that houses our other institute TPO are great examples of Oman's achievements in this regard. Hence, in our institutes we have made major investments in technology enhanced digital and blended learning platforms that cater to, and keep pace with, the modern styles of learning, providing students with an immersive learning experience. This innovative approach to learning is the first of its kind here in Oman. Our integration of eLearning and virtual and augmented reality technologies, allows us to actively engage the next generation of young learners, whilst ensuring these new technologies complement the more traditional 'hands-on' training methodologies.</p><h4>In which sectors of the economy outside of oil and gas is there a need for training programs?</h4><p>As part of its economic diversification plan, the Government has identified a number of key non-oil sectors, to focus on in the next phase including tourism, mining, construction, logistics and manufacturing. Many of these sectors will require a competent local workforce to lead so they can achieve high Omanization targets at all levels. And hence, the importance of developing comprehensive solutions involving designing effective training programs, changing mindset towards work and, in some of sectors, a regulation change.</p><h4>What are Takatuf's objectives for the next 12 months?</h4><p>While large consulting firms traditionally approached people solutions with a clinical precision, Takatuf believes that cultural understanding is at the core of people processes, and we base our business model and culture on this pillar. We are a home-grown brand and deeply insightful of Oman's reality, which makes our offerings more persuasive and ultimately add value to people, business and the nation as a whole. We've delivered impactful solutions so far and we will continue to develop our business based on this belief.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[SD38.96 million invested in 2017]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[abdullah-bin-said-al-badri-ceo-muscat-electricity-distribution-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does MEDC work with power generation companies to prepare for increased electricity demand?</h4><p>There are different parts of the industry that play different roles in terms of accommodating growth and demand. In our context, we have a three-year business planning cycle based on the information received from distribution companies, and we analyze the trends in demands, segmentally and holistically. That drives our investment plans, also reflected in annual three-year execution plans. Thus far, within the context of MEDC, we are continuing our capital investment program, which in 2017 was close to USD38.96 million that we invested to accommodate the growth in customer base and demands to enhance the reliability of supply of our system.</p><h4>What strategies are in place to manage peak demand?</h4><p>Continuing only to invest in the capacity of generation, transmission, and distribution systems is not a sustainable model, and policymakers and the industry have realized this. There was a reform in the tariff structure that will have a direct impact on the behavior of major customers. The new cost-reflective tariffs provide an incentive to consume electricity during non-peak hours. There are also new mandates in terms of the efficiency of the air conditioners that come into the country, and certain labeling requirements that mandate only high efficient devices. These reforms started in 2017 and will gain momentum going forward. It will not only help manage the network but also the seasonal impact.</p><h4>What other challenges do Muscat and Oman pose for electricity distribution and what strategies do you have to overcome them?</h4><p>Optimization of the existing infrastructure is the focus right now within our context. The other challenge is Oman's geography. On the Indian Ocean side of the Arabian Peninsula, we see a trend of cyclones that continues to increase; we have experienced three cyclones since 2017, and each impacted our infrastructure in different regions. In terms of capability, organizationally and structurally, we have already moved in terms of contingency plans to ensure greater resilience and move forward in the restoration processes. The results of this planning were evident during the Mekunu cyclone, when the entire country mobilized and every sector helped in a short period of time. Cybersecurity risks to infrastructure have also become important for the industry. We need to strengthen our systems to prevent cyberattacks.There are major reviews every three to four years, and we raise the bar every time in terms of customer service and security of supply.</p><h4>What technologies can make the distribution system more effective?</h4><p>In the last few years, MEDC has invested in systems such as a smart metering as one of the primary building blocks to improve the system. Smart metering is mandatory for customers using cost-reflective tariffs, which are commercial or government consumers. We started with high-value customers and are now in the process of taking it even further to the second segment of customers, those who can potentially move to the cost-reflective tariff. The realm of smart metering is evolving, and we will learn as we roll out how to get the best of this information to the benefit of customers and us. We have an integrated system that looks at the demand side and sees what is required on the supply side. We have also invested in geographic information systems and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and now have better control over our assets. There is automated reading infrastructure and all the components of the smart grid, and we can learn from the big data that we have available for the first time. We want to get the best out of those systems and build information to help us make better use of information to improve customer relations and manage our infrastructure.</p><h4>What are MEDC's objectives over the next 12 months?</h4><p>MEDC is here to serve customers, so they are our biggest priority in our objectives in terms of reliability of supply, connectivity for new customers, and making it easy for customers to pay their bills or contact us through electronic means. We also need to maximize the benefits to our shareholders; we have capital investments in the range of USD103.9 million to cater for growth in highly developing areas around Muscat. We have partnerships with our contractors to make sure we are effective. We will also continue our investments in upstream, in substations to ensure reliability and security standards compliance as per our license. The health and safety program to improve this culture within the organization is also of highest importance to MEDC.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[70 Years in Oman]]></title>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much demand has the HSBC seen for its bank guarantee products?</h4><p>HSBC is focused on larger local and international players for its bank guarantee products, as many of them require performance and guarantee bonds. In the sectors we choose to compete in we have seen extremely good growth. We are not deeply entrenched in the SME sector. There is a Central Bank mandated 5% target for SME lending that few, if any bank has managed to hit so far. However, this is not because there is a shortage of cash for the SME sector here. Given that all the banks have this target and none of us have hit it, this suggests there is more money than demand. We help SMEs in other ways, such as seminars with accountants and lawyers to provide financial, legal, and accounting advice. Through our CSR initiatives, we also help some small businesses in craft industries with environmental and education issues.</p><h4>How does HSBC attempt to better reach Oman's rural or under-banked population?</h4><p>HSBC has the third broadest network across Oman. We have branches in some pretty remote places, such as towns near the Yemeni and Saudi borders, and in Haima near the oil fields. Our research concluded that younger bank customers use the ATMS and mobile, internet, and telephone banking more often. As a result, we have merged a few of our branches together because there was not as much demand for them.</p><h4>How has the market received mobile internet banking in Oman?</h4><p>Reasonably well. HSBC has had internet banking in Oman for many years. We were one of the first banks with a mobile banking app and we were the first to have an Arabic app here. Offsetting a considerable drop in manual transactions over the last two years, digital transactions have grown quickly in corporate and retail alike.</p><h4>Are there an adequate number of banks for Oman's population?</h4><p>Banking services are readily available to nearly everyone in Oman. HSBC has 300,000-400,000 clients and they are spread across the country, and is one of two or three banks that have broad networks. So if anything, Oman is over-banked—there are too many banks for the market, especially when you consider the presence of Islamic banking as well as the conventional banking sector. The number of branches across the whole country are in excess when compared to the bankable population. In terms of borrowing, most people have borrowed up to the hilt. This is why there have been discussions around several potential mergers.</p><h4>How has the Omani banking industry and HSBC been impacted by the introduction of IFRS9?</h4><p>The initial impact has been positive. IFRS9 is an attempt to produce more consistency across the banking sector. However, because of the way IFRS9 is constructed, banks can take several different approaches to running models behind it for forecasting credit losses going forward. So, there is some inconsistency in approach, which the Central Bank is aware of. At HSBC, we take a particular approach that is global and conservative because there has been some increase in our provisioning. We expect this to continue during 2018 and maybe even into 2019.</p><h4>What regulatory measures do you think could be introduced in Oman to further modernize the banking industry?</h4><p>Oman has a new executive president of the central bank; hence, time will tell what his particular focus will be. He has had discussions with us, other banks, and other regulators, and he travels a lot and is well informed and connected, so I expect there will be changes coming through, and that he will continue the path of modernization set by his predecessor. In terms of changes, the Oman Bankers Association has highlighted a number of areas where they think some relaxation might take place. One example is the interest rate cap on personal loans. The cap of 6% has been in place for six or seven years and in that time the cost of funding these loans has risen, and as a result, banks have been squeezed quite hard.</p><h4>What are your operational objectives over the next 12 months for HSBC?</h4><p>To improve the speed of processing, reduce the number of complaints, and to make more money for our shareholders. This can all be facilitated by ensuring that our systems, processes, and procedures are not only helping our clients, but are also removing frustrations for our staff to create a happy workplace. The key focus for us is how we can leverage technology and move more away from paper to digital so that we are more efficient internally.</p><h4>Would you tell us about the milestone HSBC Oman is celebrating in 2018?</h4><p>HSBC has been in Oman for 70 years, which is at east 20 years longer than any other bank. We arrived here in 1948 as the Imperial Bank of  Iran, then changed to the British Bank of the Middle East before changing to HSBC Bank Oman today. We have had many firsts in the country, including the introduction of the first ATM in Oman and the launch of the first online banking system. We have also assisted in the printing and distribution of the first Omani currency in the 1970s, which was the Saidi Rial. We have some relationships that go back to 1948. We are cognizant that it is a tremendous responsibility on our part to maintain the happiness and loyalty of our clients who comprise of all parts of the society. We are holding various celebrations in Oman to mark this milestone, but the key for us is that we have been here for 70 years and we want to be here for another 70. We value our involvement in the country; we are not here just from a profit-loss perspective, we like being part of the community.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Fiber to Oman]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[said-al-mandhari-ceo-oman-broadband-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is OBC coordinating infrastructure growth with Oman's public utilities?</h4><p>We have signed several MoUs that are focused on having better alignment to various utility providers, allowing us to be involved at the early stage of project development and consequently be a part of the major infrastructure rollout. For example, with the Public Authority for Electricity and Water, we are jointly working on a deployment of the fiber network along with water projects across Oman. This approach creates significant synergies; from one side savings are secured, while from the other, disturbance to the citizens during the construction phase is minimized.  </p><h4>Are you on track to achieve the 2020 goals for coverage in Muscat and the country as a whole?</h4><p>Within Muscat, we are positive that we are going to exceed our originally planed goals for 2020. Outside of Muscat, since our rollout depends on other utility providers, we are committed to achieve our goals but currently we can not accurately predict whether targets will be overachieved due various dependencies. Having in mind that implementation of fiber, compared to other utilities such as water is easier and quicker, our initial project timelines in some areas may be affected, but on the other hand as previously noted, that approach generates significant savings. It's is important to mention that in cases where we see that utility deployment project will be delayed beyond acceptable timeline, we are engaging into so called “stand alone“ deployment to secure fibre access to wider public within acceptable timeline.</p><h4>How does your relationship with service providers operate?</h4><p>We, as an infrastructure service provider, work under the regulation of the Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRA), from whom we have been granted a license to build and operate nation-wide passive fiber network. Our clients are three existing fixed line operators who are at the same time Internet Service Providers (ISP), as well as some government institutions.  It is important to note that we are not directly dealing with end customers, that segment is under ISPs, so we play the role of a wholesale service provider. The biggest advantage of having the open access network, used by the three ISPs is that the competition is shifted from the infrastructure to services, where it should be. The government's aim was to create an environment where the end user has better options, quality, and prices without unnecessary investment and we are happy to say that the plan works.</p><h4>How is OBC's fiber network facilitating “smart“ practices into government and industry?</h4><p>One of our main tasks is to enable the government to be “smart“, so part of our project is to directly connect the government entities with fiber optic. A good example of such initiative is the project we commenced in 2016 with ITA, to interconnect all the head offices of the government and connect them to data centers to have a parallel network dedicated to the government services. So far, we have completed about 40-50% of the work and are eyeing completion in mid-2019. In general, having in mind that 4th Industrial evolution is here, we need to plan wisely and take into consideration that Oman Broadband will be serving multiple operators as well as services and platforms related to IoT and smart applications, therefore we are building today an infrastructure that is beyond Oman's current requirements. Building this infrastructure now is much easier than thinking how to upgrade it afterwards, as it is clear the fiber is and will remain to be a crucial connectivity technology. With this approach we are directly contributing to e-Oman vision.</p><h4>How does Oman's regulatory framework support OBC's goals?</h4><p>The national broadband strategy depends on three main pillars: a) the regulation and reworking of the regulation to serve the future applications; b) stimulating the demand and c) building the new and utilizing the existing broadband infrastructure which is the directly linked with the formation and mandate of Oman Broadband Company. From the beginning, the vision of the country was clear; to build an integrated infrastructure that is set to be used by future technologies.</p><h4>What are OBC's objectives for the next 12 months?</h4><p>One of the main objectives is to fulfill our commitments regarding the roll out plans. Another objective of significant importance is to complement the missing parts of the infrastructure in the Sultanate. To that end, we have participated in the creation of a tower company along with government as well as private sector stakeholders. Our focus remains broadband infrastructure but having the tower company will complement our work and befit the country as any new player coming into the market will have the infrastructure already available. In the next 12 months, we plant to get this company up and running at full speed like Oman Broadband. We are also focusing on integrating more of our work with other government entities to create the momentum of having a solid and robust infrastructure. The idea is to follow the government's direction in empowering some of the commercial industry areas in Oman like Duqm, Salalah Free Zone, and some free zones around Sohar. The company is working hard on getting all the zones connected to high speed technology, turning them into smart industrial areas. Since being a broadband provider doesn't restrict the company from providing capacity-based infrastructure instead of dark fiber, we are working on providing this for the newcomers of smart applications.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[99.9% National Electricity Coverage]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[omar-al-wahaibi-ceo-nama-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How well positioned is Oman to meet increased power demand?</h4><p>Oman's interconnected power system is in a great position because of the way the sector is set up in terms of load, generation, and our annual plans that project increases in demand going forward. Oman Power and Water Procurement Company (OPWP) publishes seven-year statements containing its future projections that help determine when we need new generation plants. In terms of installed capacity and projects for the near future, we are doing well.</p><h4>What are the primary challenges in distributing electricity to rural parts of Oman?</h4><p>The entire country is now connected with electricity. Through the main interconnected system and the rural areas system, we have 99.9% coverage. The job is done in terms of coverage; it is now just a matter of maintaining it by ensuring we have adequate capacity in the system. The main challenge is to optimize costs in rural areas. There is a great deal of dependency on diesel for generation, and electricity companies in rural areas are working on alternative solutions. These might include the use of renewables under a hybrid model, or interconnection with the main system where it is economically feasible. However, these proposals present challenges in themselves. In the case of renewables, energy sources are not all available all of the time so it is necessary to create hybrid systems integrating renewable and conventional generation sources. And in the case of rural connections to the main system, sometimes an area is just too far away to connect, and the cost of infrastructure is not justified by the savings in diesel costs.</p><h4>Which of the Nama Group companies is most involved in the integration of renewables into the system?</h4><p>Most of Nama Group is involved in some way, though OPWP has been tasked by the government to help ensure that by 2025, 10% of the electricity consumed in Oman will be from renewables. This has given us the mandate to enhance the utilization of renewables in the grid. OPWP as the main power procurement arm in Oman has already kicked off a number of projects, and there are others in the pipeline aimed at achieving this capacity. It is doing wind and solar projects, and there is another project lined up based on obtaining energy from waste recycling. The second company focused on this agenda is the Rural Area Electricity Company (RAECO). The regulator in Oman has also introduced a scheme to encourage people to place solar panels on their rooftops. This scheme is making progress, and all our distribution companies are involved, as they are required to support people who want to install solar systems.</p><h4>What technologies are being introduced to make the distribution system more efficient?</h4><p>Our focus at the moment is on automated meter reading, such as smart meters. This is together with pre-pay meters and using IoT technology to help us with data analytics that will make the system more efficient. Smart meters are for customers who consume more than 150MW per year. This includes commercial, industrial, and government accounts, though it does not include residential accounts.</p><h4>How have the cost-reflective tariffs changed the power model in Oman?</h4><h4></h4><p>Cost-reflective tariffs have had an impact on consumers' consumption behavior. The entire purpose of the cost-reflective tariff is to reduce peak load. All utilities providers worldwide invest large sums of money to meet peak-hour demand, and if that peak demand can be lowered, it saves money and reduces the strain on the system. As a result of cost-reflective tariffs, we have already seen consumers shifting power consumption away from those times. The strategy is beginning to work, though it takes time for consumers to understand and adopt this new approach. They have to adjust their machinery and optimize their behavior to shift away from peak consumption because it now hits them economically if they consume during peak times.</p><h4>What benefits have come from the expansion of IPPs and IWPPs in Oman?</h4><p>The main benefit has been the attraction of foreign investment. Without these billions in foreign investment, the government would have to put the cash upfront to do these projects. Then, there are the benefits of efficiency and optimal designs because private operators are in it to make money so they ensure these operations are efficient. However, to maintain performance, there are penalties if they do not reach standards set by the government. We have not been disappointed, and moving forward this will be the way to go for such service.</p><h4>How does Nama Group limit interruptions to power supply?</h4><p>We want to make sure we meet demand without interruptions. We carefully monitor indications of any disruptions in public electricity supply. We also work hard to keep electricity losses in the system as low as possible, especially commercial losses. We have been driving that now for more than 10 years. We have come down from 25% losses to 8.3% today, in part because of upgrades to our systems. We have an investment program for the next three to four years for transmission and distribution activities. It is important that we are able to attract new investors to generate electricity or funds from banks and other financial institutions that can lend us part of the money we need for the further development of the electricity network in Oman.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of road infrastructure for development in Duqm?</h4><p>The road is a part of the infrastructure required for projects to come to Duqm. We almost finished of that in terms of roads, ports, and airports, and will soon complete the rest. The roads require high standards to ensure they meet future needs of heavy trucks and equipment that will move from the port to the factories in Duqm and then on to other area. The corridor infrastructure will have electricity, communications, and gas infrastructure in a common place for companies to use. In addition to infrastructure development, SEZAD's role involves supervision and licensing, and we have completed all the legislation including licensing, environment, construction permits, and registrations so that if any investor applies for a registration he will know what he needs to submit. SEZAD's third role is monitoring and compliance. We have to ensure that registered companies do business according to our rules and regulations. TATWEER, a company we own 100% of, has taken over the management part of the project and reports back to SEZAD on the situation of projects, obstacles, and other types of project management.  </p><h4>How important is air transportation for Duqm?</h4><p>Air transportation represents an important step for us. When SEZAD was established there was only one way to the area via the road, but now you can reach it by road, sea, and air. The airport's completed. There is now a daily flight, except for Friday, from Muscat to Duqm through Oman Air. transport around 25,000 tons per year. The passenger terminal have an annual capacity of 500,000 passengers.</p><h4>What efforts is SEZAD making to attract investment for fisheries in the area?</h4><p>Fisheries are important. Within our master plan we have created a fishing industry, which includes a fishery harbor and is already under construction., according to the original plan, the harbor will be ready and linked to the industrial area. A consultant has been assigned with completing a master plan for the fishery area. This is all very important, not only for the local fishing people, but also for the vessels catching in international waters that then use our fishery harbor. The company has a plan to have a fishery within Duqm so that international fishers can also make use of what they catch in international seas. In the fishing area we already have three factories in operation who buy fish from the local people.</p><h4>How important is the port's geographic position?</h4><p>Duqm is in a strategic position with open access to the Arabian Sea and close to the Indian Ocean. The port was designed because of this strategic location, which is one of the attractions and selling points we use to promote the area. Also, Oman has a good relationship with all of its neighboring countries and has established the border accordingly. Being secure is important for business.</p><h4>How important is Chinese and Indian investment to SEZAD?</h4><p>All investors are similar. We have been everywhere, whether the US, Brazil, Europe, the GCC, China or Singapore. India is close to Oman, and China has huge investment resources, not to mention that Oman is now part of China's One Belt One Road initiative. We have a successful heavy industry with an Indian investor who will start operating by beginning of next year, a fact that will attract even more Indian people to Duqm. China has become one of the developers within SEZAD and so we help them whenever they market their projects in China. We are focusing on these two markets, but still consider other countries and encourage investment from everywhere. Our area is huge, covering some 2,000km, so it is good to have competition between countries, since there is more than enough land to go around. And the Chinese projects enhance the appetite of other countries to come and do the same.</p><h4>What are SEZAD's objectives for the next five years?</h4><p>At SEZAD, we have 2,000km of land and have created a master plan of which reflecting 40% around total area. Our objective is to accommodate international and local investors. Our five-year action plan from 2018-2023 is segregated into two different parts. One is the development of the region and the other is marketing, the infrastructure is already there. The remaining 10% has been contracted out and will be complete by 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[24 Health Projects Since 2004]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-eng-saad-bin-ahmad-al-muhannadi-president-of-public-works-authority-ashghal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ashghal recently signed contracts for building six new health projects. What do these projects entail for Ashghal's involvement in the health sector?</h4><p>In line with the Qatar National Vision 2030, Ashghal's building master plan continues to focus on the development of the health sector. Ashghal has implemented 24 health projects between 2004 and 2018. In fact, during the last five years, in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health the authority has constructed double the number of health centers that were implemented in the past. We recently signed contracts for new health projects worth approximately QAR1 billion (USD274 million) that include five new health centers located in various areas and serve around 3,500 visitors per day. This is in addition to constructing the National Health Laboratories building. All our projects are implemented using international best practices. The construction criteria are set by Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS), as operational and architectural consideration are taken to accomplish a three-star environmental level in terms of energy saving and environment preservation.</p><h4>How have cost fluctuations affected Ashghal's operations after the blockade, and which countries have gained prominence as suppliers?</h4><p>Frankly, the blockade has worked to our benefit. Despite persisting challenges, we embarked on a new phase marked by acceleration in the pace of project implementation and delivery, which has resulted in robust operating and performance outcome. We have demonstrated over the past four months our success in strategic planning through managing our resources and maximizing our reliance on national resources through several initiatives. In cooperation with the concerned government entities, we have commenced initiatives that qualify and accredit Qatari factories, enlist Qatari manufacturers in Ashghal's approved supply chain, and also accredit local industrial products that meet the technical requirements, specifications, and the standard quality levels in order to enable them to supply materials for projects at the national level. Simultaneously, a strategic plan has been developed to provide other sources of building and construction material, and supplies have been provided from several countries including Oman, Turkey, India, China, and others to overcome any challenges affecting the work progress. We receive materials at an optimized cost and high quality.</p><h4>What is your approach when it comes to engaging with SMEs?</h4><p>SME contractors have been vital contributors to the construction sector. As part of our ongoing efforts to support this sector, we recently launched the small-scale contractors initiative that aims to provide local entrepreneurs with the opportunity to execute small projects that will qualify them to implement strategic projects in the future. As an initial step, we took on a large project, separated it into five smaller projects, and made these projects available to SMEs that we had not worked with before. We wanted to get new contractors into the mix and work with new people. We offer many opportunities for smaller firms to compete, which creates a valuable legacy for them moving forward. In collaboration with Qatar Development Bank, we also launched another initiative “Ta'heel“ targeted toward rehabilitation and accreditation of the existing national industrial factories. With these ongoing initiatives, Ashghal has succeeded in attracting a number of national competencies to implement Qatar projects.</p><h4>How do you work to promote sustainability in your projects?</h4><p>As part of Ashghal's strategy, the authority is committed to adopting high standards in environment protection, recycling, and sustainability across all our programs and projects. We encourage our partners to adopt stringent requirements on sustainability, which forms a critical part of selection criteria during tendering. To this effect, Ashghal is implementing GSAS standards in all its public buildings in Qatar, specifically in educational and health buildings, for which the authority in cooperation with the Gulf Organisation for Research and Development Group (GORD) has been awarded the three-star GSAS certification in design and construction. Ashghal was granted two Sustainability Awards in 2016 in health and education facilities by GORD, the first performance-based system in the MENA region. In 2018, Ashghal won the Qatar Sustainability Award for implementing GSAS in the design of its building projects in education and health sectors, in addition to being awarded the GORD Sustainability Eco Champion Award at the Sustainability Summit in Doha.- Ashghal's Doha North Sewage Treatment Works (STW) project is the first facility with comprehensive odor control system to minimize the impact on the surrounding environment. Ashghal has taken the initiative, the first of its kind in Qatar, to grow trees over approximately 12sqkm within the buffer zone surrounding the plant using treated sewage water.<br>Ashghal also has a number of sustainability initiatives including an initiative to recycle car tires and use it in the asphalt mix, which increases the elasticity and durability of the roads. Another initiative is recycling the asphalt layers and reusing it in Ashghal's projects. The authority has also started to collect the waste of excavation and concrete crushing 4 years ago and prepared a recycling plan to eliminate construction waste. Since then, we succeeded in using approximately 60 million tons of excavation waste in sand layers for some road projects.</p><h4>What is your assessment of Ashghal's investments plans in the medium term, and which sectors will be subject to further development?</h4><p>In alignment with the government's directives, Ashghal's priority and focus is on developing infrastructure to serve the residential areas and citizens' sub-divisions in all parts of the country, and opening them as per schedule and according to the required quality. Ashghal has developed a plan to implement the roads and infrastructure for 10,400 plots in new citizens' sub-divisions, 1,819 of which were served by end of 2017. We are also working on completing the roads and infrastructure in existing areas to serve 5,644 land plots in 2018 within Al-Shamal City, Bani Hajer, and Muaither. Our plan for 2018's project award included 19 projects serving a total of 18,529 plots, out of which six projects were awarded to serve 5,099 plots, and the rest will be awarded before the end of the year to serve 13,430 plots. Ashghal has transitioned from an authority entrusted with awarding and executing efficient sustainable infrastructure projects for the state to an entity that focuses on the operation and maintenance of the state's road networks and drainage networks and delivering quality services and solutions in managing projects and assets. As we move closer to 2022, we will work on developing this area extensively in the coming years.</p><h4>What would be your advice for any company wanting to start working for Ashghal?</h4><p>Ashghal always looks to partner with leading companies in Qatar and the world to deliver state-of-the-art projects and infrastructure for Qatar, regardless of whether this is in terms of design, construction, or the operation and maintenance of our projects. The process of selecting partners and/or contractors is done based on certain conditions and criteria that take into account important factors such as quality, safety, and expertise, as well as capability and commitment to implementation within the set schedule. Ashghal operates an open and transparent compulsory competitive tendering process whereby tenders are advertised on its website and in relevant publications. With major projects, Ashghal also holds pre-tender briefings to ensure companies are aware of the tender requirements for each stage of the project. We encourage all qualified companies to take part in our project bidding process and share their knowledge, expertise, and technical know-how in implementing some of the largest infrastructure projects in the world.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead, and which projects do you have in the pipeline?</h4><p>Our outlook for the coming year is extremely positive. As we deliver some of the largest infrastructure projects, our purpose remains unchanged, which is unwavering commitment to improving performance. We are implementing our corporate strategy considering it as the track of Ashghal's journey for the next five years (2018-2022). This is the base of development that Ashghal relies on across all its activities to achieve its vision of “excellence in delivering and managing efficient sustainable infrastructure,“ as envisioned in the Qatar National Vision 2030. Our projects in the pipeline are set across our core sectors covering infrastructure, drainage, buildings, and asset management. Our special emphasis is developing sub-division infrastructure, so those projects will be a priority in the coming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[35% of Energy from Renewables]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[paolo-romanacci-director-general-enel-green-power-mexico-central-america]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you choose Mexico to invest in such large projects?</h4><p>Mexico has many advantages, namely its size and its resources. The amount of solar power is one of the best in the world in comparison to other countries. This makes it possible to develop large projects of over 500 MW. In addition, from an economic and social point of view, the new regulations have established a context in which one can invest large sums of money. In addition, we firmly believe that we can generate a positive change with each of our projects for Mexican society, both in the goal of generating 35% of energy from renewable sources, and in the communities close to our projects, to whom we offer employment, training and programs according to our Creating Shared Value (CSV) philosophy.</p><h4>How does your subsidiary Enel Energí­a Mexico complement the work of Enel Green Power Mexico?</h4><p>This is part of ENEL's new global line of business called Global Trading. We see a great deal of interest in the world and also in Mexico in commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) clients. Mexico is an interesting market for this line of business. Our Qualified Supplier, Enel Energí­a, is the vehicle through which we will develop this market, and in the coming years it will be another important pillar of our work here. It is part of our two-step strategy to start commercializing energy in Mexico. We want to be as close as possible to our clients and also think about future services that are involved. This is part of another line of business that we have called ENEL-X. Second, the auctions are an interesting opportunity to keep growing, though sometimes we cannot extract the total value of the project as specified in the auctions. There is even more space to grow if we go directly to clients.</p><h4>What are your plans with Holdco in your upcoming projects like Amistad?</h4><p>Compared to other companies, we have an economic strength and stability that allows us to move quickly during the construction period. We do not have to rely on project financing for the construction, which is a major advantage for rapid development. We also bring to our projects different types of investors that allow us to focus our resources on expansion to continue to grow at this rapid pace. This economic strength is one of the reasons why we can plan, build and operate great projects, such as Amistad, which will be considered as the largest wind park complex in Mexico.</p><h4>How do you plan to participate in the fourth auction that is about to be released?</h4><p>We like to compete; competition is an extremely important pillar to succeed in Mexico, and we like to win. We are the only company that has won all the three long term auctions held in the country. The company plans to retain its leadership in the renewable market and its record of winning all the auctions in Mexico.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the fourth auction?</h4><p>The rules are slowly changing. It is important for them to change and adapt even faster, as the reform needs modifications and updates. There are already some in this next auction, and we see it as a positive step. We would like for this to continue to evolve toward transparency, security, and clear rules.</p><h4>How do you ensure the development of viable projects considering that the average price per project is becoming cheaper?</h4><p>The fall in energy prices is a global phenomenon. Prices are falling mostly because the cost of energy generation is going down as well. Technology is improving greatly, which allows us to extract more energy from a single panel, reducing the costs further. This is a trend that will continue in the coming months or years, and we can guarantee that energy will stay as cheap as it is right now.</p><h4>What are the next projects in your pipeline?</h4><p>We are working on the construction of the first part of the Amistad wind farm complex, that will enter into operation by the end of 2018. We are also working on the construction of Salitrillos, which will enter into action at the beginning of 2019. It is a fairly advanced project in comparison to its auction date. At the same time, we are about to start the construction of another photovoltaic park in Tlaxcala named Magdalena II, this is the first renewable energy project in this entity and we are glad to be the pioneers. As for the third auction projects, Amistad II has already began construction, Dolores another wind farm , this one in Nuevo Leon will start construction this 2018, same as the third part of Amistad. Amistad IV is expected to begin construction in 2019.</p><h4>How will you continue to consolidate your presence as the largest renewable energy producer in the country?</h4><p>Our presence will continue to consolidate through auctions, clients, and C&amp;I as a result of the development of Enel Green Power and Energia Mexico. Later, there will be room for new services such as ENEL-X. We will start with big corporations and large clients before eventually incorporating clients with smaller demands as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Cybersecurity in Mexico]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[marcos-flores-director-general-delete-technology]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors led up to the acquisition of Software Blanco and the subsequent rebranding as Delete Technology?</h4><p>Blanco used to be a Finnish company until it was sold in 2014 and became part of a group from the UK. Delete Technology is now a fully Mexican company with a presence all over Latin America. The acquisition was a major step forward for our company. When we opened an office in Mexico, we were following the company's general strategy. We became independent in early 2018 and have new ideas for the company, as doing business in Mexico and Latin America differs from Europe. In the region, companies are more concerned about receiving certain services rather than just the software. We have a wide range of services, which has helped us form better relationship with our clients.</p><h4>What are the main characteristics of your average customers?</h4><p>Our customer profile is divided between private corporations, financial institutions, and the government. We have a greater focus on the latter, as the Privacy Act opened many doors for us. The government is required to follow a strict set of norms and compliance when erasing data. This was the first segment that we started to serve in Mexico. Financial institutions are another important target for us, as they have to abide by many international regulations. The banking system in Mexico is dominated by foreign companies, and most of the top banks are international. The few Mexican banks that are owned by Mexicans also need to comply with these norms, so that is a great market for us. The third customer base is corporations listed on the stock exchange that need to comply with international regulations. When data erasure was first being discussed, we were the first company in Mexico that was introducing the technology and processes that would be needed. Our first customer was Banco de Mexico. It was extremely important for us to get ahead in the sector and gain the trust of these institutions and corporations. Most of the banks in Mexico now work with us, including Bancomer, Banorte, and Scotiabank. We are data erasure leaders in the financial sector and cover most of this market.</p><h4>How well prepared are Mexican companies when it comes to cybersecurity?</h4><p>In the last several years, Mexico has invested a great deal of money in cybersecurity. Private companies, government entities, and banks are now familiar with the risks, and hackers have shown what they are capable of. Now, securing customer data is a large issue for companies, and they are investing accordingly. We see a great deal of excellent qualifications from people leading IT security departments. In Latin America, Mexico is the leading country in this regard. We do need to start developing applications, software, and hardware in the region related to security in order to improve. Most of the technology comes from the US, Europe, and Israel. These areas are developing many solutions while national security agencies typically prefer the local development of this technology when possible. This is a gap that needs to be closed in the region.</p><h4>How do you plan to continue expanding in Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico is our biggest market, while Colombia is our second market, and it is growing significantly. Even though Brazil is the largest country and economy in the region, it does not have the latest technology and lacks an established data protection law. That makes it difficult to convince people in that market that they need our product. Due to security reasons, Colombia has been investing significantly in technology, especially cybersecurity. That is why it is a great market for us; the more rules and regulations there are in place, the more popular our software is.</p><h4>What strategies do you employ to stay ahead of the regulations?</h4><p>Technology moves faster than laws. It takes time for people to know if they need to adopt new technology, and this context helps us understand what the next step will be. For me, it was especially beneficial to live in Europe because I had a chance to see the implementation of extremely strong data protection acts. In Finland, data protection laws have been in place since 1972. Mexico adopted the same laws in 2010, so there was a huge gap. When Mexican began to adopt these processes and services, I realized it would present a great opportunity for IT security solutions. Companies face severe penalties when they are not complying with data protection laws. Telecommunications companies, retail stores, and universities are some examples of entities that are not keeping information safely. Many are already paying fines for this lack of security.</p><h4>How do you differentiate your company from other providers?</h4><p>We work to secure our customers with the best technology and people. We have invested a great deal of time in the process that we use to deliver our product to customers. We are the only company in Mexico that provides such service. We try to be as professional as companies in the US or Europe and have the best teams we can gather to provide these services. Our company learns from what other regions have incorporated and emulates them in Mexico, all while adapting them to the local culture. The mentality in each country is different, which is a significant factor in marketing our product. The needs in Colombia, Brazil, and Mexico are different, and we need to adjust to the way each country does business, which is our main challenge.</p><h4>What are your plans to expand your services and products in the region?</h4><p>In Mexico, we have covered most of the market. Our next challenge is the change of administration, as a new president started in December 2018. Many contracts will come to an end in 2019, and we seek to renew those contracts. Hopefully, we can retain the trust of our customers on the government side. Mexico is a steady country in terms of income for the company, and we are focusing more on Latin America, specifically Colombia, Chile, and Brazil. We have distributors in the region, though the next step is to open offices in these locations. We are currently the leading company in Latin America, as we have been operating since 2006. We have developed a network of distributors in the region, and when we have physical offices that can further support our distributors, we anticipate being able to close bigger deals and grow the number of customers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[miguel-pernes-country-managing-director-abb]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The presence of ABB in Portugal dates back to 1956. Can you briefly explain its journey?</h4><p>When I started working for ABB in 1991, it was totally different than what it is today. During the 1990s, the company had around 4,000 employees, and until the end of the decade its main investments were in power generation and the transportation sector, however, due to group divestments in this area. ABB focused more on power transport and distribution, and automation segments, today we are a company of 150 employees with a turnover of USD70 million. ABB's value added is more related to service and engineering as well as the country's efforts regarding power transmission, distribution, and automation.</p><h4>The company is dealing with Power Grids, Electrification Products, Industrial Automation, and Robotics &amp; Motion. What are the most important projects that ABB is active in Portugal?</h4><p>Recently, we were awarded a battery storage project that requires an innovative solution. It will be situated on the island of Port Santo, next to Madeira, as one of the first such projects in Europe. It is a battery storage system that will sustain the grid of the island. The project will store energy and regulate the power in the island; the goal of the local government is to make these two islands energy efficient from an environmental point of view. The ultimate goal of this system is to integrate renewables into the grid and make the island a truly green island.</p><h4>How would you characterize the current investment climate in the energy sector?</h4><p>We are witnessing a major change, especially due to efforts from Portugal's two main utility providers, REN and EDP, which are also among ABB's top 10 clients in Portugal. These two companies made a huge effort and invested to accommodate the penetration of renewables into the grid. Therefore, the current energy grid is a new grid as a result of their efforts, allowing us to have a secure and dependable network. At the same time, there is a new challenge for grid operators, to manage the penetration of electrical vehicles and the distributed power generation as a result of the residential micro production.</p><h4>Who are your main clients and partners?</h4><p>One of our primary clients is Navigator, a pulp and paper company where we have installed a huge base. Similarly, Volkswagen AutoEuropa is our main clients in terms of the robotics area. On the utilities side, we have REN and EDP as well as EEM in Madeira for the Porto Santo project.</p><h4>What are your human resource requirements in Portugal and how do you keep your existing talent?</h4><p>ABB has around 150 employees and 50% of those are engineers, service engineers, application engineers, and sales staff. We have a demanding and precise talent management system. One of our most important values is to share and give value back to our employees. ABB is a steady company where the average age of employees is around 40 years old, which means we are a young company. We put a lot of effort and invest on giving training to our employees in all aspects, from technical training to themes related to OHS, Integrity or Finances.</p><h4>In a global perspective, how would you assess Portuguese innovation vibe?</h4><p>Portugal is one of the most advanced countries in the power automation segment. We are in the 4th industrial revolution and the world is now talking about digitization, but it's true to say that in Portugal the first steps towards digitization began about 20 years ago. That is why Portuguese engineers are well prepared for modern challenges. Similarly, a lot of small Portuguese companies are developing solutions that are out of the normal trend. From our perspective, we see this as opportunities to become leaders in new developments and innovations.</p><h4>What are your priorities and goals for the next few years?</h4><p>The strategy of ABB is clear: profitable growth, relentless execution, and business-led collaboration. The company wants to be present in all the segments and areas of the economy which are related to its portfolio. We want to be the best in the area, promote talent, develop the future, and be ahead with our customers to attend upcoming challenges. ABB operates in more than 100 countries with about 147,000 employees, and we work in a network and in several developments. Our goal in Portugal is to adapt this group strategy to the local reality. ABB will have an even bigger presence in the automation and digitalization as well as in the new concept of mobility. We also want to be part of this revolution and be ahead in influencing the use of applications and digitalization. We want to continue working on our platform to gather all the technologies and make a common use to attend customer needs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did TETEC become one of the largest private accreditation bodies in the country?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DR. OMAR M. BASODAN </strong>We have been working in the education and training sector for a long time. We selected a number of important qualifications that are needed for the market, particularly ICT and English qualifications. This approach gained acceptance in the market and also resulted in great cooperation with governmental entities. We have certified over 200,000 people in the ICT sector, including 35,000 government employees under the Yasser project. TETEC has also looked at the business models that are needed in the new challenging and demanding market, rather than just providing qualifications. Such a concept and business model is not well known in Saudi Arabia, though in the last few years, especially with the establishment of the Public Education Evaluation Commission (PEEC), people have started to realize the importance of standardizing qualifications.</p><h4>How has TETEC's portfolio of programs in ICT, English, and other fields advanced so far?</h4><p><span></span><strong>OMB</strong> Although we started in ICT in 2010, we have since opened up other opportunities, firstly by becoming an open exam center for Cambridge English-language assessments. Now we are moving into other sectors. We have qualifications in education, health, and safety, and are also introducing more qualifications both for individuals and organizations in different areas that are of interest to  the Saudi market. We study the market continuously for new opportunities, especially long-term opportunities. In the qualifications field, we need to be ahead of market trends so that we are well placed to meet demand when a particular sector picks up.</p><h4>What role can TETEC play in driving the e-learning and distance education agenda in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DR. JAMAL ALHEFDHI</strong> The digital era can introduce important tools to the education sector through different platforms for distance and e-learning. It makes it easier to have cooperation in the education sector, whether in formal education, through e-learning, or as an assistant through computer-based teaching. Digital technologies can provide a great platform for the standardization and delivery of different types of educational services. There are excellent efforts taking place in terms of introducing smart schools here. The Ministry of Education has started some initiatives along this line, though they are inadequate. The more effort we put into changing the education environment to a smart environment, the better the opportunities will be for the students, teachers, and even parents to participate in the education process. The more smart services are introduced into the education system, the better the performance, outcomes, and opportunities for education to reach new and different areas and offer the best education. TETEC now is a main Ministry of Education partner in providing online English learning solutions for its initiative #English_for_All. We also have a major project underway that is set to be completed in 2018 to introduce an e-learning platform for ICT qualifications so that people can study and do their exams online. We will expand this approach to other qualifications in the future. TETEC has also developed an exam engine that is an adaptive electronic testing system—one that can almost be used with any kind of subjects and any type of questions. It will help with the digitalizing of all forms of education and training assessments in the market.</p><h4><span></span>How does TETEC envisage growing its services and presence in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><strong>OMB</strong> We have more than one strand in our vision for growth at TETEC. One approach is that we look at the important areas that still need qualifications and we tackle them, even if they are new areas to us. Furthermore, our goal is to increase the number of mass qualifications we work with, as opposed to niche qualifications. Another goal TETEC has is to grow vertically to become one of the biggest awarding bodies in the country. We also want to tackle the needs of the business sector in Saudi Arabia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[keying-in-the-basics]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What must brands do to ensure their attractiveness in the Abu Dhabi market?</h4><p>When a firm enters the market, it is likely to face high degrees of competition from other companies trying to serve relatively young, sophisticated consumers with high purchasing power. This is why excellent service and quality, as well as innovative ideas are extremely important to succeed. Second, brands need to utilize the most advanced technology at their disposal in order to gather feedback from their consumers and understand how they can improve themselves and adapt to their new needs. The brands and companies that are most successful at constantly doing so and succeed in creating an emotional relationship with their clients will be the ones to survive. Given the youthful nature and explosive growth of market players in the UAE and Abu Dhabi, brands must stick to the basics in terms of customer centricity and quality, while at the same time, change how these basics are delivered. The third requirement is to cut through the noise. I once read that 30 years ago, consumers in the US were exposed to 300 messages per day. Today, consumers are exposed to 5,000 messages a day, consciously or unconsciously. This means that given the amount of noise in the market today, brands need to cut through this noise by making their message simple, easy, relevant, and emotionally engaging. Last but not least, it is healthy for brands to target different categories of the population and be more aware of price sensitivity. Good deals are always attractive to customers, especially those who are used to purchasing goods when they travel or online and expect to pay similar price ranges for similar products.  </p><h4>How can technology help marketing firms build brand consciousness and add value to their clients' business?</h4><p>We are in a very exciting time for technology, especially as marketers. Technology allows for improvements though immediate feedback whereas before, brands had to rely on focus groups, surveys, and questionnaires to improve services. Today, types of artificial intelligence, whether it is via chatbox or facial recognition, allow brands to assess consumers' real interests and reactions. Another major benefit brought by technology is time saving. A firm will be able to gather more data and push the line that drives greater interests, thus growing the top-line and reducing costs. With technology, advertisers can also better track how well their messages and campaigns have reached their target audience. We can do more testing via digital platforms and other technological applications and tools, and save our clients' money on their total marketing spent. In this way, AI can turn marketers into more proactive planners and include them more in the development of a product. In Abu Dhabi, the government is keen to empower technological change in a number of industries, such as fast-moving goods, banking, real estate, and leisure. </p><h4>What is the UAE's competitive advantage with regards to the adoption of technology?  </h4><p>The country is safe, secure, stable, and extremely commerce-friendly, which helps in any business endeavor. The government recently enacted a number of new decrees to enhance SMEs and start-ups in the country. However, at the end of the day, it goes back to the entrepreneur and the brand. The economy changes, though the basics remain key. The marketing industry should push clients to think globally and act locally, especially multinational firms. We need to provide clients with the same level of ideas that they would find in Tokyo, London, or New York, while maintaining a local flavor and consciousness. Another important aspect is agility; lean and flexible companies are more likely to keep up with an ever-changing market. A final tip would be to always be cognizant of the government and its various strategies for the economy. By aligning itself with the government, a company maximizes its chances for success and is not left out of key trends happening in society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you interpret the “digital shift" that media companies in the UAE are embracing? </h4><p>The UAE's media sector is undergoing rapid changes because of increasing digitization. According to the Arab Media Report 2016-2018, digital media is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the Middle East, with digital video now growing by 30% and e-books by 10%. The National Media Council (NMC) functions as a regulatory body, as well as a body that supports all forms of media in the UAE. NMC's regulatory role requires us to ensure common standards, irrespective of the medium, that are necessary to ensuring the veracity and quality of the information being relayed to the consumer. The UAE leadership believes that the exponential increase in digitization can be a key driver for the country's development. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum made this point clear when he addressed the 'Future of Media' retreat, a summit organized by NMC in Abu Dhabi in February. Defining concrete initiatives that would ensure the future growth and international influence of media in the UAE, His Highness outlined a vision for the country to take a leading role in driving the industry forward as an instrumental component in helping the country achieve its ambitions on the global stage.  </p><h4>What further measures should both regulatory bodies and independent players adopt to keep up with the fast advent of changes in the industry? </h4><p>NMC's mandate is to develop and support the local media sector and build the media of the future. Part of the council's strategy is to develop an advanced legislative and regulatory environment for the UAE's media sector. NMC's Electronic Media Regulations, for example, were enacted to help the UAE's media sector remain on top of the rapid changes taking place. Issued in March this year, the regulations work to enrich and organize digital content. They also ensure that media material respects the religious, cultural, and social values of the UAE. One important dimension of the regulations is that they act as a safeguard against false information, which if unchecked can have a detrimental effect on society. Often such false information is commercial in nature and comes in the form of a social media personality dispensing 'advice,' which in reality is a paid-for endorsement of a product or service. NMC's Electronic Media Regulations require companies and individuals who engage in activities of a commercial nature on social media to get licenses so that their activities can be regulated in the same way as traditional advertising. NMC is committed to gauging audience perceptions in its regulatory role. The 'Public Confidence in the UAE Media Index,' launched in early 2018, evaluated the UAE public's main sources of news, information and media. The findings showed that local newspapers were heavily relied on for local news at 98%, followed by radio stations at 72%, television channels at 59%, and news websites at 34%. The survey found the overall reliance on UAE media amounted to 63%.</p><h4>What is the key to attracting local talent, and how do you expect the younger generations to change the nature of media in the UAE? </h4><p>It is young people—the largest demographic in the region—who are driving the changes in the sector. Recognizing that education is integral to this process, NMC is focused on building the capacities of the country's youth. To this end, we regularly partner with local universities for various initiatives. Providing young people with a say in the UAE's media sector, NMC commissioned a nationwide survey titled Sources of Youth for Obtaining Information and News, conducted in collaboration with the UAE University's Centre for Public Policy and Leadership. As a result of the study, NMC formed the Youth Media Council in March this year. Comprising young journalists and students from universities and media institutes across the country, the Youth Media Council is a platform for the young to contribute to the sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the strategic priorities for twofour54 Abu Dhabi in 2019, and what is driving these priorities?</h4><p>Over the last decade, we have built a thriving media ecosystem that has seen continuous growth. Today, we have a unique and vibrant creative community of more than 470 media companies and 580 freelancers. We are home to a mix of leading international brands, including CNN, Red Bee Ericsson and Ubisoft, who work alongside local and regional companies such as Algorythma, Lamsa, Image Nation and Flash Entertainment. Our main priority is to create a sustainable media economy, and in 2019 we will focus on helping our partners take their businesses to the next level. We also recently announced an extension to our entrepreneurship scheme to enable more small businesses to work from home. We will continue to create products and services that help our partners and freelancers focus on their core business and their own growth. We will also continue to support job creation and we are in line with the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, to create 10,000 jobs for Emiratis in the private sector. At the media zone, 37% of our partner base is owned and operated by Emiratis who feel the need to be part of a creative community and this is something we will continue to champion. Part of creating a sustainable industry is our investment in youth. We will continue to focus on engaging talent to explore media as a viable career path from a young age. We are extremely proud of our 13,000-strong youth community. We encourage, support and train young people to follow their passion in media. It is also important that we educate our young people on the role that media plays in preserving our culture and identity.</p><h4>Where do you still see white spaces that represent valid opportunities for prospective companies and investors alike?</h4><p>We see many opportunities for both companies and investors in Abu Dhabi and across the MENA region. This is a unique time for our region and the scale of opportunity and content creation is unprecedented. This is largely driven by three factors: we have one of the largest youth population in the world; we live in an era where digital media plays an integral role in our everyday lives; and there is a large demand for Arabic content creators.</p><h4>How do you expect the needs of content creators of the media and entertainment industry to evolve in the medium term?</h4><p>One of the trends we are experiencing at the moment is with consumers, who increasingly demand instant content gratification. They want more content faster and want it delivered to the quality they expect from high-end productions. This is game changing for content creators who need to be more flexible and cost effective to deliver tight deadlines while still maintaining a benchmark of quality. It is one of the reasons why we have introduced flexible working options as an extension of our entrepreneur scheme. We have also recently reviewed our production and post-production offers so we can offer the quality of our state-of-the-art facilities to partners in a competitive and nimble way. Our role to help our content creation partners take advantage of the growing opportunity. We know from experience that some of the best content comes from collaboration so we are constantly looking for ways to help our partners' network and collaborate. By connecting partners with each other, and through offering products such as the dual license, we help them source more work and secure more opportunities for content creation. Over the next few years, we will see our vision for the future come to life on Yas Island. Our new home will be the ideal base and a destination of choice for the world's most innovative media and technology companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the government continuing its work to promote Abu Dhabi as a medical tourism destination?</h4><p>When we compare Abu Dhabi to the rest of the region, we are best-in-class in terms of quantity and quality. Not only we do have more clinics, expertise, and hospitals, but we can also count on facilities such as the Cleveland Clinic, Imperial College, King's College, and a huge public sector with well-known doctors. The ultimate goal for 2018 is to work alongside other government entities to promote Abu Dhabi as a medical tourism hub. Therefore, the department is taking all the necessary steps to build up its sustainable capabilities by adopting a culture of innovation and fostering R&amp;D to advance the sector to meet the demand of medical tourists and position Abu Dhabi as a leading medical tourism destination. One of the necessary steps we have already taken is to collaborate with the Department of Culture and Tourism to develop a smart portal through which people can apply for a visa, receive an answer within two hours, book a medical appointment, estimate costs, and book tickets and accommodation. Two thirds of the world's population is only a three-hour flight from Abu Dhabi, which means patients can come here instead of the US and receive the same care. World-class medical brand names already operate here, not to mention some of the finest brands in travel and hospitality. Now with the government redoubling its efforts to draw in even more tourists, we are keen to tap and exploit the significant opportunities of the global medical tourism market, which is estimated to reach USD46.6 billion by 2021.</p><h4>Where do you see new technologies having the biggest impact?</h4><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a growing area expected to play a central role in improving healthcare in terms of quality, access, safety, and affordability. We are working to distinguish Abu Dhabi as a hub for AI and provide the necessary infrastructure and government support to attract major players and leverage the next generation of technologies. In terms of innovation, the latest innovation awards were given, along with large-scale funding, to the ideas that addressed some of the government's major challenges such as TIP healthcare awards. Finally, we had a pilot oncology project with IBM's Watson, and plan to announce a future partnership aimed at leveraging these technologies across a number of services in the medical sphere here. </p><h4>How does the recently announced primary care standard fit into the Department of Health's goals?</h4><p>Similar to the best health systems in the world, we use primary care as a gatekeeper. In a primary healthcare setting, a highly trained physician or consultant with extensive experience and expertise diagnoses patients, thus reducing the cost of the government. Eventually, if the patient needs to see a specialist, the primary care expert will refer any additional care accurately and effectively. The next step is to ensure that urgent and emergency care settings are more clearly distinguished and classified so that patients can seek care at the proper facility. Additionally, we will soon establish and implement our secondary and tertiary standards and centers of excellence. </p><h4>What are your major projects in the pipeline for the near term?</h4><p>By reviewing and updating our 2015 strategy, we seek to create a clear roadmap for all relevant stakeholders for the next 20 years. The government cannot always be the biggest player in the health space, which is why we are in the midst of a shift toward increased private sector participation and leveraging the strong infrastructure that Abu Dhabi offers. In this sense, we are working on establishing a governance framework and a medical council to hear input from the payer side, the private sector, the government, and the regulator. Creating dialog is vital, and it allows us to create collective decisions that are the product of widespread contributions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key strategic priorities for DoH to ensure dynamic, affordable, and high-quality healthcare services? </h4><p>DoH will continue its efforts to increase the efficiency of the health sector in line with Abu Dhabi Vision 2030, fulfilling society's needs and expectations and proactively promoting a healthier society and a culture of healthcare excellence. As such, this year we are building a new strategic plan that will enable the healthcare sector to realize its full potential, which boils down to closing capacity gaps in the short term, building an integrated healthcare system with better value for money, and achieving a transformational shift in Abu Dhabi healthcare's long-term innovation and medical tourism vision. The industry has evolved over the years into a mature, adaptable, and advanced system aligned with leading international systems in terms of practices, standards, and regulations. This system is driven by high standards of quality based on excellent services through highly skilled health professionals and state-of-the-art facilities, guaranteeing patients an exceptional, transparent, and safe experience.</p><h4>As chairman, what is your message to reassure private investors of the opportunities in the health sector?</h4><p>The private sector is one of DoH's most valuable partners, and the rise in regional healthcare demand has presented the private sector in particular with many opportunities for development and expansion. As such, Abu Dhabi's healthcare system is facilitating investment for local and foreign investors through a number of initiatives, such as the recent Capacity Master Plan (CMP), which was launched to help investors identify the best investment opportunities in Abu Dhabi's healthcare system until 2030, based on current and foreseen supply and demand levels. In this sense, the geographical areas of demand are mostly in Al Dhafrah, Al Ain, and Western Region, whereas services in great demand include primary care, specialist outpatient care, and emergency care units. In the CMP plan, investors can learn about laws, regulations, and standards required by the health authority. </p><h4>How can the sector strike a balance between developing the skills of Emirati doctors and attracting foreign talent? </h4><p>The healthcare industry in Abu Dhabi boasts a solid infrastructure and an attractive business climate, in addition to an advanced regulatory framework, all of which give Abu Dhabi a competitive advantage and offer a conducive investment environment. The attractiveness of the market is highlighted by the number of international, multi-specialty health facilities we have been able to attract, such as the Cleveland Clinic and the Imperial College London Diabetes Center, which, together with locally based health providers such as Healthpoint, Mediclinic, and Burjeel Hospital, provide world-class health services that can accommodate patients who require surgical and specialized treatment. That being said, national agenda 2021 has steered the country's efforts toward a sturdier, knowledge-based, and diversified economy, with the UAE government reinforcing Emiratization initiatives in various strategic sectors to empower its citizens and ensure it has a sustainable workforce. This is also the case also in the healthcare sector, where the government's efforts have seen more leading economic players join the healthcare industry as health professionals, contributing to the advancement of provision of healthcare and innovation. Building and maintaining a sustainable workforce is also crucial for the Abu Dhabi healthcare sector to remain one of the cornerstones of the UAE healthcare system. Therefore, DoH is working alongside medical and educational institutions to encourage young Emiratis to study medicine and other related fields. For example, in 2017 we launched an awareness campaign where we reached out to potential medical students to help them learn about different medical specialties and job market needs and understand which opportunities can advance their careers. At the same time, DoH is also facilitating onboarding and medical licensing for UAE nationals through improved health professional licensing requirements.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Rabdan Academy play within the formative educational environment of Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>In support of its mission, Rabdan has three main functions: academic teaching, vocational training, and encouraging interoperability across government safety, security, and defense entities with the private sector. The vision behind the academy is important from a holistic security perspective, driving cross-government dialog by breaking down barriers between the relevant organizations. Although we report to the Abu Dhabi Executive Council, our Board of Trustees is formed by a number of key stakeholders, mostly from the defense and security segment, which amplifies our scope beyond the Emirate. Our mission is about both education and forming networks of highly skilled people to draw upon. Our faculty has a healthy mix of 25% Emirati and 75% international, all of whom tend to be practitioners as well as academics in various fields. At the same time, there is a need for highly specialized training and education, which is why our vocational and academic programs are steadily expanding. For example, we offer a new master's program in intelligence analysis taught by our faculty with non-military backgrounds to help our students understand intelligence in a significantly broader sense rather that solely a military one. We also have a new bachelor's program in homeland security that requires input from nearly every government entity, as we cover topics such as resilience, which is vital even in the business community.</p><h4>How can interoperability between the public and private sectors help address national concerns?</h4><p>The risks facing the UAE are not that different from those nearly any other nation faces, such as natural emergencies, global health threats, and organized crime. That being said, the UAE is located in a region with many potential challenging factors. Solutions can be imposed by authorities, though it is much more effective to convince the human elements of the various systems to take this journey together and discover the value of coordination and cooperation. To achieve our long-term goal, we need to rely on the strategic planning that the leadership of the UAE has directed, which allows for a highly efficient and effective public sector to be integrated with the private sector to create the bedrock of a healthy and safe society and nation. Indeed, the private sector requires security, so it has an important role to play in support of government entities and must make its contribution to resilience and security.</p><h4>How do you expect AI to impact warfare?</h4><p>We have long had automated systems in the military, usually in defensive, rather than offensive roles; however, there remains widespread public unease about the potential use of AI to make decisions about terminating life in more offensive, kinetic scenarios. Ethics will remain an important area of education in the future since we do not want to rely on machines to make ethical decisions for us. There are many human skills that will not be replaced by AI, and as educators we need to focus on these, so that people can continue to play a critical role in technologically advanced societies. We must prepare our graduates for the challenges in the coming five to 10 years, challenging some of the long-established academic paradigms.</p><h4>Given international trade's reliance on maritime logistics, what is the future of naval warfare?</h4><p>There is resurgent recognition of the role of maritime forces in the wider security framework, as the global market demands a highly efficient and effective supply chain, often utilizing the access and capacity offered by maritime trade. Protecting trade and maritime infrastructure across a number of areas is therefore a key area that we must not take for granted. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the origins of Mohammed V University?</h4><p>At the time of the inception of the university, Emirati students were studying at Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco, which is known for being one of the world's most outstanding universities in Islamic studies. However, in line with an emphasis on developing local knowledge and talent in primary, secondary, and tertiary education, the Abu Dhabi government decided to open a branch of this university in Abu Dhabi to enable national students to continue their studies in their home country and to enrich the community here. With the opening of a satellite university comes both advantages and challenges. On the one hand, it is vital that we maintain global standards of excellence—not only corresponding to the levels put in place by our colleagues in Rabat, but also worldwide—as well as staying on top of the latest educational developments more generally. On the other hand, we are privileged to be able to mine the deep experience of our colleagues in Mohammed V University Rabat, harnessing the benefits brought by their rich personnel and infrastructure capacity. The leadership of Abu Dhabi gives full attention and support to secondary and tertiary education in order to reach global standards.</p><h4>How does Mohammed V University seek to maintain the international standards of its faculty and student body?</h4><p>Mohammed V University has set up a system to recruit talent and faculty members, enforcing global standard requirements in terms of qualifications and skill sets. Prospective teachers are subject to a rigorous selection process overviewed by a specialist scientific committee that collects information from previous workplaces and trains the selected professors to further develop their capacities and make sure they pass the probationary period of one semester to be fully enrolled. Furthermore, Mohammed V University Abu Dhabi seeks to attract good students relying on their eagerness to continue their education in Islamic studies or Arabic literature. All said, the numbers speak for themselves. The employment rate among Mohammed V University Abu Dhabi's graduates has reached 98%. This result was obtained through specialized research, extensive career counseling, benchmark assessments based on the labor market, mandatory 100-hour-internship course, and employment agreements with professional parties. There is a strong demand for Mohammed V University Abu Dhabi's graduates as the number of jobs required in the labor market exceeds the number of graduate students. This demand is expected to remain at least for the next decade.</p><h4>How does the institution position itself with regards to the educational push from government?</h4><p>Islamic education plays a fundamental role in Abu Dhabi's educational priorities as the Emirate seeks to convey Islam's accurate message of moderation, tolerance, and openness to world cultures with humanitarian values. Mohammed V University Abu Dhabi thus offers two knowledge fields: Islamic studies and Arabic literature. Both disciplines are presented through modern and general knowledge to contribute to sustainable social development activities. All these are carried out in accordance with international standards. We face the challenge of students being attracted to more traditional programs such as business administration, human resources, media studies, and law. However, higher education in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi will achieve a great leap in the coming years due to the serious and promising future planning based on best practices, along with the availability of human and financial capabilities. Finally, we have implemented a plan for Emiratization in cooperation with the Emiratization Authority in Abu Dhabi for the 2016-2020 period. In this regard, we have reached a high standard and are continuing on our path to full Emiratization within the next decade.</p><h4>What are the main strategic goals Mohammed V University Abu Dhabi has set for itself in the medium term?</h4><p>A strategic plan for Mohammed V University Abu Dhabi for 2020 was implemented in 2016 in line with the Abu Dhabi 2030 plan. In this respect, we seek to develop a promising generation that contributes to society through an active, high-level participation in the labor market and in Islamic affairs services. In order to achieve this, our university needs internally to maintain an efficient financial system and integrated administrative legislation based on distinctive human resource management. Externally, we need to gain a prominent media reputation in order to highlight the wide array of top-level services we offer and our strong social development commitment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the value of your relationships with international institutions, and what do you look for in these partnerships?</h4><p>Some of these partnerships are for accreditation purposes. We are a member of the Middle State Commission for Higher Education, and our membership allows us to participate in decisions regarding the accreditation criteria. Through the association we are developing best practices in governance and institutional policies. Some other collaborations are there for program development and research objectives. For example, we have been running a program where we invite scholars from world-renowned universities to come and teach at Zayed University. We also bring people to advise on improvements to our institution, particularly when it comes to English instruction. This reflects our aim of always looking for ways to improve the environment for all our students. Finally, we also have a number of research collaborations with institutions around the world.</p><h4>Are there any specific areas of research that you are aiming to be more involved in?</h4><p>As a comprehensive university, we have research strengths in multiple areas: IT security and data analytics, environment and public health, accounting and other business fields, social sciences, and innovations in education and other fields. As we have this expertise, we look for partners who share similar specializations. We have around 250 annual research projects in these fields, around two-thirds of which are in collaboration with international research partners. There are also a number of contract research projects funded by government agencies for specific objectives. </p><h4>How do you assess students' ability to adapt to all these new technologies and programs? </h4><p>Our students are the first adopters of technology, which makes the integration of innovative approaches natural. To further this, we are creating an innovation and entrepreneurship center at the university to coordinate developing a business enterprise culture in partnership with business incubators and accelerators, and national organizations developing the SME sector. The university has a Fab-Lab that was just established at the College of Arts and Creative Enterprises, where we combine IT skills development with design courses and fabrication facilities. The Fab-Lab is an interesting concept because it has 3D printing capabilities for small items, and for bigger items the lab contains an eight-axis robotic arm that can fabricate these using subtraction technology. By programming this robot, our students can fabricate these images, thus learning reverse engineering in the process. This opens up a lot of possibilities for students, who are eager and capable of adopting new solutions.<br>How does Zayed University contribute to the further economic diversification and Emiratization?<br>About 55% of our graduates get jobs the first year after graduation, and about 70% get jobs within two to three. The remainder go to graduate school or work within their families' businesses or simply prioritize family. Our graduates are articulate and have gone on to work across every sector of the economy and in government. A great example is the current Minister of Community Development, Hessa Bint Essa Buhumaid, an alumnus of our university.</p><h4>How do you go about fostering leadership when designing your programs?</h4><p>The learning outcomes of Zayed University are based on a core comprising the skills to be learned by all and are modeled on 21st century skills such as critical thinking, communications, leadership, teamwork, technological awareness, and relevant IT tools. We use a great deal of role-playing, which fosters an ability to interact and contribute to the wider team. We also have student councils for each campus, student clubs, and training programs. We believe that students learn though experience, which is why the quality of the learning experience is important. Thus, we encourage students to apply their skills in classroom projects and in the wider community through volunteerism and other activities outside the campus. People from the community also deliver workshops on campus. By sharing their expertise, students get a mixture of experiences. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges have you faced in your integrated approach to technical education?</h4><p>People typically resist uniqueness, and our approach is extremely unique. Second, there was a negative view of vocational education in Abu Dhabi, largely because of bad experiences with vocational education prior to the introduction of our programs in 2005. When IAT was founded that year, we changed the entire image of vocational education by updating the curriculum, language of instruction, and our entire approach. In 2006, we began teaching at the secondary level, and by 2007, although there was already a large demand for graduates with a background in avionics from the military, there was no school or college to meet their needs. This was the catalyst for the integration of the secondary and tertiary education with the aim of producing qualified talent from IAT high schools in the areas of engineering, nursing, and health sciences. That same year, IAT also established the Al Ain International Aviation Academy to train aviation engineers and maintenance technicians, and in 2010, we merged our aviation engineering campus with Abu Dhabi Polytechnic.  With regard to the health sector, Fatima College had an agreement with Griffith University in Australia that helped it maintain quality assurance. Since then, Fatima College has had a more local focus to meet the market needs of Abu Dhabi and the UAE in the form of health science and nursing. </p><h4>What is your assessment of the degree of demand on the aviation side?</h4><p>Demand continues to increase because there are many airports in the UAE, and Abu Dhabi Airport will continue to grow significantly. In four years, the number of passengers will triple, by which time the Midfield Terminal Building will be completed, Dubai Airport will have reached full capacity, and Al Maktoum's full capacity will be utilized. All these developments require Emirati manpower, so every graduate we produce can be absorbed by the market, either in health or aviation engineering. Our unique integrated system at IAT gives all our high school graduates the option to continue on our path, allowing them to shorten their study time from one to two semesters. We thus promote the development of hands-on technical skills in high school. Our high school students can go anywhere else besides our colleges, with around 30% of IAT high school students continuing within the system and 70% going on to other universities and HCTs. At IAT higher education facilities, 33% are students from our own schools, with the remaining 67% coming from other schools.</p><h4>What are the challenges of creating a curriculum when technology is constantly changing and advancing?</h4><p>Schools and universities do not teach any new technologies, but rather basic ones that allow students to get familiar with technical thinking. At IAT, we use computer numerical control (CNC) from desktop computers and are rolling out 3D printing capabilities next year. By teaching students logic and programming, they get to understand the basics that will allow them to adapt to other new technologies. Receiving this level of knowledge in high school will allow students to manipulate machines and gain experience with programming from a young age. We can already see the difference in our higher education facilities between our graduates, who have been more exposed to technology, and other students.</p><h4>Are you looking to expand into any other sectors?</h4><p>We are looking for new technologies as they arise. We now teach our students coding from eighth grade onward, a UAE mandate that we are leading. We do not introduce technologies purely based on whether they are available, but based on the needs of the country. Abu Dhabi Polytechnic collaborates with a few public and private companies to work on manufacturing diplomas, particularly for CNC and 3D printing. In 2010, when we started Abu Dhabi Polytechnic, it was based on the market need for technicians in nuclear technology. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact did the late Sheikh Zayed have on people and the overall social development of the Emirate?</h4><p>The late Sheikh Zayed launched the first initiative many years ago with the objective of establishing specialized centers that focused on rehabilitation and education for people with special needs and giving them a right to self-determination. Secondly, he ensured that all the legislature and laws in the UAE were supportive and encouraged the inclusion of everyone in society. The third point was ensuring there were special programs, such as a start-up employment fund, that could allow people with intellectual disabilities to work and be active. At the founding of the Zayed Higher Organization for Humanitarian Care and Special Needs in Abu Dhabi, several staff members were relocated from the Ministry of Social Affairs, with other people joining from other centers after meeting with Sheikh Zayed. One of his messages was, “I will do my job by supporting your activities, but you play an important role in ensuring that these people with special needs have education, rehabilitation, and care in order to participate in our development plan. They have to be part of the economy by contributing to and being part of the workforce that boosts the growth of the UAE."</p><h4>What are your organization's goals and programs moving forward?</h4><p>Empowering people with special needs and making them self-confident enough to contribute to and become a part of society is our goal. We have a word, tamkeen, which means reassurance. It all goes back to reassuring them that they, too, are a part of our development. The challenge is to make sure that we design the right development programs that will prepare them for the workforce. Choosing the right programs and development is important when it comes to making sure they acquire the skills they need. In terms of awareness, things have been improving over the last few years, especially with the advent and popularity of social media. When Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid introduced the title of “people of determination," we began to see a significant change and impression it was making on people, especially on parents, who became prouder of seeing their children relabeled in a more positive way. It was a major turning point in UAE society, and it is spreading throughout the Gulf and the world.</p><h4>What impact has technology had in enhancing the inclusion of people of determination in society?</h4><p>There are two aspects when it comes to technology. In terms of rehabilitation, there is a trend across the UAE where everyone seeks to acquire the latest technology to support its people. We are focused on analyzing all aspects of medical treatment and therapist sessions to incorporate technology to ensure our children develop on the right track with a tangible result, all with less time and manpower. The process took several phases; first, we reviewed how it is done in countries such as Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and Spain. Then, we handpicked the best equipment to support our programs and finally worked with the first pilot in Abu Dhabi, bringing technology that supports different areas such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy. In terms of assistive technology, there have been changes in regard to multi-disabled children, such as those who have difficulties walking, using their extremities, or communicating and interpreting their environment, perhaps by improving eye movement or increase eye contact. On the social side of things, everyone is engaged with social media to some extent to express their ideas and suggestions. They are now a part, to some extent, of councils and committees: for example, in Dubai we were proud to have a legally blind doctor be the chair of a delegation going to the UN in the US to renew a disability fund.</p><h4>How do you expect the needs of people of determination to evolve in the near future and the UAE to adjust accordingly?</h4><p>We hear a great deal of news regarding labor and workforce changes that can affect future plans. We started by working to emphasize skills that make them more adaptable to the yet-undefined future. They must be entrepreneurial so that they can adjust the way they want to live in the next five to 10 years. There were two pilots launched in early 2018 where we encouraged people of determination to start their own business while we support them for one year. Manufacturing, renewable energy, financial services, and communication are the sectors with the greatest potential in terms of the direction of our economy. We are currently working on several projects that should give us a great foundation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[skill-sets]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) within the broader socio-economic development of the Emirate? </h4><p>TVET provides individuals with transferrable skills for the job market and is thus crucial for economic development, particularly in developing and emerging countries. The availability of a skilled workforce contributes to economic diversification and increases efficiency and competitiveness. After all, human development is undoubtedly a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth that needs the attention of government policy. To achieve this, our TVET Strategy was established to set out a number of key areas and actions to help TVET providers enhance the relevance, quality, and governance of their systems. The focus is on equipping learners with the skills required not only to find a good job and develop entrepreneurial and innovative mindsets, but also to become active citizens in an equitable, inclusive, and sustainable society. This will contribute to the achievements of Abu Dhabi Vision 2030, which seeks to create a sustainable knowledge-based economy and ensure the availability of a stable supply of high quality labor to staff the economy.</p><h4>How can Abu Dhabi strike a balance between developing a knowledge-based society and implementing modular, competency-based programs?</h4><p>Knowledge-based economies are driven by innovation and require a highly educated, flexible, and adaptive workforce, which can be realized through competency-based learning that focuses on the skills needed for success in the job market by providing the knowledge, skills, and attitude needed in a given discipline; standards for measuring performance and capability; and a framework for identifying qualifications to meet job market requirements.</p><h4>What is the best strategy to ensure Emiratis are equipped with transferable skills?</h4><p>These both raise the demand for skilled labor. Thus, a well-organized TVET system is capable of producing a skilled labor force that can attract globalized financial capital. However, a lack of human capital may deter foreign investment, since physical capital tends to go to areas where skilled human capital is available. This prompts employers to look for individuals who possess transferrable skills that include problem solving, self-confidence, communication skills, flexibility, teamwork, self-motivation, and self-management. We believe that the best strategy to equip Emiratis with these skills is to promote TVET as the education system that can equip learners with these skills and a mindset that enables them to encounter the challenges and demands of the workplace. These enable both workers to obtain decent work, manage change, and spur enterprises to adopt new technologies and enter new markets.</p><h4>How do you expect labor market demand to evolve in the short and long-term, and how can TVET adjust to this evolution?</h4><p>Labor market demand will continue to evolve and have significant implications on TVET. Understanding and anticipating such changes is key to building a responsive TVET system that adapts quickly to new emerging technologies. That is why TVET qualifications should be developed to respond to the diverse needs of learners and their workplace and address occupational changes in the job market. We should prepare the workforce for industrial sectors that are expected to grow. These include information technology, healthcare, utilities, engineering, and AI. </p><h4>What is the future of public and private sector involvement in TVET?</h4><p>Private sector involvement, whether at the regulatory or delivery level, can greatly enhance what is offered by the public sector, but this needs to be done through a partnership with clearly defined responsibilities, which recognize each other's tasks, rather than the two sides working independently. As such, strengthening private sector involvement in TVET programs' design and delivery is a necessary precondition for a successful VET system. Its involvement in developing occupational standards is important both to increase the relevance and quality of TVET and the acceptance of its graduates in the private sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current focus of Al Ain Club Investment Company, and what drives your strategy?</h4><p>Since our establishment in 2013, the first step was to change the culture of sports here. In the UAE, fans used to enter stadiums without a ticket, and it took a great deal of work to educate them and establish a system based on rules. Since we started working on Phase I of Hazza bin Zayed Stadium, we had to provide smooth access and clean facilities. The club became a benchmark for the local league and infrastructure, and the same ticketing system was applied nationwide. We successively rebranded ourselves, with a new logo and slogan, capitalizing on the sporting achievements of the club. Several sponsorship agreements also helped increase the brand's value. Today, Hazza bin Zayed Stadium is the only one that provides 5G infrastructure, as well as the first and only stadium in the region that broadcasts matches in 4K resolution. Currently, we are working on using AI to make our operation core more self-sufficient, focusing on getting visitors to the stadium, and connecting fans and shareholders of the club. The next step is to create an Al Ain FC fan office with the help of writers, designers, and photographers.</p><h4>What is the UAE's competitive advantage in terms of a sports environment, and what role will it play in the country's economic transformation?</h4><p>Sports will play an important role in the country's economy. We are great in everything except sports. The country spends a large sum of money on infrastructure, but often does not qualify for international competitions. In developing sport here, we are starting from the ground up, changing the culture and understanding how to hold our ground along with the athletes. When clubs invest in their players and assets, this reflects positively on the local economy and community. Every club depends on the government both financially and managerially, though now, more than ever, football clubs need to become self-sufficient in terms of funding. This is why the leadership's wise vision is to create an investment company to determine our assets, build an investment plan for the next five to 10 years, and prepare for a reduction in government support. </p><h4>What are the major investment opportunities in the UAE sports sector?</h4><p>Opportunities will stem from utilizing all our facilities in Al Ain FC and the UAE to host a wide variety of global events like Club World Cup/Asian Cup and the World Games Special Olympics. We now use stadiums even in the off-season; we have held a fashion show, conferences, and workshops. Previously, we were not capitalizing on our assets efficiently. To support us in this goal, we have a sports council focusing on sports tourism, creating new events in the UAE, generating money, and building our reputation and promoting the city. It also creates community services that focus on sports. However, the private sector needs to cooperate and think about how to help and boost the industry and reduce its reliance on the government.</p><h4>What has been your experience in the field, and how can you apply what you learned abroad?</h4><p>Despite not having any background in sports, the club invested in me and sent me to visit well-known UK Premier League clubs such as Manchester City, Manchester United, and Chelsea. I learned how to generate money from the stadiums and not the players themselves. Stadiums here have a great deal of potential when it comes to the operations themselves. They can generate money from concessions and other assets. I cannot compare the UAE to other European leagues, because those stadiums are always sold out. In addition, in those leagues, fans generally come and spend large sums of money on alcohol, which is forbidden here. Nonetheless, we are developing here on many fronts. The number of fans in stadiums is growing, and we see a significant increase in the number of women and families attending games. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you envision with Ciudad Mitad Del Mundo?</h4><p>Our vision is to create another way to develop tourism, and we named it cultural tourism. History tells us that the Incas were the most important people in this region; however, that is wrong. We had already Kitu Kara people here. Ciudad Mitad Del Mundo is a vision of Kitu Kara culture, and it represents a connection between the people and earth. The Kitu Kara had their way of observing the stars, and many years before the geodesic mission of France and Spain reached the equator, Kitu Kara had already determined where the center of the planet was. They used their deities to shape their cultural vision. For example, the Pingaroa or condor is a bird of fire that perches in the center of the planet and performs rituals. This is the starting point with which we work on the Ciudad Mitad Del Mundo. We want to show the cultural and geographical wealth of Ecuador. We have just built a replica of the Cochasquí­ pyramids 50km away from Quito whose complex is surrounded by mountains. We also build ancestral homes that are an example of the richness of the incredible technical knowledge of thermo-adaptable materials. We have a complex with two houses of the mountains, one of the coast, and one of the east. We also have a shaman who can perform traditional cleanings through rituals. All these represent a way to transfer our cultural wealth to the people who visit us. We want people to know that Ecuador is much more than the Galapagos and the mountains. The Kitu Kara civilization was huge. In history, the Incas fought with them for over 50 years before creating a marriage alliance between the two cultures. Our strategy has been so successful that we have received a call from a representative of the Ministry of Tourism to notify us that it will use the Ciudad Mitad Del Mundo image at the next tourism fair in London in November. From now on, we will be the official image of Ecuador at tourist fairs.</p><h4>How do you envision further opening up for tourism?</h4><p>As a business model, we try to open the tourism market. We want to be a source of momentum for small local businesses. For example, King de Tour is a double-decker tour bus company that we allied with three years ago, and it has grown a great deal with its Quito Tour Bus. Another strong point is the Plaza del Cacao. Much of the best chocolate in the world is made with Ecuadorian cocoa; however, we have never generated industrial processes with our raw material because we were focused on exporting it. In the Plaza del Cacao, we have a museum where we explain the cocoa production process in Ecuador and its importance in the national context. We have two specific objectives: to have national tourism be empowered in Ecuador through knowledge to valorize the national productive axes and for foreign tourists know more about the country. In the region of Pichincha, we are working on a new high-altitude coffee, and we have collaborated with certain Colombian companies to develop an international coffee with the goal of exports. We have a wine project that is being developed with grape cultivated in Ecuador. We are partnered with Vinos Dos Hemisferios, and we will soon have a wine museum with a similar concept to the cocoa museum.</p><h4>Where do your visitors primarily come from?</h4><p>Colombians represent 35% of tourists, while US tourists are 20%, and European tourists are 20%. We have a great exchange with Asia and China because recently the Chinese ambassador had a working agreement with Ecuador. In the coming years, we will have a significant increase in tourism from that part of the world. Everything depends on Ecuador's tourism policies. However, we have limited capacity because our goal is not to be like Disney World; we want our visitors to be relaxed and feel free to walk around without forming long lines. We do not want to fall into a mechanic of excessive consumption. We have to measure our growth because if we grow disproportionately, customer service will fail.</p><h4>What impact will the new investment law have on the tourism sector?</h4><p>We are a public company, with ownership divided between the province of Pichincha and the Ministry of Tourism. The minister has an elect, and this entity regulates the policies that we fulfill. When it presented me with the project, I made it clear that, despite being a public project, I had a private vision to make it grow. This does not mean that we are not willing to work in cooperation with the public sector or the ministry. Seven years ago, there was no adequate legislation for pricing; foreign tourists paid a different rate than national tourists. However, with the arrival of the new president, prices were standardized. We have to work with national tourism policies and work on promotion not only internally but also with the strategies of the Ministry of Tourism when we talk about international targets.</p><h4>Ecuador is strong in eco-tourism. How do you implement green solutions in your park?</h4><p>We are a 100% green company, and we are the first pet-friendly tourist attraction and the first pet-friendly company in Ecuador. Many of our workers come to work with their pets. In fact, we rescue stray animals, which is part of our attraction. We are in the process of eliminating single-use plastics in the company and recently eliminated the use of straws. We have a plan to build a recycling factory-museum so that our visitors can learn about our process of recycling all the plastic we discard. At the financial level, it is an opportunity to save costs in the long term. Regarding the economic aspect, we have had a sustained annual growth of 8%, which allows us to think about having the growths mentioned above. With the economic reality of the country and our ability to receive tourists, we can maintain a similar growth for the next few years without losing the original line that prioritizes customer service.</p><h4>What are your plans for the coming years?</h4><p>We want to acquire land around our complex. We are in a desert zone, and we are exploring the possibility of expanding. We want to build a life-sized pyramid, and if we can acquire the land next to us, it could be possible. The one we recently built was on a 1:12 scale, while the new project would be a real-scale pyramid.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have argued that telecoms have to go beyond connectivity services to remain successful. How are you developing du in this sense?</h4><p>All telecoms companies will be completely different in 2022 from what they are today. The disruption in the telecommunications industry will continue and even accelerate. The internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, big data, and other disruptive technologies will increasingly have an overbearing influence on many of the things that we do. The impact of this disruption will be immense, which is why we needed to better prepare and evolve our company beyond our mainstay—the connectivity business. We crossed the AED13-billion (USD3.5-billion) mark in revenue for the first time in 2017, of which more than 95% comes purely from the connectivity business. We need to ensure the development of this business segment is all about efficiency, customer experience, and digitalization. We are one of the two major players in the UAE that enable connectivity. Two years ago, we debated this idea that we can do more for businesses, for example, around data. We can host, manage, and secure data for companies, or create applications that can be used in this space. We are starting to provide illustrations of this in government departments. Within that framework, we are not limiting ourselves to providing connectivity. As cities, nations, and governments move to become smarter and more digital, we will see greater need for such new partnerships.</p><h4>What challenges and opportunities will these disruptive developments bring about for du and society as a whole?</h4><p>Our non-connectivity business grew by more than 85% in 2017, and this is our fastest growth track, even though over 95% of our business comes from the connectivity business. With non-connectivity as the primary growth driver, our main focus on the connectivity side of business is to extract higher efficiency and better margins. One should expect an acceleration of disruptive developments. Conversations around the balance between the technologically possible, economically viable, societally beneficial, humanly rewarding, and ethically compatible are needed. The recent World Government Summit in Dubai was one of the most developed platforms for these conversations at the level of government, industry, and academia, and these conversations need to happen. In the UAE, we have a Minister of Artificial Intelligence, which is great to ensure we make full use of the opportunities of technology. We also have a Minister of Happiness, Minister of Tolerance, and Minister of Youth, reminding us we need an integrated conversation about all this. Another important disruptive development is the move to a decentralized ecosystem. New opportunities and these technologies can serve the noble ambition of serving people's happiness. </p><h4>du develops the Smart Dubai Platform that serves as a central operating system of the city. What features make the Smart Dubai Platform one of a kind?</h4><p>Other smart cities in the world are smart in one or just a few dimensions. In Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum has set the target for Dubai to be at the forefront of the transformation of cities and nations and to be the smartest and happiest city in the world. In the Dubai Smart City ambition, six dimensions will be addressed. This ambition is incomparable to any other smart city development in the world, and having this broader scope means the data connected from these sensors, IoT, and multiple government departments that interact will be richer than ever. This will allow new capabilities not only for users, citizens, and visitors, but also for the city when it comes to better planning, anticipation, insights, and analytics. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of your latest technological projects?</h4><p>TRA, in line with the UAE Vision 2021, is working continuously to facilitate new ICT technologies in the UAE for the happiness of its citizens. Our future enables students to make their career decisions at an early stage, and virtual reality takes them through exploration journeys of different professions needed in the UAE. The system also provides a gamified assessment experience to test students' skills and interests and provide them with recommended professions. Our vision is to boost the efficiency of our future manpower to drive the nation ahead. Moreover, we undertook a project to install a low power FM radio station at Sheikh Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain to relay commentary to the People of Determination in real time through special headsets, an innovative project that was shortlisted at the UK Ideas competition.</p><h4>What are your plans to make government services more efficient and accessible?</h4><p>Our focus for the next period is on service integration and connectedness. We need to focus on quality and excellence to increase satisfaction and happiness. In this sense, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE's Vice President, has stressed the four directions we need to work on: quality, usage, satisfaction, and integration. In addition, we are exploring new trends in digital government, of which data exchange and analysis are key components. As such, we are developing a new approach, linking e-government services with new trends related to the fourth industrial revolution, such as artificial intelligence, IoT, big data, and so on.</p><h4>What is the TRA's position on net neutrality and how will it impact the business community in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>TRA has always supported the notion of net neutrality and will continue to monitor the ongoing appropriateness of this position. In any case, TRA will need to review the potential impact of the recent change of position in the US. This is because the impact could be extensive given the US' position as the largest market for internet players.</p><h4>What is your perspective on synergies between the telecommunication and media sectors in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>As media and the telecom sectors become increasingly interrelated, the synergies between the two sectors are an opportunity to enable capabilities and technologies to be captured and used in the best way possible. TRA works closely with all broadcasters and specialized media zones for the broadcasting and radio frequencies for the transmission and ancillary requirements. While enabling such synergies, TRA will continue to enforce the Telecommunications Law to protect consumers. Today, ICT has made it easy for everyone to own their media channel and make their voices heard. This indicates huge opportunities for the future of the media landscape. This is why our smart government initiative is focusing on eParticipation as a useful method to increase the role of the public in designing policies and services.</p><h4>How does TRA work with private and public sector partners to further its own goals and develop the UAE's economy?</h4><p>It is essential to consider the interests and needs of consumers and industry players—whether public or private—when regulating the sector. Thus, TRA works closely with various industry players, including telecommunications operators, technology developers, content providers, as well as other stakeholders. The industry has established its own group (UCMIG) to represent members' interests, and the TRA has established another open forum to include the sector in the development of regulations. This is particularly relevant when it comes to issues related to the development of technologies. The UAE National Agenda highlights the importance of infrastructure and aims for the UAE to be among the best in the world. Leading in telecommunications infrastructure will allow the UAE to become a forerunner in the provision of smart services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[john-opubor-managing-partner-coronation-capital]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us some background into your business and activities?</h4><p>Coronation Capital is focused on the key sectors of Financial Services, Consumer Goods &amp; Services, and Technology Solutions in Nigeria and other West African economies. We bring together dynamic businesses and strong management teams which together can create stable platforms for future growth and expansion in home markets and throughout West Africa and the entire continent. Our goal is to create African champions. All businesses in Africa, even those that have performed well over time, require a great deal of work to develop into champions. For us, a major component of that success comes from focusing on environmental, societal, and governance issues (ESG). We believe strongly that in order to create a sustainable and successful business one must be focused on successfully addressing ESG issues. We spend a great deal of time working with companies to inculcate these vital aspects of a modern business.</p><h4>What is your strategy to identify companies with attractive investment opportunities?</h4><p>We focus on our strengths. For example, we actively seek to invest in the financial services sector where we have deep institutional knowledge and a history of real leadership from both an operations and investment perspective. We are also focused broadly on consumer products and services. For us, consumer includes food and beverage, retail, and quick-serve restaurants, as well as light manufacturing, education, and healthcare. The consumer space is important for us, because a large part of the Nigerian and African story are the attractive demographics. These demographics speak to a growing, youthful population moving into the middle class that demands products and services. Additionally, we look at technology-enabled solutions. This includes fintech, insurance products that are online, or any innovative way that solves a problem we find in our market.</p><h4>How large is the typical company you invest in?</h4><p>We typically look to write equity checks of USD10-25 million. If we are investing in a platform we may scale that investment over time with add-on acquisitions. This generally translates into companies with USD15-50 million. We are able to structure our transactions in a way that meet the needs of investee company shareholders and also provide us the flexibility to optimally manage our investments and exits.</p><h4>What is the role of capital markets in the economic development of Nigeria?</h4><p>This is an interesting and vexing question. Our capital markets are not as robust as they could be. Capital markets are a way that many companies around the world finance their operations. However, the lack of IPOs is a real challenge in this market. It is a multifaceted issue, and there are different ways to tackle it. As a nation and as individual market participants, we are trying to find ways to advance the ball. For example, we have a budding pension industry in Nigeria, which is broadly modeled on the Chilean system. This model has proven to be a huge success in Chile. At one point, there were 20 or so pension businesses, though over time regulations and business development whittled this down to a handful of strong players. The contribution scheme is such that pension funds have to invest a large amount of capital into the Chilean stock market. This created a robust capital market in Chile, and it has been an engine of growth in the country. We hope for something like that to occur here. We still have many pension businesses, though there will be a great deal of consolidation over time. The pension regulator has done well facilitating the industry, and it is looking to the future. We would like to see more focus from the pension businesses in capital market investments as well investing in alternative assets like private equity. This is a two-way issue though, because we need enough businesses to invest in, as well as a desire and capacity to invest. We also need an environment that encourages this investment. We need other policy solutions to ensure capital markets work properly. There are a number of things that need to be put in place to encourage capital market expansion.</p><h4>How would you assess the environment for entrepreneurs and businesses people in the country seeking equity investments?</h4><p>I think the country would benefit from a broader investment ecosystem and this includes support for companies in their early development stage. When this system is robust, there is greater specialization, which creates a deeper and more diverse pipeline for investment. Part of what we need is a more mature ecosystem, and this is a challenge. There are few businesses outside of the oil and gas industry that are large enough for a USD50 million equity check. For a country the size of Nigeria there should be many more companies of scale than are currently present. That said, Africa as a whole is extremely entrepreneurial and the amount of drive and innovation taking place now is inspiring.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Coronation Capital in 2019?</h4><p>We are extremely bullish. The coming election has its own challenges and opportunities. Generally, pre-election years see strong demand to get deals done. We are seeing the same trends now. The currency seems to have stabilized, and this is a positive indicator. For us, 2019 looks positive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar Airways Cargo has been recognized by STAT Trade Times as the “International Cargo Airline of the Year." What were the main contributing factors for this recognition?</h4><p>Qatar Airways Cargo has received much recognition and the award for the International Cargo Airline of the Year is one of the latest. In 2017, we received at least three international awards and five to six regional awards; therefore, it is a great moment of pride for us, especially considering that these are based on a voting system. The recognition by STAT Trade Times and others are mostly due to Qatar Airways' customer-focused approach. Qatar Airways Cargo has grown a lot, the growth is nothing but the result of the satisfaction of its customers. In cargo, all airlines fly the same sort of aircraft (Boeing 747F, Boeing 777F, Airbus A330F) and we fly more or less to the same major cargo destinations. Quite often, cargo airlines even fly with the same schedule, meaning that any company's competitive advantage lies in how it deals with its customers. Our new slogan is “Moved by people" and it captures our customer orientation extremely well. On top of that, we are part of the Qatar Airways Group, which has a great reputation worldwide. The network of more than 150 destinations is a great asset for us. In my career in the air cargo industry, I have never seen an airline as “cargo-minded" as Qatar Airways.</p><h4>How has the air freight demand evolved since the start of the new regional trading scheme for Qatar?</h4><p>I was in Melbourne at the time when the illegal blockade was announced. Australia is one of the main providers of meat for Qatar, and overnight, we coordinated with our partners there to increase meat imports from an average of 40 tonnes per day to 120 tonnes. As a result, we even had to transit some of the meat through Bali, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Bangkok. As we realized that the blockade had the potential to create a food shortage, Qatar Airways supported the country by cutting commercial flights and focusing on sending freighters for food supplies. Normally, we handle an average of 15 charters per month but after the blockade in June 2017, we handled the same number daily; this trend lasted for six weeks. For the cargo business, the blockade has caused no impact. On the contrary, we have replaced those destinations with emerging cargo ones, such as Kuwait, Oman, and Iran, among others. While approximately 85% of our cargo volume transits through Doha, imports into Qatar did increase after the blockade, but this accounts for less than 3% of our growth. Our customers never lost their trust in us and have stood by us during the initial difficult times of the blockade. In short, it is business as usual for the cargo division.</p><h4>Qatar is expanding its global commercial reach. With which countries are you seeing airfreight increasing at a faster pace?</h4><p>The international business development initiatives taken by the State of Qatar have created business opportunities for everybody. If there is a business opportunity for a specific industry, it means transportation of goods. I am positive about the outcome of the most recent Qatar Germany Business and Investment Forum. Germany is an extremely important market for us and we hope to increase our operations there. Regarding other markets, the US is becoming more active and the EU has created more demand for us than expected. In Asia, China has always been an important market for us, but Vietnam has stood out lately for its high performance. Equally important, Indian exports have also grown and we have responded by increasing our capacity there. Additionally, Da Nang in Vietnam and Gothenburg in Sweden will be open in December 2018, leading to increased cargo activity. Mombasa in Kenya has also been announced as a new Qatar Airways destination. A major route that we have recently commenced is the transpacific service, direct from Macau — our latest freighter destination in Greater China to Los Angeles in United States., offering businesses greater connectivity and reduced flight times.</p><h4>What is your opinion about the general trends in the cargo industry worldwide?</h4><p>There are two segments of the market that have grown much faster than the market itself. That would be the perishable goods, mostly food and pharmaceuticals. This is a global trend that we observe on all continents. The second element is e-commerce. The impact of buying online on our business has been a game changer.  We recently rolled out an automated mail management system across our network. This is part of our digitalization initiatives that not only enhances the customer experience, but also demonstrates our contribution to the environment by implementing 100 percent paperless operations.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019 and what will be the priorities for Qatar Airways Cargo?</h4><p>We will continue to grow and we are considering further investments in Qatar to cater to the upcoming growth. I really hope that Qatar as a country will keep attracting more foreign investment, especially in different fields that further diversify the economy. I believe the country is on the right track with initiatives such as more free trade zones. The outlook is definitely positive and there are no signals of a slowdown in the air cargo industry in 2019.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did the Four Seasons Group choose Al Maryah Island as its first Abu Dhabi location?</h4><p>Even prior to choosing Al Maryah Island, Abu Dhabi was clearly an important market we wanted to enter. We opted to open a hotel with Mubadala, which owns the property and the entire island, following our usual business model in which we act as operator. It is important for us to partner with the right players, and both financially and strategically Mubadala is a great partner for us in Abu Dhabi. It fully embraces our values of believing in people, quality, and brand, and shares the vision of hotels being excellent investments in the long term. Al Maryah is an exclusive, central area within Abu Dhabi slightly away from the competition, with strong potential for future development given its modern and contemporary location. Being surrounded by many important businesses that contribute in different ways, whether in hospitality, food and beverage, or catering, this property represents a great opportunity. There is more to come, and we look forward to the opening of Al Maryah Central Mall in 2019.</p><h4>What is the Four Seasons' strategy in Abu Dhabi regarding tourists from Asia?</h4><p>The opening of the Louvre is a huge opportunity for us and the city and a great way to differentiate Abu Dhabi from its regional neighbors. We should continue to build upon our image as an artistic and cultural hub in the region. We feel particularly privileged to be physically close to the Louvre and are working toward offering a boat shuttle service to the museum, which will add to the other channels of cooperation we have established so far. This relationship brings opportunities not only to tap into the corporate sector or group segment that populates the hotels during the weekdays, but also to increase and diversify our clientele, especially on weekends. With regard to the growth of tourism coming from Asia, particularly from China, many of them come to this part of the world, whether to the UAE as a final destination or as a stopover. Our group is present in China with many hotels, and we have world sales offices in various Chinese cities. One of our goals for this year is to hire employees who speak fluent Mandarin and understand the culture of our guests. I personally did this in my previous hotel in Casablanca, and it worked extremely well. The Tourism Board and all the tourism authorities should realize the importance of building all sorts of connections with China, including opening more direct airline routes or having more Chinese staff in the tourism sector. There is an erroneous assumption that the Chinese market is a mass one that does not spend large sums of money, but it is a mix, just like any other. Abu Dhabi should always be quality driven and not simply attract the masses. </p><h4>How do you see this developing within the MICE sub-sector?</h4><p>From a political and even business standpoint, Abu Dhabi should not feel shy in front of anyone. It is a dynamic city where many companies have chosen to be located. In Al Maryah, there are many business deals, commercial exchanges, and professional networks being made at the highest levels, which need to continue. When it comes to tourism, we need to be able to tap into all these segments without losing our identity. Abu Dhabi is the right place for a slightly more elite traveler, whether for business or entertainment. We are also the right location for families in general. There is always the temptation to do everything, which one must resist. Abu Dhabi has an exotic element, with beautiful beaches, though we should not turn this into a product for the masses where it ends up losing its charm. Luxury is defined by space and time, both of which people need. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Jumeirah place itself within the competitive Abu Dhabi hospitality sector, and what factors will drive demand moving forward?</h4><p>Jumeirah is a homegrown luxury lifestyle brand in the UAE, and Jumeirah at Etihad Towers is its iconic Abu Dhabi destination, not only for its architecture but also as a culinary destination with 12 restaurants and bars and 174 chefs, many of whom have won awards. For four consecutive years we have been rated number one on TripAdvisor. Our facility not only hosts tourists, but also members of the UAE government, the finance and defense sectors, and delegations from abroad. Competition is not a threat to us. Tourism is also growing, especially in the MICE sector, with more exhibitions coming into the city, such as the International Defense Exhibition-IDEX in 2019, medical conferences and, last but not least, grand weddings. The personalized hospitality and product quality make our hotel a preferred choice for guests. With the recently introduced stimulus package, we are confident that the economy will pick up again. Hence, there is a need to educate and train the next generation of Emiratis to eventually take over the hospitality business, hiring them from academies and letting them gain experience in the industry.</p><h4>What necessary steps should Abu Dhabi take to maintain a competitive edge and differentiate itself in the region?</h4><p>The UAE is not just about its cities; there are UNESCO World Heritage sites and natural landscapes and various things to see and do outside of urban areas, especially in the western region, including 200 islands. Abu Dhabi is not only a six-hour flight from Europe with nice hotels and beaches, but also a peninsula with beautiful sea and island views. We have created attractive offers that are unique in the region. Abu Dhabi is also known as one of the safest cities; the highest level of security is provided for larger events. No matter what one's budget is, there is always a bracket to accommodate one. During Formula One, for example, one can be a part of the VIP crowd or enjoy the race and after-party with the racing team. Abu Dhabi Hill, one of Yas Marina Circuit's iconic landmarks with open grass seating, offers spectators the best views in motorsport without compromising safety. </p><h4>Given the historical high-profile target segment, what direction should the Abu Dhabi tourism industry take to overcome its recent challenges?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is not necessarily geared specifically toward the rich; there is a great mixture of everything. With our push toward cultural activities, a certain class of guests does respond. However, Yas Island focuses more on families, and some of the other attractions here are perfectly suitable for guests of all types. Etihad Airways, which carries 20 million passengers per year, also gives us an advantage: Abu Dhabi is a great stopover that offers thrills and relaxation. There is a great opportunity in the stopover business. Other destinations have done this successfully, and Abu Dhabi has that potential as well. The average rates are going down in the industry, and at the moment, supply outpaces demand. However, numbers are growing, not as fast as we want them too, though it is just a matter of time. Once construction of buildings and infrastructure is over, demand will catch up, provided the geopolitical situation is stable. At the same time, hotel capacity needs to be matched by airlift, though Etihad has been redesigning its routes. The fact that there is growth in our destination is a great success. What we now need to provide is consistency.</p><h4>How can the government enhance the industry from an economic and regulatory perspective?</h4><p>Now that the tourism authorities are working together, we see an interest in visiting “the Emirates" instead of just one city in the UAE. However, the government has to work to attract big organizations and to host exhibitions and conferences on a citywide scale.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you select Nurai Island, and how will demand for it grow in the future?</h4><p>It is a natural island, with white sandy beaches, and its location targets a wide market. The idea was to create something with the same feeling as the Maldives, though on the doorstep of our guests in the region. So far it has been successful; we receive both local and international guests, and growth will continue since Abu Dhabi is growing. In this sense, demand has been mostly driven by Europeans, given their geographical proximity and the number of direct flights; they also happen to stay for a longer time. The Indian market is next, followed by the Russians. There will not be a boom anytime soon for the Chinese market, though it offers a great opportunity for the long term. The Australian market is currently being developed, and there are more Australians coming. Within the umbrella of luxury, we offer families, honeymooners, business executives, and international celebrities complete privacy and comfort, a spa that has become a true driver of tourism, and different types of water sports. In the future, we seek to target diplomatic delegations visiting Abu Dhabi and grow the family segment, for which we are increasing investments in the entertainment business, such as a new water park.</p><h4>What is Abu Dhabi's competitive advantage in driving tourism?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is growing rapidly, and the opening of the Louvre and Warner Bros follow the same tradition of the Emirate becoming a cultural establishment. Abu Dhabi has everything that Dubai offers, albeit with less stress and hassle. Tourists in Dubai are always stuck in traffic, while in Abu Dhabi one can go from any resort to their destination in less than half an hour. This ease of mobility attracts people, who claim beaches in Abu Dhabi are better than Dubai, and where a great deal of attention is given to minimizing pollution through effective sewage systems, solar panels, and waste management practices with regard to food.<br>What are your thoughts on the new investment proposals such as the creation of a Louvre marina and the Hyperloop?<br>Regarding the Louvre marina, it is a necessary investment, and I hope it will be done soon. According to the Louvre manager, the museum cannot have one at the moment for safety reasons, so it will have another marina next door. However, guests would still need to walk 10-15 minutes once they get off the boat, which goes against the concept of luxury. As for the Hyperloop, people would prefer to live in Abu Dhabi, and it will be interesting to see what happens with rentals, which may go up further.</p><h4>What challenges does a luxury hotel manager face in training human resources and maintaining high standards?</h4><p>Unlike what is taught at top management schools, here there is a pressing need to teach and inspect several times until the information is processed. In the beginning, it is not an easy task, though training managers who are willing to learn will adapt faster. Certain personnel may not do a five-star professional job, though they serve from the heart and are able to compensate for the lack of professional technicalities. With the right compensation and incentive structure, we gain their loyalty and keep their morale high; a happy employee equals a happy guest. Each place, like Zaya Nurai, has its own culture and philosophy, and we need to find both workers and guests that fit that mentality. At the moment, we seek Chinese and South American staff to join our German, French, and staff from other nationalities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do the events and exhibitions hosted by ADNEC in the past year reflect the current trends of Abu Dhabi's economic and business environment?</h4><p>ADNEC witnessed a steady growth in the number of exhibitions and events hosted in the past year, which reflects the robustness of our diversified national economy and the growing confidence of global investors in its long-term outlook. Over the past year, ADNEC managed to increase its direct and indirect contribution to non-oil GDP growth of Abu Dhabi—demonstrating our continued support for the objectives of Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 by hosting and/or organizing ADIPEC, IDEX, SIAL, World Skills, and Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, along with other leading events and exhibitions. We also attract and organize a diverse portfolio of high-profile global congresses and exhibitions, the most prominent being the Abu Dhabi International Boat Show's inaugural edition. Business tourism is a key contributor in the growth of Abu Dhabi's tourism sector, and ADNEC contributed AED3.89 billion (USD1.06 billion) to Abu Dhabi's economy in 2017, attracting some 2.082 million visitors to the capital. This also contributed to 693,000 hotel nights occupancy in 2017. All this fast-tracked economic diversification in Abu Dhabi enabled domestic industries to accelerate growth, especially in knowledge-based and export-oriented sectors.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Year of Zayed for the UAE, and how does ADNEC seeks to incorporate this commemoration into its business strategy? </h4><p>Sheikh Zayed's achievements are a remarkable source of pride and honor for everyone in the UAE. It inspires us to work hard to fulfill ADNEC's vision of supporting sustainable economic growth. Sheikh Zayed was keen to preserve the UAE's rich cultural heritage, and ADNEC renews its commitment to preserving the Emirati culture and enriching the lives of residents and visitors alike, by hosting events that cover various cultural and social spectrums. In fact, 2018's edition of the Abu Dhabi Book Fair was in recognition of the late Sheikh, in line with the Year of Zayed initiative. As a company, we are also keen to create awareness among our employees through internal programs and among the community through digital screens installed at our group of companies and our social media channels.</p><h4>How does technology impact the world of event planning in Abu Dhabi? </h4><p>One of ADNEC's main priorities is to make use of the latest technologies to improve the experience of organizers and event planners. By adopting the latest, cutting-edge technologies, we have been able to provide our staff with the tools they need to offer improved services to our clients. Our website allows organizers and exhibitors to order the relevant services needed to prepare for an event of any kind, type, and size, at the click of a button. We have also built a 150MB free Wi-Fi network for all visitors and exhibitors, the fastest in the region among exhibition centers, along with latest technologies in parking systems. At the same time, cooperation with players in the tourism industry, such as the Abu Dhabi Convention Bureau, is crucial to promote Abu Dhabi's MICE credentials globally by bidding for major regional and international exhibitions and internationally rotating association meetings. The key focus is to increase the share of large events and conferences in sectors like science, technology, engineering, education, and healthcare. Moreover, by supporting initiatives such as the Hosted Buyer Program, upgrading our infrastructure and services, and working closely with private organizations through initiatives such as Fikra Labs, Abu Dhabi's list of competitive advantages as a world-class destination will grow. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What new strategic channels is DCT looking at to further increase Abu Dhabi's attractiveness both for residents and visitors?</h4><p>From 2018, DCT Abu Dhabi will continue to build on Abu Dhabi's branding efforts through a major creative destination campaign backed both by an extensive and targeted media strategy and close collaboration between Abu Dhabi's offerings and industry players in business tourism and accessibility. In the leisure tourism segment, the priority remains maintaining the development of new products and improving visitors' experiences. To meet this dual goal, new channels include digital itinerary trip planning, mosque tours, a new Jebel Hafeet trail, and a new investment booklet that will outline the tourism investment opportunities in Abu Dhabi, along with directions on how to proceed with investment. Moreover, digital innovations are crucial to increasing the attractiveness of Abu Dhabi and enhancing guests' experiences. 		    We are also investing in augmented reality technology, which we plan to use at Qasr Al Hosn, and have launched a new Abu Dhabi Culture app that acts as an exhaustive repository of relevant cultural information in the UAE capital. Our events calendar is also a critical factor, with our events bureau continuing to develop a pipeline of recurring private sector-led events by means of the Abu Dhabi Advantage Events incentive scheme. The goal consists of securing between seven and nine new, multi-year content-relevant events during peak travel periods of key source markets—the UAE, GCC, China, and India—which can also be integrated into DCT-led industry platforms. Increasing opportunities for family entertainment is also a firm part of our plans, and Louvre Abu Dhabi is an important step in establishing the Emirate as a beacon of cultural tourism, especially given newly developed cultural attractions such as Bait Al Oud and selected developments on Sir Bani Yas Island. At the same time, the opening of Warner Bros. World also demonstrates our commitment to consistently adding world-class attractions to our overall proposition.</p><h4>How can Abu Dhabi strike a balance between targeting visitors from the East and the Emirate's cultural and natural attractions that are historically catered more for Western tourists?</h4><p>We strike this balance by utilizing our deep understanding of each of our target markets and tailoring our approach accordingly by considering the make-up and requirements of each nationality and how they interact with different types of content and media channels. Within this country-specific tailoring, we also use the available technological innovations to change the 'message' according to not only nationality, but also to individual users. We also ensure we are aware of the drivers of any particular market, namely what would potentially pique their interest in Abu Dhabi, what would make them take that interest to the next level and consider a trip here, and understanding the triggers that would work most effectively to change that 'consideration' into a concrete decision to visit.</p><h4>How can Abu Dhabi's tourism industry combine efforts to drive forward the Emirate's ambition to become a leading destination for MICE tourism?</h4><p>The growing appeal of the city as a destination of choice for leading international associations can be mainly attributed to the top-drawer services and facilities offered all across the Emirate, as well as the tourist experiences for when business is done for the day. Thus, when we target potential MICE clients across the world, we combine these experiences in our messaging. On the business front itself, DCT Abu Dhabi is working with its partners on a new strategy to penetrate corporate business events, leveraging the large meeting room capacity of Abu Dhabi's hotel properties, as well as targeting the development of leisure packages and offers for business tourism. This would increase benefits from business events hosted in the Emirate, develop the healthcare sector's value proposition, position Abu Dhabi as a top destination for corporate MICE events, and increase membership activity in international industry <br>associations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the key to ensuring Abu Dhabi maintains its connection to the past while leading the way in the development of innovative landmarks and assets?</h4><p>This is a matter of maintaining balance; Abu Dhabi is fortunate to have a rich cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible. A core mission of DCT Abu Dhabi is to preserve, promote, and protect heritage sites that embody the compelling history of our country and the region. This will give future generations an awareness of our identity and ensure our heritage is conserved. To illustrate that balance in a practical way, in recent years, DCT has overseen the rejuvenation and restoration of several of the Emirate's ancient cultural sites. The oldest structure in the city of Abu Dhabi, Qasr Al Hosn, will open by the end of 2018 after an extensive process of renovation that seeks to both preserve its rich historic value and transform the site into a technologically advanced tourism and cultural destination. As an example of the overlay in innovation, we are investing in augmented reality technology at Qasr Al Hosn, which will provide users with unique experiences and additional information about the site's physical structure and historic artifacts. The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, one of the capital's most impressive structures, has also been praised for its incorporation of innovative technology. Additionally, the 2017 opening of the Louvre Abu Dhabi was complemented by an array of innovative features that showcase exhibits and enhance educational learning.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Year of Zayed for the cultural ecosystem of Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Our efforts to develop all facets of the cultural ecosystem of Abu Dhabi is a direct result of the late Sheikh Zayed's cultural vision for the nation. He set in motion a plan for the preservation of priceless heritage sites, a goal that we are still fulfilling today. The development of archaeology in the UAE can be traced back to Sheikh Zayed, who understood the importance of unearthing the UAE's unique and interesting past. His encouragement led to the advancement of archaeology in the UAE. As a result, numerous discoveries have now been uncovered, including evidence of human settlement in the country 125,000 years ago. The Year of Zayed is an opportunity to mark and celebrate the massive influence of Sheikh Zayed, in particular his advocacy of our culture. It is a reminder of his noble actions, especially on the centenary of his birth. This influence led to the foundation of a UAE based on the values of unity, solidarity, and tolerance, which in turn paved the way for its prosperity and development.</p><h4>How can Abu Dhabi further strengthen cultural engagement among youth, and what role can technology play in this sense?</h4><p>The events organized by DCT Abu Dhabi across the entire calendar year are carefully planned to appeal to the widest possible demographic; consequently, we always look to ensure that the majority of events or initiatives also have dedicated sections aimed at engaging our younger generations. Events such as the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair and the Mother of the Nation Festival have associated initiatives designed to appeal to a younger audience. There is a strong focus on reinforcing a sense of community, which coincides with boosting cultural awareness and a respect for heritage. Manarat Al Saadiyat, as a facility, and some of the cultural events in Al Ain within the Al Ain Cultural program, are examples of our attempts to specifically target and improve cultural engagement for young people. Moreover, one of the key features of effective communication and education for the youth consists of the correct use of technology. Our existing and future museums are designed to create a receptive environment, allowing for further interactivity and engagement. This is an area that we will continuously develop to ensure that the experiences on offer to a younger generation remain ahead of the curve. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key priorities for the Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development for the current year, and how do they align with UAE Vision 2021? </h4><p>Under the direction of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, 2018 will see the launch of the UAE Cultural Development Fund to support cultural activities within the country and encourage projects aimed at promoting the development of the UAE's cultural products. Sheikh Mohammed has also directed the launch of a “Creative Industries Contributions Index," which will assess the economic returns of cultural activities in the UAE and highlight the cultural sector's contributions to the country's continued development. In line with these and UAE Vision 2021, we are currently underway with the development of the National Cultural agenda for 2030, in addition to the development of a comprehensive cultural resource mapping initiative in a bid to cement the UAE's standing as an incubator for cultural contribution. Our main objectives at the Ministry are to reinvigorate and evolve the cultural sector of the UAE in an effort to disrupt and grow the creative industries and cultivate and support creative talent, especially among our youth. We aspire to have a strong impact in the cultural realm not just for our youth and country, but for the region as a whole, bringing to the world the best of what the UAE has to offer.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Year of Zayed for the cultural ecosystem of the UAE and what are the main learning points one can apply today? </h4><p>The UAE's cultural ecosystem thrives today due to the vision of our founding father, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who once said “Science and culture are the cornerstones of civilization, progress, and nation building." The Year of Zayed represents an opportunity for us to preserve our distinctive national identity while also contributing to our ever-expanding cultural landscape by embracing the values that the late Sheikh Zayed held in such high regard, including tolerance, respect, openness, and unity. It is thanks to these tenets that the UAE has been able to embrace world renowned cultural institutions and creative events across the UAE including the Louvre Abu Dhabi, the Dubai International Film Festival, and the Sharjah Art Biennial. Our mission is to continue fostering an environment that values culture, exchange, and creativity. To do so, we must follow in the footsteps of the late Sheikh Zayed and celebrate the cultural diversity that this united nation stands for. </p><h4>What will be the major challenges and opportunities that digitalization brings to entities in promoting knowledge development? </h4><p>As the UAE moves toward a future of AI-driven creativity and culture, the ways in which we produce and consume will be transformed. By supporting an AI-driven creative economy in line with its Centennial Plan 2071, the UAE is set to become a global leader in the future of AI. The role of the ministry is to enable, facilitate, and empower a creative ecosystem through partnerships between the UAE government, the private sector, and creatives to ensure that everyone can be a part of this progress. Although AI may disrupt some jobs, it will also impact job creation. Experts believe that by 2020, AI will become a positive net job motivator, creating over 2.3 million jobs worldwide. Embracing this change will enable us to establish government-driven incentives and regulation that signal long-term commitment to bridge the AI-culture divide and provide start-ups with incentives for developing AI-driven products and programs. Building the ecosystem to support this large paradigm shift requires the collaboration of all sectors as well as a “systems leadership" approach to ensure technology develops alongside the cultural norms needed to guide it. A strong regulatory framework based on shared values of ethics and inclusivity is necessary to ensure that the next technological wave lifts everyone with it, and builds strong, happy, and successful generations for decades to come. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mastering-industry-40]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the story behind the formation of Exechon Enterprises?</h4><p>It is a long story that started in my garage in 1985, where I ran my own production engineering company. Then, one day, I received a request from a major Swedish company to perform the automatic assembly of phone relays. The result was the first PKM, Tricep, which gained popularity among major aviation OEMs and automotive companies. Eventually, further technological developments led to the current carbon-fiber XMINI, which leads to better productivity efficiencies at the highest levels of technology. To achieve the specifications of the XMINI, it was essential to reduce both the size and weight of the unit by scaling the previously proven XT design as well as replacing previous heavy components with new lighter components. Given these achievements, today we are able to significantly contribute to the UAE's Industry 4.0 movement, applying our technology to a wide variety of sectors.</p><h4>What role does Exechon Enterprises play within Industry 4.0, and what is its growth strategy in the region? </h4><p>Exechon Enterprises is a joint venture that provides the most advanced Parallel Kinematic Machine technology capable of transforming manufacturing processes and adapting to integrated factory workflows. The advent of new planes and cars, which have new shapes and are made out of carbon, plastic, and aluminum, meant that traditional machine tools were outdated. As such, Exechon represents an innovative platform that merges automation and robotics to meet futuristic manufacturing trends, in line with the global trend of Industry 4.0. Since we saw an alignment with the direction that the UAE is determined to take in terms of industrial production, we decided to set up our base here with an international and local partner. Our goal is to provide the market with a machine that is relatively low cost, innovative, and highly accurate, capable of developing the goals of the fourth industrial revolution. Today, part of our strategy is to expand our operations and bring value to other countries in the region to further enable the advent of Industry 4.0. For example, we are planning to enter Saudi Arabia by tapping into aluminum casting, which adds up to the aluminum profile manufacturing we have in the UAE.</p><h4>How does Exechon add value to the technological profile of the country? </h4><p>Exechon is playing an additional role in the country based on its experience in robotics: our machine is built to suit the needs of companies working across the construction, automotive, and aerospace sectors. Indeed, our product has the ability to replace human efforts in a more efficient way, disrupting the market to raise the level of UAE's technical capabilities and productivity. There is growing interest from younger generations to learn how automation can impact the productivity of the country, and technology can help this transition by enticing Emiratis to work in an industrial setting. Automation is a global trend and presents different issues: some jobs will be disrupted, while others will be created. The UAE is at the forefront of this trend, and with a growing population and skill set, the country is set to advance with its transformative technological efforts. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the driver behind the MoU with Ethiopian Airlines, and what role does Africa play within TS&amp;S's strategy?</h4><p>Given our strong position in the Middle East, we are bullish about the African market and believe there is no better partner than Ethiopian Airlines to work with in the African continent in the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) business. Ethiopian Airlines has the largest and most modern fleet in Africa, coupled with the ambition to establish MRO capability on the continent, which is still in its nascent stages. As such, we saw an opportunity to enter the African market, whether that is materialized through a physical presence or a hybrid model that takes advantage of Africa's low labor costs and Abu Dhabi's infrastructure for high-end repairs.</p><h4>How do you expect demand within the MRO industry to evolve in the future, given the growing ambitions of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)?</h4><p>The MENA region is the second-fastest growing region in terms of aviation activity and the largest region in terms of oil and gas production. This growth and future projections play a massive role in our strategic ambitions and direction setting. Our business has grown threefold since 2014, and the target is to continue on this growth trajectory. As a company focused on turbines, we offer solutions to both the aerospace segment and industrial applications used in the energy and power industries. The industry is witnessing a trend of consolidation and integration of OEMs not just on the aerospace side, but also in the after-market following the sale of equipment, instruments and machine articles. Our strategy is to act as the partner of choice for international OEMs and MROs in the Middle East, such as Siemens, General Electric and Rolls-Royce, especially as the entire focus shifts towards localization underpinned by the growth in the region. Moreover, local turbine operators feel contented having their engines in their sight, not to mention the cost savings that close access to an MRO facility brings to their bottom line given that reduces the transport cost and improves the turnaround time.</p><h4>How should an investor position itself with regards to the R&amp;D efforts that seek to impact the aerospace manufacturing industry?</h4><p>All major companies invest significantly in R&amp;D. This does not mean we disregard returns; all investments in technological upgrades need to be based on a balanced strategy. As such, TS&amp;S on the one hand purchases trusted, well-known technologies, and on the other, seeks to grow its R&amp;D efforts with the aim of having a multiplier effect on the underlying performance of the business. These two approaches reflect two different risk-exposures: one that looks at a shorter time frame to collect yields, and another that is catered toward longer-term, strategic investors. Investments in R&amp;D should be aligned with the wider strategic objectives of the industry with measurable outcomes.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the ecosystem around the MRO industry in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>On the research side, local academic institutions such as Khalifa University offer excellent resources. Linking academia with industry leads to benefits on both sides, and Abu Dhabi is encouraging this aspect in a concrete way. Aside from research, the MRO business is rapidly growing here, and we would like to see sustainable growth and healthy competition that will support positioning Abu Dhabi as a regional and global MRO hub. Having more competitors helps to create an environment where TS&amp;S is not the only player, but part of a larger ecosystem that links infrastructure and talent. This would also address the major challenges the industry is facing today, one of which is the shortage of skilled technicians. We are meeting this challenge through a program where we take high school graduates from technical institutions and place them in a two-year program at TS&amp;S, at the end of which they are certified to work on various engine platforms. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define the core strategy of Airbus in Africa and Middle East and its relations with suppliers and MROs?</h4><p>Airbus is extremely proud of the strong and positive presence it has established in the Middle East and Africa over the last four decades. We employ more than 3,000 people across Africa and the Middle East and are committed to supporting the development and growth of a sustainable aerospace sector in the region. Our strategy takes into account the tremendous potential for further growth and expansion of the aviation sector in the Middle East. We can cite several examples of our deep and growing relationships with regional OEMs and suppliers. In the UAE, Airbus works with Strata Manufacturing (a Mubadala company) and TPI (Tawazun Group) directly and via Tier-1 suppliers including FACC, SAAB, and SABCA. In Morocco and Tunisia, strategic partnerships that we have developed via STELIA (100% subsidiary of Airbus) have played an instrumental role in enabling both countries to act as major suppliers on Airbus programs. We aim to leverage new digital technologies to help transform the regional MRO industry. We have the support of a number of quality MROs in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and we continue to invest in these partnerships. Airbus is also a proud partner of all leading regional airlines, including Emirates, Etihad Airways, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Kuwait Airways, and Air Arabia, among others.</p><h4>How does the Airbus industrial partnership approach exemplify standards of cooperation between an OEM and local players?</h4><p>Airbus has invested in the regional industrial footprint through numerous commercial agreements and partnerships in several countries such as the UAE, Tunisia, and Morocco. Not only does this contribute to the Airbus global supply chain efficiency; it also creates opportunities for skills development and the stimulation of new revenue streams for local economies. It also provides important incubators for local talent to address the global talent shortages in the fields of aviation and aerospace. In the UAE, Strata Manufacturing produces composite components for the A330, A330neo, A350 XWB, and A380 aircraft, while TPI produces metallic parts for the A320, A320neo, and A330 programs. In both Morocco and Tunisia, Airbus suppliers and the Airbus subsidiary Stelia utilize a highly skilled workforce and take advantage of the proximity to Europe to source a mix of machined, composite, electrical, and assembled components across all Airbus programs.</p><h4>How does the education and training partnership fit into the company's 2030 strategy?</h4><p>We recognize that developing the skills of regional youths will help foster a new generation of aerospace leaders. To that end, we have launched initiatives such as Future Scientists in the UAE, Entaliq in KSA, and Airbus Little Engineer across the region. Airbus' talent and capacity-building initiatives offer something for everyone, from school students to emerging professionals to university students. The Airbus Little Engineer (ALE) initiative aims to build future talent by re-igniting a passion for STEM subjects at the grass-root level through hands-on robotics workshops. Notably, ALE workshops have been delivered to over 4,000 students from across Africa and the Middle East.</p><h4>Does the industry require automated decision-making to improve its performance?</h4><p>Over the last 10 years, the pace of technological disruption has accelerated drastically, reducing the cost of products and services. As we embrace digital technologies, we move from a hardware-focused approach to an integrated, problem-solving approach that connects software, hardware, and customer perspectives. Increasing automation in all fields of the aviation and aerospace industry is an inevitable phenomenon that will only grow in magnitude in the years to come. Our Hangar of the Future combines various technologies that together speed up maintenance and improve efficiency. Our new aviation data platform, Skywise, in collaboration with Palantir Technologies, a pioneer in big data integration and advanced analytics, is a single platform of reference used by major aviation players. It is already improving the performance of industrial operations throughout Airbus' industrial footprint and allows the delivery of enhanced aircraft and equipment designs and better service and support offerings based on deeper in-service data insights. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main accomplishments and milestones for MBRSC over the past year?</h4><p>2017 was a busy year for MBRSC; in April of 2017, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan visited the center and re-launched the UAE national space program, placing it under the auspices of MBRSC. The national program consists of four main initiatives, the first being the UAE satellite development program, which is based in South Korea in collaboration with our partners there. Thus far, the program has successfully launched three satellites and will soon launch a satellite—designed, built, and tested in the UAE—from Japan in 4Q2018. Our second initiative is the Mars exploration program, which is the Arab world's first mission to the red planet. Since Mars presents similar challenges and conditions to the UAE's own challenges, the third initiative is the Mars 2117 Strategy: a century-long strategy aimed at establishing the first inhabitable human settlement on Mars by 2117. Additionally, we want to have a moonshot idea that empowers and inspires the youth. In 2017, we announced MBRSC's plan for a 2-million-sqft Mars Science City, which will be one of the largest Mars simulation cities on earth. The fourth and final initiative is the UAE Astronaut Program. As of March 2018, we had received 4,000 applications, of which 34% were women, 22% were pilots, and 60% were engineers and scientists. 2018 will be spent selecting the final four applicants who will represent the UAE astronaut corps, but only one individual will be chosen for the first space mission. The UAE is cementing its place in the field of space; last year, Dubai was chosen to host the International Astronautical Congress in 2020, which will be largest-such gathering with around 6,000 attendees.</p><h4>How do you see the importance of MBRSC in the UAE's vision of being a knowledge-based economy?</h4><p>Space is one of the seven areas of activity the government has identified as a means of diversifying our economy away from hydrocarbons. Getting the youth involved is one of the ways to generate interest and activity, eventually creating numerous high-tech jobs. Since the field of space is a niche market, MBRSC is focused on ensuring that people with unique skillsets have a great place to work. Perhaps the largest way in which we contribute to the UAE vision is through inspiration. If we can show the youth of the country that we can go to Mars, we will be able to inspire them to further transform the country for the better. </p><h4>How can the UAE's economy take advantage of the research and technological development at MBRSC?</h4><p>The Mars Science City is one such project because the technologies or resources developed to go to Mars can be utilized to meet challenges in the UAE. Additionally, developing satellites requires a technological infrastructure that creates relevant data for a number of ministries. For example, the program will provide Dubai with imaging technologies that will allow officials to easily and effectively track changes in the metropolitan area. We are developing another satellite specifically for the Dubai Municipality to detect CO2 emissions from the city. It has a carbon networking station on the ground, and this satellite will serve to verify the data it is collecting. The vast amount of data that will be collected will have a vital impact on the lives of citizens in the UAE and around the globe. </p><h4>What will be the significance of the launch of KhalifaSat for the development of the UAE's space industry?</h4><p>The launch of KhalifaSat will be one of the biggest steps in the space program. By undergoing a process of knowledge transfer over the last 15 years, the UAE now has the capability to design and build its own satellites. Similarly, the UAE can now partner with other countries to develop their space programs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the mandate of the UAE Space Agency adapted to the evolution of the space sector?</h4><p>The entire UAE space program has established roots and can be credited to the late Sheikh Zayed's vision in the 1970s, when he started asking questions about space missions. At that time, there was no specific program, though there was an underlying interest in educating people. In 1997, Thuraya Telecommunications Company was set up, the first mobile satellite communications company that now owns and operates two geostationary satellites. Then, the Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology was launched, which later merged with Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre. Mubadala established YahSat in 2007, and the government realized it needed an umbrella in 2014 to oversee all these players, creating the UAE Space Agency, and outlined its mission to Mars as part of its National Space Vision. For the government, the most important thing has been the journey, not the destination. We try to include a scientific purpose to the entire journey to understand what learning lessons can be transferred to Earth. We need to team up with the international space community to ask big questions not specific to countries, but to humanity.</p><h4>What major learning points is the UAE Space Agency taking from the financial and legal framework being set up for the Mars mission?</h4><p>We were mandated by the government to create a sustainable space program and needed to work by the book. We are working on a Space Law and will be one of the few countries with a comprehensive space regulatory framework. Our space program is for peaceful reasons and requires long-term planning, focusing on human capacity and the next space engineers. This is where we work with universities and research centers, and push for social media and awareness campaigns.</p><h4>How does the UAE Space Agency seek to strike a balance between transferring technology skills and knowledge and maintaining control over its intellectual property?</h4><p>We are hungry for knowledge, and cooperating with international space agencies provides a fantastic overlap. We have signed over 20 agreements and have established an international advisory committee. We meet twice a year, helping us engage with different stakeholders.</p><h4>Where should further research efforts and investments be made and why?</h4><p>The government has announced the Mars 2117 project, which aims to establish the first city on Mars. Our environment is not that different from Mars; we face the same challenges. For example, Mars today is a desert, with no atmosphere; however, we can see and tell from the structure of the planet that there was once water there. If the best scientists in the world are employed to solve issues on Mars, spin-off solutions will be applied on Earth. That is how most inventions in fact come to be used in our daily lives. This is why the UAE government is building a Mars scientific city in Dubai.</p><h4>What is the best way forward to attract and promote young Emiratis to become space scientists and technology pioneers?</h4><p>The UAE has announced a plan to establish a human space flight program to develop astronauts. These are all big projects that have spurred a great deal of interest from young people. Our regional neighbors are looking on with curiosity at our efforts. Most international space agencies come here because they appreciate what we are doing.</p><h4>How can the UAE spacy industry develop a solid private ecosystem?</h4><p>We are putting in place the right regulation to attract and protect investment in the UAE space program. The government is funding exploration missions, though we want to see the private sector play a greater role. I assisted in the launch of Al Yah 3 satellite, which will provide vital connectivity to over 600 million people in Brazil and South America. We are also looking at strategies to attract international investors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Road Safety]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[road-safety]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major updates with regards to road safety in the country?</h4><p>As per the statistics, there has been a remarkable drop in the percentages of road accidents and fatalities in Q12018: 11% drop in road accidents, 22% percentage drop in road fatalities, and 14% drop in injuries compared to the same period in 2017. There has also been a 50% drop in the percentage of fatalities due to car accidents even after an 11% increase in number of vehicles and 6% increase in license holders. Working closely with the traffic department, we highlighted the main cause of these accidents, which does not depend on the skills of the driver, the vehicle's abilities, or the driving experience, but the driver's attitude and behavior. After some thorough research, we realized it depends on the environment in which the student is raised and their initial source of information about driving and motor vehicles. Thus, we have been working on spreading safety awareness, targeting all ages, from aged 6-10 to teenagers and adults. This awareness campaign has been delivered by participating in traffic and educational-related events and also social media.</p><h4>Can you give us a few examples of the major challenges with regards to changing drivers' attitudes?</h4><p>More people mean more vehicles on the road, which in turn increases the risk of traffic instability. This is a huge challenge for us and the traffic departments, and, therefore, we work together to monitor handle, and control the change using methods of education, awareness, rules, and regulations. Another major challenge is mobile phone usage while driving. Highlighting it to the youth and showing examples of its dangers will have a positive impact on road safety. Another issue is related to the use of seat belts: most people only follow the law to avoid fines. However, when we directly communicate with them and let them experience our rolling car, for example, they understand the real importance of buckling up. The private sector has been showing great concern about safety measures in all fields, initiating annual events for employees and visitors to offer training and information needed during possible critical situations.</p><h4>What are the major cross-border risk-management approaches that countries in the region should focus on developing?</h4><p>During the annual Gulf Traffic Week, GCC companies meet and discuss the growth of the traffic system, the status of traffic, the facts and statistics of the traffic system, how it is managed, and new methods and technologies that have been introduced to give a positive impact. As per studies on risk management, drivers still need to learn the proper defensive driving skills in order to remain alert. To that end, we have introduced defensive driving training courses where we develop drivers' skills. This will then be extended as training services to major companies involved in large-scale production. Moreover, EDC has been leading the way to foster cooperation and communication across police and emergency departments. </p><h4>How will sustainability and eco-friendly measures impact the transport sector in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Electric vehicles, or green vehicles, are the future. Current transportation vehicles heavily affect the environment, emitting almost 25% of the world's greenhouse gas emission volume. As green vehicles are completely electric, technology focuses more on developing electricity sourcing instead of using the old method of consumption. In terms of congestion, a communication system has been enhanced on these vehicles. Vehicles will be able to communicate to give drivers estimates and solutions when it comes to congestion in certain areas. Nonetheless, we cannot only depend on upgrading vehicles; the road structure will definitely have to be developed to adapt to the UAE's growing population. Therefore, other methods of transportation such as trams, metros, and electric buses should be installed.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major developments and trends in Abu Dhabi and the UAE that the automobile leasing industry needs to keep an eye on?</h4><p>Many public and private companies are becoming more financially savvy, making sure their financial returns are well reflected in their year-end results. Thus, the decision to switch their fleets to leasing and external management is becoming smoother. We see both private and public-sector entities moving away from ownership of vehicles to operating leases as it helps them to budget and control their costs more efficiently. LeasePlan Emirates was one of the first players to introduce and specialize in operating leases in the UAE. We see continuous growth in the leasing market. Notably, there is significant demand from multinationals operating locally, who were already used to leasing in other countries. In addition, government entities in the UAE are increasingly opting for leasing. Recently, SMEs are also understanding how leasing could be beneficial. Equally important, even in an economic downturn, the nature of the leasing business model remains resilient because of the long-term nature of the product. </p><h4>How and where is technology having an impact in the automobile leasing and fleet management industry?</h4><p>Technological breakthroughs impact businesses around the globe, and the leasing and fleet management industry is no exception. In our case, LeasePlan Corp in the Netherlands invests heavily in creating and improving the technology available to our staff, as well as to our customers. New digital products plus applications are introduced across all countries on a continuous basis. This provides LeasePlan Emirates with the backbone infrastructure, systems, and organizational processes which enable us to provide easy-to-use, cost-efficient solutions, such as tracking the performance of their fleets on a number of key metrics in close to real time. Furthermore, LeasePlan Emirates invests heavily in its presence on social media platforms to promote the LeasePlan brand and product portfolio.</p><h4>Can you expand on the strategy behind the entrance in the B2C segment, and how do you consider the preferences of the younger generations? </h4><p>Recently, LeasePlan launched an operating lease product for individuals. The market for used cars has been volatile in recent years, and people have not been able to resell their vehicles according to their expected prices, especially if they are in a hurry to sell. Leasing removes such a risk, and its total costs are competitive compared to ownership costs. The UAE's youth is made up of digital natives, expecting businesses to provide them with the tools to make informed decisions. One example of how LeasePlan is catering to their needs is through its mobile app, which allows customers to manage vehicle information, book maintenance appointments, and communicate with our staff. Companies such as Uber or Careem should not scare the auto-leasing industry; we should look at opportunities to collaborate. LeasePlan, for example, has a successful collaboration with Uber in several European countries.</p><h4>Will environmental regulations force readjustments in the auto industry?</h4><p>According to various studies on the prospects of electric cars and autonomous driving, the US market will have 60% driverless cars by 2030. I would not be surprised if the UAE is one of the early countries to follow, not only from an infrastructure perspective but also from a regulatory one. For example, Tesla disrupted the car market with electric cars, and it will be interesting to see how the market adjusts when other companies do the same.</p><h4>What is LeasePlan Emirates' competitive advantage?</h4><p>One of the important strengths of LeasePlan Emirates is that we are brand independent, so we can offer multiple brands whereas most of our competitors are aligned with one brand or another. In the UAE, Japanese brands such as Toyota, Nissan, and Mitsubishi are the most popular. However, we do have clients who would like to have a mix, including European and US-based brands in their fleets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Big on the Fundamentals]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[big-on-the-fundamentals]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major trends in the UAE's logistics market over the last year, and what are its prospects for the future?</h4><p>The largest factors in the success of UAE's logistic sector have been the commitment, consistency, and size of investments in ports, airports, roads, and, in the last few years, rail. Sizable expansions come every year, which shows why the UAE has been ranked among the top-three most attractive markets for logistics over the past four years, according to the Agility Emerging Market Logistics Index 2018. The index takes three factors into consideration, and one of them is market size, on which the UAE cannot be compared to India, China, and other large emerging markets. The two other factors, market connectedness and market compatibility, are truly where the UAE shines. Transport and logistics is a key sector, and while there may be some delays, the government has signaled just how serious it is in terms of investing in the sector. We are extremely bullish about the opportunities in the market, particularly with the entry of COSCO and MSC; it will bring in larger volumes and attract more companies.</p><h4>Given your bullish outlook, which area of logistics has the most potential to grow in the short to medium term?</h4><p>There are substantial investments in every area of the sector; although from a growth perspective, rail will see the most development because it will go from being almost non-existent to truly changing the way cargo is transported in the UAE. Air and ocean cargo are both projected to grow, though I do not know which will grow faster, as significant investments are occurring in both segments. In terms of air transport, investment and development have been ongoing for the last three years, and current projects are scheduled to be completed by 2019. Capacity is increasing greatly, and roads to support this capacity are also being ramped up; our highway infrastructure has seen widespread expansion in a number of areas. On the ports side, cargo mostly goes to Khalifa Port, with Mina Zayed receiving some project shipments. In the future, all shipments will go to Khalifa port, with Mina Zayed becoming a terminal for cruise and passenger ships.</p><h4>How do you expect automation to impact the industrial supply chains in the UAE?</h4><p>Digital platforms are being developed, and more people are becoming connected over time. Eventually, all stakeholders will be connected to these platforms via smart processes, making all process significantly faster, facilitating trade, and having a direct impact on GDP growth. At present, blockchain technology is being used to facilitate this growth: all parties will log in to the same ledger and exchange data, increasing the transparency of the process and expediting the shipping of goods. We are participating with Maersk-IBM on its blockchain-enabled shipping solution designed to promote more efficient and secure global trade. In terms of locating production close to customers, we witness this trend catching on globally. New technologies make production cheaper, and for certain industries and applications, the organizational model that produces solely for the export market makes sense, though it does not apply to all industries. Certain industries will still need to be produced far from markets and shipped in, like electronics.</p><h4>How will the expansion of online retail impact logistics?</h4><p>E-commerce has been gaining traction at a global level in the last few years, in particular in emerging markets. As a logistics service provider, this forced us to enter the last-mile delivery space, and we have been making headway in this area. Large-scale firms, such as Amazon, prefer to develop their own in-house logistics, though the market still has many vibrant smaller players interested in outsourcing these services. Every retailer with an online presence needs a logistics provider, therefore, logistics service providers will continue to dominate this space and benefit from this trend. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the driver behind the MoU signed with Emirates Global Aluminum (EGA), and how can this set an example for other companies?</h4><p>As a fully integrated solution provider, Abu Dhabi Ports takes a holistic approach with regards to its industrial zone. The agreement with EGA, one of the world's biggest producers of aluminium, fits into our dedicated strategy that goes beyond the port gates, both at home and abroad. This strategy is reflected both in our support in the development of EGA's state-of-the-art facility in Taweelah for a bauxite refinery and in the management of its terminal in Conakry, Guinea, which will be integrated next year. Thus, it is clear our support toward EGA is not just geared locally, but wherever EGA exists, whether that implies taking care of the logistics around its business or handling its raw materials and finished products at all levels. We also signed a strategic deal with COSCO, giving them a home port to handle their cargo, and another one with MSC, handling their cargo and transshipment to Abu Dhabi Terminals. Of course, these announcements imply major infrastructure expansion on our side, which will contribute even further to putting Abu Dhabi on the map for commercially oriented clients.<br>What does 2018 mean for the group's strategy, and how do you expect your TEU to evolve over the next five years?<br>2018 is the start of the huge and major expansion of our facilities, such as the Khalifa Port, Fujairah Terminal, and in Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (KIZAD), with many developments coming along that will be announced to keep the trade world aware of our progress and expansion. Khalifa Port's overall capacity will jump from 2.5 to 8.5 million TEUs, requiring a huge amount of investment and infrastructure. The numbers highlight the dramatic expansion: for 48 years, Abu Dhabi handled 1.5 million TEUs; however, after signing the agreement with MSC, it will handle more than 2.5 million TEUs in 2019. Indeed, over the next five years, we aim to add more than 6 million TEUs. As such, we will be expanding ADT's footprint in order to handle and increase the capacity from 2.5 million to 5.5 million TEUs. </p><h4>What are the next steps to ensure the whole process is digitalized and efficient for both port operators and clients? </h4><p>Without an automated system, we would not be able handle 8.5 million TEUs within five years or switch billion-dirham assets. Because of our forward-looking mindset, we built a system that speaks both the local and the international language. In addition, Maqta Gateway, an Abu Dhabi Ports subsidiary, is developing digital solutions that ensure smooth transport and logistics operations. It operates the single window for Abu Dhabi, allowing parties to submit information and documents with a single-entry point to fulfill all import, export, and transit-related regulatory requirements. We are the only port linked to ports in China and Europe, and we are one of the first ports to work on blockchain to meet the needs of our clients and community. These efforts reflect our positioning as an international company that seeks to meet the growing interest of international clients, an interest reflected in multiple investments into KIZAD from Brazil, Europe, and the Far East. Abu Dhabi's positioning at the heart of the Silk Road and the prominence of our clients such as COSCO and MSC is a testament to our competitive advantage, and technology gives an added value to compete on a global scale. </p><h4>What impact will the relationship with China have on Abu Dhabi's industrial sector? </h4><p>The strategy lies in attracting Chinese investments, in the form of factories, to the industrial zone. We are encouraging FDI because we cover all requirements needed to set-up a business here, which solidifies our position as the best destination for FDI. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does your portfolio evolution reflect the trends and opportunities in the F&amp;B market in Abu Dhabi and UAE?</h4><p>The roots of Agthia go back to four decades ago, when it was founded by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan as a flour mills and animal feed company. When Agthia was established as part of the government's privatization initiative in 2004, it had already added a water plant onto its business base. From these two building blocks, in less than a decade it grew its assets over 10 times, becoming today one of the largest F&amp;B companies in the UAE. A solid determination to make Agthia one of the UAE economy's non-oil diversification pillars in line with the vision of our leadership has been a major driver of this exponential growth. While accomplishing our commercial objectives, we also constituted a major backbone for food security in Abu Dhabi and the UAE over these years. Although it was not an easy task, Agthia has proven to the market and investors over the years that its business model is sustainable and profitable and goes hand in hand with the growth of the UAE. Today, our ambition is to become a USD1-billion company by 2020, and one of our strategic priorities to achieve this goal is to remain dynamic and expand: we want to think beyond our region, we want to think global. In the UAE and the GCC, we have expanded through acquisitions, and we have also entered Turkey and Egypt. To support this expansion, we had to transform ourselves from being a majority agribusiness to a more consumer business. As such, we embraced a total mind shift from a B2B model to a B2C one, requiring special attention to the latest marketing and innovation trends around us.</p><h4>Can you briefly touch on the investments to develop both human capacity and brand equity within your group strategy?</h4><p>Developing and retaining a top-caliber human resource is important to ensure stability and alignment with our strategy, regardless of the ups and downs of the UAE and GCC economies. As a company, we have been focusing heavily on training and developing our employees at different stages of their careers, whether one is a fresh graduate, a middle manager or an executive. Through our Agthia Academy in our own Al Wathba facilities, we liaise with many academic institutions and bring in prominent people to share their invaluable experiences and learning with us. Regarding our brand equity, our flagship Al Ain Water is not only a well-known brand but also a highly trusted one by the UAE consumers. This is why we are the market leaders in water, and our other products are in almost every shelf of modern trade shops. Our relentless focus on the highest quality products and customer service in addition to our passion to listen to and address the evolving needs of the consumers has been our recipe.</p><h4>How do you project e-commerce and new digital technologies to impact the UAE market?</h4><p>E-commerce is not new to us and it has become an indispensable milestone for our growth. For example, a significant portion of our B2B business is already based on e-commerce, and we are actively leading the conversion from analog to digital of the municipality retail stores which we are operating on behalf of the Abu Dhabi Municipality. Our Agthia mobile app has been in the service for a number of years at the fingertips of our customers: clearly, this highlights our strategy aimed at fully integrating our brick and mortar, ecommerce and home delivery operations. This integration is an interesting challenge for a company within the F&amp;B sector: just think that even major diversified multinationals had their challenges in providing fresh food online only and had to figure out ways to integrate bricks and mortars within their business. That being said, it is a fact that e-commerce is taking away business from the physical retail store segment, and the market is adjusting to what is undoubtedly a global trend.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your priorities for Foodco Holding, and how do they reflect the opportunities in the local FMCG industry?</h4><p>Foodco is coming out of the cycle of former strategic plans that almost tripled the size of the company in the past four years.  We are now embarking on a transformation program and designing the next strategic business plan to take the company over the 2020 horizon and double the size of the present business. In doing so, we will have to realign Foodco's portfolio and become the first choice for quality, wellness, and nutritious food products in the entire GCC. The company's aim is to provide the good taste of life for our consumers by consistently delivering quality, nutritious, and high-value food products while creating value for our stakeholders and employees. Moreover, we will connect with consumers through Foodco Innovative Brands and Products Portfolio, ensuring they have excellent execution at all points of purchase, and optimized services in an efficient and simplified environment, achieved on the back of talented people working for the company.</p><h4>What trends have you seen among consumers?</h4><p>Floating populations are growing as the UAE increasingly becomes a travel hub. Consumers are also cutting back on their expenses and becoming more aware and confident about their needs in terms of health and nutrition. As a result, deciding between ready-to-eat or home-made food has become a day-to-day decision. Similarly, choosing between eating at a restaurant or ordering take away is another question consumers ask themselves. Packaging proposals and offers will have to address those needs, which will vary based on families' incomes.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the UAE's organic food market?</h4><p>According to studies on consumer attitudes towards health and organic food, more than 70% of the sampled population in the UAE acknowledged the health and environmental benefits of buying and eating organic foods, and around 80% favor improving availability, pricing, and education in relation to organic produce. At present, availability and price are seen as major barriers; however, availability is gradually improving, and leading western-style supermarket and hypermarket chains are increasing their organic product ranges. Previously, organic foods were mainly found in specialist chains. In terms of demand, organic reduced fat milk is the most dynamic, while organic baby food has also seen huge growth. Nonetheless, organic products still represent only 10% of items at any store. Therefore, producers still need to find the right balance between cost and quality.</p><h4>How have new technologies changed the FMCG sector?</h4><p>In order to understand the needs of a modern-day consumer, we need to understand changing consumer habits. Traditional retail style purchases have slowed down in recent years due to economic challenges. Comparatively, e-commerce is expected to grow as access to internet applications increases. Digitization has brought in new ways to connect with consumers, affecting the entire supply chain. In terms of delivery, there is still great potential, but there are still significant issues that hamper the full development of online shopping in the region. Even in considerably developed countries such as some European countries, the percentage of online orders for giant hypermarkets remain minimal. The consumer still has an emotional attachment with walking through the supermarket and pushing trolleys, and technology may not have as big of a disruption as we expected. The chain of processing and ordering deliveries lacks automation. Once that is achieved, online shopping will grow.<br>How can you increase the participation of locals while still bringing in foreign expertise?<br>It is more about an individual's willingness to deliver. In doing so, we must integrate and consider wherever and whenever a local candidate is available. The policies regarding competition will allow us to bring in the best and most qualified candidates for the benefits of the company and the entire community. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the drive behind the cooperation agreement with Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), and what role does organic agriculture play in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>The driver behind this agreement was to provide financial services to both Emirati and Japanese companies operating in the UAE and to strengthen communications with the best international institutions. The ultimate goal is to transfer and localize modern agricultural techniques to build the capacity of national farmers. This will improve both the efficiency of the production chain and the technical and economic feasibility studies of proposed agricultural techniques. In terms of priorities, the areas of cooperation between ADFSC and SMBC are focused on protecting agriculture and post-harvest techniques; supporting the transition to modern agriculture; and ensuring the sustainability of water and soil resources, such as efficient cooling systems for greenhouses, the production of organic vegetables, and green waste technologies. At the same time, we are working with 25 farms in Abu Dhabi to convert them to organic agriculture and seek to convert a further 100 over the next four years. Our organic agriculture experts are working with these farmers to apply organic pesticides and biological control systems to reduce the use of chemicals in agriculture, whether fertilizers or pesticides. All this is consistent with the sustainability strategy of Abu Dhabi's government.</p><h4>How do you project consumer demand to evolve in the near future, and how does the agriculture sector plan to adjust to this evolution?<br></h4><p>ADFSC offers educational and extension services via a network of 27 offices to local farmers to improve farming practices, resulting in higher production levels and better-quality crops while conserving the country's environmental resources. ADFSC also partners with retailers and large corporate and government customers to provide them with a secure supply of quality local produce fresh from Abu Dhabi farms. Working closely with retailers allows us to learn consumer demands and current supply trends. This knowledge means that we work effectively with farmers to ensure that the industry grows the right quantities of the right food. Through its Farmers' Trusted Partner, ADFSC provides on-farm advisory and technical services, as well as the necessary inputs to help farmers grow larger volumes of better quality crops, which, in turn, leads to higher incomes. Moreover, we constantly seek to develop new and strengthen existing marketing links to wholesale and retail outlets by providing modern, efficient supply chain services, including the packaging and marketing of products. Bringing the high-quality agricultural products to the market is the main barrier to promoting the local product's competitiveness. In this regard, ADFSC created a brand of local products called “Local Harvest" that offers all UAE residents and visitors alike locally grown fruits and vegetables that meet and exceed international standards of quality and taste, directly from our farms in Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>What does Abu Dhabi need to do to ensure a balance between food security, the conservation of wildlife and marine resources, and economic stability?</h4><p>Water consumption in agriculture is the main challenge, which is countered through the development and maintenance of efficient forms of irrigation. In this sense, there has been a strong push to educate farmers on several issues: the quantity of new systems such as inline pressure compensating dripline and adjustable online drip irrigation systems; the dosage of water for crops such as date palms; and the introduction of hydroponic technology, which can dramatically cut water use by 80% and have a major impact on agricultural profitability in Abu Dhabi. This technology in particular will enable farmers to grow crops outside the traditional off-season throughout the whole year, leading to the achievement of better returns and provision of high-quality products. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important are PPPs models in ensuring growth in the food industry, and what role does ADFCA play in this context?</h4><p>ADFCA plays a major role in the development of food industries in Abu Dhabi by empowering food importers and establishments in the private sector. ADFCA firmly believes that effective PPPs and integrated efforts are pre-requisites to ensuring food safety and the food sector's development. This is visible not only through the specialized technical training ADFCA provides traders and companies regarding food-handling, but also through ADFCA's strategic partnership with SIAL Middle East, an exhibition that looks at the whole food supply chain to bridge the demand-supply gap throughout the region. ADFCA remains committed to promoting the quality of local produce by introducing risk-analysis procedures and technologies, while supporting local farmers in the UAE's through the Farmers Income Support Program. Farm owners who meet the necessary requirements—around 14,000 of Abu Dhabi's 24,000, are eligible for basic financial aid of around USD21,770 annually, paid in monthly installments.</p><h4>What are the latest strategic guidelines in ensuring food security within Abu Dhabi's agribusiness environment?</h4><p>By keeping up with the latest technologies in food processing, ADFCA seeks to adopt a full transition from routine inspections to a comprehensive verification model of self-monitoring and auditing of food establishments by the end of 2020. This masterplan will be achieved by introducing an intelligent control system to achieve efficiency in inspections and food control mechanisms; ensuring efficient inspections of the Emirate's ports; and maintaining high food safety levels while promoting ADFCA as an internationally recognized leader in intelligent control systems. </p><h4>Where do you see areas of growth and opportunity within the agricultural sector and what are some recent success stories of local companies?</h4><p>Over the last decade, there has been significant growth in crop yields of fresh vegetables and livestock production. The UAE's agroecological climate provides comparatively better opportunities for open field and greenhouse vegetable production in winter months. Farm infrastructure, efficient and rational use of natural resources, and farm inputs are factors in enhancing the yield per unit area. In the last three years, a 50% increase in crop diversification has been observed, as more than 60 different recorded types of vegetables were cultivated in 2017, compared to 32 varieties in 2013. These numbers are confirmed by the achievements of local actors. For example, Excalibur Farms in Al Rahba has increased its plant cultivars to 30 different varieties, compared to nine in 2013. Similarly, Elite Agro now grows 22 fruits and vegetable cultivars. In 2017, Alfalfa Agricultural extended operations to 10 farms from four in 2012, increasing the cultivated area by 230% and production by 320% with 25 cultivars. With one major retailer creating a Farmers' Club for local producers who comply with sustainable certification requirements, and other retailers regularly promoting local products to increase consumption, there is confidence for local companies to expand.</p><h4>What efforts are being taken to enhance Abu Dhabi's reputation as an attractive destination for foreign investors?</h4><p>ADFCA collaborates with federal and local authorities to facilitate the provision of services to investors in the food sector, including the Abu Dhabi Business Center, which was set up to issue electronic business licenses. Moreover, we participate in several food fairs, including hosting SIAL Middle East in Abu Dhabi for eight consecutive years, which facilitated around USD1 billion in deals in 2017 alone. The event involved more than 1,072 exhibitors, 34 international pavilions, and 26,044 visitors. We also participated in SIAL China 2017 to showcase our commitment to developing food-based commercial activities. In response to the creation of the Abu Dhabi Investment Office, ADFCA formed the Investment Committee, which has identified 15 essential areas of investment. As ADFCA is responsible for the entire food chain, the committee oversees inbound and outbound investment opportunities for animal, plant, and aquaculture value chains. The Investment Committee is mandated to encourage PPPs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Exeed Industries redefining its business model to increase efficiency in its used material and ensure a sustainable line of business?  </h4><p>
	Industry in general is going through an important transformation, and the construction industry is not insulated from this revolution. Today, there are countless new building materials, or reinterpretations of existing materials that are bringing dramatic improvements in manufacturing processes, transportation or installation costs, and quality. At Exeed Industries, we understand that we need to take advantage of these changes. We will continue using cement, steel, and chemical admixtures, but modern technology such as nano-materials present innovative possibilities in terms of design and performance. One interesting example is graphene, a nano-material from graphite whose supply is controlled by China, its biggest producer. We are in a country that is rich with oil; therefore, if we can collaborate with and control the downstream areas of this industry, we have a major opportunity to produce innovative materials at a competitive price.
</p><h4>
	How do you expect the supply chain of the industry to adapt to technologies such as 3D printing?
</h4><p>
	Although it seems surprising, 3D printing has been around for 25 years, and a relevant number of important industrial companies around the world are already employing it to manufacture spare parts and consumables. It might have come a little late to the UAE, but recently there has been a serious political push to keep these technologies at the fore. However, for 3D printing to have an impact, it must support operations and reduce costs in a sustainable way. For example, if we talk about the building materials industry, 3D-printed concrete is an interesting new technology but its effectiveness is yet to be proven. Undoubtedly, these technologies will dramatically reduce the amount of labor input required to produce concrete, but there is a great deal of trial and error left to work through. At present, there is a need to invest in the technology as well as people in order to change the mindset. At the same time, businesses should get used to think laterally in order to transform in pace with technological advances.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on how economies should adjust to the trends you mentioned in industrial construction?</h4><p>
	The public and private sectors have to shift from thinking about only efficiency to considering effectiveness as one of the main drivers of the future. The coordination and communication between the government and corporate stakeholders is essential to making sure that change is effectively implemented. Education is another important area that requires much better coordination. Universities and institutes are a precious source of talent, and we have to ensure that they are an active part in affecting change on the ground.</p><h4>How do you expect demand to evolve in Abu Dhabi and the UAE?</h4><p>By using indicators such as market size and expected development, some reports are predicting around 5% growth in the construction industry over the next five years. However, according to our analysis, the target market will remain largely the same in the next few years, but the number of completed projects will rise.  This means that even if the economy grows well, we must change our operations and focus, which is why we are looking at exports. There are good potential markets for our products in Africa, for example, and we have plans to carry out field studies there in the near future. Since Africa is a vast continent, we are eyeing opportunities in East, West, and Central Africa. These are challenging yet exciting times to be in our business line. Whilst we look to the export markets, we also note that the UAE construction industry continues to surprise the world with new and innovative solutions and designs. Exeed Industries is proud to be part of the UAE's industry ,and we remain confident that the UAE will continue to provide growth opportunities as more new developments are announced. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[fulfilling-the-vision]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the performance of the UAE's construction sector over the last year?</h4><p>The significance of winning the right to host Expo 2020 generated an enormous amount of construction opportunities both directly and indirectly, and this had a knock-on impact on companies, which were finally able to get their noses above water. Arabtec picked up a good share of the work last year, with the bulk of that being Dubai-centric, as we are working on projects both within the Expo site and associated with Expo that are to finish by end-2019 or 1Q2020. Hosting the Expo is probably one of the most material events I have seen, and it will drive economic growth. </p><h4>How has Arabtec fared in these circumstances? </h4><p>Arabtec had a transformational year in 2017; with the capital raising, we were able to rebuild the balance sheet and bid, win, and deliver projects. Our biggest success last year was the completion of the Louvre in Abu Dhabi. It doesn't only hold a strong cultural and historical significance for the Gulf and the Middle East; it is also an important piece of architectural infrastructure. The trend remains extremely positive, as I have witnessed the most positive start to a year on a global level after many years.</p><h4>How is Arabtec's international footprint developing?</h4><p>In 2017, 100% of the work that we won was in the UAE, of which 85-90% was in Dubai. Outside of the UAE, we are still looking at other markets. Saudi Arabia, heading toward its Vision 2030, could be an interesting source of opportunities. Egypt is another market that may offer growth opportunities because of its population, resources, history, and culture. Notably, we have some projects in Bahrain. Outside of the Middle East, we have Abu Dhabi Plaza in Kazakhstan, though that is also a client from the UAE. </p><h4>How does Arabtec champion innovation in the construction industry?</h4><p>The construction industry is a low margin business and tends not to reinvest in innovation. Looking at the UAE, we have a relatively low-cost, unskilled and semi-skilled workforce, which means that companies do not always drive productivity the way they should. I do, however, see that changing. Our duty here, as a contractor, is to deliver on the nation's vision, and a key driver of the UAE's vision revolves around sustainability and innovation. One of the ways the construction industry is innovating is through BIM and computer-aided engineering with 3D modeling. One of the biggest challenges for the UAE is to ensure that the knowledge and competencies it has invested in remains within the country.</p><h4>How are your ambitions and priorities in line with Vision 2030?</h4><p>When we start developing our business plans, we take into account the environment we operate in. The first thing we do is look at the vision for the nation and where the leaders are looking to take it. Our job is to then participate and deliver on that vision, whether that is hosting the Expo, increasing financial services, or promoting tourism. In general, our outlook for the next few years is positive. When Abu Dhabi Midfield Terminal opens, it will be the most spectacular airport in the world and will be a major hub for Etihad and the wider region. As a group strategy for 2018, our priority will be to improve cost savings and benefits through integrated supply-chain management and an internal simplification of the Group's operating structure. On one hand, this will go through the integration of BIM, 3D modelling, and embracing technology into new projects, always bearing in mind our target of reducing waste through innovation and modularization. On the other hand, we seek to pursue opportunities in the infrastructure sector while divesting non-core assets. Our workforce productivity has to improve, and our short-term debt requires restructuring. With these priorities in mind, we are committed to rebasing the business to create a lean and agile organization—one with a can-do culture. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the company's priorities shifted over time?</h4><p>Pivot has been in the market since the late 1970s and is 100% owned by UAE nationals, with 65% owned by Aldar alone. Although we have considered exploring opportunities abroad, we mostly work within the UAE, with most of our projects in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. At present, we have projects worth over AED2.5 billion in our backlog. We are selective of our clients, and do not deal with anyone until we make sure a prospective client has the financial capability to fulfill the project. In the past, the majority of our operations were in Abu Dhabi; however, with the current market situation we are shifting more toward Dubai. Recently, we closed two big projects in Abu Dhabi, namely Mussafa Gardens Residential Tower and Saraya Tower. At present, we only have one project in Abu Dhabi, with Abu Dhabi Airports Company (ADAC). In Dubai, we have ongoing projects such as malls and hotels with Emaar, Dubai Properties, and numerous private individuals. Previously we completed villa projects with Damac in Dubai and are now bidding for more similar projects with Nishmi, Deyyar, and Dubai South. In general, Dubai offers more business in terms of villas and high-rise buildings. For example, we recently completed two big projects for Emirati housing, each one comprising 1,000 villas. Pivot will continue to build housing projects, no matter if they are villas or high-rise buildings.</p><h4>What would you define as your competitive advantage?</h4><p>Our advantage is that we not only work as contractors, but also have mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) services. That gives us an advantage because we have more control construction elements and can always have competitive prices in MEP. Equally important, we have great support from our shareholders and board. The company has excellent liquidity levels and great banking facilities, which opens more doors to quality projects.</p><h4>How do you look at sustainability when approaching a new project?</h4><p>We have a five-year plan that is rolling, so we update it every year to cope with developments in the country and industry. Our growth vehicle is not our own; sometimes we enter into joint ventures (JVs). For example, in Saadiyat we have a JV with San Jose, a Spanish company. We are building Mamsha al Saadiyat, a AED1.25-billion project. We have built several projects in line with the standards set under the Estadama program. Today, Pearl-1 is the minimum level for any building, but Pivot has several buildings with Pearl 2 and 3 standards in its portfolio; we focus on energy conservation and savings to improve the overall quality of life. Being cost conscious, environmentally conscious, and introducing technological innovations is key in our line of business.</p><h4>What do you see for Pivot in the coming years?</h4><p>Under current market conditions, our main challenge is high competition. Hopefully, the number of quality projects will increase and filter out the competition. Then, we can have better opportunities and better margins to operate with. If the market doesn't change in the near future, a number of good contractors will disappear from the market. The market has changed immensely; in the past there were not enough contractors bidding on projects, forcing developers to urge companies to make a bid. With that in mind, it is important to maintain healthy competition in the market. In a mature market, a developer always opts to give time and space to the contractor to work and earn a decent profit. In short, healthy competition is always welcome.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Have you experienced any significant changes in the UAE's construction market over the past few years?T</h4><p>The UAE is the land of opportunity and advancement, which is evident when we look around this beautiful country. I have not perceived a drastic change per se, but rather a reorganization of the market and technology advancements with integration of various processes. Over the years, the UAE has been more focused on sustainability and green construction, which is a growing field in construction. Many projects and plans are incorporating green technology into the construction process. It is a way of building projects in an environmentally responsible and resource-efficient way from planning to design, to construction, maintenance, and demolition. These methods are not that diverse from the archetypal building methods since the economy, efficacy, and durability are all important facets of the process; however, sustainable construction can include the conservation of the environment, an efficient use of resources, with an eye to social progress and culture. Another growing trend is modular and prefabricated construction projects. Modular construction is a prefabricated approach to building repetitive structure because of the amount of material, time, and flexibility of it. Technology is also at a peak currently. Construction PM Software is getting better and better with addition of new features. Many PM solutions are bundling scheduling, project management, and time in order to better serve construction companies.</p><h4>How does innovation impact the real estate and construction sector in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Sustainability remains a key issue, and it is now part of the design of every new building. However, there is always space for innovation in construction. One of the main trends is the adoption of various technologies as a part of innovate construction. Secure Engineering has implemented building information modeling (BIM), which not only increases association, but also reduces construction costs and promotes a safer building process that will result in faster construction and minimize safety incidents. Use of BIM seen to increase in the last year and moving forward it will be a part of the construction and building codes since it is now a 6D approach. Another new innovative approach is the use of drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which helps to access remote locations, collect data, complete safety inspections, and capture project progress. Surveyors use them to create 3D mapping or images that later can be used to depict an area. As a growing organization, we need to take advantage of new technologies and embrace change to position ourselves in the growing market.</p><h4>What practices and methods do you have in place to develop local talent?</h4><p>Since the inception of Secure Engineering in 2010, we have grown and entered into different facets of engineering field. We think about developing local talent in many ways. One way is to give our staff a clear idea about the industry by training them on new construction methods, market performance, and project management. We also encourage employees in positions that will allow them to develop their skills and advance in their career. As a result of these practices, we now have more than 10% local employees out of our workforce of 1,000-plus people.</p><h4>Where do Secure Engineering's priorities lie in the coming years?</h4><p>We have already entered and expanded our operations into the other Emirates, particularly Dubai and the Northern Emirates. We believe it is the right time for us with our right resources &amp; infrastructure, particularly in the hospitality and real estate segments. Secure Engineering has established its roots in the capital city Abu Dhabi; in addition, our three priority segments regarding infrastructure will be road construction, bridges, and storm water, which we will focus on in the following years. We have already undertaken major development projects and have diversified our offerings into hospitality, real estate, construction and facilities management. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[staying-ahead-of-trends]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you describe the evolution of your portfolio and how it reflects recent economic trends in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Trojan Holding was founded in 2009 with 50 employees. After months of diligent work, we were granted our first major contract, with the Institute of Applied Technology in 2010, and continued this momentum into early 2013 by winning a contract for 5,000 villas in Al Ain. Trojan Holding started to expand outside the UAE in 2013 with projects in Seychelles, Jordan, Russia, Morocco, Serbia, and Belarus, among others. In 2015, we started to expand into the Dubai market and worked with the largest developers in the Emirate, such as Emaar, Nakheel, and Damac. The economic crisis in 2008-2009 forced many companies to suspend operations, but we managed to remain active. We expect to maintain this steady growth in the year on the back of strong contract wins during 2017. In the medium term, the residential segment shows the greatest potential; the region is the main producer of oil and gas in the world, and has traditionally been a potential market for us. In addition, population growth in the UAE and the GCC creates more opportunities across the board, from hospitality to utilities. Our five-year plan includes expansion to other areas, for example, opening a branch in Saudi Arabia. We aim to diversify our activities and go beyond residential real estate, with plans to include power plants and oil and gas construction projects.</p><h4>How can the UAE, and specifically Abu Dhabi, strike a balance between attracting foreign talent and developing local skills?</h4><p>The UAE is a large, ambitious country with a medium-sized population. Of the 9.4 million inhabitants, approximately 1 million are Emiratis. However, I do not see an imbalance or competition; we are a multicultural country. In an attempt to create a local skilled workforce, we launched a countrywide vocational initiative that offered 100 of the UAE's engineering students an opportunity to gain some invaluable experience at Trojan Holding. Proud of our heritage as a local company, we always look for locals to work with us. A company that wants to work and expand across the world requires a multicultural approach. </p><h4>How is technology shaping the construction and real estate industries?</h4><p>The UAE is one of the most advanced countries in terms of adopting technologies and robotics, ranging from software to materials and management. If we compare our volume of construction to other countries, we are extremely efficient and productive. Trojan Holding has adapted new technologies across the board, from aluminum to water works, construction sites, logistics, new equipment, and architecture and construction methodology. Technology has a greater role to play across the construction sector, including design, planning, and management. However, the greatest potential is found in using robotics on construction sites. Although it is in its early stages, we will see a massive jump in this field within five years. The government will have to ensure that state-of-the-art technologies are available to help create safe and sustainable growth. We expect the public sector to test and investigate new technologies that are appropriate and sustainable, and to adopt these across all sectors. In the past, for example, design and construction parameters were standardized across all types of housing.</p><h4>Where do you see the greatest growth risks for Trojan Holding and the construction sector in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>The world is changing the way it consumes energy, and this will of course have some impact on oil rich cities like Abu Dhabi. Fortunately, the UAE has contained the problem arising from fluctuations in the oil and gas market. Moreover, the government has been studying the risks and is trying to further stabilize growth. On our side, there has been an effort to shift from traditional and conventional ways to more sustainable practices. These include using solar panels, more environmentally friendly materials, and lower fuel consumption equipment. We have launched many initiatives at Trojan Holding and these fall in line with Vision 2021 and Vision 2030. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the evolution of Manazel's portfolio reflect  trends in the Abu Dhabi real estate sector?</h4><p>Since its inception, the company's portfolio was created with a vision to provide a holistic, self-sustainable living environment that requires a long-term view. This can be seen in all our project launches since 2006; they were all consecutive residential, commercial, and retail developments. In particular, we look for energy-saving techniques that cut running costs, connecting developments through district cooling plants. A prime example of this concept is Al Reef 1, which provides its 17,000 residents with retail options and clean energy solutions. Another example is the district cooling plant that connects Capital Mall with the land that will feature Manazel Medical City and other future developments. Manazel continues to look for opportunities to target the mid-market segment within the UAE and MENA at large, despite tight margins and the risk of oversupply. In doing so, we will leverage our strong and highly capable workforce, made up of many UAE nationals occupying various positions across all levels of the organization and its subsidiaries.</p><h4>How do you project demand for your properties to evolve in the near future, and how does Manazel seek to adjust to this evolution?</h4><p>In terms of clients, the company has built a solid brand value synonymous with the mid-income segment. The mid-market segment represents a different target compared to the majority of developers and investors engaged in the UAE's luxury real estate market. However, in light of the new economic changes, Manazel has sought to diversify its revenue stream through a varied portfolio to insulate itself from the volatility of the property market. The company has been strategically utilizing existing lands and branching into healthcare, education, and other non-cyclical sectors with recurring income.</p><h4>What could revitalize the property sector in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>The growth of the property sector is strongly tied to investor demand and sentiment, which are in turn highly influenced by macroeconomic signals. Abu Dhabi's economic growth is greatly reliant on the performance of the oil sector, which plays a crucial role in creating demand for both residential and commercial property. Over the last few years, the UAE has taken a number of steps to reduce its dependence on oil by encouraging the growth of several non-oil sectors such as healthcare, education, and technology, among others, while also increasing government funds through VAT. The signs are positive, with recent reports from SCAD reporting a YoY GDP growth of 5.3% for Abu Dhabi in 3Q2017. We have witnessed a gradual increase in investor sentiment since the start of 2018.</p><h4>How is technology shaping the real estate and facility management industry in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>As a developer, business intelligence is extremely important in order to pace the launch of projects, and we have seen this aspect being incorporated at the government level in the Dubai Land Department's Smart Investment. Technologies such as virtual reality and 3D printing will be a large part of the real estate and construction business in the years to come, and, just as in the finance and health industry, developers will have to adapt in order to remain competitive.</p><h4>What are the biggest opportunities in the real estate market, and how would you assess the impact of the new regulatory measures?</h4><p>The UAE real estate market is supported by the country's strong levels of market growth and sound planning; hence, it will eventually resume its performance. The current offering of premium value is not only domestic, but also for international investors. Thus, more regulations were a necessary step to continue to attract investors and increase confidence. This is true for the real estate market and for other key non-oil sectors. Investors in the UAE seek unique real estate that gives stable yields and insulation from market volatility in growing markets such as healthcare and education. With this in mind, the company has and will continue to carefully cultivate its portfolio to meet investor needs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will are some major developments for Miral in 2018?</h4><p>In addition to hosting the 10th Formula One race in Abu Dhabi, the biggest achievement of 2018 was the addition of two new attractions to Yas Island. One of them is Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi, which opened in July 2018 and is the largest indoor theme park in the world, with six different immersive worlds, each with its own characters and theme; it is a game-changer for theme parks and entertainment within the region. There are 29 new rides, attractions, and shows catering to a range of ages, with well-known characters from Warner Bros. all under one roof.  To further expand on our guests' experience, we also built a website that allows visitors to personalize their experience before they arrive at the park. The second project is CLYMB, which has the world's largest indoor skydiving facility with the highest indoor climbing wall at a height of 43m. The attraction is the tallest point on Yas Island at 60m in height, connected to Yas Mall and Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, making visits even more convenient. These 2018 projects are a reflection of the vision that Abu Dhabi's leaders had in 2006, and the new heights we have reached since then. In September 2016, we launched a new vision for Yas Island and targeted 48 million visits by 2022. Two future milestones that will help us achieve that goal are Yas Bay, which is a major project in development at the Southern part of Yas Island, and SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, planned to open in 2019 and 2022 respectively.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on how residential and business tourism fits into Yas Island?</h4><p>To date, only 40% of Yas Island is currently developed and the island spans 25 million sqm in total, which is about a third of the size of Abu Dhabi Island. We aim to welcome 10,000 residents who call Yas Island  home and 100,000 corporate travellers. With seven existing hotels and venues and more coming in the future, Yas Island currently provides a wide array of venues and options to the business tourism segement. The Yas Bay development is composed of three distinct areas; a vibrant public waterfront and entertainment district; the Media Zone, featuring the new campus of twofour54; and the Residences at Yas Bay, an urban island community that offers the complete Yas Island lifestyle. Yas Bay will provide a new 18,000-capacity arena for indoor sporting events, concerts, weddings, and meetings, with a customizable space for different scale functions. Yas Bay will also feature two hotels, including a Hilton family resort and a lifestyle hotel, adding 900 rooms to the leisure and business traveler market. Furthermore, the Residences at Yas Bay features 35 plots available for investors and developers to transform them into a vibrant residential neighborhood for urban professionals and families.</p><h4>How does Yas Island distinguish itself from other tourist destinations?</h4><p>Yas Island is a unique leisure and entertainment destination in the region, with varied and exciting theme parks like Ferrari World Abu Dhabi and Yas Waterworld, as well as Yas Mall, Yas Beach, Yas Links , Yas Marina and many more—all within 3-5 minutes of travel time from one another. We continue to work with our partners to ready our unique transportation solution called SkyTran, which will be rolled out by the end of 2019. The integrated transportation system will link all of our assets for the first time ever, allowing guests with cars to travel from one place to another in a matter of minutes. We continue to develop Yas Island into one of the world's top family entertainment and leisure destinations and put it on the global travel and tourism map as a key player in a highly comepetitive market. To remain inspiring, we work hard to stay ahead of the game.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you walk us through the concept behind IMKAN and its position within the real estate market?</h4><p>We are young company fueled by a visionary board with excellent long-term strategies, revolving around the belief that the real estate business needed a completely different perspective. Over the last 10-15 years, the industry has not been going through major changes. Prior to this, there was an incredible period of development that marked the creation of a new era in the real estate development sector. This success was based on an old formula that continued to work for quite some time because industry was experiencing a boom. The success of the previous formula has kept business from advancing and expanding, and we believe that it's now time for a new model for our client base. </p><h4>What role does research play in the development of IMKAN, and in what way does it seek to redefine the real estate industry?</h4><p>Our development team continues to be extremely critical to our operations, while our research platform is one of the key components of what separates us from our competitors. One area of focus is technology, and we have really empowered our young tech research associates to develop the best and most effective technologies with a fresh perspective. Another area of focus is design, through which we research areas that give us a vital edge. We have a team dedicated to researching new and unconventional design spaces like food and fashion. We also employ science research associates that carry out research on sociology, psychology, physics, and other areas related to human behavior. The last area of focus is economics. This part of the team focuses on data analysis and economic trends. One of the examples is that they carry out research on crypto-currency and blockchain, developing ideas and strategies for incorporating this type of technology. </p><h4>How are all these research departments organized, and how do you ensure cohesion among them?</h4><p>These core areas of research all have their own teams. We are extremely collaborative and work to ensure that all of the relevant information is shared and considered in every discipline. Additionally, we utilize an ever-changing pool of student interns, from some of the top institutions both regionally and globally. These students add vitality and vision to these various areas, allowing us to stay on top of all regional and global trends. Each area of focus has created a set of filters that define and direct the projects we work on. This has meant that our developments progress slowly, as projects take 18 months to develop; however, this deliberate speed is exceedingly important to be able to create something that will not only succeed in a financial sense, but also change the entire industry.</p><h4>Can you walk us through some specific examples on how this large research effort translates into an original approach impacting the urban space?</h4><p>So far, our research arm has looked into a vast array of different components. According to our research, people use their cars only 4% of the time, a fact that has led to a decrease in car purchases. Autonomous vehicle technology is going to change the automotive landscape with several implications. Driverless cars can be put to work as part of the shared economy, constantly moving and reducing overall demand for cars and parking. This leads to another consideration we obtained through our research: parking structures are beginning to lose money; Los Angeles, for example, has enough parking lot space to cover four San Francisco. Thus, we are implementing flexibility into our design projects to remain relevant and vital in years to come; the Artery, our hybrid parking garage and events space is a testament to that. It is being developed to accommodate our parking needs now, while taking into account our future needs. Starting next year, our project in East Cairo, Alburouj will come online with Phase 1 being handed over in 2Q2019. The ultimate goal is still to positively impact the mentality of the consumer and real estate sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see your project portfolio evolving in the near future and how does this evolution fit into Bloom Holding's expansion plans? </h4><p>In terms of diversification in the real estate sector, Bloom has embarked on a sustained path of growth, both vertical and horizontal, offering luxury and middle-income properties. Our diversification is visible across the region as we continue our development activities in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. We have close to 2,000 units in the pipeline and three projects under development. We are also looking at diversifying internationally, with a number of countries on our radar. For instance, we have appointed consultants in Europe, particularly Portugal, which has become an attractive destination for Europeans. Furthermore, we have identified three possibilities that we are studying carefully. We also have a large plot of land in Bucharest in southern Romania. Notably, in the US, we have two projects in the pipeline in Rochester, Minnesota. Apart from the hotel we are building there, the second project under development has become an attractive proposition due to its exclusivity and our collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, along with a number of components that make it a sought-after property. We will have the final green light to commence the construction works on the senior living part in 2018, and we hope to break ground in 4Q2018. </p><h4>How has your education portfolio developed in the last few years?</h4><p>In 2017, we accomplished major achievements, such as partnering with premium education providers. After the success story of our Brighton Colleges in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain, which received the best results of any school in Abu Dhabi, we are opening a new campus for Brighton College and Dwight School, a high-profile private school out of Manhattan, in Dubai in September 2018. Dwight was the first US school to offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) and is an inclusive school with high rates of acceptance to top global universities. Both schools have a third component called a center of excellence for Arabic, where the focus is on out-of-the-box approaches to teaching Arabic language, culture, and arts. The third partnership on the education front is with Mindchamps Singapore, the largest pre-school nursery in Singapore. We have opened our first nursery here in Bloom Gardens, which is now operational, and we will open the second one in Dubai in April and the third in Al Ain, with more locations underway.</p><h4>How do you seek to enter the healthcare market, and what demands have you identified in Abu Dhabi's healthcare sector?</h4><p>We are in the process of opening our first public clinic. Moreover, we are building an ophthalmology hospital in Dubai in collaboration with Spain's Barraquer Ophthalmology Center. We have also branched into fertility clinics, where we have one center in Al Ain and two planned in Saadiyat and Dubai. Our entry into healthcare is a well-calculated step given that it offers us the ability to learn as we progress and expand. Instead of foraying into a sector where there is considerable competition, we would rather focus on what is lacking and what adds value to society.</p><h4>What is your perspective on the efforts of local authorities in terms of urban planning?</h4><p>In Abu Dhabi, the Urban Planning Council (UPC) plays a fundamental role, and it does a sanity check on everything that is taking place in the Emirate. It is concerned about congestion, traffic, and volumes, which helps keep developments reasonable. In Dubai, there are 167,000 units in the pipeline to be delivered over the next five years, which is a big challenge for urban planners and the market, especially in terms of generating demand. In Abu Dhabi, things are more balanced. We work closely with UPC, and it is supportive of our idea to enter into community retail. We are not building mega malls, but talking about communities that need a small supermarket, hair salon, pharmacy, and so on within a 1km radius. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you walk us through the vision and the growth strategy that will drive Aldar in the future?</h4><p>The essence of our brand is that Aldar is home. We are a multi-sector developer with a rich history that over the years has built everything from residential communities to shopping malls, schools, and hospitality assets. However, for every single one of those assets, it is extremely important that the person feels at home, with the term “home" bearing different meanings according to who one is and what they do. Driven by the desire to create memorable moments and spaces to live, play, and work in, we decided to move from just building and selling properties to also managing communities. Today, the company is split 50% between a lifestyle developer of choice and 50% as a landlord of choice, guaranteeing a strong balance sheet through recurring income on an annual basis. This serves as a buffer to navigate the various economic cycles the real estate sector goes through and to capitalize on opportunities out there in the market to create value for our shareholders. For example, we recently completed a successful AED3.7-billion (USD1 billion)  acquisition worth of strategic assets from the Tourism and Development Investment Company, which complemented our offerings in terms of location both under a development and a management point of view, under a 90-day period.</p><h4>What does Aldar's joint venture with Emaar Properties mean for the broader UAE real estate market?</h4><p>Dubai-based Emaar is a larger, more experienced entity with a wide global presence, but it had the ambition to develop a flagship asset in Abu Dhabi on Saadiyat Island: a mixed-use retail, residential, and overall lifestyle-led community between the Louvre of Abu Dhabi, the Guggenheim, and Sheikh Zayed Museum on an amazing island surrounded by water. At the same time, our goal was to develop a strategic asset of residential units on the beach in Dubai, across the coast in between that whole Jumeriah Beach Residence and Dubai marina area and The Palm. We saw an opportunity for the two companies to partner and co-develop, co-design, co-manage, co-sell, and co-brand, establishing this JV worth AED30 billion (USD8.2 billion). This deal should send a message that, given the rapid pace at which the world is changing, there is a need to have the best of the best compete on a global scale, whether that comes through developers, architects, project managers, contracts, technology providers, or interior designers. We are extremely excited about the possibilities of this partnership and hope to form further partnerships both with Emaar and other potential partners.</p><h4>How will the urban landscape of Dubai and Abu Dhabi develop?</h4><p>There is a huge opportunity to invest in this mid-area, and the key will be to marry the growth of the two cities and target the affordable segment with the concept of creating communities. At Cityscape in 2018, we launched a new Alghadeer community, which currently has over 2,000 homes strategically located between Abu Dhabi and Dubai in a relatively underdeveloped area, but where both cities are growing. Abu Dhabi has been developing Khalifa City, Al Raha Beach, Yas Island, and KIZAD, all of which are moving onto Dubai, not to mention the expansion also coming in the other direction in the western region with the nuclear plant and refineries. Dubai has also been moving that way with the expansion of Jebel Ali, the new Al Maktoum Airport, and the theme parks. From an infrastructure point of view, a further concrete sign of convergence is given by the recent extension of Mohammed Bin Zayed highway, while our agreement with Hyperloop represents the willingness to explore futuristic technology. By connecting infrastructure, mobility, and communities we seek to attract both institutional and foreign investors that have a clear idea of the country's wide economic and urban planning vision. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the newly established Investment Office at DPM seek to advance the strategic urban priorities of Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>In close collaboration with the Department of Economic Development (DED), DPM recently established its own investment office to coordinate joint-investment programs and strategic alliances with the private sector. This decision helps reinforce and expand our international partners' network and offer attractive opportunities to key local players. The underlying strategy consists of securing an efficient and reliable framework to guarantee returns on investment, whether that comes through establishing commercially sustainable PPPs, maximizing government assets, or attracting international investments to the Abu Dhabi market. Investors will thus be supported through analyses of local-scale economic data to make timely and better-informed decisions when deploying capital in Abu Dhabi. Moreover, to meet the objectives of the Abu Dhabi Plan and ensure the highest level of delivery capability, DPM recently launched two tailored tools designed to attract and drive sustainable investments: the “partner with us" mobile application and the “Abu Dhabi's Investment Guide to Private Partnerships." Both platforms provide investors with greater transparency via our regulatory framework for PPPs.</p><h4>What are the main challenges in developing a sustainable urban space capable of enriching individuals both socially and culturally, as well as protecting cultural assets?</h4><p>In Abu Dhabi, our heritage and culture have helped guide us over the decades with the determination to fuse tradition with modernity in a distinctive way, while safeguarding our customs and heritage. The cultural heritage and present context enrich our Emirate with a unique character and counterbalances some of the negative aspects of globalization, such as homogenization. The Emirate's cultural assets stimulate innovations that spring from our unique geographical setting, cultural history, and identity. Preserving the status of cultural capital and diversity remains a crucial asset for Abu Dhabi, and it protects the resilience and interlinkages of social systems within the natural environment. DPM's role is to reinforce and raise awareness of Abu Dhabi's long-standing commitment to sustainable development principles. Our signature statement “Abu Dhabi's Commitment towards Sustainable Urban Development" illustrates a clear vision that encompasses and interlinks environmental, social, economic, and cultural aspects.</p><h4>What role do sustainability and energy savings play in the current and future construction projects in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>In 2008, our wise leadership recognized that the only way to firmly ingrain sustainability principles was by developing a system tailored to our regional challenges. One of the many ways Abu Dhabi has become more sustainable is via the Estidama Pearl Rating System (PRS) established in 2011. It is a set of homegrown sustainability rating components tailored to the Arabian Gulf's unique climate and culture. As the first regional initiative of its kind and scope, PRS is considered the best-practice benchmark for urban development in the MENA region. PRS has significantly improved standards within the built environment, utilizing principles for resource reduction, particularly in energy and water consumption. PRS attracted strong interest worldwide and will start to be applied in several countries in the region.</p><h4>What are the major working points that require cooperation with both private stakeholders and the Department of Transport (DOT)?</h4><p>DPM works closely with DOT on a wide range of issues, from the strategic long-term planning of the city and its transport networks to detail project level planning and designs. An interesting example is the development of the new metro, where DPM and DOT worked together to optimize land use and peripheral developments, while ensuring our planning regulations allow the best density to support the project and make it a success. Cooperation with the private sector has been key to the strategic development of Abu Dhabi, providing high-quality infrastructure for new businesses to operate and grow. With this in mind, DPM works closely with government entities such as DED to forecast future growth and integrate data within our development plans. DPM also liaises with developers to ensure their projects are aligned with market assumptions.</p><h4>How do you seek to boost further integration across the less urbanized areas of the Emirate such as Al Dhafra and Al Ain?</h4><p>Where there was rapid growth, there are now measured, meticulous, and sustainable processes to correspond to the Emirate's expansion. Thus, sustainable urban development continues to be a core foundation of the stability paradigm developed in Abu Dhabi. The successful emergence of Abu Dhabi over the last 40 years predominantly focused on the capital's urban development, though this is now spreading to the wider Emirate. The aim is to weave together the entire Emirate's urban fabric with Al Ain and Al Dhafra into well-connected neighborhoods. We treat all regions of Abu Dhabi, including Al Dhafra and Al Ain, with equal importance while considering their own specificities. We are also ensuring all rural areas are well connected to each other and to the wide range of municipal services available in larger towns. To mobilize this commitment, DPM created the Complete Sustainable Communities (CSC) initiative, a key component in our strategic drive toward sustainable urban development and realization of Abu Dhabi Plan. Cities are currently becoming instrumental economic hubs that contribute to our overall nation's growth and wealth. Therefore, each of our development projects is intrinsically linked to the DPM's strategic and comprehensive analysis of future transformative changes, conducted in close collaboration with each of the three municipalities. Through the UAE centennial 2071 Plan led by our government, we share a long-term vision which integrates factors such as the evolution of our Emirate's demography, its energy and space needs, the environment, and social composition. It is all about gearing our mindset toward sustainable responsibility as an opportunity prompted by societal challenges instead of corporate obligations.</p><h4>How does Abu Dhabi seek to integrate technology within its developments and services?</h4><p>The full cycle of transactions in Abu Dhabi, from planning and development to community and business services, are being fully integrated as part of the DPM's digital transformation movement. This initiative was accelerated with the merger of the three municipalities under the DPM umbrella and enables us to implement an effective strategy towards the development of digital services across the Emirate. With the municipalities, we have embarked on a digital transformation program designed to accelerate the delivery of smart service outcomes and provide tailored digital services to the community. A robust digital architecture has been designed to drive all of DPM's systems acquisition, planning, and developing programs. Eventually, we want Abu Dhabi to be recognized as one of the leading smart and digital cities worldwide.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the key findings of your steel market analysis that led to the restructuring of Union Iron &amp; Steel in the first months of 2018?</h4><p>In order to increase margins, we had to come up with a strategy that was based on a market analysis of the UAE and the GCC, and then Africa, Europe, the US, and Asia. After looking at what products of our portfolio the market demanded, we restructured internal supply chain processes and departments such as finance and procurements. With the addition of new talent, we started our revenue assurance program and determined we were ready to bounce back on the market. The findings revealed that the best market at the moment is the UAE, in terms of both demand and prices. In 2016, 75% of our production went to GCC countries and only 25% went to the UAE, which has changed to 75% UAE and 25% GCC in 2017, and 100% UAE in the first half of 2018. Indeed, there is no export market for the Made in UAE steel rebars at the moment, which range from 8-32mm, as other GCC countries have lower prices. This is why we are exploring the production of rebar in coils, for which there is a high demand everywhere, including the UAE, but limited supply. Hopefully in the next 18-24 months, we can increase our export share to 25%, though that depends again on the demand.</p><h4>How has the UAE market reacted to the steel price increase?</h4><p>Early 2018 saw high local demand projected at 320,000 tons of steel rebars a month by Emirates Steel, which controls the market and sets the price once a month. Emirate Steel can produce up to 180,000 tons, while the remainder will be covered by other mills and imports mainly from Oman at the moment, which has a fairly saturated market and sells over 60,000 tons into a higher-price market like the UAE. Fortunately, since June there has been a 10% import duty effective for steel imports, which protects us from China or Turkey or elsewhere. Compared to the average price of steel rebars last year, prices are around 15-20% higher. This might be positive for manufacturers and traders, but bad for end users, whose credit lines become strained, which has negative implications for manufacturers and traders, as they are getting 15-20% less material for the same credit. In 2H2018, prices are likely to stabilize and perhaps go down slightly, with demand picking up.</p><h4>How do you expect demand to evolve once prices stabilize, and why?</h4><p>The overall demand for steel rebars in the UAE is predicted to be in the range of 4.2 million tons on an annual basis. This is mainly driven by the construction sector in Dubai, more specifically by private developments, with only a limited amount of government projects. In the UAE, there is a strong focus on Dubai and not Abu Dhabi. Some major budgets have been announced recently, though we are currently far away from the realization of these projects. In terms of the local market, 60% of our products is for the local Abu Dhabi market and 40% is for Dubai, Ajman, and Ras Al Khaimah. Since we expect demand to be higher in the future, we seek to increase the market share of our product in the northern Emirates, especially in Dubai. At the same time, high prices for manufacturing make the UAE less competitive than other GCC neighbors, and to maintain competitiveness, as a local manufacturer we require our product to be protected from cheap imports from other GCC countries like Oman, as well from Turkey. In 2017, Emirate Steel reduced prices significantly to compete against Turkish rebars in the market, pushing the idea that it is safer to buy regularly from local manufacturer to mitigate price fluctuations and longer shipment timeframes. The focus should be on buying local products and navigating the misleading information in the market spread by traders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges did you encounter with the Al Taweelah Power &amp; Steam Expansion EPCM project in the UAE?</h4><p>The Al Taweelah project is our first large-scale EPCM offering in the region. One may see it fundamentally as a power plant expansion, which is why, initially, it was considered a regular EPC offering. The project involves a complex process of integrating a new power block with the existing power plant which supplying steam, power, and utilities to the USD3-billion greenfield alumina refinery. Through our power team in Canada and our project delivery groups in South Africa and the UAE, there was a blend of knowledge, skills, and expertise that allowed us to meet the necessary timeline. The challenge was picking up a prior EPC contract structure and converting that to EPCM delivery whilst ensuring the correct quality and schedule was met. The fact that this project was a complex, brownfield development integrated with a currently operating power plant delivering product to a costly greenfield development presented additional challenges that have all been overcome throughout project delivery.</p><h4>What solutions do industrial facilities the UAE and Abu Dhabi require to optimize their operational assets?</h4><p>Industrial optimization requires a thorough technical and financial diagnostic of older facilities, and then executing the various debottlenecking, upgrade and sustaining capital project optimizations, which will bring them up to current best practice. Many owners of industrial assets in the UAE and the greater region have realized there is a great deal of underutilized value within their facilities and are making efforts to undertake the costly planning to access this value. Hatch, with industrial assets as its key competence, has many methods to bring the true industry knowledge to this process; much of the true value is realized by optimization of the process and operations rather than the balance sheet. In recent times, data analytics play a far greater role in our ability to monitor, optimize, and access the true value of the assets, and in this way, the region is transforming many of its older utilities and industrial plants into best practice operations.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the water-power axis issue concerning desalination plants here?</h4><p>In terms of life-cycle efficiencies that can be gained from water use and re-use alongside the corresponding power savings, there is an inverse exponential relationship to effort, with some of the major gains having already been made in this region. A few decades ago, goods and assets were traditionally not reused for both effort and cultural reasons. That tide has turned, and now we see many initiatives being pursued such as consumption minimization techniques, net zero discharge targets for industrial facilities, and grey water being used in communities. As we proceed, available improvements will lead to smaller gains, which will require the use of data analytics and thorough technical reviews to make the wisest investments.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the in-country value (ICV) program?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi's recent changes reflect a shift to a more mature, globally centric economy. For years, the government has been wise in its application of resources, leading to an economy that is extremely different from the traditional capitalist model. However, in recent months we have seen the application of VAT and more opportunities for international investment in terms of business licensing and so on to energize the next level of investment required. The government has to assist access to private land, private capital, and private investment. ICV is a crucial step that will assist this process now that competition is opening up with the recent reforms in incoming investment. As long as ICV is treated realistically, with the framework being applied to a resource pool in existence, rather than unrealistic targets for sourcing of unavailable goods, services, and skills, it will be a clear winner for the UAE. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[New Revenue Streams]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[new-revenue-streams]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>EGA is expanding upstream and internationally into bauxite mining and alumina refining. What is the driver behind these strategic decisions?</h4><p>Our decision to expand upstream and internationally was based on creating new revenue streams for EGA, while securing the natural resources the UAE's aluminum industry needs to grow. The UAE currently imports all the alumina we require. The alumina refinery we are building in Al Taweelah, Abu Dhabi, will be the UAE's first and will meet approximately 40% of our needs. Through our mining investment in the Republic of Guinea, we will have production of bauxite, the ore from which aluminum is derived and the feedstock for alumina refineries. Guinea has over a quarter of the world's bauxite resources. Once fully operational, our mine will produce approximately 12 million tons of bauxite per year. Once both the bauxite mine and alumina refinery are fully operational, EGA will be an integrated upstream and midstream aluminum company—from mine to metal. As with most sectors, entering a new part of the value chain is challenging. But we have over 40 years of experience in developing substantial megaprojects; for example, our Al Taweelah smelter was the largest single-site smelter in the world when it was built. For these new projects, we relied on our previous experiences, providing training to our employees, and supplementing our team with experts from around the world.</p><h4>Now that the UAE represents the fifth-largest aluminum-producing nation in the world,  what key strategies should the public and private sectors look at to maintain and further grow the sector?</h4><p>Aluminium is a growing sector in the UAE and we are proud to really be at the heart of it. Our growth over the last four decades has led to the development of a strong local downstream sector, making products using our metal. We sell more than 10% of our production locally, and there are now 26 downstream companies in the UAE. Some well-known global companies in various sectors including the automotive sector, use parts made in the UAE from UAE metal. The UAE's aluminum industry is the biggest employer amongst the country's energy-intensive industries, accounting for some 30,000 jobs. And our aluminum is the largest made-in-the-UAE export by value after oil and gas. Although our supply chain is global, we spend around USD1 billion a year on goods and services in the UAE to support our capital projects and operations, including on energy. This is about 40% of EGA's total spending. An effective, responsive and sustainable local supply chain is essential to the continued success of our business. The growth of the broader sector around us benefits us as a company. As a corporate citizen of the UAE, we are pleased that both our metal and the opportunities in our supply chain are contributing to economic diversification.</p><h4>How can the UAE embrace recycled materials extracted from waste streams?</h4><p>The UAE is already a diverse economy with many industries, and that means our country has various waste streams. At EGA, we have learned that industries must work together to unlock every potential opportunity in order to support even further diversification. That includes finding uses for waste. Almost seven years ago, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, announced UAE Vision 2021. This gave businesses a blueprint for reducing the impact of waste by aiming to balance sustainable development with the preservation of the environment, and it set targets for a leaner, greener nation. At EGA, we turned the waste challenge into an opportunity. We take waste material that we do not use ourselves and find others who have appropriate and environmentally friendly uses for it. We are turning waste into value, in a cleaner production system. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[AXIANS Portugal and its Integration into One of the Top 50 European Groups]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[pedro-afonso-ceo-axians-portugal-e-board-member-vinci-energies]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you please give us an overview of the evolution of Axians Portugal over the past two years, since the acquisition of the Novabase division?</h4><p>We have recently finalized our integration in the group. Being part of VINCI world is more than just assimilating procedures, tools, systems, organization, or metrics; it is absorbing its culture, a culture of decentralized operations network with a great deal of autonomy in local business units, a culture which is extremely different from other large corporations that are much more centralized. VINCI is one of the 50 biggest companies in Europe, which means, we have operations in several areas, such as airports, highways, construction, concessions, and so on. Therefore, working in Axians under the VINCI Energies “umbrella" brings interesting synergies for ICT, as various opportunities can be addressed within the group. Our current step on this onboarding program is joining the VINCI innovation networks'. It's been a smooth and very successful process. That said, in two years, we have won two innovation prizes at VINCI Energies so far. Actually, our integration in VINCI is such an accomplishment that we use to say that we have no longer employees but shareholders. VINCI has a program which transforms a typical employee into a shareholder and this is done by investing along with people. Thus, more than 60% of VINCI employees—almost 200,000 all over the world—are shareholders. 41% of Axians Portugal workers own VINCI's shares already and we believe this figure will grow. We are an extremely strong group and we do have ambition to grow. Our main focus is the people who work with us and their well-being, though.</p><h4>What does your portfolio of services and solutions include?</h4><p>We are the leaders in Portugal with regard to ICT system integration. Companies need to fulfil three requirements to be successful in this sector in Portugal: firstly, they need to have a strategy to go abroad; secondly, they have to cover the entire lifecycle of ICT in the customers, and finally they must be working with the 200 biggest customers in Portugal. We meet the three of them. We go from on-premises ICT to the cloud and hybrid. We are also on top of the main hot topics like cybersecurity and privacy, Artificial Intelligence and bots, and have had several achievements in those areas, mainly in Banking and Insurance. We are also very strong in sectors like Public Administration, Education, Telco, Energy and so many others. In the Industry sector, for instance, we are working for fast improvement. In fact, we have started to invest a lot more in this field since last year.</p><h4>In 2018 Axians Portugal won the Microsoft Inspire Award. What does this mean for the company?</h4><p>In a specific area, we have invested in the customers with Microsoft, and we have had great achievements with that strategy. It is important that a company like Microsoft recognizes Axians and that a company like Axians uses the Microsoft technology for its customers. This also applies for CISCO. We were awarded with three prizes at the Cisco Partner Summit as well, very recently. We are extremely proud of the journey we've been doing with our global partners. It has been making the difference in our arena and it takes respect and partnership between all the parts included for this to happen. Trust is the key value for our success and this is also valid for other important global brands we partner with. They are responsible for our success too.</p><h4>VINCI Energies has plans to boost your presence abroad. In terms of internationalization, what are your plans?</h4><p>We prefer to see international business in a different way: not as country A or country B, but in terms of the activities, solutions, and services that we can provide to customers. We always start with them: if we have three or four large customers, then, we can set up a local company to develop out of that. We do not see other countries or the world as a small village; we face each customer as a large country. In certain countries, we've started with some great clients, and after a while we have set up a company locally to develop that further. We supply services from Portugal to different cities remotely, such as Munich, Brussels and Luxembourg, among others. The opportunities since we have been integrated in the group are more than we had in the past and, because of that, we are now addressing big projects abroad in the Utilities sector where the group has already activities, for example. We have specific and deep knowledge on a specific subject so we can do it.</p><h4>What is the main challenge of doing business in Portugal?</h4><p>The main challenge is finding skilled people but not only that. Follow me: first, enough children aren't being born and, for that reason, talent will become increasingly scarce. The second challenge is attracting people to universities to learn the hard-technical subjects we need to operate our companies, with the right soft skills. The third one is competition for talent, that is, the knowledge with which we work today is global knowledge, and with that same knowledge one can work in any part of the world. This means that we must struggle for talent, not only in Portugal, but also abroad. The market here is growing; at the same time, international opportunities are increasing as well. We should think about bringing excellent opportunities to Portugal, which to me is the main challenge. I would like to introduce a concept - augmented productivity. When we do not have enough people available, we must “empower" the existing pool of talent with software, machines, bots and automation, to the end of having more efficient use of people's time and talents. Qualified people should focus on valuable activities and all those activities that can be automated should be automated then.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2019?</h4><p>To seek talent inside and outside the company. This is truly an endless task. Overall, the future leaders, given the increasing pace of change in this DX economy, should focus on their moral intelligence, on top of their emotional and cognitive skills. Fostering solid values through education is the way to build relevant and long-lasting human relationships, for all that matters. For all other (minor) things, the market will dictate the path we shall take.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements and developments in 2017 for Schneider Electric in the UAE?</h4><p>The UAE, the region, and the world are being shaped by the three mega-trends of rapid urbanization, digitization, and industrialization, along with the “new normal" of lower oil prices. In order to drive energy efficiency across a wide range of industry verticals, Schneider Electric has seen strong success in diversifying our business models from oil and gas into building, transportation, water and waste water, oil and gas, utilities, and data centers. Developing these new solutions has helped our customers to overcome the challenge of lower oil prices and support UAE Vision 2021 and national visions across the region. Our most innovative customers include the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and its Panorama Command Center, the Hilton Garden Inn Mall of the Emirates and EcoStruxure Building solution, integrating building management systems, the Kuwait Ministry of Electricity and Water and a nationwide smart metering project, and the Kuwait Oil Company and smart meters and smart training through virtual reality environments.</p><h4>How is Schneider Electric using the Internet of Things (IoT)?</h4><p>For us, 2017 was an exciting year in which we officially launched EcoStruxture architecture, our digitalization approach related to IoT. In April we demonstrated our connected products and solutions for the first time to more than 4,000 customers at a large innovation summit at Atlantis Palm in the presence of many governmental bodies and the Egyptian Minister of Trade and Industry and Minister of Communication and Information Technology. It was a major success because people are increasingly seeing Schneider Electric as a holistic energy efficiency company. Our partners became part of this journey of transformation and integrated our solutions into their systems. We are now being consulted for solutions by various industries, such as manufacturing and cement. In our quest to educate the market and reach out to our customers, we created the Innovation Hub on Wheels, where we displayed 17 IoT usage cases so that people from various industries can visualize how these can help them. We demonstrate how to measure efficiency and how connected products help to control and analyze data. The IoT usage cases can apply across industry, oil and gas, software analytics, performance management, and contracting. The Innovation Hub on Wheels has been a revelation throughout 2017 and is traveling across the Gulf, including with the Ministry of Infrastructure Development, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, and Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority in the UAE, and with the Knowledge Oasis Muscat in Oman. The Innovation Hub on Wheels is also going to universities to show students what energy efficiency is and what it means to have green buildings and a decarbonized environment. In small sessions, we show how a huge industry can optimize operations, using real examples that we have implemented in Saudi Arabia. </p><h4>Are you seeing an acceleration toward energy efficiency within the private sector?</h4><p>There is an acceleration on the power generation side, where there are many solar projects. For example, we are working with some of the UAE's largest organizations to install solar panels on parking facilities and rooftops to generate electricity. As the world becomes more electric, connected, and distributed, the UAE is a global leader in digitalization and decarbonization of energy.</p><h4>How do you assess the progress that has been achieved in the implementation of the smart grid?</h4><p>Smart grid implementation is going well, especially in the UAE. In general, the authorities in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Al Ain are moving forward in implementing the solutions, and we are seeing continued interest among utilities players across the UAE and the wider Gulf region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

We have introduced many technical insurance regulations for companies, including takaful. To help companies adapt their business models, we engage their leaders in designing most of our regulations through consultations before we introduce new laws or make amendments. Today, the authority is growing rapidly and hand in hand with the sector. We are number one in terms of premium collection in the MENA region, witnessing an average growth of 10% per year. Demand is high, and penetration in every sector of insurance is growing as well. Finally, we focus on raising awareness through campaigns and short films in schools and cinemas to educate people on insurance.</p><h4>What has been the reaction to the new motor insurance policy?</h4><p>Prior to rolling this out in 2017, we had a regulation in place from 1987 that had not been amended. For five years, we had been reviewing the policy, asking companies how we could improve it to tackle outstanding issues. At the end of the day, our regulations are for consumers, and we needed input to add value to these policies. This five-year journey has come to an end, and we finally rolled out our new policy, though our work is not yet finished. In the meantime, we encourage people to shop around at the 48 insurance companies in the UAE until they find a policy that is right for them.</p><h4>How is the Insurance Authority working on introducing technology to streamline the claims handling process and data acquisition?</h4><p>We are looking at technology, fintech, and blockchain. Currently, we are trying to get things done electronically. The new claims technology that we have introduced pushes claims directly to the insurance company, and it has three days to come back to the client before it is escalated to us. We aim to reduce the amount of time it takes to receive a claim as much as possible. That is why we introduced a loaner car policy, whereby the company has to provide customers with the same type of car or compensate them AED300 (USD82) per day until the claim is settled. Our neighbors may have larger populations than Abu Dhabi; however, we are beating them in terms of technology.</p><h4>What is the competitive advantage of the UAE market compared to other countries in the region?</h4><p>Awareness is higher in our market. We also have a large amount of compulsory insurance, such as health and motor, which adds value. Now, we have been approached by different entities that want other compulsory insurance. We want to get the government involved as much as possible. Insurance will become increasingly dominant in the coming years, as people think even more about how they can insure themselves and companies work to create better products. Typically, the stock exchange is the mirror of the economy anywhere in the world. However, insurance is heading in that direction. Now we also have to pay VAT, and there will be an impact during the first year, after which everything will run smoothly. We want to reduce the number of complaints from 60 a day to zero—that is the ultimate goal.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>Life insurance is the next big thing, as well as making investments. We are working actively to promote life insurance and want to raise awareness. We have drafted new regulations, and they will come out on the takaful side as well. All in all, we see positive growth in the insurance sector, with an average of 10%. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the performance of the UAE capital markets following the 4Q2017 listing of 10% of ADNOC's fuel distribution business?</h4><p>Overall, it is an excellent point in time for the economy of Abu Dhabi and the UAE in general. ADNOC's listing was not only successful, but was also well managed and important for the diversity it added to the financial platform of the Emirate. Furthermore, the impact on the stock exchange was also positive, as it set the scene for other transactions in the near future. The Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) has also started on the right foot, and the distinction in terms of jurisdiction, law, and independence between the global and local market will ensure that many companies will initiate activities there in the coming quarters as well. It is heartening to see that even though ADGM started after the Dubai International Finance Center (DIFC), it is already setting up a platform not only targeting traditional markets, but also the development of cryptocurrencies and blockchain-related activities.</p><h4>What is the most promising sector that might offer the highest return on investment?</h4><p>Real estate has always been the traditional backbone of any industry, and here at Al Nahdha, one-third of our investment is focused on real estate development, both internationally and locally. We recently had a high-level private viewing for the Al Fahid project, which is developed by Al Fahid Development Company and will take four years to finish. This is a great time for the property market to relaunch itself because by the time construction projects are finished, in three to five years, the economy will have picked up again. At the moment, the market is slow in terms of rental and sales, though things are moving. Investors would rather engage in buying off-plan and paying their investment in four to five years than buying completed housing and paying the entire amount all in once. A normal return on real estate investment is around eight to 10 years, and if the return matches that, it is a great investment.</p><h4>Can you walk us through your private equity activity?</h4><p>We are large direct investors in private companies in the UAE while historically having invested globally via funds. Recently, that has begun to change as we have looked at taking direct stakes in international businesses ourselves or co-investing alongside our partners. We have also enhanced our private equity activity with building a venture capital book, also driven by investments in top funds in the industry as well as a fast-growing portfolio of direct investments. In terms of sectors in both private equity  and venture capital, we usually seek to diversify our substantial financial services and real estate exposure via a concerted focus on consumer facing businesses such as retail, food and beverage, healthcare, and education and expect to continue to do so through the coming years.</p><h4>What is the best way to mitigate exposure to regional geopolitical events?</h4><p>Although we are currently on a solid footing, there is always the potential for a correction driven by local or global geopolitical events. Al Nahdha is a long-term investor and usually looks to take advantage of these short-term dislocations locally and globally in line with our strategy. We also aim to consistently reduce the volatility of our returns via a combination of prudent risk management, hedging using various products, and, most importantly, keeping a keen eye on both the past and future five years to maintain a balance. The UAE is energetic enough to make things happen economically, whether in a boom or bear market. Overall, I see the stock markets growing positively long term, and regulation tightening and benefiting investors. By the third or fourth quarter of 2018, we expect to see a change in the trajectory of real estate activity in UAE, which we expect will start growing positively. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What further financial instruments does ADX plan to add to further grow the sophistication of Abu Dhabi's capital market?</h4><p>The first objective is to increase liquidity, while the second part is market capitalization, as there is still room to expand and add more IPOs, especially with local private companies. There is another area for SMEs, and we seek to make it easier for them to finance, export, expand, and create even better platforms. We have a plan to introduce other financial instruments into our market as well as develop other products. Bonds are another alternative that we are working on with issuers to have on the trading floor. At the basic diversification level, we are in talks with potential companies in education, healthcare, retail, and petrochemical sectors to add more diversity into the exchange that would produce more opportunities for our investors. Our role is to highlight the opportunities available on ADX to those companies.</p><h4>Extremely large players are recently getting more involved with capital markets. What does this mean for the finance sector?</h4><p>It means growth and expansion and the potential to be significantly more active. It is all about IPOs that make the companies more efficient and transparent. In a nutshell, it introduces better governance. This activity shows that the economy is growing, and the maturity of the management of these companies has reached a level where going public is feasible. The board members are eager to take on these opportunities so that they can develop their entities. Once the wheels are in motion, we will witness radical changes in the financial sector. On the regulatory side, ADX has adopted the best practices in the field. There is also the technological aspect, along with a great level of depth; at ADX, we have around 966,000 investors, 40% of them foreign. We also have more than 7,900 institutional investors, of which 5,900 are foreign institutional investors, and more than 350 are pension funds from all over the world. All of the top-25 asset management companies are registered on the exchange and actively trading. In 2018, our listed companies paid cash dividends of over AED23.4 billion.</p><h4>What is the key for investors to allocate funds on equities, changing and unlocking the potential in the MENA market?</h4><p>In the UAE, in general, there are a variety of ways to transfer funds to and from multiple entities without obstacles. Our case will be the same because we have many high-net-worth individuals, many of which are almost as large as institutions. We have many units here, and using REITs would be a great way to get people involved in owning pieces of various properties.</p><h4>What is ADX's relationship with the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), and how will that relationship evolve moving forward?</h4><p>If there is any reason we cannot develop a financial instrument in the UAE, we now have ADGM as an option to reach out to and further develop the market. For example, in terms of fintech it has positioned itself as a specialist. ADX will become part of the fintech movement, so now we have a “fintech club" where we can further develop technical ideas to be introduced.</p><h4>What are the risks for capital markets in the UAE and region?<br></h4><p>We are currently part of the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) emerging markets (EM) index and, thus, face the same risks as other financial markets around the world. There is taxation, shifting of investments, and clustering, all of which result in rapid and radical changes. All the global economies are challenging themselves and competing against each other. This makes the market a constantly improving place and the UAE attractive and unique for most investors. We do not focus on our past achievements, because we know there is more to be done. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your operations evolved to gain brand recognition in the Middle East? </h4><p>Eaton has been in the Middle East for 40 years, since we had our first office in Dubai in the World Trade Center. In the past 20 years it has grown significantly through a number of acquisitions that expanded our installed base capacity. In 2013, we decided to double investments in the region, setting up a manufacturing facility in Dubai to get closer to our clients. This process has led us to an approach that establishes support mechanisms for our customers through more tailored solutions, and the growth of Dubai as an Emirate has undoubtedly favored our operations. Indeed, Dubai acts pretty much as the regional benchmark: once we establish a relationship with a Dubai partner, it is then easier to engage in its counterpart somewhere else in the region. This has been the case with Dubai Civil Defense, for example, with whom we have established an excellent working relationship in our life safety division. </p><h4>What is the level of security and standardization of power equipment plays within commercial construction in the region?</h4><p>Bringing safety to the construction market, whether in hospitals, houses, offices, or other buildings, remains a key priority for Eaton. One of the key challenges in the region is ensuring the equipment specifications meet the right standards to deliver high-level solutions to a different number of stakeholders. Counterfeit products sold at cheaper prices are another issue our industry always had to deal with, but safety should not come at any compromise. Eaton has more than 10,000 patents, and we are constantly working to develop or evolve products in order to meet specific market needs and safety requirements; however, there has been growing awareness in the market around the importance of security of the generation system, which has allowed for greater innovation in certain niche areas.</p><h4>What is your assessment on the wave of investments in data centers the region is witnessing?</h4><p>Investments in data centers, especially in the technology for data protection, and becoming increasingly important in the region, whether it be the server in buildings or big colocation sites. As such, Eaton is proud to supply all the protective equipment and UPS for the Gulf Data Hub, one of the first large data colocation center in the region. Safety and security are absolutely paramount for companies to build strong, well-tested, reliable foundations, both in hardware and software. This enhanced connectivity and higher amount of data presents companies and governments with huge potential, but people need to understand what it actually means. It all boils down to the intelligence of the network, and how we can take the data, turn it into really usable information that people can make decisions on. There are major steps being made in this direction, and overall it is an exciting time. </p><h4>How do new technologies fit within the push towards a stronger localization of the utility system?</h4><p>There is a lot of interesting conversation going on in terms of PV, electric cars, and the regulations around them. That being said, localization inherently implies a more case-by-case approach, and when that case happens to be in a part of the region where you have energy poverty, one has to look at what type of resource is available there to put into a generator. In this sense, PV represents a major leap forward in the segment of implementing efficient energy storage solutions at an economically sustainable price. There is a great demand for this area, as witnessed by the implications of our agreement with Nissan to develop a scalable lithium-ion energy storage system. Battery technology has gone up and price of PV has gone down, which leaves us with a bullish sentiment for this segment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Siemens' strategic goals for 2018, and how do they align with the country's preparation for the World Expo 2020 and UAE Vision 2021?</h4><p>We recently announced plans to expand our digital presence in the Middle East with a USD500-million investment over the next three years, which includes the opening of two MindSphere Application Centers in the UAE. MindSphere is a cloud-based, open IoT operating system that connects products, plants, systems, and machines, enabling organizations to harness the wealth of data generated by IoT with advanced analytics and granting them an edge to cloud connectivity. In this context, the Dubai center will handle airports, logistics, and cargo, in addition to co-developing innovative approaches that improve the movement of people and goods. This will allow us to work closely with our customers and partners to come up with digital solutions specifically aimed at solving their challenges. The MindSphere Application Center in Abu Dhabi will cater to process industries, mainly focusing on oil, gas, water, and waste. It is aimed at enabling customers to improve operational efficiency and reduce their costs across the entire value chain. We are also heavily investing in software grants across the region, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. These grants are aimed at boosting digital skills among youth in the region by providing them with our Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software. Developing local skills is the key to driving the countries' digital transformation. Moreover, Dubai selected Siemens as the Premier Partner for Intelligent Infrastructure &amp; Operations for Expo 2020, enabled and digitalized by MindSphere. With MindSphere at the heart of our partnership, we are working closely with our partners to create a digitally connected Expo unlike any other previous one. We look to provide crucial products, services, and solutions that will maximize and optimize Expo 2020 for visitors and operators.</p><h4>What are the major challenges in applying cybersecurity measures for industrial and energy automation systems in the UAE?</h4><p>Cybersecurity is one of the biggest challenges facing industries today. While companies have improved protection for their IT environment, they have yet to do the same for their operational technology (OT), namely implementing technology solutions suitable for OT to protect the operational assets. We conducted a study on the state of readiness of the oil and gas industry in the Middle East to tackle cyber attacks, which revealed oil and gas OT environments face significant and mounting cybersecurity risk. Moreover, around 60% of respondents surveyed said they face a greater risk in the OT than in the IT environment, and 67% believe the risk level to industrial control systems over the past few years has substantially increased because of cyber threats. In order for organizations to capture the full benefits of digitalization, it is essential that they rigorously address the OT cyber risk.</p><h4>What sectors, so far, have shown the greatest flexibility in adapting to digitalization?</h4><p>It is not about adapting to digitalization; it is about embracing it. Different sectors are at various stages of embracing digitalization with different imperatives. When it comes to building infrastructure, for example, digital technologies have been implemented on a wider scale given the availability of data and the speed at which digitalization can realize gains in energy efficiency, cost reduction, and security. We have also seen some of the more nascent manufacturing companies in the UAE adopting digital technologies such as 3D printing. In 2017, Siemens successfully completed a pilot project for the first certified aircraft interior part that was 3D printed with STRATA and Etihad. This was a first for the Middle East and North Africa region, and we expect this technology to be used more widely. The across the board implementation of other digital technologies such as AI and blockchain is only set to increase over time. For example, companies such as LO3 already use blockchain in the energy sector to achieve greater efficiencies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the transformational changes the hydrocarbon industry in Abu Dhabi is going through?</h4><p>The UAE is undergoing valuable change with a forward-looking strategy aimed at maximizing its physical resources over the long term. Bringing change is never an easy task, especially when it requires maintaining a connection to the past. In this sense, one of ADNOC's major initiatives has been the significant downstream push, which seeks to get as much value as possible out of the barrel at home. Over time, this will undoubtedly upgrade capabilities, jobs, and opportunities for the country and its citizens. Naturally, there is always room for improvement, though the UAE can count on the robust legacy of partnership in the country, which leads us to another major upgrade in the energy sector: ADNOC's partnership model. From now on, the focus will be to partner with international firms that are able to bring value, with ADNOC acting as a broker enabling the exchange of skills and technologies in the most innovative and value-driven way. This same model has worked in other industries, including financial and commercial, so there is reason to believe it will be successful in the hydrocarbon world too. </p><h4>What new opportunities can the drive for innovation in Abu Dhabi and the UAE provide British firms with?</h4><p>The UAE's passion for innovation and can-do attitude influences every aspect of life here, as the country keeps walking down the journey of continuous improvement. This dynamic environment means UK companies and business people see the UAE as a place where dreams can become reality. This place is attractive not only because there are fewer barriers, less bureaucracy, and more action, but also because there is a great deal of compatibility and history between the two countries. Today, the UAE is one of the UK's largest trading partners, and the UK is one of the UAE's leading sources of FDI. We represent 16% of the FDI in the country, which is significantly higher than anyone else. This compatibility is vital, though it might lead to a degree of complacency. There is a need to reinvent ourselves with vigor and creativity to continue to bring value to the country. As for the business channels of cooperation, there is great potential for UK firms to supply the UAE with the latest and greatest technologies, as well as for UK academic institutions to conduct research, develop new capacities, and fill in the gap left by the shying away of R&amp;D.</p><h4>What are some of the major challenges facing British businesses in the UAE and Abu Dhabi, and how do these challenges fit into the overall changes in the economy?</h4><p>The UAE is no longer the country it used to be in 2016; there have been massive changes in only two years, and businesses must radically change the way they think in order to serve the UAE market. By looking at the issues the UAE seeks to improve, which are mostly related to water, sun, heat, and dust, it is clear that there is great potential for UK SMEs, which could make serious inroads if they expand their export facility. However, to become successful, UK firms would still need to overcome three main challenges. First, there has to be a degree of cooperation and coming together as one package to win the attention of UAE decision-makers. Second, once they are able to unify their intent, UK firms need to make the right connections and find the right people who can make these networks work, which is where institutions such as the BBG or high-profile personalities like Prince Andrew can step in. Third, British companies must be price competitive and recognize that the UAE is becoming an increasingly price sensitive market. With these three pillars in mind, the future for British businesses in the UAE can only be bright. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Win-win Strategy]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-win-win-strategy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Ittihad's major highlights of the past year?</h4><p>Following a rough start in 2008 due to the global financial crisis, we managed to rationalize our portfolio by divesting a number of our non-core businesses and focusing on growing our investments in the export manufacturing industry and privatized government services. We also developed strategies to nurture our investments in healthcare and education sectors. This strategy yielded its fruits, and we managed to grow revenues by 10-fold since inception. Our exports today cover more than 32 different destinations, and we will continue to grow in the coming years. Ittihad is now the main shareholder and operator of over 26 companies that are categorized into four pillars: Industrial Capital Group (ICG), our manufacturing arm; Emirates Link Group (ELG), focusing mainly on privatized government services; Medical Investments (MED-IN), for investments in healthcare; and Venture Investments (Venture-In) for small businesses and new VC-type investment. They are uniquely structured for Ittihad to focus on each pillar's development, tap into new markets, and secure its financial needs to maintain its growth strategy.</p><h4>To what extent is the government turning to the private sector to further stimulate the economy?</h4><p>We have witnessed a number of initiatives toward the privatization of government services over the past few years. Government departments have realized the need to restructure their offerings in a manner to emphasize their role as regulator rather than service provider. Abu Dhabi has been a leader in privatizing the operation and maintenance activities for various infrastructure and municipal services. For example, the first PPP projects in the GCC for water and electricity generation were in Abu Dhabi. However, we currently see further developments toward projects with a BOO or BOOT model, such as the recent announcement of the largest desalination plant in Abu Dhabi, the waste-to-energy plant in Dubai, and a number of PPPs in healthcare. Privatization can play a major role in the coming years to boost the economy in the GCC area, especially in municipal services, transportation, telecommunication, and healthcare.</p><h4>Can you walk us through Ittihad's strategy with regards to potential new partners?</h4><p>Over the past few years, Ittihad has developed, strengthened, and grown its partnership with global and business leaders regionally and internationally. Our strategy is based on a win-win philosophy and long-term partnerships. Union Copper Rod, an Ittihad subsidiary, became the core partner of Glencore in the Middle East. Our partnership with GE led to the development of our unique investment in PPPs in healthcare and expanded our market offering. Our cooperation with Khalifa Port has grown from being a regular customer to becoming one of its main partners in exporting over 10,000TEUs per year, which is likely to double by the end of 2020 with the addition of bulk imports. Relationships with local companies, such as Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC), enabled our subsidiary National Cement Factory to be the first cement plant approved for nuclear construction. Collaborations with Fujifilm, Hill-Rom, Steelcase, and many others widen our offerings and enable us to tap in new markets and ventures.</p><h4>Where do you see the biggest challenges and opportunities for the growth of the Emirate's economy?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi urgently needs to rebrand itself to focus on what makes it an attractive place for investors. To start, it needs a new business card. It used to promote itself as a tax haven and a place with inexpensive electricity and labor; these are no longer valid. Perhaps we should start promoting Abu Dhabi as a place with secure and reliable energy, modern infrastructure, and flexible regulations. However, Abu Dhabi needs to put more emphasis on connecting the dots and fostering harmony across all sectors to streamline efficiencies throughout industry, real estate, and energy. We need to leverage our quick decision making, as we have a dynamic structure that can allow us to be ahead of our regional competition. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you walk us through the establishment of ADMCC?</h4><p>With the ultimate vision of building a secure and intelligent city, ADMCC has been on the vanguard of utilizing technology in order to secure the capital city while being a critical enabler for various key partner organizations. ADMCC hosts a wide range of security applications and tools for independent government agencies. As a global city, Abu Dhabi presents the widest possible set of policing challenges, from managing and regulating the use of monitoring and control the devices in various locations, to leveraging vital information from the vast and seemingly random data, to relaying these to the relevant organization for effective and timely operations. Abu Dhabi enjoys a low crime index of 12.26 and a safety index of 87.74, which is, by comparison, the safest city in the world as reported by numbeo.com.</p><h4>How is digitalization impacting the level of security in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Fundamentally, digitalization is revolutionizing how we interrogate captured analytical data to produce forensic results. This digital era has enabled ADMCC to produce a world-class platform through multiple disparate subsystems for the purpose of criminal investigation and situation clarity. ADMCC views the primary objective of a digital security system as a means of data collection. This data is then processed and utilized according to different government sectors. Moreover, protecting digitized data is our primary concern. ADMCC is committed to staying two steps ahead of technology where possible by not only completing market research on the latest technologies, but also by forming strong, integral partnerships with key vendors. </p><h4>What is the significance of ADMCC in the broader strategy of building a sustainable smart city?</h4><p>We aim to increase Abu Dhabi's competitiveness in tourism and commerce and improve the quality of life for its citizens and visitors. A few years ago, ADMCC took on an essential role in safety and security through its responsibility for the design, standardization, and management of CCTV systems. This includes public event coverage, highway, and public area surveillance, including provision of enrichment data for use in sustainable traffic management.</p><h4>What is ADMCC's approach to partnerships, and what role do you expect private players to play in guaranteeing safety?</h4><p>The development of partnership relations is vital to coordinate the efforts made in  the provision of a safer Abu Dhabi. Our public-sector partnerships allow the utilization of collated information to enrich the user-level data, providing more concise examinations through our platforms. This in turn provides far smaller margins of error in the apprehension of criminals combined with a higher rate of success. All of Abu Dhabi's government entities collate good data; however, we benefit by enhancing it into solid data. The value placed on our private partners is overwhelming as they work with ADMCC to bring new technologies and solutions to previously unforeseen challenges. Our efforts are consistently concentrated on the partner roadmaps and in looking to exploit any technological advances in the interest of public safety.  </p><h4>What role does cybersecurity play in ensuring security in Abu Dhabi and what are the major challenges for ADMCC?</h4><p>The reason that there are a great number of security vendors with a vast array of platforms is because cybersecurity is defined by evolution; as more threats appear, more complex technology is required to combat these threats. The biggest challenges that ADMCC can anticipate and react to are noticeable market trends, the exponential growth in data from systems, and the fast-paced advancement of security systems.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities and expectations for 2018?</h4><p>Ultimately, all safe city projects share the same goals, and ADMCC is no different: The Civic Security Duty is to uphold the directive to ensure the creation of safe and secure communities that enhance quality of life and reflect the Emirate's unique identity. The key is to achieve it while enabling the full potential for an economic and prosperous city by ensuring safety for regional, national, and international tourism and trade. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does SCAD ensure accurate analysis and production of data to forge sustainable business relations?</h4><p>In response to the changing economic environment and needs of the users of official statistics, some survey data collections were replaced with administrative data sources to reduce the cost of conducting these surveys. Meanwhile, the timeliness and quality of data collections and dissemination of statistics have been improved through innovative electronic communication and connectivity platforms. In addition, SCAD has developed a unique identification number for each economic (business) establishment in Abu Dhabi, which are stored in a central database. This initiative supports government entities through faster data collection and lower costs. At the same time, data quality is preserved by eliminating the risk of duplicate respondents. A good example of interconnectivity among governments is the eStats program. It coordinates access to several government administrative datasets, which allows SCAD to transform into useful, high-quality statistics. Finally, plans are underway for the next population census in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, as well as an exporters and suppliers register which includes geographic location data.</p><h4>What have you and your international partners learned from one another? </h4><p>In 2017, SCAD had three stand out international learning points: statistical maturity, big data, and statistical leadership. For statistical maturity, SCAD is enhancing communication and cooperation, building and maintaining trust, and maximizing its value for money across the Abu Dhabi government. For example, in 2017, SCAD completed 670 client data requests. Our clients' data needs are used as inputs for future statistical production processes. In terms of big data, SCAD is exploring new data sources to provide timely information for decision making. To achieve statistical leadership, SCAD is investing in its people, empowering its top management to be inspirational in pursuit of organizational success. Following Abu Dhabi's successful hosting of the International Association for Official Statistics Conference at the end of 2016, SCAD continues to strengthen its partnership and reputation with the international statistical community, contributing to a variety of areas including: digital government and executive dashboards; outputs and uses of the Abu Dhabi Consumer Price Index; and innovative integration of the Generic Statistical Business Process Model. In 2018, SCAD looks forward to playing a key role at the second United Nations' World Data Forum, to be hosted in the UAE in October.</p><h4>What are some of the innovative statistical development tools SCAD seeks to implement?</h4><p>Similar to statistical agencies around the world, SCAD balances the competing requirements of timely releases with the need to produce accurate and reliable statistics. To this end, SCAD follows the best-practice Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM) and international statistical methodologies. In terms of technology, the focus is on three core areas: SMART SCAD—an enterprise business management system enabling statisticians to generate statistical indicators faster—is being integrated with Abu Dhabi government entities to exchange administrative data using secure data exchange protocols; latest technologies such as big data and data visualization tools are being used to empower customers to generate customized statistics in interactive and graphical form; and mobile applications such as Sallatna, Abu Dhabi Over Half Century, and m-Services have been developed to serve growing public demand.</p><h4>How can Abu Dhabi strike a balance between attracting foreign talent and developing local human resources?<br></h4><p>As of July 2018, SCAD reached an Emiratization level greater than 70% and maintains a healthy balance between national and international expertise. This is achieved through rigorous identification and induction of local talent, the careful selection and placement of international experts in key strategic positions, nurturing local talent through SCAD's dedicated Statistical Training Institute and wider learning environment, and utilizing motivational initiatives such as SCAD's Digital Library, Innovation Labs, and Employee Open Forums. SCAD leads the industry in compensation, benefits, and opportunities for its staff and is a great place for fresh UAE graduates to build their careers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Mubadala Investment Company benefited from its merger thus far?</h4><p>Mubadala Development Company and IPIC were extremely successful companies in their own right, even before they joined forces. This was a merger of equals that has created a global investment powerhouse, providing increased scale and global reach to pursue a bold new strategy. Looking back at the merger, this has been one of the smoothest and most productive processes I have been involved in. Moreover, as the largest corporate merger in the history of the UAE, the synergies we have been able to realize and opportunities we can unlock have been sizable. Take our petroleum and petrochemicals platform, in which we hold world-leading positions across the value chain of the sector. Since the merger, we have set out a clear strategy to pursue investments that help us realize opportunities, especially in the strategically important downstream sector. For example, Nova Chemicals' USD2.1 billion acquisition of one of the largest petrochemical facilities in the US, based in Geismar, Louisiana, will support the company as it embarks on its ambitious growth strategy. Mubadala Investment Company now can benefit from a stronger, more dynamic balance sheet and world-class expertise in industries vital to Abu Dhabi's growth. As a result, we are even better positioned to deliver against our mandate and generate attractive financial returns for our shareholder. In doing so, we can continue to contribute to the ongoing diversification of the economy, in line with the Abu Dhabi Plan and the country's long-term vision.</p><h4>Mubadala Investment Company recently moved into a range of technology-related fields. What are the benefits of investing in industries that are heavily disrupted by innovation?</h4><p>We have been involved in developing innovative technology companies since our inception, and our recent capital deployments in the sector are an extension of our strategy, rather than something new. Take the partnerships we have forged with world-leading tech companies such as our JV in Cognit, a collaboration with IBM's Watson to bring cognitive computing to the MENA region; or Yahsat, our satellite communications technology company that has brought affordable internet access to more than 140 countries. These are just two examples, though when we look at the changes taking place across society and business it is clear that digital disruption, and the technologies that make that possible, enhances the prospects of economies across the world. It has, therefore, been important for us to gain further exposure. Part of our global investment strategy consists of ensuring we are an integral part of these trends and positioned to capitalize on the opportunities they present. Our USD15 billion commitment to the Softbank Vision Fund, which provides exposure to a wide range of highly innovative and disruptive companies in the tech sector, is one example. Furthermore, through our recently announced San Francisco office, we are getting closer to the venture capital community that provides exposure to some of the most exciting and game-changing investment opportunities in the world.</p><h4>What are the major gaps in the country's healthcare sector and how can the public and private sectors cooperate to meet the existing medical needs of the UAE?</h4><p>When we initially looked at the healthcare system in Abu Dhabi, we aimed to identify the most pressing gaps across acute and critical care. Our goal was to deliver against a strategy of filling these gaps and introducing world-class healthcare, which we have largely achieved. We invested heavily to create a healthcare ecosystem in Abu Dhabi designed specifically to meet the needs of the local population. Take our Imperial College London Diabetes Centre (ICLDC), which advances patient care on one of the most pressing healthcare issues for UAE nationals. It has expanded significantly in recent years with two facilities in Abu Dhabi and one in Al Ain, all of which are at capacity. Our flagship asset, Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, has also started to reshape the healthcare model in the Emirates with a series of regional and country-wide firsts, including the nation's first multi-organ harvesting and transplant. This was possible because of the quality of clinical staff we have attracted and the world-class facility we have created to perform these procedures.</p><h4>What are the main challenges and opportunities that Abu Dhabi might encounter in the full adoption of green energy resources to meet the sustainability standards in the next decade?</h4><p>Mubadala is advancing the development, commercialization, and deployment of renewable energy solutions and clean technologies, helping to establish Abu Dhabi as a global center of excellence in the renewable energy and clean technology sector. Take the joint venture between Total and our renewable energy company, Masdar, to build the region's largest concentrated solar power plant, the 100MW Shams 1 project in Abu Dhabi. This USD600-million solar power project is the world's largest financing transaction for renewable energy and in March 2018, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of uninterrupted electricity supply. However, like all countries around the word, there are significant challenges in changing behaviors and improving adoption of green technologies, and while Masdar has led the way in driving the renewable and sustainability agenda, there is also a concerted effort at a policy level as well. The Environment Vision 2030 was developed to drive collaboration across key government entities, covering the environmental, social, and economic impact in areas such as agriculture, water resources, electricity consumption, air quality, and waste. If we get this right, there is also a significant commercial upside to add to the primary social and sustainability outcomes we are driving towards. Our Masdar wind farm projects, such as London Array, the largest offshore wind farm in the world, and Dudgeon offshore wind farm, which will generate the electricity equivalent for more than 410,000 UK homes, are just two examples. These investments not only have a major impact on sustainability but also generate attractive financial returns for our shareholder, the government of Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>Looking at 2018, where does Mubadala Investment Company see the potential for highest returns on investments?</h4><p>As a diversified global investment company, we are active in over 30 countries, from the large emerging markets such as China, Brazil, and Thailand to many of the world's key developed economies, including the US and Europe. We will continue to explore and maintain our operations in high-growth emerging markets, having invested over time to build market-leading platforms that position us well for future investment opportunities. However, as we evolve, our geographical exposure will also change. In line with our clear mandate to deliver financial returns, we will see the international portfolio increasingly weighted towards more developed markets that enable us to de-risk our investments while securing attractive and stable income streams. Alongside this, with our increased exposure to the technology sector, we expect to deploy capital in high-potential sectors. We will make strategic investments to position ourselves at the leading edge of these sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Intellectual property (IP) is being granted topmost priority by countries today, for its ability to accelerate economic growth and improve a country's social and cultural environment. It is concerned primarily with encouraging and preserving people's original thoughts and ideas, which form the cornerstone of progress and prosperity of a nation. The wise leadership of the UAE has stressed the importance of investing in its citizens, who are the real wealth of the country, and believes that unless people are accorded top priority, there cannot be resurgence and reawakening within a country.</p><p>Recognizing this need, the UAE is making every effort to enhance its IP framework and thereby becoming a global hub for innovation and creativity. It was one of the first countries to sign and join the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) convention and has been at the forefront of adopting policies and legislation supporting the protection of IP rights. In fact, the country has attained several milestones in the field of IP, such as a ratification of a new IP law based on international best practices, patent streamlining, copyright, and trademark processing procedures. It recently introduced a new patenting agency to fast track the patent registration process and provide focused support to Young Innovative and Industrial Companies (YIICs). Today, the country has a large network of R&amp;D infrastructure consisting of 120 accredited universities and a strong legal framework governing IPRs. It adheres strictly to WIPO and other IP-related treaties and encourages the participation of youth and students at all levels and in all stages of education, so they can foster a culture of creativity and innovation, and also motivates teachers to play a greater role in generating greater awareness about IP and its ramifications.<br>UAE's Vision 2021, its roadmap for the future, aims to create a knowledge-based economy based on IP, to promote research and development and is proud to claim that it is well underway to becoming the innovation capital of the world. Today, the country is recognized worldwide for its creativity and openness, with an average growth rate of over 3% over the last three years and has the fifth-highest GDP per capita in the world. Moreover, the UAE is strategically located at the heart of the Asian, African, and European continents, with the world's most active international airport providing market access to more than 2 billion people within a four to five-hour flying time.<br><br>The UAE is also ranked 26th out of 190 countries in the 2017 Doing Business Report and 38th in the Global Innovation Index 2018. Significant efforts at economic diversification have reduced the proportion of GDP based on hydrocarbons to 25%, and the UAE accords top priority to entrepreneurship and SME development, for these sectors to play a vital role in fostering a culture of innovation. All these have contributed to the country's economic diversification and transformation into a highly productive, competitive knowledge economy.<br><br>One of the significant steps taken by the country is to develop a comprehensive IP infrastructure, by establishing the International Centre for Patent Registration, and today we are taking another stride in this direction, in line with the best international standards. The UAE is also keen to incorporate global best practices and harness the international expertise of our partners to nurture more creative ideas and motivate minds to become more involved in the various innovations and technological advancements to create outcomes that will contribute to economic prosperity and growth.<br>In addition to this, we are working on the formalities of hosting a representative foreign office of WIPO in the UAE to promote greater awareness about IP, shape our policies, enhance capacities, and highlight the UAE as a global hub for IP applications and practices. We are confident that such specialized centers act as a catalyst for fostering innovation and increased investor confidence in the environment, which in turn encourages value-added investments and consolidates the growth of key economic sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major steps are being taken to reduce dependence on oil and diversify the economy?</h4><p>The country, in line with UAE Vision 2021, is keen to build a diverse, globally competitive economy based on innovation and knowledge and led by national competencies, find other sources of income away from oil, and develop the non-oil economic sectors that are viable, such as manufacturing, tourism, and SMEs, in addition to the seven sectors identified by the National Innovation Strategy, namely technology, health, education, transportation, renewable energy, water, and space, as well as non-oil sectors that further the government's plans, such as infrastructure, trade, logistics services, and the financial and retail sector, to increase the contribution of the non-oil sector to GDP to 80% by 2021. The country is also keen to support investment spending on several strategic and development projects, especially those in the infrastructure, financial, social, and private sectors related to Expo 2020, expanding the metro, airport, railways, tourist facilities, retail, and energy projects, as well as other priority projects that are mentioned in the government's development plans. The private sector continues to support the government as a major partner in the forward march of the country, and the various initiatives and community development projects undertaken against the backdrop of the Year of Giving have gone a long way in contributing to the development targets of the country. The implementation of policies and the launching of national initiatives that support the SME sector and encourage entrepreneurship, as well as the development of a legislative and regulatory environment that promotes this sector and provides it with incentives for success, continue to play a role in increasing economic diversification, enhancing sustainability and productivity, and stimulating innovation, knowledge, and technology as pillars of development.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the trade protectionism that has begun to make its presence felt in global economies? Has it affected the industries, exports, and business activities in the UAE? </h4><p>The UAE has adopted trade and economic policies based on flexibility, economic openness, and free markets, and has benefited immensely from this policy. The country is keen to support all efforts that contribute to trade liberalization and facilitate the movement of goods as one of the main ingredients for global economic growth. This pioneering approach of the country has contributed to building an active and dynamic foreign trade sector that supports national products and industries, promotes its capacity to access new markets, and is considered a major pillar of economic development and an enabler of the country's competitiveness as a major trade and investment hub at the regional and international levels. The country looks at trade protectionism as a factor that undermines an increase in foreign investment and hinders the growth of the private sector, especially export industries, and causes a slowdown in the movement of the intra-global trade of goods and services. While they serve some short-term objectives, they have negative implications for the economies of countries and for medium- and long-term global economic recovery. In this context, the country is keen to support and adopt initiatives that could facilitate the movement of trade and investment and deepen ties with promising international markets as the first Arab country to ratify and deposit the trade facilitation agreement with the World Trade Organization, as well as reiterate its commitment and support to the principles of a multilateral trading system and help in organizing yearly initiatives like the Annual Investment Meeting (AIM), which features the participation of more than 120 countries around the world, and “The Week of Global Trade Development," which aims to promote the country's commitment to issues that contribute to facilitating trade and discussing the challenges faced in this regard. The Ministry of Economy works in cooperation with various governmental and private-sector partners in the country to follow up on any protectionist issues aimed at products in various international markets, by measures such as dumping, subsidizing, or increasing imports, in order to promote UAE exports and support and diversify national industries, increasing their competitiveness in the regional and global markets.</p><h4>The Ministry of Economy expects a GDP growth rate between 3.6 and 3.9%. Looking at the current geopolitical situation in the region, what are the major risk factors that the UAE needs to take into account and what is the best strategy to hedge such exposures?</h4><p>The Ministry remains confident of achieving AED1.6 trillion in GDP this year as compared to the AED1.49 trillion posted in the previous year, accompanied by a close to 3% increase in constant prices. In line with this, the national economy continues to maintain its position as one of the most diverse economies in the GCC region. The UAE's current ranking across all global economic indices shows its success in implementing non-oil diversification efforts and creating a highly conducive investment and knowledge-based environment. In fact, the country currently ranks third in the economic openness index, fourth in the business environment and infrastructure indexes, and fifth in the global readiness and readiness change indexes. Since 2015, the UAE's economic and financial policies have played a key role in improving the country's ability to cope with global economic pressures while also being able to maintain financial and monetary stability. More policies and structural reforms are planned with the aim of enhancing the business environment and improving access to credit and the modernization of the labor market. To further enhance this, the country has expressed commitment to revising economic policy measures to further synchronize investments across the seven Emirates, drive in more investment opportunities outside free zones, promote competition, and support the government's call to create a diversified, knowledge-based economy. Industry experts have shared that the high level of economic activity associated with hosting Dubai Expo 2020 is expected to attract more than 25 million visitors from around the world and bring in foreign investment in a number of key sectors such as retail, real estate, tourism, and education. FDI is expected to grow by AED50 billion by 2020. The industrial sector has been witnessing continuous growth in the country, accounting for 53% of non-oil exports. The UAE is one of the leading countries in the field of developing clean and renewable energy in the Middle East and aims to rely on it by 2050. The UAE government has also expressed its continuing commitment to study and evaluate the ever-changing social, economic, and political landscape, which is expected to enhance its ability to respond with unprecedented speed to any challenges by developing and implementing new economic policies and regulations aimed at enhancing international market confidence in the country's ability to manage and guide its economy amid global economic changes and meet key challenges such as climate change, security threats, employment polarization, and financial instability. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have relations between the UAE and Panama evolved since you took office in 2014?</h4><p>As soon as I won the election I decided to establish an embassy here in order to expand our diplomatic footprint. Since then, we have sent an ambassador and exchanged a number of missions. The Dubai Chamber of Commerce came to Panama and wants to open an office there. Additionally, we plan on bringing a business delegation here and have confirmed that Panama will participate in Expo 2020. We are signing different agreements aimed at protecting investment and supporting tourism between our countries. Going forward, the main challenge is ensuring that we add value to all of the cargo that comes through the Canal. This would not only ensure Panama's position as a shipping and logistics hub, but would also allow firms and countries to maximize their industrial and economic potential. </p><h4>What are the strategic priorities and areas of cooperation between Panama and the UAE moving forward?</h4><p>Trade is a vital component of relations between Panama and the UAE and can be further leveraged to support both nations. If we are able to establish a direct flight, then trade could expand a great deal. Panama and the UAE both represent international success stories: both are global hubs with air connectivity and financial centers that play an important role. Each place is also a gateway to their respective regions: the UAE for the Middle East, India, and Africa, and Panama for Central and Latin America, with the Canal the most modern and visible symbol of our ability to connect the world and bring people together. Moreover, our airport serves 15 million passengers and has 15,000 employees, which we seek to grow to 30-45,000 in the coming years. In terms of investment, we invite the UAE's investment fund to bring capital into Panama, vitalizing sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and real estate. </p><h4>What are the biggest lessons Panama can learn from the UAE?</h4><p>The UAE is a country that promotes peace, dialog, tolerance, and investment protection and, as such, has a great future ahead. A key area we can learn from is immigration. Changing regulations to drive immigration would be a vital, including visa requirements so that we can support expanded tourism. In Panama, we changed from restricted visas to stamp visas, and I hope that one day we can open the country entirely, doing away with visas. This is, of course, a process that takes time. From a business point of view, an immigration reform would facilitate a smooth transition for international SMEs looking to enter the country and bring their expertise. By having nationals from more than 150 countries working together in the UAE, it sends a strong message to countries that are currently closing their borders and restricting access. You cannot define people by their country of origin, and the UAE is doing an excellent job illustrating this.</p><h4>What would be your message for UAE investors interested in Panama?</h4><p>Panama's FDI has grown by more than USD4.5 billion every year in recent years, coming from Asia, the US, Europe, and the Middle East. Thanks to our robust regulatory system, investing in our country is secure, profitable, and safe. In this sense, we have directed more than USD500 million in the fight against corruption. Panama's USD65 billion GDP has been growing steadily for the past 10 years, averaging 6-7% growth per year. Unemployment is less than 5%, and inflation is less than 1%. Like the UAE, we have benefited from the growing presence of international companies that are using our geographic position. As proof of our extremely business friendly environment, 150 international companies from all industries and service specialties have moved their headquarters to Panama. Work permits can be granted with nearly same-day service, and the government is constantly trying to ensure the highest technological standards are introduced and implemented. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In this sixth edition of the World Government Summit, I have been honored with the role of the chief guest and the honorable guest country given to India. This is a matter of pride and great happiness not only for me, but for all Indians. In the form of Prime Minister, I have traveled to the Gulf region several times before 2018. However, whenever I come here to the UAE, I feel a special attachment.</p><p>After several decades, India's relations with Gulf countries have become so deep, so comprehensive, and so vibrant. Today, our dynamics with the Gulf countries is not just confined to a buyer-seller relationship, but it has become a true partnership. I was in Abu Dhabi and signed several agreements, one of them, the Lower Zakum Concession, is the first-ever investment of an Indian company in the upstream sector of the Middle East. The brighter aspect of the partnership has begun.<br><br>The Indian community not only sowed the seeds of its dreams along with the dreams of local people, but also with the same commitment, by considering this place as its own home. India takes pride in that more than 3 million Indians live in the Gulf countries, as they have become partners in the developmental journey of this region.<br><br>In the UAE, people were surprised when His Highness Crown Prince took the initiative of constructing a Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi when I came here last time. I would like to express my gratitude to His Highness Crown Prince on behalf of all the 1.25 billion Indians. The construction of a temple is significant also in the form of a bridge of goodwill. We have been raised in a tradition in which a temple and a holy place is an agent of humanity, where a holy place is an agent of harmony. I believe that this temple will be unique in terms of architecture, in terms of technology, and in terms of the message it gives. It will also be an opportunity to make the world community feel the mantra which we have followed for living our lives: the whole world is one family. And because of this thing it will also become a medium for acquiring a unique Indian identity.<br><br>I would like to tell all those who are related to the construction of the temple that the rulers of this place have shown so much respect for India, have given so much respect to India's cultural traditions: now it is our responsibility not to leave any loose end, not to commit any mistake.<br><br>In a way, a small India resides here. There is not even a single corner in this country where India is not represented. And that is why you can experience very well how fast India has been changing and with what kind of confidence 1.25 billion Indians have been moving ahead to realize their dreams. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the progress on the Strategic Tunnel Enhancement Programme (STEP) as the project reaches completion?</h4><p>STEP is currently operational, although there have been some challenges. Effectively, we have operated STEP from the start of August 2017 on one side of the pumping station. Sewage flows through the tunnel and is being pumped into the treatment plant for processing. However, we still need to go through the full commissioning process. Although we hoped it would be complete by the end of 2017, certain complications mean the official opening will be later in 2018. At that point, we will have the project fully operating on both sides of the pumping station, with the tunnel flowing fully. Over the next two years, STEP will be increasingly used as we decommission 34 other pumping stations. The ongoing capacity that we have built into the system will safeguard Abu Dhabi's collection system for 80 years, taking into account a tripling of the population, based on figures from 2010.</p><h4>What lessons have you learned over the course of addressing the challenges of this megaproject?</h4><p>The principles, technology, and design have all been proven, and one of the great successes of STEP has been the branding. Our approach in terms of the contracting work has also proven to be correct; the choice to use a shared risk model with our partners was extremely effective. Building underground structures at such great depths is extremely complicated. In order to get the best cost for Abu Dhabi's government, we made a commitment to share the risk of what we call unknown physical conditions (UPCs). That worked out well in our favor, as we were able to get a lower contract price with minimal risk.</p><h4>What has ADSSC further done to assist Abu Dhabi's plans regarding its carbon footprint?</h4><p>We now have schemes designed and ready to bring the recycled use of wastewater up to 100%. The original target for this achievement was 2018, though it will likely take another year or two before full completion. In Al Ain, we already reuse 100% of the wastewater, and Abu Dhabi is moving toward 100% reuse as per the government target. We also work with the environmental agency and some of the forestry agencies to look at the reuse of biosolids and testing their safety. The treated sewage effluent (TSE) is currently being used for irrigation in golf clubs, central reservations, and parkland. As for industrial applications, our approach is to treat it to the standard currently in use for irrigation.</p><h4>ADSSC has achieved a very high level of Emiratization within the organization. How did you achieve this?</h4><p>We have had a focused Emiratization policy over the years. We have brought in well over 100 trainees across the business, from engineering to administration, finance, and everything in between. Our aim is to develop younger nationals into management streams so they eventually take over the business from the few remaining expatriates. One challenge is to ensure proper succession planning in order to ensure that high potential trainees and post-development managers can take over the leadership of the business. The challenge is to get them motivated and trained in the right way. We have a focused development program. Once they come out of it, there is still further specialization. Getting them interested in some of the more technical elements of the business is where we need to work harder. Engineers are fewer in graduate numbers, with the oil business taking in more of the engineering graduates. We have to compete with that business to attract candidates into the wastewater business; however, we have been successful, and we have many young nationals now taking part in running the business. Among the number of expats that we have, in total about 60 in the entire business, there are only two in senior management, including myself. Most of our leaders are nationals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does FANR play in advancing the country's regulatory environment around nuclear energy?</h4><p>We have established ourselves not only as a functioning regulatory body to enforce safety, security, and non-proliferation for nuclear energy, but also as an organization that supervises hospitals, dentists, and all those institutions that need licenses for sophisticated machines that emit radiation. As outlined by our management board, to become globally recognized as a leading nuclear regulator, we need to achieve excellence in our operations, like most UAE institutions.  We are presently reviewing the operating license application for the Unit 1 of the Barakah plant and need to make sure it is built according to international standards and FANR regulations before we award the operating license. The long length of this concession requires a rigorous process of supervision over safety issues and the consideration of security requirements. The potential impact on the environment is also part of FANR's review efforts.</p><h4>What is the estimated economic impact of the Barakah Power Plant in the context of UAE Vision 2021?</h4><p>This is the first time since 1985 that a new country has introduced nuclear power, and the reason for this investment is strategic, as nuclear energy seeks to save the country from oil dependency and reduce the environmental impact of electricity production. In this context, the Barakah nuclear power plant will provide stable and reliable electricity across the UAE, in addition to a new career path for the economy and youth. In order to be fully operational, a lot of skills are required in various sectors, from basic science, and engineering to legal advising. Initially at FANR, expats such as myself came to set up, mentor, and train, but eventually we will leave space to nationals. In our efforts to support the Emiratization process, we initially started hiring from local industries and governmental institutions as well as universities to train groups of students before moving them into the appropriate departments. Presently we have over 220 staff members, of which 64% are Emiratis, whom we have trained in nuclear and radiation regulation to be able to assume leading expert or management roles in the nuclear sector.</p><h4>What is the importance of building such an integrated network with local and international authorities? </h4><p>In the same way as nuclear vendors and operators have transformed into global players, nuclear regulation has also been impacted by globalization. In line with the need for continuous improvement and to continue to ensure maximum safety of the public, workers, and the environment, we need to strengthen our regulatory programs on nuclear safety, security, and radiation protection and safeguards. Forming international partnerships where information and experience is exchanged between regulatory authorities, as well as increasing support from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has so far resulted in stronger, more robust regulatory frameworks being set up all over the globe. Likewise for FANR, partnerships with local and international entities play an indispensable role. It establishes a platform for cooperation, support, and  the exchange of information and knowledge. Locally, FANR has presently 15 agreements and MoUs signed with federal and local government agencies that help nurture our mission and provide the means to regulate the nuclear sector. Internationally, FANR has signed 19 agreements and MoUs with international organizations and regulatory authorities of other countries to share technical information, exchange experience and lessons learned as well help in building national capacity in nuclear and radiation. Thanks to having cooperation agreements, FANR has contributed strongly to the nuclear sector by creating the legal and regulatory framework to be followed, adopting and enforcing regulations for the nuclear industry that are on a high international level, and inspecting the compliance with these regulations to ensure public health and safety and ensuring the peaceful uses of it. The work of FANR and its partners is continuously enhancing the nuclear safety culture in the UAE.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your opinion of the restructuring of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), and what will it mean for Statoil's operations?</h4><p>The journey ADNOC started on is a transformation that is truly impressive. Its newly unified brand, bringing together all its subsidiary companies under one common identity, highlights the scale of its business and strengthens its position locally and internationally. It was a great decision to rebrand ADNOC following the restructuring of its organization and having sharpened its strategies. By doing that, it will be easier for ADNOC to excel and deliver on its future targets  and be well positioned to support long-term economic growth.</p><h4>What policies and regulations are required to address green energy issues moving forward?</h4><p>For Statoil, our CO2 emissions are extremely important. In Norway, we produce oil and gas with half of the CO2 emissions per produced unit compared with the global industry average. We are currently at around 9kg per barrel, while the industry average is around 18kg. Our goal is to maintain our industry leadership in producing oil and gas with lower emissions. It is essential that we take strong and effective actions to meet the challenges associated with man-made climate change and realize the important goals set in the Paris Agreement. We are pleased that Abu Dhabi has initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions. Targeted efforts are underway throughout our business. We are working on a wide range of measures, from major CO2 initiatives to minor actions that will help reduce our carbon footprint. There is also more research being done on methods to minimize and sharpen the use of energy in the most efficient manner to get the CO2 pressure down from the operations.</p><h4>What further R&amp;D would you like to see in this area?</h4><p>There will be a reduction of CO2 in operations through energy efficiency in the way facilities are operated. With less movement of vehicles and people using technology, energy demand will be reduced. In addition, the use of CO2 in EOR will continue. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an important area for future research, and it is still far from reaching the level we want to see at this stage, since it is still expensive to capture CO2 and challenging to store it in areas close to people. In the North Sea, we use seismic tools to map CO2 storage and document where we have stored it underground. This becomes important in dense locations in terms of safety and security. Oil and gas will stay here for many years to come, as will coal—the most CO2-intensive form of energy. Having research and a focus on CCS is extremely important; furthermore, capturing research has stood still without any groundbreaking technology, especially from exhaust gases. It is demanding to capture CO2 from exhaust gasses, and we have test plants in Norway that show it remains expensive and demanding. We need to radically focus new ways of capturing CO2.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the Hywind project in Scotland and your plans for future collaborations with Abu Dhabi companies?</h4><p>The Hywind project is the first floating wind park in the world. We have been researching floating wind in Norway for many years; it is the next wave in renewable energy, and within the next decade, we aim to make floating wind a competitive renewable energy. Hywind is considered commercially viable wherever sea depths are too great for conventional fixed offshore wind power. Also, from a production point of view, the floating wind park creates opportunities as there are no limitations on assembly methods. It eliminates the need for vessels and creates an unlimited size of generator capacity. We are collaborating with Masdar on this project, and we have recently signed a further agreement with Masdar on Batwind project, where we combine wind with battery technology to store energy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate the population's adoption of waste efficiency and recycling and ensure the economic sustainability of your programs?</h4><p>The key is to reach out to the public using a varied range of media and communication channels. This creates greater awareness of these initiatives and highlights the other strategic approaches that are currently being designed and implemented at Tadweer. We also work together with other agencies, as we are aware that the development of a sustainable waste culture is a long-term program that will only show results over an extended period of time. Public acceptance has been increasing as it gradually adapts to the culture of source segregation and recycling. Economically speaking, we look at the most competitive bid and outsource the services to optimize operations and reduce costs. For example, public bins prevent the illegal dumping of waste, which costs the government AED20 billion (USD5.44 billion) per year.</p><h4>How would you recommend the regulations in the UAE to be improved in order to have higher standards of health, safety, and environment (HSE)?</h4><p>The Abu Dhabi Centre for Occupational Safety and Health (OSHAD) is the regulatory body for occupational safety and health, which has certain mandatory requirements, whereas other Emirates only comply with Federal Law No. 8 of 1980 (as amended in 2007) and Ministerial Order No. 32 for 1982. When comparing OSHAD's regulatory framework with compliance with the abovementioned laws, OSHAD's regulatory framework is extremely comprehensive. In addition, there is a need for a coordinated implementation linkage between the requirements of various regulatory authorities like the civil defense, police, and so on with OSHAD.</p><h4>To what extent is there a mismatch between the level of construction and population growth with the waste management infrastructure?</h4><p>The Integrated Waste Management Master Plan for the next 25 years takes into account population growth as well as economic growth, which means growth in industries and commercial entities and healthcare facilities. The model-based master plan is in the process of implementation and the waste infrastructural gap will soon be filled.</p><h4>What, if any, new tenders will be launched in the near future, and how can foreign investors participate?</h4><p>New opportunities in waste management include a tire recycling facility, a waste-to-biofuel/jet fuel/chemical facility, a waste-to-refuse derived fuel (RDF)/solid recovered fuel (SRF) facility, waste-to-energy (for water desalination) facility, material recovery facility (MRF), green waste, and animal waste treatment for resource recovery. Such projects are typically published in local newspapers and on the center for waste management's (CWM's) website, where all interested companies can participate in arranging partnerships with local companies as per the government's requirements. Investors who express interest in doing business with Tadweer must first obtain a trade license from the Department of Economic Development (DED) and the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce. Alternatively, they can collaborate with a local company based in Abu Dhabi or form a new company for this purpose. Subsequently, they have to approach the CWM license office to obtain approval as a waste sector entity.</p><h4>In what way is technology utilized in Abu Dhabi's waste management?</h4><p>Tadweer adopts fleet management integrated with RFID for waste bins to report heat maps of waste generation. Through a content management system (CMS) integrated with municipality inspector users, all deficiencies are reported in a common plate form as well as on the GIS Dashboard. Moreover, Abu Dhabi has a robotic fleet for side loading bins and an automated truck for bin washing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the UAE's regional and global leadership in promoting clean energy?</h4><p>The UAE is a regional leader in developing and deploying clean energy solutions and technology. An excellent example of such leadership is Masdar, which sends a strong message to the whole world that the country is making waves in the renewable energy sector. Furthermore, the UAE's commitment to promoting renewable energy received global acknowledgement when the country was chosen to host the permanent headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in its capital, Abu Dhabi, in 2009. The fact that one of the world's leading hydrocarbon producers can compete with established players in the field of renewable energy reaffirms the UAE's commitment to reducing its ecological footprint and transitioning to a climate-resilient green economy. Locally, we have mega projects such as Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, the largest single-site solar park in the world with a planned capacity of 1GW by 2020 and 5GW by 2030. Several other projects of around 400MW have already been connected to the grid, and we have positive expectations for further additions in 2019. Furthermore, Masdar is bidding for renewable energy projects in Saudi Arabia and Oman, transferring our experience abroad, and supporting development ventures around the world, especially on remote islands, where communities are in dire need of power supply. We are also extremely active in improving efficiency in energy supply and promoting demand-side management. We are working on high-tech solutions to produce desalinated water and have had great success in popularizing energy-efficient green buildings. The UAE is one of the top 10 countries globally in terms of cumulative LEED-certified gross sqm outside the US, according to a list revealed by the US Green Building Council (USGBC) in 2017.</p><h4>How do you see the role of the private sector in addressing sustainability challenges and advancing the UAE's economic diversification agenda?</h4><p>The private sector has a vital role to play across industries to advance the sustainability agenda. There are some excellent examples of the growing commitment of the private sector to sustainability. For example, the Majid Al Futtaim Group launched an initiative to be net positive by 2040, starting to embed sustainability in most of its practices and policies. Meanwhile, DP World has embarked on the construction of the largest distributed solar rooftop project in the Middle East, with the installation of 88,000 rooftop solar panels on its Dubai facilities. In a bid to bring the private sector on board to help us achieve our leaders' vision, the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment in 2016 established the “Environment and Business Majlis" with the aim of boosting the contribution of the private sector and aligning it with the government's environmental strategies. Furthermore, the Ministry recently launched the “UAE Green Business Toolkit" to inspire companies across the country to become eco-friendlier and socially responsible and enhance awareness about ways to operate in a greener fashion.</p><h4>What role can green finance models and fiscal policy play in the transition to a green economy?</h4><p>Green finance is something we take seriously. We work in close cooperation with financial institutions and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Finance Initiative to ensure readiness to support and finance promising projects. Locally, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) announced a USD27 billion green fund in 2016 that offers loans to investors in the clean energy sector at reduced interest rates, and First Abu Dhabi Bank has committed USD10 billion in financing over the next 10 years toward the clean energy sector. In 2016, we announced the Dubai Declaration on Sustainable Finance, signed by 32 UAE financial institutions that committed to supporting the UAE's transition to a green economy. Garnering the backing of financial institutions and understanding green technology requirements is crucial. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your key priorities in the UAE, and how do they reflect the trends in the country and Middle East?</h4><p>The dynamics around us define and refine our priorities. The UAE and Middle East are transforming away from a traditional, purely hydrocarbons-based industry and using that natural wealth to diversify and build a future of efficiency and sustainability. Bilfinger is well positioned within these plans. Our century-long focus and expertise in both the worlds of CAPEX and OPEX give us the privilege to serve our clients along the entire value chain and support their efforts not only to build things better, but also to run and manage them more efficiently and sustainably. On the CAPEX side, we begin with an idea all the way to detailed value engineering and then onto the project to ensure that the money being spent results in the highest return.</p><h4>How do you project the recent asset allocation toward natural gas impacting the hydrocarbon industry?</h4><p>New exploration, marginal fields, sour and ultra-sour, and even unconventional assets have all come into focus, albeit at a higher production cost, thanks in part to energy security considerations and the economic viability of the petrochemical industry. However, there is an internal source of productivity and additional capacity that is not fully explored. It starts with basic efficiency measures in the power sector to produce more with the same, enhanced desalination solutions to reduce power consumption, integration of refining, and petrochemical assets to better utilize side streams and leverage hydrogen, CO, and CO2 as strategic molecules. Furthermore, the energy and hydrocarbon industry have not truly tapped into enormous technological possibilities here. The role of digital transformation starts in better designs and more efficient processes but stretches on far beyond into the world of data; digitization will have a much bigger impact on enhancing operations.</p><h4>What is the biggest challenge of the oil and gas industry in the UAE and Middle East?</h4><p>Apart from the markets' volatility translating into more pressure on the margins, unconventional supplies continue to drive the cost race. For Middle East producers, blessed by the low lifting cost, the game is all around the availability, reliability, and maintenance. As long as the oil price is around USD70-75, shale producers have a healthy cash flow and solid margins to service their debt and continue to drill. The same holds true for Middle East producers, even though the elements are somewhat different. At this oil price, the net margins are healthy, allowing the social cost and economic spending to continue at the right pace. The challenge comes when the needle drops to around USD40-50. That is where social priorities prevail, growth CAPEX freezes, and the entire eco-system suffers. This very familiar and somewhat cyclical scenario suggests continuous focus on cost reduction, efficiency, and productivity is more than prudent.</p><h4>How can energy efficiency technologies and concepts be applied to the power generation issue that the UAE faces?</h4><p>There are many opportunities on this front; the basic rules of thermodynamics that suggests a combined cycle power plant provides much higher efficiency to advanced technologies like Bilfinger's Heat-Reclaimer that looks at that efficient combined cycle power plant and finds another few percentages of efficiency to be extracted. On the other hand, looking at the significant installed thermal generation capacity in the UAE, we could build a bridge between concentrated solar and existing thermal generation units through another innovative technology that Bilfinger has developed HyCSP. Desalination processes also have to be revisited given very high energy consumption in both thermal and RO units. We have managed to crack the code with some of our patented solutions along with our partners. Keeping in mind that industry is conservative and is not comfortable with revolutionary solutions, we are taking incremental steps, co-piloting some of these and showcasing the results. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you walk us through the evolution of the company in the last few decades?</h4><p>Zakher Marine international, established in Abu Dhabi in 1984, has more than 30 years' experience in the industry. Currently, we have three business units: a marine assets unit, which is subdivided into the mobile offshore units and offshore service vessels (OSVs); a sub-sea division; and an offshore manpower section. We are a marine service provider, though we are gearing toward becoming a turnkey solutions provider to our clients operating in the offshore—both oil and gas, marine construction, and renewables sectors. Originally, we started out on a small scale as a ship operator and manager. As our capital grew and profits increased, we entered the ship-owning field, purchasing second-hand vessels in the early 1990s. In 2001-2002, we decided to build our own vessels and were one of the first to bring in dynamic positioning vessels. A key moment in the evolution of Zakher Marine was the strategic decision made to enter the mobile offshore units market, which has enabled us to significantly scale up in terms of asset size and capability and gave us the opportunity to take a considerable amount of the local market value share within a short period of time.</p><h4>How do you foresee the needs of clients evolving in the offshore business?</h4><p>All three of our divisions will see their fair share of demand in the long term. The oil crisis in the last few years had a significant impact across the supply chain. We have seen demand for jack-up rigs remain strong in the last three years and brought in new assets that met client expectations and allowed us to remain technologically advanced and cutting edge for years to come. We took advantage of low shipbuilding costs and saw a gap in the market, pricing structure, and lack of competition. At the end of the day, this is a sector with high barriers to entry.</p><h4>Where have technological advancements had the largest impact on offshore and marine services?</h4><p>Unfortunately, our industry technology has had a longer lead time than other parts of the oil and gas supply chain. This is because of the high cost of innovation and the willingness of clients to explore these new innovations. Clients want to be sure that a technology will become the industry standard before they take on a substantial investment. I do not see this changing until the market is back to where there is a lack of great assets, favorable pricing for ship owners, and activity. All three have to be present to ensure that there is a focus on R&amp;D and innovation. Globally, there is currently a fascination with big data that allows one to analyze many different aspects of operations, improving internal practices and comparing them with industry standards. Data analytics are also important for market intelligence and sourcing information to make better decisions.</p><h4>How are marine services reacting to the shift from oil services to gas services?</h4><p>For us, oil and gas are synonymous. There have been gas field developments in many places in Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, and for us, there is no difference when it comes to the utilization of assets. We are equally suited to providing services for gas developments or oil developments. In terms of renewable energy, offshore wind farm developments are potential target markets. As jack-up owners and operators, we have done a great deal of research into the European and Asian market to have a foothold by the end of the year. Ever since we started owning jack-up assets, we were focused on ensuring that the assets could transfer across industries. Our jack-ups are extremely versatile in terms of geographic location as well as technical capabilities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the contract for the Ratna field, and what does this mean for overall UAE-India relations?</h4><p>India is truly a core market for NPCC—we have been executing projects in India for past 35 years, amounting to USD2.6 billion. India was never really impacted by the recent industry downturn, as India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) continued to spend CAPEX on projects, so it has always provided us stability. The importance of this is also reflected in our in-country capabilities and workforce. We have two engineering companies: NPCC Engineering Limited (NEL), which has been operating for the past 10 years with around 250 employees, and ANEWA, which we acquired in 2016 and for which we recently inaugurated a new, 40,000-sqft office in Hyderabad with over 450 employees. All these demonstrate the strength of our relationship with ONGC, nurtured throughout the different projects as partners. The latest project, Ratna R-Series, is valued around USD327 million. It consists of five new unmanned wellhead platforms as well as five jackets, nine segments of pipeline with total length of 140km of various sizes, five segments of composite cables with a total length of 63km, and modifications at two existing platforms.</p><h4>How do you seek to position NPCC within the current trends of the energy sector?</h4><p>Sector-wise, we have historically focused on upstream, whether it is onshore or offshore. However, the strategy launched in 2017 seeks for NPCC to be a leader in the broader energy sector, and not only upstream or oil and gas. This implies both a vertical and horizontal expansion within the industry. On the one hand, we seek to strengthen our position in the onshore sector to eventually enter into downstream. On the other hand, we are looking at renewables, especially in the form of offshore wind farms. The country places a great deal of importance on renewables, and the plan is to support this direction. 2018 seems to be a healthy year for NPCC, and hopefully there is more to come. All the plans announced by ADNOC in the UAE, KOC in Kuwait, and Aramco in Saudi Arabia, will require current players to step up and provide support.</p><h4>What is your opinion on ADNOC's in-country-value (ICV) program to energize the private sector?</h4><p>This is truly a strategic move, and given the importance of ADNOC in the UAE's economy, it will have knock-on effects on other industries beyond oil and gas and become a standard for anyone seeking to do business in the country. It allows for a level playing field and for players to invest in the country's economy. We saw different waves of companies, coming first from Korea and then China, that did not really add much value to the local economy. ICV will also help develop human resources and skills within the country, as well as new industries. For example, today's downstream industry is not truly at the level the country expected to be, though through the ICV it will also flourish.</p><h4>What is the key to help young people understand the specialized needs of the industry?</h4><p>Although the new generation is extremely well educated, developing human capital is crucial, since the contracting business may not sound too appealing to young graduates. However, we have almost 300 young Emiratis within the company and target 550 by the end of 2021. We seek to do this by stating clearly what their role will be and giving them the right training and career development programs, while at the same time working on succession planning. We identify potential successors and equip them with the right skills to enable them to hit the road running and fill the target position without any issues. The relevance of these developments is showcased in the field of innovation, where young Emiratis were empowered to express their ideas and engaged in real projects, some of which were developed with a technology provider specifically for our use, when we developed an IP. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Have there been any developments in hydrogen-based solutions or CO2 in oil recovery enhancement technology in the last few years?</h4><p>We are currently working on developing ideas and concepts to optimize the management of industrial gases in the context of integrating refining and petrochemical production units. The implication is that one can develop and implement new models of efficient management of utilities and streams between the different units to optimize OPEX for complex production systems. That includes, among many other options, a better integration of industrial gas sources and operations, including hydrogen and other synthetic gases. This is in line with our medium-term strategy, which consists of being a key technology and operation partner for our regional partners in industrial gases and related services.</p><h4>How would you characterize working as part of a joint venture in different markets?</h4><p>On the downstream side, ADNOC has announced plans for approximately USD45 billion in investments until 2025 in new refining and chemical production facilities, primarily in Ruwais, to develop the largest integrated petrochemical complex. This is part of ADNOC's strategy to secure long-term growing markets for its crude oil by processing up to 20% of the product into high-value chemical and plastic products, while creating new jobs and revenues in the UAE. That is why there is a gradual shift to petrochemicals and the downstream value chain, which will require the best technologies, existing and new, as well as operational excellence in all domains including plant design, execution, operation, and maintenance.</p><h4>What are some of the main risks and challenges in the regional market?</h4><p>On the geopolitical side, we are all concerned by the role of Iran in destabilizing the region. In terms of the economy, we see a critical push to develop the value chain downstream; form partnerships with key players; and engage in technological R&amp;D, high-value services, and operational excellence. In addition, there is a will to develop more local capabilities and push even further into the education system. This is all a greenlight for investors, including Linde Group. There may be a long-term risk with crude oil markets, as one can see the development of the energy portfolio, including the electrical and hydrogen mobility in Northeast Asia and Europe, which are key markets for the region. This is why players such as ADNOC are hedging their risks and growing into petrochemicals to reduce their dependency on crude oil.</p><h4>How do you expect big data analysis to enhance your operations from a risk management point of view?</h4><p>We operate more than 1,000 industrial gas production assets worldwide. A large majority of them are operated centrally by a remote operating control (ROC) system in connection to our best experts and advanced operation and maintenance tools, so that all sites' operations are optimized 24/7 to minimize OPEX, optimize onstream time, and prevent major incidents. We have an extremely CAPEX-intensive business that requires an investment of about USD3 to generate USD1 of revenue. To avoid failures, there is a need to use powerful software that analyzes thousands of data from a single plant, generating an analysis of what to do next in real time, and to witness any deviations in the process—even deviations which an operator cannot notice using standard tools. If the equipment were to fail, the cost would be extremely high. We see big data tools and technology evolving to better prepare our commissioning, operations, and accident prevention. Therefore, we are developing systems that integrate in one platform the full life cycle of an asset from the very early design to the ultimate decommissioning of the plant 30-40 years later. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be the major impact of the new Borouge 4 plant at Ruwais as it approaches its FEED stage?</h4><p>With the realization of Borouge 4, we will be able to grow our business together with that of our customers and deliver solutions that meet their expectations and address their challenges. This will lead to doubling our capacity of polymer production in Ruwais by 2025. The investments in Borouge 4 will also further strengthen our position as a leading provider of creative plastics solutions.</p><h4>What does the recent shift of the hydrocarbon industry toward the downstream segment mean for Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Diversification is central to Abu Dhabi's economic strategy, as the Emirate plans to increase the contribution of non-oil sectors to its GDP. To achieve this, the industrial sector will play a vital role, especially the downstream business including petrochemicals and plastics industries, on which Abu Dhabi's strategic business development strategy is based. We will not only have the world's largest integrated refining and petrochemicals hub in Ruwais, where Borouge is a large player, supported by a huge investment of USD45 billion over the next five years; we will also support the development and diversification of the UAE's economy with increased FDI, new business and employment opportunities, and in-country value creation.</p><h4>How do you expect demand for plastic solutions to evolve in the future?</h4><p>The world today faces huge global challenges around carbon emissions, food, drinking water, and sanitation, and Borouge's role is to provide specialized solutions that positively contribute to addressing these challenges. We do this through strong collaboration and deep engagement with the value chain, including packaging, infrastructure energy, mobility, agriculture and medical solutions. We see the demand for plastics solutions in these markets growing, especially in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. We are investing further in the Borouge 4 plant and other expansion plans like the new PP5 unit in Ruwais and the compounding manufacturing plant (CMP) in Shanghai.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the energy saving guidelines set by UAE Vision 2021 and Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030?</h4><p>Reducing energy usage within our operations is a key aspect of our environmental stewardship and economic growth. Consequently, we seek to invest in innovation and improve our energy efficiency while monitoring our performance. Our direct and indirect energy consumption decreased by 5% and 7%, respectively, compared to 2016 levels. In addition, we managed to reduce our total energy consumption, both direct and indirect, by 5%, which reflects the successful implementation of the different energy efficiency initiatives this year. We also managed to take another step toward our 2021 target of reducing our total energy consumption by 14% per ton produced as we achieved a reduction of 9%.</p><h4>How can the oil and gas industry remain ahead of the technological innovation curve and gain benefits across its whole value chain?</h4><p>We must keep investing in innovation and research to ensure we have the right technology in place so that our operations are safe for people and the environment. We must also be more efficient in the way they are operated with regards to energy, feedstock, and handling. Digitalization and AI have the potential to create tremendous value for both industry and society. Digitalization promotes new energy sources and carriers, as well as innovative models for the optimization and marketing of energy. Developments in technologies such as social media, big data, and analytics are driving trends that have immense potential for oil and gas. New digital technologies combined with data-driven insights can transform operations, boosting agility and strategic decision-making. Integrated digital platforms can enhance collaboration among different participants in the oil and gas ecosystem, in addition to accelerating innovation, reducing costs, and increasing transparency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Master Plan]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-master-plan]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are things progressing with your offshore project in Shuwaihat?</h4><p>The Shuwaihat field is one field among many in the Western region. The project began a few years back. In 2010, we signed an agreement with ADNOC for the technical evaluation of the field. Our goal of the technical appraisal with ADNOC was to find out whether the Shuwaihat gas accumulation was sufficient enough to be developed. After gathering a large amount of data and gaining the necessary insight into the nature of the field, we are now in discussions with ADNOC to discuss a possible development. These discussions are ongoing, and we hope to come to a conclusion by early 2018. The whole sour gas segment has a large number of undeveloped gas resources, which are of strategic importance for the country. This development could bring Abu Dhabi to a level of high self-sufficiency with regards to gas supplies and exports.</p><h4>How do global developments in the gas market impact Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>There have been many developments and changes in the global gas market in recent years, with a huge amount of shale gas coming into the system. As a result, global dynamics and the market have been transformed, with former importers becoming exporters. There have also been new developments in Asia, with more supplies flowing into the global system. It is hard to predict the final impact of all of these developments, as we are finding out how sustainable shale gas developments will be, and how fast Asian volumes will continue to come into the market. Nevertheless, for the UAE there are enough gas resources to ensure that the country will be largely independent, although it will require further major efforts to develop these gas fields. ADNOC has developed an integrated gas master plan to meet growing energy needs for Abu Dhabi and overseas customers. This demonstrates that it is a top priority, along with integration of the oil and gas business into a higher value chain.</p><h4>What is your perspective on the challenges in developing sour gas?</h4><p>The main challenge with the development of sour gas fields is that they are subsurface, and there is a high degree of complexity involved in approaching the reservoir itself. In addition, sour gas is highly toxic, so high safety standards need to be followed. Wintershall could be a key player because we are a 100% subsidiary of BASF, which has essential technologies in place. There are also challenging and ambitious plans to increase oil recovery from reservoirs elsewhere in Abu Dhabi. New technologies and innovation are needed in that regard. With BASF, we have a large research laboratory capacity that enables us to stay at the forefront of the latest developments. We are not yet involved in any oil asset developments; however, we are confident. Wintershall offers a unique combination of three integrated disciplines: subsurface, engineering, and chemical expertise. This way we are able to develop powerful innovative solutions for sour gas processing, oil production enhancements, and excellent operational performance. We are the perfect partners for Abu Dhabi and we are committed to staying.</p><h4>How do Abu Dhabi and the Middle East fit into Wintershall's portfolio and strategy?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi and the Middle East are a dedicated future core area for Wintershall. Based on our past successes, we are sure of our future production and presence here. There are significant differences between these regions, which is why we take our time to make our decision on the region to select. When we do that, we ensure we understand the region and take the right steps. Shuwaihat was a stepping stone. Abu Dhabi continues to hold the largest oil and gas resources in the region. We came here to be successful—together with our partners. And we came here to make a difference by contributing our knowledge and be a reliable partner for ADNOC.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Looking at the oil price crisis of 2015-2016, what were the major lessons for IOCs like Shell?</h4><p>The oil and gas industry, in the last few years, was losing focus; now the talk is about peak oil, which is a far cry from the discussions that were happening only a few years ago. As far as the Middle East is concerned, although the region bears a low unit cost, when we add both the commercial terms and the fiscal overlay, the breakeven price then becomes fairly high. In this sense, rather than talk about price levels per se, the focus should be on ensuring project resilience during low price environments, since projects get postponed, re-started, stopped again, and so on as a result of spikes and drops. As a result, the industry needed to re-focus and changes needed to be made. This led Shell to reduce its capital investment by around 50% from its 2014 levels (including BG) and to engage in a more selective investment approach, marked by the USD25-30 billion cap communicated to our shareholders. Moreover, as the industry changed, it pushed Shell and ADNOC to reevaluate the technical challenges and costs of the joint development Bab sour gas reservoirs as it made no sense to continue with a high cost gas development where the alternative supply was cheaper. This led to a joint decision to exit. Nonetheless, we will continue to play a role in the Abu Dhabi energy fabric, whether through formal joint-ventures or advisory technical support to ADNOC across the different segments of the industry. Reflecting back on our presence specifically in Abu Dhabi since the 1930s, and generally in the UAE over 50 years ago, through a vibrant downstream aviation, chemicals, and lubricants business, Shell is proud to have a substantial footprint with over 500 staff working out of its UAE offices. At Shell, we not only look to partner with host governments and national operations operators, but also believe in being embedded in a B2B relationship with UAE SMEs, in addition to our core value of supporting the local communities and environments in which we operate. </p><h4>Can you give us more details about Shell's relationship with ADNOC since 2016? </h4><p>On the upstream side, Shell continued to support ADNOC on various projects regarding enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which led to significant cost optimization of developments, as well as exploration system studies that enabled the recent exploration tenders. Following the signing of an agreement in 2016, we have been providing extensive exploration studies, mapping out petroleum systems across Abu Dhabi's ecosystem, collecting all available data, and setting up a new framework within 17 months of intensive efforts. As a result of these studies, ADNOC released the recent blocks that opened up for tenders. When it comes to midstream, it is all about gas capture and reinjection to sustain oil production, and Shell is a 15% shareholder in ADNOC Gas Processing, with 68% being owned by ADNOC, 15% by Total, and 2% Partex. In terms of downstream, we continue to provide technology and licensing opportunities and explore channels to further support ADNOC with optimal cost-effective solutions.</p><h4>How is the UAE positioned within its stated energy transition strategy? </h4><p>The UAE has been a leader when it comes to energy diversification. At an Abu Dhabi level, Masdar was launched in 2006, and today it holds a large portfolio of renewables projects that include solar power in the UAE and wind farms across North West Europe. On a UAE level, the UAE Energy Strategy was launched in 2017, during which an ambitious goal was set for an energy mix composed of 50% fossil fuel and 50% non-fossil fueled energy by 2050. As such, Abu Dhabi and the UAE have been showing a clear interest in reducing their reliance on oil to the benefit of gas, which is expected to represent 38% of the hydrocarbon makeup. Broadly speaking, all the necessary steps for the achievement of these energy targets are being taken at the right pace, and there will be many opportunities for experienced IOCs to support Abu Dhabi on this front.</p><h4>What are the major risks that could affect the energy market in the region in the short to medium term?</h4><p>As an industry, we have an aging workforce, and attracting and developing competent and capable workforce represents an actual risk in the region. Additionally, as facilities age, there will be a need for significant investments in the upgrade and rejuvenation of assets and this can lead to asset integrity exposures. On the supply side, it is becoming more difficult to access the easy oil and gas resources and therefore projects will need different technological solutions such as enhanced oil recovery and unconventional gas production, which, if not deployed effectively and in a timely manner, could lead to supply disruptions. Finally, there will always be black swan events that no one can fully anticipate, and these are not only related to geopolitics and regulations. This is where stress scenarios represent a healthy approach for businesses to be ready to face the future with confidence. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[technology-at-the-heart-of-everything]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the benefits of BP's partnership with the Abu Dhabi government?</h4><p>Typical oil and gas deals are either production sharing agreements (PSA), concessions, or royalty and tax type deals. Our present agreement, however, goes beyond a normal contract; it is more integrated into the organization of a sovereign fund, allowing it to have a real stake in the future of our organization. This is all built on the relationship and trust BP has earned with Abu Dhabi as a result of a well-established history of working together. The success of Abu Dhabi, represented by Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), has been and is an important and attractive factor for BP, and now that Abu Dhabi is our shareholder, the relationship has a different reach. Now Abu Dhabi wants us to succeed in all of our ventures, not only in Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>What cutting-edge technology are you able to implement through this partnership?</h4><p>At BP, we apply technology at scale across all of our portfolio: technology is really at the heart of everything we do. This is visible even in our relationship with ADNOC, where we are providing the best technical and business collaboration to help build greater efficiency and more profitability. In doing so, we are benefiting from greater transparency in terms of how we can add value and transfer our knowledge. This not only concerns technology itself, but also the application of this technology. Providing technology is only half of the game; 50% of success depends on its execution. BP is a leader in deploying enhanced oil recovery (EOR) schemes and has developed several proprietary technologies, such as low salinity water injection, to help recover more oil from the reservoir. BP is also a leader in water flood technology, a type of improved oil recovery. Our success is shown by how we maximize recovery from some of the world's largest reservoirs and from maturing fields in places such as Azerbaijan, Iraq, Russia, and the US. As for Abu Dhabi, we support ADNOC to meet its production target and in their aspiration to achieve 60-70% recovery factor. This is through our technical capability which is demonstrated in different ways: our joint research programs with ADNOC regarding carbonate ionic design, EOR, and reservoir modelling; through the Subsurface Centre of Excellence in ADNOC; our leading position in the Digital Oil Fields work; and our experience in giant water flood oil fields as well as addressing operational challenges. A key enabler, in this sense, is the transfer of senior experts and technology.</p><h4>What have been the most recent developments in the downstream business?</h4><p>All NOCs in the region are looking into downstream as they seek extra value in every drop of oil. This approach is great in terms of diversifying income and reflects the challenges of today's market. In order to be successful, companies will be required to have a competitive edge through a differentiated offer that is then able to grow into a niche market. Each player will be known not only regionally, but also globally for a certain segment of the downstream or petrochemicals business.</p><h4>What further measures should be taken by the government to achieve the 2030 strategy and beyond to 2050?</h4><p>Education is key. We need to start not only from education in schools, but also education in terms of culture, setting role models for the next generation. We have a program with Abu Dhabi Environment Agency called Sustainable Schools, where we train students on how to protect the environment and recycling or reducing some of the waste. If the private sector and the government work closely via these initiatives, it will make a huge difference to society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important are your renewable and non-oil energy projects?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi's strategy to have 27% of its energy coming from clean sources by 2021 runs parallel with our objectives at Total. We are working along the same path, though we may differ slightly in our execution. In solar energy, for example, we have a certain approach; however, our photovoltaic (PV) sales are more affected by the American market, as we cannot match the prices it offers at the moment. We are exploring a different approach and will remain and increase our presence here in everything. Non-oil is also important. We have the Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Company (ADMA-OPCO) concession (now ADNOC Offshore) that ended in March 2018, and we are in discussions for the new concession for the next 40 years. If we look at global demand for energy in the next 50 years, we will need renewables; however, we will also need the traditional energies, and here the advantage is that oil production in the UAE is a low-cost traditional energy compared to other parts of the world.</p><h4>How ambitious are Abu Dhabi's enhanced oil recovery (EOR) targets?</h4><p>From an engineering perspective, the targets are not overly ambitious. I have a great deal of experience as a reservoir engineer, and the fact that there are supposedly 100 barrels available, but only 40-50 can be extracted, is troubling. If there are 100 barrels there, I want to get the maximum. When people call the 70% target ambitious, this is just a matter of price and economics. Perhaps at USD50 per barrel one does not have the same recovery rate as at USD60 and perhaps what is too expensive at USD60 in 10 years' time will be economically viable at USD30.</p><h4>How will the new technologies you are developing impact your operations and the sector at large?</h4><p>We have tried to bring in the latest technologies at Total and implement them here. There were five projects that all brought about a new way of doing things, whether it is the new way of doing seismic monitoring, autonomous robots, studying carbonate reservoirs, quantum data, or alternative logging. All these technologies provide improved methods, such as seismic monitoring with balloons and drones, which allow us to interpret data live and more accurately and effectively. We have to adapt to what is happening in the world and use it to improve the way we work, which is what Total does.<br>How would you assess the progress of Emiratization in the energy sector?<br>We are active in this area and are looking at how to make our R&amp;D effort more efficient in this country in terms of human capacity building. We are deeply involved in this, and our Total Academy is now integrated with the ADNOC Academy. We are helping to reorganize it in such a way that we not only train engineers but also technicians at all levels to improve Emiratization.</p><h4>What are Total's main objectives in 2018?</h4><p>We are in discussions with ADNOC but are not the only people doing so, as there are many players in the field. The concessions will end in March, and ADNOC told us it will finalize things before that date. We are confident in ADNOC's capabilities and are doing whatever is needed to ensure we are involved in the new concession. I came here for the renewal of ADCO and ADMA; we have done ADCO and ADMA onshore and now need to do the offshore. It would be great to expand our cooperation beyond simply offshore as ADNOC wants to form more strategic partnerships that cover more subjects than purely upstream, downstream, or trading. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Following the announcement of an investment to expand its downstream capacity, what will be the key steps for ADNOC Group in developing opportunities across the refinery and petrochemicals segment?</h4><p>It is an exciting time for our downstream business. We are on track to expand our refining and petrochemicals production by building on the existing strengths and competitive advantages of the Ruwais Industrial Complex. <br>With select partners, we plan to invest AED165 billion (USD45 billion) over the next five years to turn the complex into the world's largest and most advanced integrated refining and petrochemicals hub. This will enable us to increase our range and volume of high-value downstream products, secure better access to growth markets around the world and create a manufacturing ecosystem in Ruwais that will significantly stimulate in-country value creation, private sector growth and employment. </p><p>Plans are well advanced to expand the Ruwais complex's refining capacity by more than 65%, or 600,000bpd by 2025, through the addition of a third, new refinery, creating a total capacity of 1.5 million barrels per day (mbpd). The new refinery, coupled with the crude flexibility project, will significantly increase the capability, flexibility and output of Abu Dhabi's refining operations by adding to the range of crudes that can be processed and that in turn enables the export of increased volumes of the high-value Murban crude. </p><p>The expansionary investment program will also see the entire Ruwais complex upgraded to increase its flexibility and integrated capabilities to produce greater volumes of higher-value petrochemicals and derivative products. It includes a plan to build one of the world's largest mixed feed crackers, tripling petrochemical production capacity from 4.5 mtpa to 14.4 mtpa by 2025.</p><h4>How will the Abu Dhabi hydrocarbon industry benefit from ADNOC's new downstream strategy and how will it drive growth and diversification of the wider economy?</h4><p>By 2025, our downstream strategy will add over 15,000 jobs, contribute an additional 1% to GDP per year, and create multiple opportunities for new businesses to be formed and grow alongside us, as we develop a new, large-scale, manufacturing ecosystem in Ruwais through the creation of new petrochemical Derivatives and Conversion Parks. It will also create significant in-country value, as our domestic and international partners work more closely with local SMEs to maximize the use of local products, manufacturing and assembly facilities, services and infrastructure. </p><p>The Derivatives Park will act as a prime catalyst for the next stage of petrochemical transformation by inviting partners to invest and produce new products and solutions from the growing range of feedstocks available in Ruwais.<br>This will create numerous new petrochemical activities and value chains, including construction chemicals, oil and gas chemicals, surfactants, and detergents. </p><p>At the same time, the Conversion Park will act as a catalyst for focused industry clusters that can not only supply products and solutions, using the derivatives and other facilities available, but will also leverage the proximity of such an interconnected ecosystem to drive expertise, innovation, and entrepreneurship.</p><h4>What was the driver behind the licensing strategy that saw the six new onshore and offshore blocks in Abu Dhabi open up for competitive bid, and what will be the implications of such a decision for the upstream segment of the industry?</h4><p>The licensing strategy represents a major advancement in how Abu Dhabi unlocks new opportunities and maximizes value from its hydrocarbon resources. It is also consistent with ADNOC's approach to expanding strategic partnerships across all areas of the business, as we develop and apply new strategies to realize the full potential of our resources, maximize value and accelerate the exploration and development of new commercial opportunities. </p><p>Based on existing data, estimates suggest the new blocks hold multiple billion barrels of oil and multiple trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Some of the blocks already have discoveries, and within the combined area there are 310 targeted reservoirs from 110 prospects and leads. In addition to the country's conventional oil and gas accumulations, some of the offered blocks also contain significant unconventional resource potential. <br>The production of oil and gas from the licensed blocks will make a significant contribution toward achieving our 2030 strategic objectives of a more valuable upstream and the delivery of an economic and sustainable gas supply.</p><h4>As a result of ADNOC Group's introduction of the In-Country Value (ICV) program for its suppliers, what role do you see the program playing in the UAE economy and what long-term benefits will it deliver?</h4><p>Our ICV program seeks to stimulate private sector partnerships and opportunities resulting from our 2030 growth strategy, catalyze socioeconomic development, improve knowledge transfer, and create additional skilled employment for UAE nationals. <br>Our planned capital expenditure across the entire value chain over the next five years will create multiple opportunities for local companies to form and grow alongside ADNOC, as international companies work with local SMEs to maximize the use of local products, manufacturing and assembly facilities, services, and infrastructure. We will also work closely with our suppliers to ensure the success of the program.</p><p>As one of the backbones of the UAE economy, ADNOC provides the stimulus for economic growth, supports GDP diversification, and drives employment. Our ICV program will further strengthen our partnerships with the local private sector and drive even more opportunities for local businesses to benefit and grow alongside us, as well as employment opportunities for Emiratis. It is a win-win situation for the nation, the economy, our suppliers, and ADNOC.</p><h4>What is the importance of pursuing alternative financing strategies, despite disposing of a solid balance sheet?</h4><p>The careful and prudent choice of alternative sources of financing represents a smarter and more efficient use of our resources and capital. It sets us on the path to becoming a more commercially minded company. <br>These new financing initiatives will enable us to explore an expanded range of compelling options for the long-term strategic financing of our operations. </p><p>The USD1.5-billion capital restructure of ADNOC distribution and the issuance of the USD3-billion Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline (ADCOP) bond, in addition to other financial instruments, are tangible examples of how we are proactively managing our asset base, especially our infrastructure assets, while being smarter with the deployment of capital. <br>These transactions demonstrate our ability to unlock value from our portfolio of assets and our ability to design and execute innovative and alternative operating and financing models across our business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the major restructuring in the past few years mean for Abu Dhabi's business ecosystem?</h4><p>A number of restructuring efforts were implemented over the past two years, with the business ecosystem being a key target for improvement. Today, Abu Dhabi boasts a globally competitive business environment that continues to steadily register significant improvements, making doing business in the Emirate smoother and easier than ever before. The current attractive business environment plays a crucial role in attracting new investors with innovative ideas to our market while encouraging the expansion of existing investments. Our ability to attract further FDI will grow further as the Emirate's business ecosystem continues to move up the global competitiveness scale. Examples of the latest efforts aimed at improving the ease of doing business, especially for individual entrepreneurs and SMEs, include: Streamlining and consolidating the registration requirements at Department of Economic Development (DED) and Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry (ADCCI); simplifying property registration; easing the process of obtaining construction and building permits and setting up an electronic system for issuing initial approvals; simplifying the process for obtaining an SME license through the “Tajer Abu Dhabi“ initiative; issuing new e-commerce licenses that allow individual entrepreneurs and SMEs to conduct trade through electronic websites and the social media; and launching the TAMM system, a fully integrated electronic system to obtain trade licenses through DED's website in one step.</p><h4>What is the significance of the MoU signed between ADIO and the Office of the Chinese Business Council?</h4><p>This MoU indicates the strength of business and trade relations between the UAE and China. The agreement aims to strengthen inter-institutional cooperation and exchanges between both parties, and provides further trade and investment opportunities for businesses with the aim of strengthening and deepening existing bilateral, economic, and trade relations. Through ambitious joint projects run by public-private sector partnerships and attracting foreign investment, Abu Dhabi is charting a course toward greater economic diversification, liberalization, sustainability, and enhanced non-oil export capacity. Countries that follow the footsteps of China in this sense will stand to benefit from the attractive investment opportunities that Abu Dhabi's current and future development course has to offer.</p><h4>What are ADIO's key strategic priorities, and what is the driver behind this direction?</h4><p>Key strategic priorities include positioning Abu Dhabi as a trusted partner and preferred investment destination, growing Abu Dhabi's FDI in terms of value and number of projects, and providing business services that ensure satisfactory investor experiences. The key drivers to achieve these goals are the new mandate to unify investment promotion and investment attraction activities across Abu Dhabi government and state-owned enterprises; policy prerogative to grow the private sector's role in the economy, especially SMEs; substantial improvements in the ease of doing business, competitiveness, and innovation over the past decade of concerted effort to diversify the economy; and significant investments in growth and enabling sectors that have created unique investment opportunities across the value chains.</p><h4>What are Abu Dhabi's major regulatory incentives for further investments?</h4><p>There are no taxes on income and profits; the ability to remit capital and profits; a modern real estate law that fully protects and guarantees the rights of investors; up-to-date anti-dumping and bankruptcy laws; a flexible, modern labor law that equally guarantees the rights of labor and employers; modern SMEs Law; and a draft investment law that will allow 100% foreign ownership in specific target sectors throughout the Emirate. The key challenge is that Abu Dhabi's local market is perhaps relatively small and highly competitive, and investors would need to keep an eye on exports to other regional and international markets. The Emirate's world-class airport and seaport provide great connectivity to markets across all five continents. The central geographic location of the Emirate is certainly an added huge advantage in this respect.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The global market for fragrances and perfumes is projected to reach USD51 billion by 2022. How does this figure reflect your operations and what are your expectations?</h4><p>There is a huge demand for oud, oil, incense, and perfumes, not just from established clientele, but also from newer generations as well. Sales expected to increase in Saudi Arabia, the GCC, and the rest of the world. The Saudi manufacturing industry has a huge capacity, with a global reach, and can compete in Europe. One such market where we have enjoyed great success is the French market.</p><h4>What is your core vision on expanding to new markets, and what further expansion do you have in the pipeline?</h4><p>We are expanding to 1,000 branches around the world, and our aim is to open more branches in the US, Europe, and East Asia. One of our latest milestones is opening a flagship store in Times Square in New York. Over the recent past we have also opened our first branches in Russia, Turkey, and South Africa.</p><h4>What is your vision on women empowerment within Arabian Oud and how do you strive for greater female participation?</h4><p>We have recruited more than 400 women for a new female-only factory and we are looking to recruit more. On top of this, we are now increasing our overall female recruitment, especially for our stores in mall venues. In terms of executive female positions, we are working to recruit them in a suitable environment.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your green agenda?</h4><p>Arabian Oud invests in agarwood farms in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. These farms are famous in several high-quality sourcing breeds such as aquilaria malaccensis, aquilaria SPP, aquilaria sinensis, and aquilaria crassna. We also send teams that travel across Indonesian and Malaysian forests to find the best Aryan, Maroki, and Kalimantan agarwood as well as Malino and Sabah agarwood that result in the finest oud, incense, and oil.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the coming years?</h4><p>We are currently the leading fragrance brand in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. With our global expansion plans, we seek to become a global leader as well. Arabian Oud is a unique brand that has grown to be a global representative of Saudi Arabian heritage. </p>]]></richbody0content>
