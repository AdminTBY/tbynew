		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>What were the main advantages that Tripoli offered as a location for the TSEZ?</p><p>Tripoli is the second-largest city in Lebanon, with plenty of untapped human and natural resources. Its location is right next to the Port of Tripoli, the second largest port in the country, which has recently undergone an expansion. Trading activity in Tripoli has increased significantly over the past few years, with more shipping companies choosing the port as their berthing point. Also, it is the gateway to the Levant and the Euro-Mediterranean economic zone, the entry port to Turkey, and the connection through Syria to the Arab hinterland, an area of opportunity we look forward to exploring once the situation there improves. Tripoli also has the Rachid Karami Trade Fair, a 1 million sqm plot of land sitting in the middle of Tripoli that has not been properly exploited yet. Tripoli is well placed in terms of transport routes, capacity, and installations, and offers an excellent platform for attracting investments into Lebanon.</p><h4>How has the TSEZ project brought the business community of Tripoli together?</h4><p>Across the political spectrum, everyone seems cognizant that the TSEZ is one of the most important projects taking place in Tripoli today. Regardless of what party you are from, the project is known to be crucial. Tripoli is in a dismal state due to the lack of a manufacturing industry, little economic activity, and because the few economic sectors present there are not diversified. This project presents a rebirth for the region and the business community is aware of that; people realize the TSEZ has the potential to attract investment and start a new chapter for the north of Lebanon.</p><h4>How will the TSEZ differ from the Beirut Free Logistics Zone?</h4><p>The Beirut Free Logistics Zone is a pure free zone with a customs-free zone and some incentives for traders, importers, and exporters, but with no developmental implications. On the other hand, the TSEZ has been given the authority to set up its own procedures and provide a streamlined business environment. We will provide state-of-the-art infrastructure with all the utilities, amenities, IT, broadband, and transport infrastructure. What we will have here in Tripoli does not exist anywhere else in Lebanon at the moment, so it will greatly contribute to the country's development process. We want to bring the much-needed employment and socioeconomic development through the TSEZ, not just for Tripoli but all of northern Lebanon.</p><h4>What will be the major benefits from TSEZ for the north of Lebanon?</h4><p>The transformation of Tripoli started with the revitalization of the port. Now, there is an opportunity to have Tripoli play a significant role as a platform for logistics, warehousing, and transshipment activities. We want to supply value chains from here and that would require prepping the local economy, such as training the local workforce by fostering high-skilled labor, and opening up the market offering for companies here. Also, the Lebanese government is about to pass two decrees to regulate oil and gas exploration. This will hopefully pave the way for gas and oil exploration off the shore of Lebanon. The TSEZ can become attractive for downstream and upstream oil and gas companies. Finally, there is the Syrian factor. The international community is preparing for the post-conflict period in Syria and Tripoli is the closet city to the border; therefore, we want to make the TSEZ an incubator for the reconstruction process. The government, local community, and private sector have to rise to the challenge and help prepare the local economy to be up to standard to benefit from this. The process has moved forward, and today we have the backing of the Secretary General of the UN and the President of the World Bank. We have received funding from the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, the World Bank, and the UNDP. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the factors that make Lebanese talent so attractive abroad?</h4><p>Lebanon has always been a trend-setter and a gateway to the Middle East, whether it is for business, fashion, or any other sector. One always sees Lebanese people carrying out entrepreneurial projects, doing business abroad, and working as professionals around the world, from Gulf countries to Latin America. Traditionally, European countries were the ones taking advantage of that, especially France, due to the historical ties we have, but in the past year this trend has been expanding to countries that lay farther from Lebanon, the US being the clearest example. Lebanon is an excellent place to establish a foothold in this region because we know the markets—we have done business with every single one of these countries, we speak three languages, and we have the human capital to serve as a platform for companies' expansion across the Middle East.</p><h4>How does American influence on Lebanese education institutions benefit the bilateral relationship?</h4><p>We have a close bond with the US education system, which has prompted a positive effect on building trade relations and promoting businesses between our countries. The most prestigious universities in Lebanon are connected to American universities on a varied scale and this has transformed their structure in different ways. Also, a large number of university-educated people in Lebanon come from an American educational background, many of them even going to the US to study. This trend has existed for years and has eased the path for people who want to do business with the US or who want to take part in their operations there. An Americanized education has not only taught them to negotiate in English; it has also showed them the culture there and how to succeed in such a competitive market. When thinking about business opportunities that can develop from both sides, we have the most important factor already in place: human capital.</p><h4>What is your strategy for globally promoting Lebanese SMEs?</h4><p>New regulations establish various customs standards and one of our jobs has been to educate SMEs so they know what these regulations are and how they can abide by these standards. Bringing Lebanese SMEs up to international standards has been the biggest challenge thus far, but we are focusing our efforts on making this happen. We hold conferences and workshops to educate them on the many regulations, how they can comply with them, and the benefits that fulfilling this framework can bring about. Our biggest contribution has been advising SMEs and raising awareness of what is happening in their surroundings, how to structure a well-planed strategy to grow their business, and how to come up with innovative solutions that will place them in an advantageous position. The chamber is fully committed to the improvement of Lebanese SMEs and we want to contribute as much as possible to their development.</p><h4>What are the major opportunities for companies in the US to do business in Lebanon at this moment?</h4><p>Unfortunately, investment opportunities in Lebanon have fallen in the last two years, mainly those that were once shining opportunities for US companies. The political instability and  economic downturn have severely affected most sectors in the economy and made them risky to invest in; having said that, Lebanon is a great gateway into the MENA region, especially GCC countries. We know those markets well, and it is easy to start from Lebanon and move from there. We also relate well to the way of doing business in Western nations, combining the best of both worlds. My hopes are for a brighter future for Lebanon in the coming years, where it will become an attractive hub for investment and for companies basing their regional operations here, and where local businesses are ready to prosper outside the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is IDAL's involvement in the project to create three industrial cities across Lebanese territory?</h4><p>We have carried out different studies for the development of the industrial and economic zones that are taking over the national territory, not only for these three planned cities, but also for the Tripoli Special Economic Zone and other flagship projects in the country. We identified that there is demand in the manufacturing sector; therefore, we arranged this industry to allocate a series of companies under one single umbrella that would ultimately become the industrial zone. We also identified some underdeveloped regions in the country across the south and the east; therefore, we pushed for the relocation of these industrial cities to those unprivileged areas. Finally, we are working now on setting up incentive plans to attract investment to these regions.</p><h4>Amid the complexities Lebanon has faced in the past year, how has IDAL turned these challenges into opportunities?</h4><p>When the worldwide financial crisis hit global markets in 2009, Lebanon was registering growth rate figures of more than 10%, and FDI reached all-time highs of USD4.96 billion. When the region was engulfed in the Arab crisis, Lebanon remained one of the few regional economies to register positive growth of FDI levels. We have managed to maintain FDI levels at around USD3 billion, proving Lebanon's resilience and forcing us to do more as this number does not match our ambitions. The more recent challenges have been impacting both our foreign and national investments but also exports. With the closure of the Syrian border, half of our trading routes were suddenly cut. With IDAL's main mandate to support the promotion of Lebanese goods, it set up the Maritime Lebanese Export Bridge program, or M.Leb, which essentially supports exporters in transporting their goods via maritime means to counter for the loss of the land route. This program has had a positive impact on exporters in the agriculture, agribusiness, and industrial sectors, with many companies benefiting from the government support. Recent measures imposed by some Gulf states forbidding their citizens from visiting Lebanon have had a negative impact on our tourism industry, which has traditionally relied heavily Gulf spending in Lebanon. This was an opportunity for us to tap again into our diaspora by working in partnership with public and private organizations to identify diaspora members who would either directly invest in Lebanon or support in outsourcing part of their operations to Lebanon. It is also important to note that despite the many challenges, our main duty as the national investment agency has been to continuously promote our sector-specific competitive advantages. We are starting a campaign to promote our sectors and remind investors of the many facilities available to them. </p><h4>The knowledge economy sector is one of the most promising ones at the moment. How have you channeled your resources to help this sector grow?</h4><p>Three years ago, we developed a business process outsourcing strategy given our belief in the potential of the country to serve as an outsourcing destination to companies engaged in ICT- related services. We carried out several roadshows to promote our location advantages. In 2016, we partnered with Berytech to promote Lebanon in the Canadian market and held a presentation and workshop in Paris for Lebanese companies to establish partnerships and business opportunities with French companies. We have tailored tax break incentives and easier licenses issue for the startup ecosystem and have partnered with incubators and accelerators to simplify the process for companies to set up companies. We are currently preparing an ICT sector event in Oman due to increasing interest in our ecosystem there. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lebanon's nominal GDP has been growing despite falling prices and stagnant growth. What accounts for the country's resiliency, and what are the actions taken into account to counter these negative effects?</h4><p>Lebanon presents a number of opportunities and factors that account for its resiliency amidst all surrounding conditions. In 2015, we achieved growth of 1.5% in comparison to the previous five years mainly due to our effort in continue building partnerships and seeking opportunities abroad. Our highly skilled labor force and the wide reach of the diaspora also continued to play a strong networking role by acting as a main intermediary between countries to do business in. Lebanon also reinforced its role as a hub and competitor in the field of business development for the MENA region, and our way of life continues to be a trend-setter in the Middle East. Finally, we have a service-orientated economy with low levels of inflation and a stable exchange rate that allow the country to build upon two important pillars: consumption and investment. The ministry has also set in motion a set of measures looking to reinforce our economy, such as updating and reinforcing the relevant legislations and rules, restarting the accession process to the WTO, launching initiatives to reinforce PPPs, and signing new trade agreements that pave the way for new trade markets for Lebanese exports. The economy will not witness any improvements in its indicators in 2016 unless political understandings result in restoring confidence in the Lebanese economy, creating growth, contributing to attract tourists and investors, and facilitating exports to improve the balance of trade.</p><h4>The association agreement between Lebanon and the EU entered into effect 10 years ago. How has this agreement contributed to boosting Lebanese exports and attracting investments?</h4><p>The Lebanon-EU Association Agreement has not only had a great impact on trade exchange, it has also put reform on the Lebanese government's agenda, as well as improvement in the production capacities of the private sector. The agreement was designed to help support the Lebanese economy, serving as a catalyst for development, whereby Lebanon can utilize it for structural reform, technology transfers, and human and institutional capacity building. At the trade exchange level, bilateral ties have increased steadily in recent years with an average annual growth of 12.7% since 2008, and with total imports amounting to almost USD7.5 billion and exports only USD320 million. This weak growth in Lebanon's exports to the EU is primarily due to the stringent market access requirements imposed by the EU on most of its agricultural and agro-industrial imports. On the other hand, this agreement entails a package of technical assistance that grants approximately EUR50 million to Lebanon every year. The agreement has had both positive and negative effects for Lebanon, but something we would like to emphasize is the need of our country to receive more assistance to stress on the additional needs Lebanon faces.</p><h4>Lebanon's accession to the WTO has been stuck for nearly 20 years. Is the country's accession feasible now, and what could be the major benefits for Lebanon?</h4><p>The main advantage of Lebanon's accession to the WTO is restoring confidence in the economy. Once we enter the WTO, the reciprocal privileges among members of the organizations will allow us to open up to new markets and hence boost Lebanese exports to more than 162 markets. It will also help Lebanon to attract foreign investments, create new investment opportunities for Lebanese companies, and contribute to the creation of new jobs to combat unemployment. Despite the fact that this process has been filled with challenges, we have come a long way, and we have a promising opportunity today to complete our accession by being well aware of our rights and duties in order to face these challenges together. Joining the WTO is a necessity, as it would give our economy an international certificate to world trade. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	What were the main strategies of the Ministry of Finance to counter the deficit during 2015?
</h4><p>
	The balance of payments reversed from surpluses recorded pre-2010 due to the deteriorating security situation in the region and the repercussions this had on Lebanon. The Syrian conflict negatively impacted cross-border trade, which led the government to find alternative routes and support farmers by subsidizing the higher cost of exporting by sea freight. FDI and capital flows into Lebanon naturally followed the general mood and have witnessed some slowdown. The fall in international oil prices led to a decrease in the energy import bill with a positive effect on the current account, although the capital flows coming into Lebanon in form of remittances from oil producing countries will eventually decrease now that Gulf countries have been impacted by this trend. From the ministry's perspective, we are always keen on managing the funding needs of the government as a whole and to structure an exhaustive debt management strategy to alleviate the pressure on Central Bank reserves as much as possible.
</p><h4>What have been the ministry's actions to tackle Lebanon's sharp decline in tax revenues in recent years?</h4><p>
	The decline in tax collection over the past few years is mainly due to lower economic activity; we have undertaken several reform measures and policies to improve collection and facilitate payment procedures to citizens and companies. Some of these measures have implied the facilitation of tax payments through OMT and all commercial banks and the provision of e-payment services for taxes; we will also implement this service to corporate income tax soon. We have also taken measures to enforce tax payments through the confiscation of real estate properties of companies evading tax payment, tax collection from third parties, and financial prosecution of evading individuals and companies. Finally, we are in the process of implementing further measures for the collection of built property tax from tenants rather than landlords and the automatic deduction of built property tax from individual bank accounts for those who chose to do so.</p><h4>What outcome do you expect from the ministry's nationwide real estate survey, and how will it improve the property tax system?</h4><p>
	We called for a nationwide real estate survey in Lebanon in the context of a reform plan that was launched in 2015 at the General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre, with the collaboration of the World Bank. The project consists of a 10-year land administration modernization program that will result in modern information technology, electronic governance, equitable property values, and geospatial data sharing; this will ultimately ensure transparency, fairness to citizens and the government, information revolution, improved decision making, improved revenue to the treasury, as well as better management of state land and a widened use of land under the law. Although the full project is spread over 10 years, the first phase will be five years, during which most reforms will be implemented and whereby the impact on government finances will materialize within the first three years.</p><h4>How do the dollarization of Lebanon's currency and the country's large capital inflows contribute to the resilience of the economy?</h4><p>
	Ever since Lebanon began to face internal political tensions and spillovers from the regional turmoil caused by the Syrian war in 2011, our economic performance has been drastically affected. However, with robust economic policies, a strong financial sector, and continued trust of the Lebanese people in Lebanon and abroad, the country is able to weather the crisis until the cycle is reversed. Lebanon has one of the highest bank assets to GDP ratios in the world amounting to 345%, which ensures ample solvency to support the needs of both, the private and the public sector. In addition to that, the pegged currency exchange system in the country, combined with attractive interest rates and a strong remittances base ensure financial stability and continued growth in the stock of capital. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key aspects of Canada and Lebanon's bilateral relationship?</h4><p>Canada and Lebanon enjoy a close relationship built on the strength of 62 years of diplomatic relations, reinforced by close cultural ties and participation in La Francophonie. Given the significant challenges the country faces today in terms of the security, political, and socioeconomic situation, there is much to do with Lebanon in ensuring its stability, and there are plenty of opportunities to increase our bilateral ties on that basis. We announced in February 2016 Canada's increased support over the next three years in terms of security, stabilization, and humanitarian and development assistance, as well as enhanced diplomatic engagement to respond to the crises in the region. Lebanon will benefit from this assistance. I would like to thank our Lebanese counterparts on the ground with whom we have had excellent cooperation, further forged through Operation Syrian Refugees. Our joint intervention has created more opportunities to widen our collaboration to other sectors. </p><h4>The Lebanese diaspora represents the largest Arab diaspora in Canada. What have been the major contributions of the diaspora to Canadian society?</h4><p>As Member of Parliament for Saint-Laurent in Montreal, I can attest that the Lebanese community is growing steadily. The Lebanese-Canadian community is estimated at over 165,000 people. We also have a large Canadian diaspora in Lebanon, estimated at over 40,000 people. This significant diaspora provides a competitive advantage to developing economic, cultural, and academic links. We are very happy to see the Canadian market growing in Lebanon, with the presence of Canadian companies, either directly or through agents, representatives, franchises, and partnerships that include Blackberry, Intelcan, Raytheon, La Senza, Second Cup, and HEC Montreal.</p><h4>Canada has made significant contributions to Lebanon in light of the Syrian refugee crisis. How has this assistance strengthened Lebanon's resiliency to face this challenge?</h4><p>We commend the Lebanese people for welcoming and hosting civilians fleeing the conflict in Syria. Along with other Canadian governmental departments, and with the assistance of our embassies, we were able to meet our commitment of welcoming 25,000 Syrian refugees by the end of February 2016, of which over 14,000 came from Lebanon. We have renewed our commitment, and we look forward to welcoming more Syrian refugees throughout 2016. Since the beginning of the conflict in Syria, we have contributed over USD1 billion in humanitarian, development, stabilization, and security assistance to the broader region to help neighboring states deal with the Syrian refugee crisis. I am pleased to see such a coordinated effort to provide support on the ground. Through our funds, we support activities implemented by UN agencies, non-governmental organizations, and the International Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement. </p><h4>What will be the highlights in your agenda as head of the Canadian Foreign Affairs Ministry to strengthen the relationship with Lebanon?</h4><p>In February 2016, alongside our Prime Minister, we announced our new policy. We committed USD1.6 billion in humanitarian, development, stabilization, and security assistance to the region over the next three years, from which Lebanon will benefit. We will also work with our international partners to deliver USD840 million in humanitarian assistance, USD270 million in bilateral development programming, and USD145 million to security and stabilization programming, from which Lebanon will benefit, including responding to internal challenges related to the crisis in Syria. I was pleased to see that in light of our commitment, on April 15, 2016, Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, announced a contribution of USD20 million to the multi-donor Concessional Financing Facility, which will play an important role in helping strengthen Lebanon's ability to manage the crisis and provide crucial services for refugees and host communities. We commend the Lebanese government's dedication to keeping Lebanon stable and disassociated from regional conflicts, and encourage all parties to adhere to this commitment. We continue to encourage and support the country's efforts to end its political deadlock, and to both elect a new president and hold parliamentary elections as soon as possible. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been RAK Properties' landmark projects?</h4><p>RAK Properties was established with a vision of His Highness, Sheikh Saud Bin Saqr Al Qasimi. At the time of inception we were seeking AED1 billion, but when we announced it, the demand far exceeded our expectations. Everyone wanted to participate and we reached AED56 billion. We discussed this with High Highness and we decided to aim for AED2 billion and return the extra money back to the investors. After that, we registered our company on the Security and Commodities Authority in the UAE because it is a public shareholding company. Our first projects were the Julphar Towers, where our offices are located, and Mina Al Arab, our biggest project. We started with the infrastructure of Mina Al Arab and the first phase of villas and apartments, which cost approximately AED1 billion. The plan at that time was to spend about AED10 billion on Mina Al Arab. There are about nine hotels planned along the coast together with a big mall in a specific area of the development as well. Unfortunately, by the time we were going to float a tender for these projects, the economic crisis hit in 2008. By that time, we finished and launched the first part of Mina Al Arab. Now we have around 2,500 units completed to date. Furthermore, around this time, we finished the RAK Tower development in Abu Dhabi, which was sold completely.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the market for eco-themed mixed-use projects such as Mina Al Arab in RAK?</h4><p>These types of properties are ideal because Ras Al Khaimah has not previously had high-quality buildings, gated communities, or mixed-used developments. So we decided on building hotels, malls, high-class villas, and medium-class apartments. The only difficulty we had was during the financial crisis. Otherwise, whatever we launched at that time was sold. The demand was very high before 2008. After the crisis, we changed strategy and decided to follow market trends, which was affordable housing. From now onward, we hope that the domestic real estate sector will continue to improve, although there are many economic difficulties and instability in the region. And yet our country is different because of the great infrastructure. We have 221 nationalities living peacefully, and there are no problems. We have around 10 million visitors in the UAE every year. In Ras Al Khaimah, we have a different topography from the rest of the UAE because we have the mountains, the sea, and the sand dunes. We are also close to Dubai, just 45 minutes away. All this adds value. Also, we have a well-established free trade zone authority and it is attracting many investors. All this encourages us to pursue new projects. Anantara Resort and Spa is already announced and under design, hopefully to be completed by the end of 2018. We will also have another hotel coming online and we are currently in the process of finalizing that. We are also master planning to have a huge mixed-use project in this area. This year we are developing the concept and then we will establish the details and tendering. There will be two hotels, a mall, beautiful residential apartments, villas, and along the beach there will a vibrant promenade lined with al fresco F&amp;B outlets, retail, and entertainment zones. There will be a lot of activity directly by the beach. </p><h4>Why have you decided to expand beyond Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>The UAE is unified space and the Emirates complement each other. Whatever we do in Dubai or Abu Dhabi complements Ras Al Khaimah.</p><h4>What trends have you identified that will affect your approach to future projects?</h4><p>Ras Al Khaimah is a rapidly growing tourist destination, which is why we need to increase the number of hotels. I wish I had started hotels eight years ago. Another factor is that high-end homes are at the point of saturation. Mid-market houses are in demand now. There is demand in the high-end market, but people want beach front properties. The majority would like to have an affordable apartment or villa, so that is what we are now  taking into consideration. Also, maybe people look for the quality of shops in the area that add to the destination, like Tim Hortons, Starbucks, and so on. It adds value to your projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The recent municipal elections injected positivity into the political life of Lebanon. How will this translate into a solution for the political impasse the country has been living for the past two years? </h4><p>The recent elections demonstrated that the will to develop and to succeed is in the DNA of the Lebanese people. They proved that when there is a will, there is a way, and our will is to truly fulfill our democratic rights and to elect a valuable representative out of the numerous political parties that play a role in the political sphere of Lebanon. Moreover, this election has proven that Lebanon is well prepared to face any election in the upcoming years, and that we can do it in a peaceful and fruitful manner.</p><h4>At this early stage of your mandate, what will you focus on to further develop the capacities of Beirut?</h4><p>We put in place the development plan for Beirut 2016-2022, given the six-year mandate I was elected for. The plan is divided into the sectors we want to focus on for the following six years, from environmental issues, solving the transit problems of the city, and improving and increasing green spaces around Beirut, something that has been long overdue to our citizens. We also have a major plan to improve the economy of Beirut. Around 45% of the Lebanese population live or work in the capital; if the economy here performs well, the entire country will perform well, too. We want Beirut to be an expansionary economic platform for the rest of the country, to have spillover effects into less privileged parts of Lebanon. To achieve this, we will implement the necessary infrastructure and we will interact with local traders and players in the Beiruti market. We will embrace a promotional agenda for their businesses so they can attract investors, bring money into the city, and develop commercial capabilities whilst simultaneously solving problems hindering economic activity in the capital.</p><h4>What is your plan to attract foreign investors and make them focus on Beirut? </h4><p>A major part of our success will rely on the partnership between the private and public sectors. This is why in major projects like new parking developments or the solid waste management project we will definitely involve the private sector. I have experience in embarking on PPPs in other countries, hence I strongly believe that the private sector has the ability to manage investments and protect their returns, while having higher social indicators and good operational standards that will also benefit the government. In Lebanon, the private sector has traditionally excelled much faster than the public sphere, and we can learn from each other for the benefit of the city. We also need to increase transparency so people feel encouraged to invest in the country, regardless if they live in or outside of Lebanon. If we are good enough to attract the private sector and the Lebanese diaspora, we can talk about developing megaprojects in the city, and this will be crucial for the capital's development.</p><h4>What changes would you like to see in Beirut by the time you leave office?</h4><p>I want to make sure that there is a final solution for the solid waste problem that has long affected the lives of thousands of Beirutis. I also want to implement sewage water treatment plants, guarantee the water supply, solve the traffic issues in the city, and implement efficient public transportation. Finally, I consider culture a key component of every society; therefore, I want to make sure that our cultural heritage will be harnessed and accessible to everyone in the city. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[one-beating-heart]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>This year I visited Beirut for the second time since I took over the presidency of the French Republic. The first time I came to Lebanon in 2012, I was received by then-President Michel Suleiman in the middle of an already delicate context for Lebanon. This time around I returned to an adverse context under which the Lebanese people have learned to survive. The ever-threatened security, war at its doorstep, terrorism, and economic difficulties sieve over Lebanon once again, hence I wanted to demonstrate France's solidarity with this country. Although solidarity is a feeble word, what France feels toward Lebanon is friendship. During my stay I had the chance to visit the residency of the French Ambassador to Lebanon, a historic site for French-Lebanese relations for this is the place where in 1941 General Charles de Gaulle expressed his love for this nation. He had stated that the “Lebanese are the only people whose heart has never stopped beating at the same rhythm to France's heart," just as today French people's hearts beat every time Lebanon is threatened. This was a reality once again when last November Lebanon suffered a terrorist attack just a day before France experienced one of its own for both countries represent in their particular way the values of freedom, pluralism, and tolerance.</p><p>I traveled to Lebanon to mark my respect for the Lebanese authorities and notably to Prime Minister Tammam Salam, who has repeatedly overcome the testing circumstances he has faced. His government has been able to lead Lebanon in the midst of difficulties; he has been able to assure his country's security and to equally welcome over 1.5 million refugees. His government has shown a great human solidarity toward the refugees, and the world has sometimes forgotten the pressure this has implied to Lebanon itself.</p><p>I want to remind Prime Minister Salam that France has taken a new initiative to reunite the international assistance group to Lebanon to mobilize the international community as much as we can to guarantee the stability of Lebanon. France has played a key role in solving this conflict. Furthermore, we need to show that it is possible to restore a country just as Lebanon did in the past, with a sense of reconciliation and equality that gave Lebanon a new image before the eyes of the world. </p><p>The refugee crisis is not for Lebanon alone to solve; it is a global responsibility and one that concerns Europe and France. For over four years, Europe believed the Syrian crisis would not have any direct consequence on our internal situation. This blindness impeded the international community from mobilizing promptly to put an end to this conflict. In this sense, to alleviate the crisis in Lebanon by maintaining its stability and sustaining the refugees is also a sign of self-assistance for Europe to keep control of our borders whilst continuing to provide asylum. This is why I decided to extend France's assistance to Lebanon to face these challenges with a monetary contribution of EUR50 million during 2016 and an additional EUR100 million in the course of the following two years. But our contribution does not finish there; we will also reinstall refugees based in Lebanon to France. In 2015 1,000 refugees were reinstalled through the mechanisms we implemented, and we will receive 2,000 more in 2016 and 2017.</p><p>We also hope Lebanon can find a solution to its political impasse by electing a new President. When solid institutions are missing, risks arise in any country, particularly when the threats are so evident. This sovereign decision has to be taken by the Lebanese parliament, and we hope it will do so soon as this is in the interest of its nation. I trust the Lebanese parliament will not only find a quick solution to elect a president, but also form a government of national unity and proceed to legislative elections. </p><p>We have also assured the security of Lebanon through mechanisms such as UNIFIL, which has been here for a long time. France will continue its efforts to maintain UNIFIL to grant Lebanon the necessary military capacities the country needs to protect and defend itself. The Lebanese army has shown its will and capacity to fulfill its duty and we have committed to immediately contribute the material means and the training needed enforce them.</p><p>But overall, we have an extensive French community in Lebanon at the core of this vast bilateral relationship. They hold a deep love for both countries and are the ultimate representation of our mutual values of freedom, pluralism, and tolerance. Today we have a solid economic relationship with Lebanon because of them. Our community also works in favor of the French language, with 41 institutions lecturing programs in French and over 55,000 Lebanese students being educated in our language. We also have a strong cultural and artistic exchange with artists moving between both countries. Both countries have a strong sense of innovation and creative mind-sets, and we incorporate these young talents in projects such as FrenchTech, an incubator for startups.</p><p>France and Lebanon have deep-rooted ties cemented in their friendship. We will stay by Lebanon's side because we love Lebanon; a sovereign and independent Lebanon, a plural and multi-confessional Lebanon. An open Lebanon to the outside so Lebanon stays forever close to France, and France always by Lebanon's side. <em></em></p><p><em>* From a speech made during President Hollande's visit to Lebanon in May 2016</em></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In 2016, Lebanon welcomed a group of prominent businessmen, economists, and bankers to participate in the Arab Economic Forum that took place in our capital city. This was an opportunity to reconnect with our Arab brothers too and to welcome them to Lebanon, their second home. We had honorable guests from Egypt, Jordan, Sudan, Mauritania, and the Gulf nations, countries that are dear to Lebanon and who have supported us all along the way.</p><p>During the occasion, I also had the chance to greet the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), led by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdul Aziz, who is running a great developmental experience under the Economic Vision 2030 plan that will transform the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the entire region for the better. In Lebanon, we will be looking forward with great interest to the development of this quality journey, and we wish our Saudi brothers great success in this endeavor.</p><p>This year marks the unfortunate second anniversary of our presidential vacuum, which reflects a shameful deficit of political vision in our country and dissents into deep political divisions that hinder our internal and foreign interests. It is also an abuse to the Lebanese people who put their trust in us and want to see their interests protected. This prolonged dereliction is the fundamental reason for the paralysis of our institutions, and this has implied the stumbling of a large number of issues related to the direct and long-term needs of the Lebanese people. The presidential vacuum also reflects the worst possible picture of the country at a time of need to Lebanon and damages our image in front of investors, who wish for a stable political situation before deepening their connections with our nation. This fact is one of the main reasons for the lack of growth and the large decline in the economic activity, in addition, of course, to the externalities that have added up to the complex panorama Lebanon faces these days, the current tragic developments in Syria being the main effect of this.</p><p>But shedding an illuminated space amid these adverse times, the first municipal elections took place in Lebanon in May 2016, injecting life into the democratic practice that Lebanese people had long waited for. These elections, which we hope to achieve with the same smoothness and success in the upcoming three electoral positions, spread some spirit in the political life of the country and returned the Lebanese citizens their natural right to choose their representatives in managing public affairs. It also diminished the pretension that the Lebanese are unable to run elections in a peaceful and civilized manner. But, most importantly, the municipal elections proved that the Lebanese state, its institutions, and its security forces are able to manage and protect the most difficult and complex electoral challenges.</p><p>Moreover, the recent elections showed us that it is not impossible to build upon this achievement, to proceed toward other stations of the democratic practice in order to revive our political life, and to rebuild our constitutional structure with an immediate focus on the election of a President of the Republic. We can also reach a modern election law and move toward general elections that would regenerate the Parliament. It is not impossible either to deepen the current political dialogues, to agree on enhancing the current stability, and barricade Lebanon from the effects of the painful war that is occurring in Syria. We have long waited for Lebanon to return to the place where it should be, to become an ideal destination for investments, to become an exceptional oasis for business, and a unique platform for trade, industry, and banking.</p><p>Despite all the difficult internal situations and even more difficult external conditions, Lebanon maintains its well-established institutional structures and its long-standing democratic practice. We keep incentivizing investment regulations; we have an advanced and well-capitalized banking sector, a stable situation with security granted to our citizens, and a highly capable stock of human talent. These very same traits are the ones that qualify Lebanon to be the launching pad for the reconstruction process in neighboring Syria once all weapons fall silent, a day we hope will come soon and will reestablish peace once and for all. <em></em></p><p><em>* Taken from a speech in Beirut on May 12, 2016</em></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the country coping with both regional instability and its own domestic challenges?</h4><p>It is like we have been vaccinated. We adapt with strength to all the challenges we face and prove our resilience as a nation. We have faced obscure moments in previous years with terrorist attacks, threats to our stability, and gargantuan challenges that we surfed with determination; yet, we remain the safest country in the region. Our reality has also been altered by the large refugee influx. We currently host nearly 2 million refugees, a number that not even Europe, 500 times bigger than Lebanon, could cope with but that we still accommodate with no major problems to date. We know that these are not signals of good health, and this reality is distant to the one we want to live, but they show how strong we are as a nation. In Lebanon, life always goes on; we keep walking. Right now in the height of summer, there are people heading to the streets. We have festivals, artists coming from all over the world, and enthusiasm is in the air. This is the Lebanese spirit: we celebrate life regardless of the circumstances.</p><h4>You have been an advocate of economic diplomacy to attract the millions of Lebanese living abroad. What outcome do you expect from this strategy?</h4><p>We have around 40 million Lebanese expatriates residing in 167 countries around the world. We have presence in every single corner of the globe, and this represents a golden opportunity for us. What we are trying to do is to reconnect these expatriates through cultural exchanges, monetary interests, and the Lebanese traditions so they can have a positive impact on the economy. This concept has been going on for years; however, we are now materializing it into a state policy. After all, the flows of capital coming from the diaspora have maintained Lebanon's economic standing during adverse times. We receive around USD8 billion annually from the diaspora; therefore, we are trying to build bridges to bumper their contributions to the homeland.</p><h4>How would you assess Lebanon's role in the Arab world today?</h4><p>Lebanon is at the heart of the Arab world, and we have always participated actively in regional integration projects. We had the first democracy in the region, and we are a cherished nation among our Arab brothers. Moreover, we have always stayed away from regional tensions and have expressed that it is in our interest to serve as a communication channel to find peaceful and long-term solutions to regional disputes. We want to build bridges that go beyond religious or political differences. We also have large communities of expatriates in the Arab world who are active in building networks and tightening bilateral relations with those countries. We will continue working in this line, and the recent appointment of the new Secretary General to the Arab League has injected fresh blood into a regional bloc that could be doing so much more for the integration of our nations.</p><h4>What do you envision for the near future of Lebanon?</h4><p>We want to build up relations based on values rather than interests. We want to preserve our country's stability by preserving our values. History has shown us that the prevalence of power makes us lose, that we need to build up on a chain of values to maintain solid foreign relations and a good domestic situation. We want Lebanon's message of coexistence and tolerance to prevail and to echo all across the region to bring peace to the Middle East. We are a small player in this chessboard, but we can be a significant one if we put our values beforehand and form bridges between regions, between our Arab neighbors and us, and between the Arab world and Europe. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main milestones and achievements of Purdy Motor?</h4><p>In 1957, my father was working in agriculture and was looking for a four-wheel drive vehicle. He had heard of Toyota. He ordered a few cars and later realized he liked the business of selling cars, so he decide to start his own business representing Toyota in Costa Rica. By 1959, he quit his career in agriculture and move to San Jose and worked with Toyota motors. By 1963, he had set up its first assembly plant in partnership with TMS. This lasted until 1983 when the law changed. Toyota had the largest market share in 1971 with the Corolla model and has remained in that position. In 1997, we hired the CEO of the company and set up a board of directors and things started to evolve more professionally. We have been lucky and the company has grown nationally and internationally, mainly in the US.</p><h4>What segments of the population do you target? </h4><p>Purdy's vision is to only sell Toyota products, including Lexus and Hino Trucks and Daihatsu, a Japanese brand the trademark of which is owned by Toyota. We are a Toyota family and it is an interesting market. Earlier, it was such that for every four used cars sold in the country, one new car was sold. We convinced the government that used cars are not good for many reasons. The total number of new cars sold in 2016 was around 46,000. Last year was our best year ever and this year will be better than that. I do not expect the car market to grow more than 46,000 cars a year, which includes pick-ups and trucks. I do not think we will grow but will remain stable over the next four to six years. Our main problem is Costa Rican infrastructure. We pay a high tax each year called the Marchano to renew our license plates. The tax is supposed to support infrastructure; however, that did not happen. Instead, the money goes to different cashiers when they need it, which is not fair. Costa Rica is still a country of law and we all have to respect it.</p><h4>What is your outlook for this year?</h4><p>Toyota will have brand new models in 2017. We will be able to be around 21% with Toyota, Lexus, and Hino. We used to be 24%; however, competition is now stronger and has cheaper cars because others bring in cars from other places and customers must learn that cheap does not mean same quality. You have to learn not to be frustrated when you drop two points in the market. We just have to settle down and attack again. Next year will be our year to come back and gain market share.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for 2017? </h4><p>One is to keep growing our market share in the US. I am in my retirement age and it is not a matter of money; it is about going around and making people happy. One time I was a parking lot and told my wife “You see all those cars? There are 600 cars or more in the parking lot, when 10 years ago there were only 10 motorcycles." Now I am glad to say there are 600+and I hope to see 1,000 cars in the future. This means people already own a house or cover the principal needs and they are in peace and now they want to go travelling. The more cars and motorcycles I see, the happier I am because it means people are doing better. Growing in the US is part of the show. It is hard and of course as Costa Rica is the chicken of the golden eggs, which we cannot abandon. We must keep growing in Costa Rica, and that means more investment, more jobs, and more peace. We plan to make a few more investments in Costa Rica to keep growing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[leap-forward]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What events have characterized the past year for Boursa Kuwait?</h4><p>The key event this year was our takeover of the management of the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) on April 25, 2016. This was a huge milestone and a great leap forward in the privatization process. It was a very smooth handover, which did not hamper the operations of the exchange or trading activities in any way. The handover was unusual in that it was not a private sector-to-private sector handover but one from the public sector to the private sector. This normally requires a number of special actions and special considerations in order that such a transfer can be successful. In this case, a major step is making the stock exchange regionally and internationally competitive. We are doing this by restructuring the infrastructure of the stock exchange itself in three phases. We have successfully completed phase one, which primarily involved the setting up of Boursa Kuwait. Phase two entails the formulation and implementation of our initiatives and strategy roadmap, and is almost complete. Finally, phase three includes the assumption of full operations of the KSE and preparations for a company IPO in due course. However, we first need to ensure that the improvements continue to be on the right track, because none of our existing or potential stakeholders will be interested in entering the market if we are not conducting and maintaining the business to internationally recognized standards. We are not seeking to reinvent the wheel; we are adopting international benchmarks and best practice and are mainly targeting international institutional investors. We primarily focus on the trading processes, segmenting the market, enabling more transparency and efficiency in the market, and introducing a proper cycle of settlements. We are applying this methodology so that the market will be familiar to international investors in terms of infrastructure and business approach.</p><h4>To what extent would you say your privatization process aligns with the goals of Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Our process was started and made clear long before the new Saudi plan, but our cycle of implementation is taking a little bit longer because of the current law and the need to approve new laws by parliament. This is one of our weaknesses and as a result our actions cannot yet be translated as fast as we would like them to be. Although our main priority is to finalize the KSE's infrastructure at this time, we currently have 203 companies listed and the day-to-day business must continue. We are the only established stock exchange on the market, so the privatization process is not just about convincing people to list on the market, or assisting the government privatization process by helping it list its own entities on the market. The stock exchange itself is leading the process on this issue. The KSE is at the forefront of the government's privatization initiatives. Once governmental entities are transferred to the private sector, they will be listed on the stock exchange. Our aim is to have government companies, mainly in the oil sector, list on the KSE. This is also part of the government's strategy. But the concept of the privatization process is not just about opening government entities to the public, it is also to convince family-owned companies to consider an IPO. However, we need to give them confidence and persuade them that the stock exchange is one of the most effective methods for companies to raise capital. To do this successfully we need to change the business culture and the closed nature of private family-owned companies.. We need to showcase the benefits of going public, and that an IPO will only benefit the company, not the opposite. We have had some success in this in the recent past, with a very successful example IPO with Mezzan Holding. </p><h4>By the end of the third quarter, Boursa Kuwait is set to fully operate the KSE. In light of this, how would you describe your outlook for 2017?</h4><p>By September 30, 2016, we anticipate being a fully licensed independent stock exchange with the full support and endorsements of the Capital Markets Authority (CMA). On the ground, we are making good progress in enhancing our services and systems and this date will not affect the upgrades we have underway and which we plan to have in place by the end of the year. If all continues to go to plan I think 2017 is going to be our breakthrough year. If the CMA accepts all of our plans, we are going to have a new kind of stock exchange with new markets introduced and systems that embrace international best practice. We are going to have a market maker introduced by the end of this year, and will introduce SLBs and short selling. We will also collaborate with the KCC to introduce derivatives and options. In addition, we are going to enhance over-the-counter performance, which is a market nobody focuses on in the region, and later, we are going to focus on SMEs, which are a key part of the economy, especially in relation to diversification. Kuwait is the most innovative country in the region. While other countries are focusing on conglomerates and big businesses, in Kuwait we concentrate far more on entrepreneurship and encouraging business growth. There are conglomerates here, but much of their success is based on collaboration with small businesses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

How will this and similar offerings develop the ADX?</h4><p>Etisalat is a multinational company that is highly sought after by both local and international investors. However, its Articles of Association did not allow for foreign ownership. As such, we worked with the management of Etisalat to illustrate the added value and benefits of foreign investment in the company, be it shareholding, management, or even ownership. Based on the correlation between foreign ownership and turnover, Etisalat can expect higher turnover, and even possibly blue chip status, through opening up the company to institutional investors. That in turn will have a positive impact on the market, which we have started seeing. We hope other companies will follow Etisalat's example. One of our strategies is to increase liquidity, which is certainly a step in the right direction, not just for Etisalat and ADX, but also for companies not listed on ADX. </p><h4>How resilient has the ADX been to external factors such as the devaluation of the yuan and chronically low oil prices?</h4><p>We are part of the international financial community and are affected by what goes on in other parts of the globe, positive or negative. When things go bad, we are impacted, unlike before when we sealed ourselves off from the global market. Today, the ADX is part of the MSCI and the S&amp;P Dow Jones emerging market index. The UAE works hard to diversify away from oil, although it remains important to our country and the economy. In real terms, non-oil activities accounted for 50.2% of Abu Dhabi's GDP at constant prices in 2014. Real estate activity also accounted for 20.7% of gross fixed capital formation in 2014, with the sector having grown by more than 22% during the year. The financial and insurance sector was second, with growth last year of nearly 20%. Diversification is an important issue for our country, and there are many serious strategic investments in renewable energy sources in the UAE, including, nuclear, wind, and solar.</p><h4>How will the Fed's impending rate hike affect the ADX?</h4><p>Whenever interest rates go up, it attracts investment away from other channels and into the interest rate channel. Therefore, we can base a strategy on that to tackle this problem whenever it arises. This is a cycle, so you have to be prepared for it. Our preparations are to diversify our financial instruments. We do not only have equity available on our market and we have also been concentrating on our bond and sukuk markets and instruments, and need to make more ETFs, warrants, and right issues readily available. It is up to us to give choices to investors. When interest rates go up, these instruments will make more sense to investors than equities. Perhaps in the future we will go into other instruments. When interest rates go up, part of that extra interest-generated money goes to banks, but a major portion also goes to bonds and sukuks. If we have them available on our platform, we would continue having liquidity available under the roof of the stock markets.</p><h4>How does the ADX fit in with the government's Vision 2030 goals?</h4><p>The ADX is one of the newest exchanges in the Middle East. From day one, we concentrated on quality and the performance of our stock market and wanted to be the exchange of choice in the region. I can say we have achieved that goal. When other exchanges want to develop something new, they come to us. We have passed the stage of being part of the MSCI as an emerging market. We want to be part of the developed market as part of the Abu Dhabi Government Vision 2030. That is not easy. It requires changing investor attitudes, setting up infrastructure, and changes to the legal framework. We have developed a clear strategy to develop those three elements, which can be defined as behavior, structure, and law.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the inception of the Lawyers' Council of Thailand over 30 years ago?</h4><p>The Lawyers Council of Thailand separated from the Thai Bar in 1985 because at that time professional lawyers felt strongly that we did not receive fair treatment under the joint leadership of the President of the Supreme Court, the President of the Court of Appeals, and the Attorney General. In a committee comprised of 27 members, only five of those members were lawyers, meaning we were a minority in that administration, and, therefore, we felt unfairly treated. The prominent senior lawyers at the time supported independence, and we pushed for the draft Lawyer Act in Parliament from about 1976 to 1985. We finally succeeded in getting the Lawyer Act of 1985 in place. Overall, it took us a while, almost 10 years, to become free and independent. We are now the special juristic entity under our own charter designated with the authority of enforcement of professional ethical rules and the promotion and enhancement of the legal profession, including welfare. In short, we are the sole authority overseeing the legal practice of all lawyers—over 81,000 attorneys in Thailand—and we are the central organization of all professional lawyers in Thailand. Initially, we were under the Court of Appeals IX for the whole legal profession; however, now we are truly independent. My colleagues and I were elected from lawyers throughout the country, and our term is three years with only two consecutive terms allowed. All 23 of us, including the president, are fully elected through public elections. </p><h4>How has the practice of law evolved over the years in Thailand?</h4><p>When we started our own administration, our biggest issue was that we did not have any money; therefore, we used our own funding for registration fees and tuition fees, for example. Today, we have invested a great deal into our own construction, with $20 million in loans to finance our new office, due to be completed in 2016. In our first 10 years, we concentrated on trying to establish more independent and stable legal practices and to raise funding. In terms of practice, most of the legal profession in Thailand is based on litigation­, more than 90%. We have not yet enhanced legal counseling much; however, we are planning about 33 legal counseling courses across all segments. The coming trend of practicing law in Thailand is that we will encourage our professional colleagues to look into future business. We want them to get involved with legal practices in terms of providing legal counseling for all sectors of society, be it financial or sports. Currently, most practices are based on litigation, and more than 60% of that is criminal. I want to encourage branching out from litigation to counseling. We also need to learn and then practice more in English, because the official language of ASEAN is English. Thailand was never colonized; therefore, we never really studied or learned English on a large scale. </p><h4>The key purpose of ASEAN is to increase business activity. Do you think legal cases being overwhelmingly criminal will give way to more commercial legal practices and cases?</h4><p>To diversify away from pure litigation law, there are 33 new legal counseling courses across all segments that we are trying to promote. In Thailand, it is unfortunate that we have a lifetime permit when we qualify for the legal profession. Once we am registered, that is it; we do not need to take any more compulsory legal studies, which is a shame because it prevents us from evolving, adapting, learning, and becoming flexible in other forms and areas of law. This is something that we are trying to change. We cannot do it right now, at least not with the current set of lawyers. The legal counseling market will also have to grow, and this will create a healthier and more dynamic legal sector for Thailand, shifting it from its near complete dedication to litigation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give us an overview of Proud Real Estate's current portfolio and achievements?</h4>
<p><strong>Proudputh Liptapanlop </strong>As far as Hua Hin is concerned, we see ourselves as a leader in tourism in the area. For visitors looking for quality accommodation; we have the best hotel in Hua Hin, bar none. During their stay, visitors want to visit shopping centers and explore entertainment in the city; we will be opening the biggest one in Hua Hin and the largest water park as well. Anyone who comes into Hua Hin will likely end up using at least one of our properties, so we see the big picture more as planning for the development of Hua Hin as a city, as opposed to one particular project. In operations, we have the InterContinental Hua Hin Resort and the Vana Nava Hua Hin Water Park. We also have a sports center called True Arena Hua Hin and are building a Holiday Inn next to the water park. We are opening a shopping center called BluPort in October 2016, and we are planning for a major push in our second destination, Phuket.</p>
<h4>What potential do you see for Hua Hin as the emerging tourist destination in Thailand?</h4>
<p><strong>Proudputh </strong>According to tourist figures, the top five destinations in Thailand are Phuket, Pattaya, Samui, Bangkok, and Chiang Mai. The way we see it there is no reason why Hua Hin cannot join that list; it has everything to become the next world destination for tourism in Thailand. It has a beach, mountains, a national park, and a culture that is unique. The other thing is that with all the logistics projects coming up, including the high-speed train and road improvements, there is plenty of growth. As far as development is concerned, Hua Hin is still behind. It has around 6,000 hotel rooms and a good offering of restaurants; however, there is still plenty of room for growth And because we are a major player in Hua Hin, it gives us a unique opportunity to almost dictate which direction the development should take place.</p>
<h4>Is Thailand's tourism market becoming more broad based, and how do you envisage it will look five years from now?</h4>
<p><strong>Proudputh </strong>Overall, the sector is not becoming more board based; Chinese tourists will be the main market. If anything, when you look at the statistics the Chinese market is obviously the fastest growing one, although it is understood that Russian tourists are coming back in numbers. At a micro level, when you look at operations it depends on the business you are looking at and the location as the strategy would differ. No hotel can just rely on just the Chinese market and everyone needs a broader base depending on seasonality as everyone has a different travel season. The Chinese market will be the biggest market in the next five years; however, the downside with that market is the price pressure. It is important to find the right mix of tourists for your operations.</p>
<p>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</p>
<p><strong>PASU Liptapanlop</strong> From a project level point of view, we want it to be a success and a project that everyone will talk about. From a corporate point of view, we want to establish ourselves as the leader in the entertainment mixed-use development sector in Thailand. Tourism is a major growth; however, everyone can get into hotels and there is plenty of supply so it is about how you differentiate yourself. Our take is to create a destination within a destination, which is where the entertainment and leisure side of things come in. It gives your hotel and your residences a unique advantage by being next to a crowd magnet such as a water park or shopping center. That is the model that we will continue to pursue; a mixed used development that will be able to draw the tourists in its own right.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give an overview of S Group's background and hotel portfolio?</h4><p>Our hotel business is a family business. I started the business eight years ago with the S15 Sukhumvit Hotel, and S Group now has five hotels. Our philosophy is to try and spread our risk over every market segment. We offer a range of different styles of accommodation and have hotel rooms priced from THB800 up to THB20,000 per night and room sizes ranging from 8sqm up to 400sqm. One philosophy that we have held is that each of our hotels has a different style, yet everyone who stays at an S Hotel can see certain characteristics in what we offer. The overall aesthetic is modern, clean, and affordable. Location is the most important factor and a crucial feature; we always choose locations next to BTS Skytrain and/or MRT stations in central Bangkok. We do look at potential new BTS lines and transportation expansion plans; having said that, we tend to concentrate on the Sukhumvit area because over the last eight years we have found that this is the most successful and popular location for our hotels. These are the main characteristics common to all our hotels. Yet, we offer variety in size, location, and facilities between our various hotels.</p><h4>What are some of the latest trends in the hotel and tourism industry in Bangkok and Thailand in general?</h4><p>Around 30 million tourists visited Thailand in 2015. Of that number, 60% came from East Asia and of that percentage 40% came from China. The growth in tourist numbers from East Asia and China continued in 1Q2016. We expect that over the next five years tourists coming here will be mostly from these areas. China has many different kinds of travelers, from budget and agency to elderly tourists and the luxury market. However, now most Chinese tourists come here on what are called “zero dollar" tours. With these tours, tourists are obliged to buy goods while they are here, such as jewelry, and in return their travel and accommodation is free. The tour agency pays for the trip and it takes a percentage of the money paid for goods by the tourists. These agencies manage to make money from this system. We work with the agencies that organize these trips. For example, we booked 200 rooms at our S Ratchada Leisure Hotel for one of these tours from China. </p><h4>What is the future of S Group in five to 10 years?</h4><p>There are two parts. The first issue is how we will serve the Chinese tourists coming here while the other side of the equation is waiting to see when tourists from other countries will start returning to Thailand. This includes tourists from Russia, Europe, and the US. We are also looking closely into the budget range; we have now positioned five hotels in this range because demand is increasing in the low-cost segment of the hotel market. This is where we will focus in the next few years. Within the next five years S Group aims to reach 1,000 rooms. At the moment, we have 560 rooms in total.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016 in terms of occupancy rates and revenue?</h4><p>Our total revenue in 2016 will not be lower than THB500 million. What I am concerned about is cost, and how in 2016-2017 we can increase our prices because this is a difficult thing to do YoY in the Thai market. Right now, I am not worried about the occupancy rates in our hotels; these are around 80-90%; however, I am worried about costs because hotel rates in Thailand are cheap, even cheaper than Myanmar, for example. Many investors want to enter the market in Myanmar now as demand is high there. Looking at the region, the most interesting location for us is Vietnam; however, it is a difficult country in terms of people and political factors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most important new developments for Ford over the past two years?</h4><p>We have had an interesting few years. We made a great deal of progress on the industrial front; in that period we had three investments for Mexico approved and they are currently being implemented. That means three new plants, two component plants, and one engine plant in Chihuahua, where we have been producing engines for 25 years. We have a transmission plant in Hermosillo beside the transmission plant of our partner in a joint venture with Getrag. At the end of 2017, it will start producing pilots and full production will begin around mid-2018. We also will build an assembly plant for vehicles at San Luis Potosi, which was announced in early 2016. It is in a state where we have never operated before as a manufacturer, although we have commercial presence. We are completing arrangements for the land with the industrial park and the government. Construction will commence in 2016 and the plant is expected to be up and running by mid-2018. </p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of Mexico to Ford's global operations?</h4><p>Mexico is extremely important because it complements our production capacity, primarily for North America as well as for other regions. That is the case for component parts; both engines and transmissions will be exported to North America, South America, Asia, and Europe to the assembly plants that we have in those regions. For the assembly plant, the primary market will be North America, though we also export to South America and Europe. We are producing up to around 350,000 units, which is the stored capacity. When the new plant is up and running we will produce around 750,000 units per year in Mexico as well as about 1 million engines and around half a million transmissions per year. This is a large figure for company that produces around 7 million units in total globally.</p><h4>What role has Ford played in developing Mexico's role as a leader in the automotive sector globally?</h4><p>We were one of the first manufacturers to come to Mexico in 1925. Then, we were the first to locate manufacturing plants south of the border to export to the US, which was when Hermosillo and Chihuahua started around 30 years ago. We were the first to see the opportunity of producing on this side of the border for export to the US and to establish a large manufacturing presence here. Then pretty much everyone followed. At the end of the day, we were the first to see the opportunity to establish a large manufacturing presence in Mexico and then to establish the relevant suppliers to make sure we not only use Mexican labor to produce our vehicles, but also benefit from material manufactured locally by local suppliers or by global suppliers established in Mexico. We maximize the benefit of producing in the country and Mexico benefits the most from the manufacturing presence of Ford, at the end of the day producing more jobs in the domestic market. That is why we are expanding that presence by building the three new manufacturing facilities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Ministry of Culture promoting Thai films outside of the country?</h4><p>The Thai government has placed a huge importance on the film industry because it increases revenues for the country, while also boosting tourist numbers and the image of Thailand abroad. We also have our National Board of Film, which is chaired by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, and which aims to be one of the world's most famous locations for film productions as well as promoting the Thai film industry both locally and abroad. We have produced more than 746 films in Thailand, generating about $35 million in 2014.</p><h4>Earlier this year you were involved in a campaign to encourage Thai citizens to wear more traditional clothing. How important is this to preserve the national identity?</h4><p>It is very important. Miss Thailand has been awarded the best national costume in the Miss Universe competition five times, which is a source of pride. Thai silk is a great product; we have high-quality material and designs. There have been many developments and evolutions over hundreds of years in traditional Thai clothing. Jewelry designers in Thailand are also famous. Queen Sirikit supports Thai dress and textiles, especially traditional and authentic dress for boosting the income of the communities. We have heritage day every Tuesday, when we promote Thai dress for officials to wear across the country. This is symbolic and not compulsory, but by dressing in our traditional attire—at least once a week—we show that we are serious about preserving our national identity.</p><h4>How is Thai culture defining itself in the context of globalization?</h4><p>Thai culture is especially dynamic because Thai people are able to adapt to the quickly changing world. We assimilate into new cultures and can easily and effectively adjust ourselves, which is how we are able to survive the modern era. We maintain the best aspects of outside cultures and adjust them to suit our culture. Cultures around the world are changing by the day and we play a part in developing them. Thais must know that there are traditions that we need to preserve, but that we must also adjust into a new way of life. We want Thai children to be aware of Thai-ness and also to be aware of the modern world at the same time. We want them to strike a balance between old and new and to recognize, as we do, that the world is changing.</p><h4>What roles does culture play in bringing in tourism revenues for the country?</h4><p>We expect to have around 30 million visitors to Thailand in 2015, which will generate around THB2.2 billion. Tourists are not only attracted to natural places like beaches or mountains, but also cultural attractions. Historic buildings, towns, or museums play a big part in tourists' agenda when visiting Thailand. The Ministry of Culture proudly manages our museums, historic parks, World Heritage temples, and festivals. We recently launched a tourist application, which introduced QR codes to museums to offer an easier and smarter experience for visitors at museums, and also audio guides. We expect the number of visitors will be increased from 5 million to 8 million visitors this year with the promotion and marketing of the application.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our goal is to prepare for the ASEAN community; we have established the ASEAN Cultural Center this year to promote the understanding of ASEAN in Thailand. We also promote and provide support for folk artists and performers to help them succeed in the modern era by generating more jobs for them. We collaborate with other agencies, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Tourism and Sports, and also Ministry of ICT. When we promote Thailand globally, it has to be a joint effort. For the promotion of culture, we are going to do it not only in ASEAN, but across Asia, Europe, and Africa, and even in South America. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the Ministry's vision for the Oman Global Logistics Group, and what will be its main responsibilities?</h4><p>We have many companies working on logistics and transport, which are either 100% government-owned companies or partially government owned. We have noticed that the work between these companies needs to be integrated, and we need to utilize the resources that these companies have. Therefore, we have established a holding company that has around 17 companies under it. We divided the holding company into certain categories such as ports and economic zones, some transport companies such as ferries, shipping companies, and some other support services included as well such as Dry Duqm Company. It is a new model for us in Oman to have all the logistics companies under one umbrella, and this group is linked to the Ministry of Transport so we can integrate the policy alongside its implementation. One major role of this group will be to look at the investments that the country needs in this sector, which will require examining KPIs to create profitable companies and elicit growth. We are expecting to see an improvement in our financial investments in these companies by integrating them and improving their financial status. The second mandate of the group is to act as the implementation arm for the national logistics strategy. The experts that helped us craft the logistics strategy told us that the country has no problem in transport infrastructure. The ports and deep ports that we have built, the excellent roads, and the state-of-the-art airport coming up in Muscat will be sufficient to grow the transport sector. However, what is lacking is the soft infrastructure, such as trade facilitation measures to improve processes, procedures, and regulations for a greater ease of business, human capital including more training, technology advancements, and marketing and markets. These are the four pillars and the spirit of the logistics strategy in the country. We hope to place logistics as one of the successful diversification sectors in the country. We are also working on an aviation holding group, where we will do a similar thing for the aviation sector with one umbrella holding company containing Oman Air, the airport management company, and the air traffic control company will be transferred from PACA. This has been approved by the government for establishment, and we are going forward with the process; we are looking forward to establishing it before the end of 2016.</p><h4>How will the Ministry's move to grant two licenses to manage and operate local taxis help to increase the development of public transportation in Oman?</h4><p>Taxis in Oman require a lot of improvement as they have not been regulated properly for many years. Countries worldwide are improving this sector dramatically because it is directly linked to tourism and any modern city requires a good taxi system. This year we have issued a new land transport law in the country. Using that law, we will start issuing regulations for taxis and imposing on them certain rules and conditions for how drivers should operate. The next step is that we will create management companies to manage the taxi drivers. They still have their taxi license, but there will be a management company at the top which will provide for them the systems such as meters, GPS, ordering service, credit card, and tracking systems based on certain fees. We will not give them new licenses, so one company will use the available licenses in hotels, ports, and harbors, while the other one will be in the airport companies and commercial centers. For the street taxis, we will be imposing regulations and rules and, while we may not ask them to use meters right away, we want them to use a fixed, published tariff. However, we are imposing on hotel, airport, commercial center, and mall taxis to have meters and advanced systems through these two companies. In addition, we allow them to do call services starting in Muscat only. It is our vision that street taxis will notice the benefit of the advanced system and will gradually migrate to it.</p><h4>What are some of the new capabilities that will come to Oman as a result of the country's airport projects in terms of increasing the national tourism and logistics capabilities?</h4><p>We are gradually completing our airport projects. The Salalah Airport is now operational and we are expecting the airport construction in Muscat to finish at the end of 2016, with its full operation in 2017. In all of our airport projects we are developing a complete airport in terms of cargo facilities, catering, and MRO. We are hoping that introducing modern facilities will grow our logistics business in Oman to be a hub for passengers, cargo, and possibly the maintenance of aircraft. We realize our infrastructure will require strong, state-of-the-art services in order to attract more airlines. We are floating tenders for international operators in related fields for our airports, such as introducing a second ground handler in the airport with Swiss Port. This is only the second airport in the Gulf, which will have two ground handling companies. Oman Air itself is partnering with a company from the UK to improve its ground handling capabilities and along with a Singaporean company to develop its capabilities in cargo handling and operations. We are reforming Oman Air to have subsidiaries; right now there is one company doing the flying, maintenance, cargo, and catering. We are creating subsidiaries under Oman Air with specialized companies for each area. We are seeking to have strong international partners in all of these areas to improve the quality of services provided in the new facilities. We are also floating tenders for the operation of cargo and maintenance in the regional airports in Salalah and Sohar. Within the next year, there will be more tenders coming out for the operation of such facilities, and we will see the appetite of international operators. While the market is not so big in Sohar and Duqm, it will require time for us to build up a market, but we are working in all directions to finish the infrastructure, bring in international operators, and market our airports and aviation sector. We have seen steady passenger growth in Salalah and Muscat. We have had double-digit growth in passengers and cargo and these numbers attract operators.</p><h4>How will a well-developed logistics sector in Oman help carry the country into its next stage of development?</h4><p>The good thing about the logistics sector is that we have done a good job in setting up a solid infrastructure over the past 40 years. We have three deep sea ports and five good airports. We are trying to progress the railway project for the GCC, which will be a good addition to the country. Oman also enjoys a strategic location. In addition, other sectors that we want to develop for diversification, such as mining, depend on logistics. If we want to export our fisheries or agricultural products internationally, then we need good airports and warehouses to take the products worldwide. The same thing applies to industrial output and even tourism. Logistics is the enabler for all of these sectors and crucial to their success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>KMITL was recently called upon to do a feasibility study for the city hall promenade. Can you tell us more about this project?</h4><p>The idea of the project was to provide a useful space in a prime location that can be enjoyed by everyone. I was inspired by the idea of a promenade many years ago, while studying in MIT. The local authorities there had created a promenade park along the riverbank where people could enjoy the space for walking, picnicking, and other activities. No matter who you are or where you're from, the city's prime locations are accessible to you. Here in Bangkok, there is a growing sentiment that the city's riverbanks are simply overpriced for the average Thai to enjoy—with its luxury condominiums, hotels, restaurants, and so on. As such, the government proposed the idea to the city hall to create a promenade and we have been appointed to conduct the feasibility study. Our research dominates the fields of engineering and flood control given that, above all, we are also the largest engineering school in the country. We have a reputation as the most reputable architecture school in the country. This combination of know-how and expertise sets us apart. Our people are experts in their field, and the big projects can change the future of our country, which is why we want to be involved.</p><h4>What have been the most significant achievements and projects that the institute has been involved in over its 50-year history?</h4><p>Our engineering school originated from a Japanese school in the 1950s, when it served primarily as a telecommunications training center for young engineers. Over the next half century the university evolved and now we have almost 2,000 students and 250 faculties. The turning point was over three decades ago when our beloved king, an admirer of engineering himself, visited us here at KMITL. Since then, the authorities in Thailand have been encouraged by our expertise in telecommunications and engineering specifically, and therefore willing to engage in a number of projects. For example, we had the first satellite installation in Thailand devised here. The Thai people could access all types of trend-setting technologies at this university, such as our first female astronaut, who graduated from this school.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead in 2016?</h4><p>We are proud of our leadership and are looking ahead toward the future. Right now we are looking at a partnership that will help us to compete with top-ranked universities in the world. We want to be the top research and education center in Southeast Asia. We have a good location and good people, and we need good advisors. We are working toward making Thailand a knowledge-based economy that will enjoy the benefits of an educated society in a booming region. From there we want to strive to be the best internationally in our particular domains, to help build a diverse, yet specialized economy. We are expanding our programs to include a medical school, as there is an obvious need for doctors here in Thailand. We have some of the best facilities, which is why we need to identify and help build the most dedicated doctors and medical staff. That is our vision for the future, and we have partners to implement this plan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the recent major developments at Samitivej Hospitals?</h4><p>Our hospital was founded in 1979, and is today considered one of the leading private hospital groups in Thailand. In fact, our flagship facility, Samitivej Sukhumvit, located on Sukhumvit Soi 49, is recognized as one of the most advanced private hospitals in Southeast Asia. Despite this, since our founding, we have always looked to expand our services and have added five more hospitals: Samitivej Srinakarin in eastern Bangkok, Samitivej Sriracha in southeastern Thailand, Samitivej International Children's Hospital in Bangkok, Samitivej Thonburi in western Bangkok, and Samitivej Chonburi north of Pattaya. Moreover, by expanding we have not only widened our presence, we have also looked to deepen our services and ensure they meet the highest international standards. Healthcare, more than any other sector, demands the highest service quality because our job is to keep people alive. This goes for our machinery, our doctors, other medical staff, and generally, our overall operations. </p><h4>The group is reportedly eyeing further expansion in the ASEAN region. What will the recent integration of the AEC mean for this strategy?</h4><p>We have a joint venture with a reputable hospital in Yangon, Myanmar, who is our strategic partner. We have set up a clinic in the hospital; however, recently we chose to further boost our presence there and decided to set up a new building that we expect to open soon. The AEC has simply allowed us to broaden our market and horizons. Thailand has a population of 60 million; however, if we expand our vision to ASEAN, we are open to a market of over 620 million people. In addition, Thailand is renowned for its highest standards of medical facilities and service qualities, more so than any country in the region, and is also approximately 30% cheaper than Singapore. Patients recognize this and it is up to us to seize this opportunity and make the most of the growing regional connectivity. To add to this regional dimension, we are currently building a new eight-story children's hospital specializing in newborns in Bangkok. Part of the reason is that we know that such facilities are severely lacking in countries like Myanmar and Vietnam. People are aware of our expertise in these fields, and we are confident that this facility will become one of the leading specialized children's hospitals in ASEAN.</p><h4>What are some of the key recent trends in Thailand's health sector?</h4><p>Our aging population is an important factor, as is the case in every country. We have to look carefully at how to help the aging people in this country and are also focused on geriatric care here at Samitivej. We have a geriatric center in Bangkok, which we are upgrading to provide more holistic, full services to our patients. Medical tourism is a major revenue generator for Thailand and this is another important trend to note. In the coming years, we expect an even stronger influx of patients from the region, specifically CLMV countries. We hope to also set up a center of excellence to study in more detail the health problems arising in the region and to look at how our specialized expertise in certain fields can meet these demands.</p><h4>How would you describe Samitivej's growth strategy going forward?</h4><p>Our current revenue lies at around THB15 billion per year, and in the first five months of 2016 we have already seen growth of 10%. In line with the trends mentioned and our strong position within both the domestic and the international markets, the future is bright for Samitivej. A final note to make is that going forward we will also look more into introducing preventive measures. It is not about only receiving patients when they are ill—we invite them for regular checkups to ensure that illnesses are detected early on and prevented. This is the key to a healthy society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the key successes of TCEB in boosting Thailand's MICE industry?</h4><p>We have been fortunate over the last three to four years to receive a large number of attendees for high-profile events here in Thailand, often attracting 50,000 visitors and above. One of the reasons for this is because we actively target corporate clients such as business leaders, executives, and board members from key multinational companies to persuade them to hold their meetings in Bangkok. It is not only about offering them first-class facilities; they also want to be on the ground and perhaps see how big the market is and what the potential for growth is. In particular, we target markets in southern China in line with the surge in visitors from there. From global economic forecasts, money markets grow quickly in this region and business naturally follows the money. We will also hold a number of large international conferences in Bangkok for niche sectors. In terms of exhibitions, as Thailand has great manufacturing capabilities, we are able to organize some of the largest and most respected exhibitions here. In the past few months alone, we have organized some major high-profile events for the packaging, gems, IT, and telecoms industries. At the same time, Thailand is renowned for its automotive and tourism-related exhibitions and these are held regularly here to the highest global standards, bringing in tens of thousands of international visitors.</p><h4>What is the importance of community-based tourism, and why is it such a priority for the government?</h4><p>We are situated in the middle of three of the biggest and oldest civilizations in the world: India, China, and the Khmer. These three civilizations, each over 1,000 years old, mixing together here has made our land one big melting pot over the past millennium, and gives us a unique culture and heritage to not only show the world but also to appreciate ourselves. Community-based tourism allows us to explore more about ourselves. For foreigners interested in exploring this rich heritage, the typical tourist packages fail to give them this experience. Packages are often fully prearranged, including accommodation, food, and other vendors, and there is little opportunity to actually explore. Community-based tourism takes a different approach; it allows visitors to really zoom in and experience the grassroots of the culture, mixing with locals, learning from each other, and sharing experiences. This is important for the country because it allows us to diversify our tourism mix; we can channel the record number of arrivals expected this year to different regions and experiences. More importantly, for the communities mentioned, it gives them a sustainable source of revenue and opens a whole new world of opportunities. This is where DASTA comes in.</p><h4>What have been the key achievements of DASTA in supporting community-based tourism in Thailand?</h4><p>Over the past decade, we have helped develop six regions across the country as community-based tourism destinations: Koh Chang, Pattaya, Sukhothai, Loei, Nan, and Suphan Buri. The goal of DASTA is not to change the community, it is to support regions if they wish to benefit from the boom in Thailand's tourism industry. After an area is designated directly by the cabinet, we create a master plan with the local community, a process that can often take many years to get right and make everyone happy. The relationship between the central government and local authorities is not always smooth at the beginning. Over time, we bring everyone together, including the local authorities, members of the community, and business people, and discuss ways to create opportunities for everyone. I can confidently say that in each of the areas we have developed, we are always welcomed in the end. Now we seek cabinet approval to also develop Chiang Saen in Chiang Rai province, and Cha-am and Hua Hin in Phetchaburi and Prachuap Khiri Khan provinces, respectively. Going forward, I see great opportunity for DASTA to expand its capability and serve each area of the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the origins of the EEC project?</h4><p>Our eastern seaboard has been a major discussion point for our country since the 1980s, when we discovered natural gas in the Gulf of Thailand. Over the years, Thailand has developed the eastern seaboard quite successfully with the petrochemical, automobile, and electronics industries. Our new government has developed a long-term vision to see how we can export this successful case and integrate new industries in the region because the opening of the AEC means that trade will expand across ASEAN. Thailand is a natural, geographic hub, especially on the mainland surrounding the CLMV countries. The EEC will act as an industrial belt, with access to Myanmar on the west and connecting Thailand to Phnom Penh and then on to the east side of Vietnam, which is a major part of our economic growth strategy. There are many industries already established and we want to introduce extensions, incentives, and value-add services of many types. The government has announced the new S curve of five industries that will look to the future development of our country, and will be central to our work on the EEC. These include robotics, medical, aviation, biofuels, and, crucially, digital.</p><h4>How many of these plans relate to the government's push to upgrade infrastructure and build connectivity within Thailand and the region?</h4><p>The government's infrastructure plans are absolutely crucial to this development, as the EEC's main selling point is indeed its unrivaled access to major airports, sea ports, and trade routes. According to the government's plan, we will now have a high-speed train from Bangkok to Rayong, a key location within the EEC, and currently one of Thailand's main industrial hubs. In Rayong, there is a deep-sea port for heavy industry; however, with the EEC, we will develop another seaport from the navy in Sattahip. We also have U-Tapao airport, which can currently accommodate 800,000 passengers annually. This summer, however, a new terminal will open that will boost its capacity to 3 million and this is just the beginning. It has already assigned a professional consulting firm to design two runways, a new terminal, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities for aircraft. Together with the Sattahip commercial port, this will cater to tourists as well as industry, as it is close to Pattaya and we are developing a ferry service that will allow people to travel across the Gulf of Thailand in one hour instead of five to six hours by road. These developments will enhance the EEC on top of the connectivity. In addition, there will be a motorway extension. We will have a web network within the EEC to increase logistics efficiency and also connect to the outside area. This is a major investment and a major driver behind the EEC project. Specifically, we estimate that the government and private sectors will pump roughly THB1.5 trillion over the next five years into the development.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>This year is fast paced because the government wants the project to be initiated by 2017. We have to engage many ministries so currently we separate the jobs. The first is industry; we have to specify in detail the areas in the industrial zone, including urbanization. The Ministry of Industry and the Industrial Estate will look into the details together with city planners. The second job is on connectivity. In this case, we have the transportation planning agencies, which are under the Ministry of Transportation. We need the private sector in the area to join them. Right now, we are also engaging the tourism sector, as the EEC is focused not only on industry, but tourism as well. All in all, we expect the infrastructure and investments in the area to be completed within five years. However, the EEC is a step-by-step process and with all the sector-wide developments pushing ahead, we expect to see positive results as we go. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[THAI seas]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[thai-seas]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the biggest challenges facing Thailand's fishing industry?</h4><p>We are reforming the entire fisheries industry, and not just traditional fishing, but aquaculture, inland fishing, and fisheries outside of Thai waters. We oversee and reform the entire industry, including imports and exports, which are crucial to Thailand's output. For example, although Thailand is the biggest exporter of canned tuna, we in fact import most of our tuna and there is a whole process there to manage, which eventually has a great impact on global seafood stockpiles. Lately our industry has been under fire from some key markets, such as the EU, which threatens to ban fish imports from us if we do not properly regulate the industry and stamp out illegal fishing practices. For us the reforms are not purely about regulating the market; it is about the concept behind the regulation and our philosophy. This is important because it is not just the structure that needs to be changed, but also the way we approach our work and support our people. For example, one issue that has been frequently raised is licensing and ensuring that all fishing activities are approved with the necessary licenses. While this is a crucial aspect of regulating the industry, it is very important to remember that across Thailand we have millions of subsistence farmers who go out fishing simply to feed their families or their immediate communities. It is impossible to force these people to abide by the same, strict regulatory process that was designed for big businesses. We therefore need to change the way we understand and better utilize our fisheries' potential rather than just throwing regulations at the problem.</p><h4>Has illegal fishing become an issue of national importance?</h4><p>Yes, it has. We have two problems—the illegal unreported unregulated (IUU) issue and the labor issue—that everyone keeps conflating. These are in fact two different issues with different regulations, but most often people assume that anyone doing IUU fishing also does human trafficking or forced labor. We know we have problems in the fishery sector so we try to solve both problems together although they require different kinds of regulations, enforcements, and so on. As mentioned, the aim is not to throw red tape and regulations at the industry until businesses cannot survive anymore. We regulate to support our businesses and make sure they are doing a better job, which will help them reach new heights in the world. There are many key players who in fact do things by the book and this is all about eliminating the ones who cheat the system, undercut their workers, and bring down the reputation of our country. </p><h4>What is your expectation for the fishing industry and do you think Thailand will overcome these challenges?</h4><p>The quicker we move on enacting and implementing these reforms, the better it will be. Looking at history, many countries, including Japan and various countries in Europe, struggled to reform their fisheries industries and went through a gradual process. We do not have that luxury; we do not have time to do it and we also do not have much money to do it. Thailand is a diverse economy so we simultaneously need to invest and develop many sectors, and not just fisheries. However, the government sees the significance of the fishery sector so it gives us attention and as many resources as it can allocate, so we try to move as fast as we can and in the most efficient way. We have outlined our strategy and plans to restructure the way things are done, both here in the department, and out at sea. If we succeed in doing this in an effective timeframe, I am more than confident that Thailand will continue to boast one of the biggest fishing industries in the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a newcomer, how do you plan to secure your share of the market?</h4><p>We provide high quality and differentiated services to both merchants and consumers in Thailand. Convenience to consumers is our core focus. E-commerce buyers like convenience and speed. Given the rapid growth of the e-commerce market, there are consumer demands that cannot be met with existing logistics infrastructure and providers. This is critical as logistics is an integral element of the e-commerce business, and there is a need for the more established providers to enable the industry to realize its full growth potential. DHL eCommerce recognizes this gap and aims to stay close to our customers and develop services to enable a better e-commerce experience for both customers and consumers. Currently, we work closely with all major e-commerce players and have so far received positive feedback about our services, indicating that we are on the right track. We offer end-to-end logistics services to our customers, including picking up products from sellers and last mile delivery to recipients in Bangkok and upcountry areas. Our standard service is next day in urban areas and 2-3 days for remote rural zones. Speed is an important element in the e-commerce business, but reliability is even more crucial to our customers. Being able to deliver our promise consistently is where DHL's strength lies. We also provide a cash on delivery service with a very timely remittance of cash back to the seller or merchant. We monitor our performance closely. We also listen to the feedback from our customers through regular customer surveys and react quickly to address any issues that are identified. By providing the highest level of service and unrivalled reliability, I am confident that we will continue to build even more positive feedback and grow our business rapidly over the coming years.</p><h4>With a number of planned infrastructure investments, Thailand aims to be the logistics hub for ASEAN. What trends do you notice in the local logistic sector?</h4><p>With greater investment and focus on infrastructure improvement, it is expected that we will see higher efficiency that will bring down the cost of logistics, which has been estimated to be around 18% of GDP in Thailand, compared to 10% in other developed countries. There is still plenty of room for development. Thailand can position itself as the regional logistics hub, especially with the regional economic integration under AEC. Our country is strategically located at the center of mainland ASEAN, linking the entire Southeast Asia and southern part of China. Specifically for e-commerce logistics, the industry is still in its infancy with a large number of players of different sizes and scale, background, and nature of business. We have also observed quite a number of start-up logistics companies with strong funding support. As such, though the market is still in the early stages, we have already seen good competition. As this continues, we expect to see consolidation in this fragmented market in the medium term.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>DHL eCommerce aims to be the leading player in the e-commerce logistics market. Given our expertise in logistics as a market leader, we are well positioned to take on this challenge. We ensure that we truly understand customer requirements. We are committed to staying at the forefront of e-commerce logistics innovations and are able to respond to the needs of the market. Operationally, we are expanding our network to cover larger geographical areas. This will enable us to provide high-quality and consistent service to our customers wherever they are. A series of new product features will be launched with the aim of enhancing and better enabling merchants to sell their goods online and further improve the convenience of shopping for their consumers. Given these developments, we believe DHL eCommerce will have a prominent role to play in the e-commerce space as an enabler for growth and a better e-commerce experience. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can the mass transit system expand further?</h4><p>There are ambitious expansion plans with new routes to be added to the network, with some of the expansion planned to integrate with other systems like the underground or trams. Bangkok currently has 85km of mass transit lines; however, the government's target is 515km in 15-20 years. The government continues to invest in infrastructure, and expansion will continue in line with the government's plans over the next 30 years. In Bangkok, only 6% of people travel by rail, with 90% using buses. Compared to other cities like Singapore, Hong Kong, or Seoul, where 40-50% of people use rail transit, 6% is tiny and indicates a huge opportunity. Currently, we are operating 36km of mass transit lines in the city but the target for the next five years is to add an additional 108km. That figure will of course grow as the system expands in subsequent years.</p><h4>Are there any other major rail projects that you are looking at?</h4><p>There is the High-Speed Rail project, which will pass through Bangkok; however, it is a huge investment that has to be a government-to-government project. A private company on its own would not go into that, as the returns would not be great and the costs would be extensive. Governments could do it and make returns through the long-term impacts of that system, through taxes, transport, trade, tourism, and so on. One project that we are interested in is the dual-track project. We have the expertise and the experience for that project and are also ready financially. We are in close discussions with the government on that project. The government has been aggressively pursuing mass transit and railroad projects that will benefit the Thai population, and so we expect significant development in the coming years.</p><h4>You have four distinct but integrated sectors that you operate in. How do you see these evolving in the future?</h4><p>In property, we have a strategic alliance to develop 25 projects in the next five years worth about THB100 billion with our joint venture partner Sansiri. These projects are all in close proximity to mass transit lines. On the media side, through our subsidiary VGI Global Media, we are evolving from a Bangkok-centric media company to a nationwide integrated media platform with six key segments. In particular, we look to enter the upcountry media market that has been long underserved. Finally, we have the Rabbit Card, a payment card that can be used on our transit system as well as with our retail partners. We are now extending this to become an e-wallet. In addition to being a payment platform, it gives us information on people's behavior such as where they eat, shop, and travel, which can feed back into our advertising operations. While the sectors in which we operate are distinct, our evolution and the integration of these operations have been natural.</p><h4>What are your expectations for BTS Group in the year ahead?</h4><p>Mass transit is still our core business and we want to secure the upcoming green line extension projects and others, including the pink line. We are also eager to participate in the dual-track project, where we have the expertise to run the dual-track trains, although we do not yet have the experience in cargo and logistics. The government has stated strongly its intention to expand investments and projects in mass transit and other transportation projects. The purple line will open this August, while the green line extensions have been transferred back to the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA). All these demonstrate the extent to which the government is pushing mass transit forward. We have recently signed a train procurement contract to purchase an additional 184 carriages, the largest single purchase of trains in Thai history. We plan more investments in rolling stock for both existing lines and the lines projected to be added to the mass transit system. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>THAI posted strong profits for 1Q2016. Is this a sign that the restructuring program initiated in 2014 is on the right track?</h4><p>We are moving in the right direction and we increased the amount of passengers by 11% last year, from 19 million to over 21 million with seven fewer aircraft and four fewer major stations. Earlier, we also cut some routes, such as LA, Madrid, and Johannesburg. Those expenses have been reduced, efficiency has been improved, and fuel prices have been low. In 2015, our cabin factor was at 73.3%, which meant 27% of seats were empty. In 2016, our cabin factor should be around 80%, so approximately a 7% increase. Filling empty seats is crucial, because it is necessary to fill the seats on each flight. We have also made staff reductions in various departments, such as catering and ground handling. We have put a system in place to do better network planning. With such systems in place, we are able to conduct better fleet planning. In terms of pricing, we will have the ability to change and set prices more quickly and in line with our competitors, so once that system is in place it will have a major effect on improving efficiency. The fleet will be better, our pricing will be better, and operations will run more efficiently and more smoothly. Every little bit helps.</p><h4>How do you also seek to grow and tackle the market?</h4><p>Last year, we realized that the airline would have to shrink in terms of capacity. Once we resume efficiency and are free of some routes and aircraft, it may be possible to expand again. In line with those plans, THAI will open new routes to Tehran and THAI Smile will offer service to Cebu in the Philippines. We have also increased flight frequency on some routes. We have better planning overall, and can take on new growth as a leaner and more efficient company. In terms of the most promising markets going forward, China is high as always, and Japan, India, Australia, and the UK also have their own growth patterns. Europe overall seems to be doing much better. We work closely with the Ministry of Transport and the airport authority to increase the number of visitors to the country. We want to make Thailand an international hub, and this is at a time when competition is fierce in the region and worldwide, especially with Middle Eastern airlines, not to mention low-cost airlines, now shining on the international stage. Those factors and players pushed us to go through the intensive restructuring, which is making us more competitive overall. THAI Smile is one of the initiatives we developed for short-haul flights to compete with low-cost carriers. For long haul flights, we could improve our network management and planning, with new systems to help in that field; however, we are certainly on the right path. We also look closely at the integration of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), and envisage huge opportunities in this field. THAI should be the key player in terms of connecting this region with the rest of the world, and THAI Smile is one of the initiatives that will help us do so.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We are moving according to plan and that should help us attain a reasonable level of efficiency that will bring us close to our competitors. We have cut the gap significantly, which is what we are aiming for. We have been improving services in the meantime in order to become one of the top-five carriers worldwide. We have a new business class service, which was launched in November 2015, and currently half of THAI's European routes offer that service. The new business class service is individual on-demand service, focused on individual passenger needs. We have also introduced all sorts of new cuisine and food selections, including Japanese, Thai curries, and Thai street foods, for example. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Are you satisfied with the progress that has been made on the major infrastructure development projects initiated by the government?</h4><p>Our prime policy focus areas are aimed at driving investment projects in Thailand's railways. Rail is not new in Thailand—it is 100 years old—but we never modernized our technology, so that is now our priority. Bangkok currently has two mass-transit lines, but the aim of the government is to expand this to 10 lines in the coming years. All 10 lines will be approved by the end of 2016, and we aim to commence with the construction of the pink, yellow, and orange lines in the second half of 2016. Our second major focus is the Intercity Rail system, where we will double our single-rail track, one of the obstacles to our transport and logistics sectors flourishing. We have six double-track projects altogether, mainly linking Bangkok to the north, the northeast, and the south of the country. Our third focus is the high-speed rail, which the government has approved and is currently working on with our Chinese counterparts.</p><h4>From the ministry's point of view, what have been the key milestones and trends in the aviation industry?</h4><p>For aviation, the major issue is delisting ourselves from the significant safety concern label, the SSC, which was issued to us due to safety concerns over aviation regulation. We hope to complete our recertification of airlines by November and thus request for a re-audit of our supervision and regulations of the airline industry at the end of 2016. Our goal is to improve our capacity on the human resources side because airlines in Thailand have been growing rapidly. Over the past 10 years or so, we have seen an evolution of the entire industry, particularly as low-cost airlines grow rapidly and bring not only foreigners to Thailand, but also crucially serve the domestic market at affordable prices, which is vital for our population. We see huge potential in the future of inter-regional travel throughout ASEAN and beyond. Thai Smile, for example, is becoming more active in connecting with regional cities, which opens up new, exciting markets and is affordable from the airlines' point of view. Because of this rapid growth, we have to look at our facilities and ensure they can accommodate this surge. The government policy is to have three major airports for Thailand's capital city, i.e. Suvarnabhumi Airport, Don Mueang Airport, and U-Tapao Airport. Primarily, we are looking into expanding Suvarnabhumi Airport by building a satellite terminal, a domestic terminal, and a third runway. We use Don Muang Airport as a domestic and low-cost terminal with the need for expansion further by renovating the third terminal. Our regional airports are also at full capacity so we need to expand. We promote more intercity flights that do not feature Bangkok to ease the congestion, such as Chiang Mai-Koh Samui, Chiang Rai-Phuket, and so on.</p><h4>With all these infrastructure projects in the pipeline, do you believe Thailand has the potential to be the logistics hub of ASEAN?</h4><p>Yes I do. We planned for regional connectivity 20 years ago when we first built the road network connecting the country. To the south is Malaysia and the border checkpoint is extremely congested, so we will open a new border checkpoint. Looking at Cambodia, we have the biggest checkpoint border, which is now congested. We will build a new border checkpoint just for trucks and other heavy vehicles. We are building a second bridge to Myanmar, which will make it easy for trucks and cargo to cross the border. In the northeast we have three friendship bridges crossing the Mekong River. We seek to reduce the cost of transportation by improving rail connectivity across the region. Thailand will be the logistic hub because our population is huge in terms of its purchasing power compared to our neighbors. The main objective is integrating our own infrastructural development with the new Silk Road project that the Chinese are building. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Software Park support the local IT sector?</h4><p>Our missions are to develop human resources for professionals, support and foster new software companies, help companies that are already on the market to grow further and expand to new markets, and help companies adapt and use ICT. Software Park is a government organization and aims to be self-sustaining, with a source of revenue coming from renting space at a subsidized rate, training professionals, and working with other agencies that share the same goals. We are 85% financially self-sustainable, while the rest of our funding comes from the government.  In terms of our major achievements over the last two years, we provided workshop training and seminars to over 11,000 IT professionals, ranging from programmers to CIOs; we train for essentially all positions and tasks in a firm's IT and corporate structure. We incubated 55 new IT startups in 2014, and we have incubated an average of 45 new IT startups each year for the last 12 years. The companies we incubated went on to generate revenue of a little over THB550 million in 2015, which suggests that our incubation program is working. We did a survey two years ago to see how many of the incubated companies are still operating and found that about 48.5% have lasted after three years.</p><h4>What are the wider goals of Software Park?</h4><p>Thailand has a strong industrial base compared to other countries in the region. Many of those industries utilize software technologies at some level; hence, there is room to grow. There is a potential to export software technologies to other countries in ASEAN, especially to Myanmar and Indonesia. One challenge is the language; Thailand has its own alphabet. We are conservative in terms of language, and English is not as widely spoken outside major cities. People from neighboring countries have started to learn Thai, and Thai television programs are popular among CLMV. There is certainly potential to be an important regional hub player. We are good in adapting and applying technologies here, rather than break though technology innovation and producing disruptive technologies; that is our strength here for now. In Thailand, technologies are expanded from the manufacturing and enterprise markets into consumer market, but we are still at the early stage of this transition. E-commerce is the key in the digital economy for manufacturers and businesses to reach into the consumer market. </p><h4>How will the AEC affect your operations and the software sector in Thailand?</h4><p>The AEC is a major opportunity and represents a huge potential market for products and exports. Cross-border regulations need to be implemented, as all the members are still concerned about protecting themselves, and that is an issue. When more cross-border regulations and laws come into effect, the greater integration will be achieved. Hence, all industries and companies will benefit. People and talent could travel a lot more easily, going where the demand is, where the industry is, and the same would hold true for products and technologies. First, we need to break down barriers in order for the AEC to be a true economic community and for integration to be achieved in a meaningful way. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the Software Park in 2016?</h4><p>Despite many ideas, the challenge is finding high potential projects to incubate, because of the lack of market validation. We started a program to foster news ideas into highly marketable or investable prototyping by focusing on solution design thinking and market validation. This is to increase higher quality of deal flow into incubation program. We are also working with corporates on their innovation development leveraging new startups. This would benefit them in the long run, where they can access resources outside their organization to develop new, outside-the-box initiatives that could not otherwise be developed within the organization, in a much shorter time frame. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the Ministry of Science and Technology play in promoting innovation and start-ups across Thailand? </h4><p>Thailand has realized it needs to be strategic. We have to provide an ecosystem that is conducive to investment and develop Thailand as the gateway for manufacturing and trading with the region and beyond. Given that we have a number of competitive advantage factors, including our rich agricultural output, substantial human resources—a 70-million strong population—and strategic location, we are well positioned to make use of the growing opportunities in the region. Moving forward, innovation across all industries is vital for our growth, including manufacturing, start-ups, tourism, water management, and so on. In this sense, government policy and instruments are important in leading and facilitating innovation. For example, in the start-up movement, which is still relatively new in Thailand, the government will assist as much as possible this year and in 2017 before the private sector comes in. In April, we held the Start-up Thailand 2016 event, from which we realized we have potential scattered across our economy and the role of the government is to set up an ecosystem to help them launch and grow from an early age. We also work closely with the Ministry of Finance to introduce a number of fresh tax incentives for start-ups, and are in the process of establishing a start-up grant fund to fill in the gaps until the private sector moves in. </p><h4>What are the ministry's goals in terms of national spending on R&amp;D?</h4><p>Our current R&amp;D expenditure for 2015 is 0.48% of GDP; however, in 2016 we would like to almost double this to 0.8%, which is a significant jump. Personally, I will try to push this figure to 1% because statistically, most developed economies go beyond 1%. After 1%, this process becomes much easier and smoother; it has the momentum to also boost a country that borrows or copies others' technology into a country that protects its intellectual property. Having said that, we also recognize that we need to get the private sector to contribute 70% of the 1%; this is our policy, and we put in a great deal of effort to encourage and facilitate our private sector to invest. This can be done through taxation, where we have a scheme in which we provide 300% tax incentive for those companies who invest in research—anything that falls into the category of research, development, or innovation, and across all sectors. In the past, it was only R&amp;D but now we have expanded to include innovation as well. The target for the private sector is 70%, and we work with BOI, whose strategies and privilege offer the largest benefits to companies who do research and innovation. </p><h4>How would you categorize Thailand's international outlook from the ministry's perspective?</h4><p>The outlook is extremely bright. The countries that we met and discussed with did not talk about a trading partnership but about establishing a strategic partnership, which is important to us. We do not just deal with trading; we talk about how we can cooperate in the long run to ensure good mobility between the countries and healthy partnership in sectorial trade and industries. We look to boost our international cooperation, particularly in the fields of transportation infrastructure and digital connectivity as they are in line with the priorities of this government. However, each country has its specific characteristics and strategic interests for us. For example, in Russia, we focus primarily on collaborating on the space program or using nuclear for peace such as for medical and industrial goods. The Chinese, on the other hand, are keen to help us develop our start-ups and open labs, as well as issues such as food security. In every country that we visit, through collaboration in research and innovation, we can help our partner countries to expand to CLMV markets, and given the growth potentials in the region, this presents a huge opportunity to them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company expanded from distribution services into manufacturing cargo and catering trucks?</h4><p>As a seller of trucks in the northeast of Thailand, we figured that it was difficult to meet the needs of our customers because there were no factories offering cargo bodies in this region. Therefore, my father decided to offer the cargo body. When I was growing up in Thailand, cargo bodies were often just a wooden box or a basic steel body, sometimes even a small cement trailer. Today, we have developed a number of new products, catering to several industries and sectors around the world. To illustrate this, most of our exports are to the Middle East, specifically the UAE and Oman, and, more surprisingly, we serve airports. In Abu Dhabi and Dubai, for example, we supply 100% and 70% respectively of all catering trucks used at their international airports. The company manages these exports by itself, meaning we have to market ourselves in these markets. Furthermore, we export to the end user; we do not use a middle company. We also export to India, New Zealand, Australia, China, Korea, and across ASEAN, with several major airports using our products. And, of course, back to our roots in Thailand, where we serve all of the airports.</p><h4>What trends are you noticing in the local industrial engineering sector?</h4><p>In Thailand, it is difficult to say precisely, but an obvious global trend is that we are moving into a digital economy. Both the logistics and the industrial engineering sectors are becoming more digital, whereby the use of robotics and automation are crucial for everyday business practice. We have our small training center in the company where we train our people on how to utilize robotics and how to use the necessary software for manufacturing. We try to train and create our own people in-house. How digitalization will ultimately affect this complex industry remains to be seen, but it is certainly here and we know we have to be on-board.</p><h4>How do you think the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) will impact your company?</h4><p>In ASEAN, we will achieve a stronger position in the market because we have a history of exporting. We export all over the world, and we are good at it. We are international in our approach, which means we are ready for ASEAN; it will have a positive impact on us. Of course, there is a chance that other competitors will come into our area, but we will stay strong because we are well established. Singaporeans and Malaysians could outpace us, and then we will realize we need to move and keep our economy strong and competitive.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>In 2013, we decided on a 10-year growth strategy, 'Cho 2023.' It is important for the company to pool all of our ideas from across the management teams on how to do business and how to grow together. We have grown rapidly in recent years so it is therefore important to know where we are heading. We are listed on the stock exchange, have around 600 permanent staff, and in 2014 we recorded revenues of approximately THB1.5 billion. Without going into the details of what our internal strategy includes, we make sure to meet for seven days every three months, exchanging information and assessing the core competencies and weaknesses of the company. Continuing with this strategy for the fourth year and acquiring new clients and partners will be our aim for 2016. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the creation of SEP and how has the company evolved since you established the industrial park in 1992?</h4><p>To start at the beginning, with my industrial business background I recognized early on that Thailand had the potential to be the center of the region's growth, particularly in the industrial, logistics, and agricultural sectors. Looking broader, I saw that with our geographic location, there was potential to build an industrial park because we were near deep sea ports. We also have the opportunity to become a key hub across all of Asia. I have long worked in the industrial sector and have experience as the Chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, Samutprakarn Province, so with this background I established SEP to answer this growing potential. SEP is not the largest industrial park on the eastern seaboard, but from the very beginning we focused on providing an all-in-one service to our clients, from facilitating their manufacturing operations, aftersales services, and logistical support, to dealing with environmental issues, such as providing waste management and water supply solutions. Actually, on the last point, we have further developed our environmental management services by catering to our industrial park and beyond. However, with soaring demand in this area, and encouragement from the government to provide wastewater management in particular, we will be expanding this field at SEP and by next year hope to double our capacity to be able to serve more industries in Rayong and beyond. One final development to note about our core business line is that we are expanding SEP to our second phase; our new project is called Siam Green City. We are currently expanding our industrial park to a new location not far from our original base that sits on 320ha of land and will be able to accommodate new investors making use of the growing opportunities on Thailand's eastern seaboard.</p><h4>What are some of the key incentives that investors can expect if they establish their operations in SEP?</h4><p>There are many benefits, but the most important one is that our tenants are 100% exempt from corporate tax for a period of eight years, followed by 50% exemption for the next five years. This is the most important attraction for the foreign investor, but there are many others such as import tax breaks for machinery used for production of export products, and others that come with operating from a Zone 3 Board of Investment location, as we are at SEP. Aside from these tax benefits, our main pull factor lies in the full range of services that we offer. Not only do we provide the land and help our clients settle with all necessary logistical support, we provide consultation services, which are often crucial for companies investing in Thailand for the first time. Sometimes in many industrial parks there are labor relations problems; however, in our industrial park there have been no labor protests or demonstrations because of several mechanisms, like monthly HR club meetings; there are talks and there are very good relationships, so there are no hiccups in the operations of our tenants. We have some very reputable producers here at SEP, including Nippon Steel, Mitsubishi, and more. With a total of 37 factories in our first park, and over 40,000 workers here, it is important to make sure everything runs smoothly for all parties. Often in Thailand such industrial areas encounter labor concerns, or even protests, so we ensure that we regularly sit down with all parties and conduct HR consultations.</p><h4>With the government prioritizing the development of Thailand's eastern seaboard as the country's key industrial hub, how will such developments impact the future growth of the company?</h4><p>We see that the government is trying to improve and develop the eastern seaboard, and most importantly the infrastructure and logistics in the area, such as the new airport at U-Tapao and the deep sea port projects. We recognize that the government is serious about developing this region so we are establishing a new company, Siam Eastern Logistic Terminal, which will focus on developing our sea transportation with other countries as well as other regions. We are launching a new, breakthrough service called K-City; a sea port and high-speed ferry that will accommodate tourists, locals, and businesses in the region. We will connect three ports on the eastern, western and northern side of the Gulf of Thailand, a project which has never been done before and which will revolutionize travel and logistics in the region. Most importantly, it will cut transportation time and costs by between a half to two-thirds, which is crucial for investment in the region. Aside from this, we are growing and expanding in line with the government's plans, so the ongoing eastern seaboard development project will be extremely useful for the future growth of this country, and we are well positioned and excited to play an active role in this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	What have been some of the key recent achievements and landmarks of SPCG?
</h4><p>
	SPCG is a listed company on the Thai stock market in the energy sector. At the moment, we have 44 companies in the group, 36 of which are solar farms. We also cover the solar roof segment, which is considered a sunrise business so we expect to significantly expand this in Thailand in the coming years. We are the pioneer of the solar industry in this country and have to do the best we possibly can because we have banks, investors, and independent engineering companies monitoring our investments and construction. Since our first solar farm in Korat, we use Kyocera Corporation to supply all the solar module inverters from Germany, which is the best world-class design. We also partner with Kyocera Corporation to expand the solar roof business for residential and commercial customers. In the solar farm business, we expand our business into Japan and ASEAN countries, especially in Myanmar and the Philippines; they are our targets at the moment. We can make this business successful in Thailand, so then this might be the case in those countries as well; therefore, we want to expand the business in a way that we are the experts in solar energy.</p><h4>What are some of the notable trends in Thailand's renewable energy industry?</h4><p>
	In 2010, no one was interested in investing in the solar farm business. We opened up the market and business opportunities to a point where solar farms now play a key role in the country's energy mix. The government has set up a renewable energy development plan where it plans to have 6,000 MW of solar energy in this country within 20 years. There is a great opportunity if all the energy plans that the government wants to pursue within the next three or four years are realized. In terms of roofing, our society is at a stage where solar roofs will become increasingly popular and sustainable. I have been working in solar roofing for four years and this is the first time I see a real momentum of change. The Thai government is encouraged to install solar rooftops with various forms of benefits such as 100% on investments, where the user can draw 50% of the investment within three years' time from corporate income tax. There are many other tax benefits that help customers get their return on investment in less than eight years; which is a great investment opportunity. The warranty of solar models is 25 years, which means the product is often passed on to other generations.</p><h4>What will the AEC mean for your future expansion?</h4><p>
	If we look at the demographics in the region, we can clearly see the opportunities. In Myanmar there are 60 million people and in Thailand 67 million people. Energy consumption is 34,000 MW in Thailand and only 2,500 MW in Myanmar. This is an opportunity where you have to look at the short, medium, and long term. Myanmar has many things to offer; it is an interesting country with resources, gas, gems, great people who can speak English, great land, and great weather. If the country is well developed, it can attract many tourists. Now that Myanmar has opened up, there are many things that need to be developed and many Thai companies that are helping. There is a short-term vision where we can put 100 MW of solar in six months. This should be the first phase. In the Philippines, there are 100 million people and the Philippines and Thailand used to be similar in terms of economic growth; however, the Philippines lost out heavily due to the financial crisis, and today they consume only 15,000 MW. The government announced the first lot of 500 MW has been completed, with the second phase expected to generate up to 1,000 MW. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do you see for LNG in Thailand's future energy security?</h4><p>Today, Thailand imports LNG and LPG. LPG is used in every sector and every part of Thailand, be it households, transportation, or industrial use, and demand for LPG is increasing across the country, even though it is not increasing at the same rate as before. As for LNG, we import LNG and mix it with our own gas to produce electricity. This is part of our long-term electricity development plan in which we are trying to balance the portfolio so that LNG can play a larger role in the future.</p><h4>What role does the Middle East play in terms of Thailand's efforts to secure energy independence?</h4><p>Thailand and the Middle East have a longstanding relationship. As a net importer of energy, Thailand imports much of its oil and gas from the Middle East, mostly Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE. In terms of LNG, we mainly import from Qatar.</p><h4>How can Thailand and Qatar work together to develop renewable resources, and how can Thailand learn from Qatar's economy and use it as a model for energy independence?</h4><p>For the time being, Thailand and Qatar are not involved in any cooperation in terms of developing renewable energy resources. But Thailand is also committed to developing renewable energy technology, and in this regard we are probably number one in ASEAN, and in the top five in all of Asia. If Qatar were to want to undertake any partnerships or projects in renewable energy, Thailand would more than welcome the opportunity to work with them in this regard.</p><h4>What impact will Thailand's joining the ASEAN Economic Community have on the energy needs of Thailand?</h4><p>The ASEAN Economic Community is about connectivity, and Thailand is strategically placed in the heart of the ASEAN mainland, which means we could easily connect with neighboring countries' electricity power lines and grids, and also to natural gas pipelines. These kinds of connectivity mean that those resources can be optimized and that could bring these countries even closer together. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of Pfizer in Nigeria over the past five years?</h4><p>In the last few years, performance has been steady. It is still a growing organization and commercially we are doing well, slowly increasing the number of employees, the vast majority of which are Nigerians. We are developing local talent and empowering more women. Next year will be our 60th anniversary in Nigeria.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Nigerian market for Pfizer compared to the overall strategy that you have in Africa?</h4><p>There are two sides to it. The commercial side is obviously small compared to the US and Europe, but there is a commitment that quality medicines should be available around the world. At the same time, it is commercially significant because Sub-Saharan Africa is predicted to be the fastest-growing region for the next five to 10 years. On the corporate social responsibility side, we are relevant because everybody in the world needs medicines and Africa needs affordable medicines. We worked with the Lagos University Teaching hospital (LUTH) to set up its e-pharmacy. It involved the full computerization of the pharmacy department at LUTH. With this project, the patient flow system can begin to generate timely, reliable, and credible data useful for research purposes. Another example is our trachoma initiative, to help reduce the bacterial infection of the eye through surgery. Pfizer has treated over 15 million cases. We also established the Pfizer scholar awards program in support of medical education in Nigeria, to help and encourage students that excel in the areas of the pharmacy and medicine.</p><h4>How can mobile technologies change the way health is looked at in Nigeria?</h4><p>Approximately 70% of people in Nigeria have access to mobile phones. In my experience in China, I saw some doctors manage patients with chronic diseases through telephone and I see no reason why that cannot be replicated in Nigeria. In a largely rural country, telemedicine can also play a major role.</p><h4>What measures can you take to fight and protect the brand from counterfeit products?</h4><p>I supported the pharma group in the fight against anti-counterfeit the last time I was in Nigeria, as well as in Indonesia and Singapore. There is only so much we can do as a company; we must continue to collaborate with the government and other stakeholders through capacity building to identify counterfeit drugs and take appropriate action.</p><h4>With your international experience, how would you rate the industry regulatory framework in Nigeria?</h4><p>In terms of registering products, Nigeria is one of the fastest countries in registering new products; it takes about nine months, while in some other countries it can take three to five years to get a product through the system. Regarding regulating multi-national companies and pharmacies, there are organizations in place, but sometimes implementation fails. There is an informal pharmaceutical market in Nigeria. About 5,000 of them have legitimate licenses and perhaps twice as much as this have not. Beyond NAFDAC, there are organizations in Nigeria that are doing a lot of great work trying to close down such markets, like the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria. We will require a lot of more cooperation between regulatory agencies and relevant stakeholders in this area. </p><h4>How do you find a balance between philanthropy and business?</h4><p>Financial models have to change; we should be looking at smaller margins. The level of profit in Europe and the US is different from what we have here. A lot of companies can do a bit more if the government is prepared to do a lot more. We are here to do business, but we also believe that the environment would be better if people did not have chronic diseases. Prevention is key, and it has a high impact in our society, so we support a lot of preventive initiatives especially in the area of cardiovascular diseases. People who treat patients need knowledge, they need constant information, and they need to be up to date. We conduct training; this is one area we are investing in. Pfizer is one of the best in this area because we work with not only doctors but also pharmacists. We have the Pharmacy Academy, we hold cardio vascular summits, and through our online medical information we give doctors and pharmacists opportunities to know a lot more about our medicines. If we are able to train and improve the knowledge of those who treat patients, we would also have contributed a lot in terms of healthcare in Nigeria. We are now doing a lot more with retail pharmacies in terms of training, because the reality is that some patients go to pharmacies and buy their medicines.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did SCS evolve to become the key service provider on cyber security to the Malaysian defense industry?</h4><p>While I was working in the R&amp;D division of Sapura, we often received requests from the Ministry of Defense on matters of command and control (C2) and electronic warfare. The Malaysian Authorities at that time had purchased a military command, control and intelligence system (C3I) from the British and there was little expertise within the military to oversee the implementation of the system. To deliver the proper support on this project, we decided to form a dedicated company and in 1993 established as Sapura Consultancy Services, which we later rebranded as SCS. We started our operations with six consultants and developed rapidly from there. The government was keen on purchasing new technology, but needed technical advice and experts to maintain these complicated systems—the military alone did not have the capabilities to do so. The British could do it; however, the idea was to localize these services as having foreigners around our strategic defense infrastructure would present an unnecessary security risk. That is how we became the maintenance provider of these systems. Prior to 2000, we did a major software upgrade and, in conjunction with the Y2K compliance upgrade, we revamped the systems at the Ministry of Defense across the board and have been maintaining them ever since. We have 25 offices servicing 90 sites all over the country, as the service level agreement (SLA) that we signed with the military requires us respond within two hours whenever repairs are needed. Software and hardware are not static systems and continued maintenance is of pivotal importance to ensure the continued reliable service.</p><h4>Would you also say that the security threats have changed?</h4><p>Security threats change all the time. You can be an expert in one system and educate yourself on all the available hacking tools; however, once a new system arrives or gets upgraded overnight, you are back where you started—imagine the consequences for the military. We need to maintain continued awareness of global developments in cyber security and electronic warfare. We train and provide technology updates and awareness to around 2,000 military staff each year to monitor the situation. In addition, we now offer our services to the national police and several town councils to enhance their public services and cyber security measures.</p><h4>Do you see an increase in demand for these services by private clients?</h4><p>Awareness is increasing, though, unfortunately, not fast enough, as cyber security is a big threat to the whole wellbeing of businesses. There is no such thing as a free lunch—be careful when you get one. In the present day and age, technology like Facebook and WhatsApp are available for free, although it costs billions to set up the infrastructure and keep all the servers running. Without having vast assets, Facebook sold for USD25 billion, which demonstrates how much data is worth these days. Commercial organizations that have valuable information should be aware of the power and the privacy risks, as the tools to break into this data have become much more advanced.</p><h4>Can your services be exported to other countries?</h4><p>It is not possible to export the whole system, as it then becomes a Malaysian system abroad and often governments prefer to localize these security operations—like we did here as well. Nonetheless, certain technologies that we have developed are exportable and we run our advisory services abroad. SCS has become a reference point for C2 and cyber security in many regions.</p><h4>What are your activities in the non-defense domain?</h4><p>Our mainstay, about 90% of our business, is in defense and in Malaysia. We plan to expand in non-defense industries like Light Rail Transit (LRT), because these systems have technical support systems through which we can bring in our expertise in software management. We have vast experience in supplying the control system for the country's electricity grid company Tenaga Nasional, and KTM, which is a key player in keeping the trains rolling. We are a service provider to KTM, LRT, and MRT, and in this regard have a track record in providing technology and servicing these systems. Infrastructure in rail transport has to last at least 30 years, and during such a lifecycle, software needs to be upgraded multiple times. It is always better to have a local company be involved in the computer system servicing, someone who can deal with problems within a two-hour timeframe.</p><h4>Do you have any interaction with international companies, such as British BAE Systems, that also operate in the field of cyber security?</h4><p>In my position as board member of MIGHT, we have visited BAE Systems and its setup here impressed us. It is inspiring that it is running its global operations from Malaysia. Everyone has its own security niche and each country has its own demands. BAE Systems works closely with the British Ministry of Defense, which means its services abroad are different by default.</p><h4>How do you envision Malaysia's future in developing domestic skills in infrastructure?</h4><p>The government has decided on large investments in infrastructure between 2010 and 2020; a total of around MYR100 billion is on the table. Many projects, like the LRT and the MRT extension plans, are currently under development and will significantly enhance the accessibility of the city center. The issue, then, is that these large projects are often awarded to foreign players, often large Chinese state consortiums that bring less value to the local economy as they bring their own workforce, materials, and refinancing institutions. We would like to see our own manufacturing industry take a share of these projects. Our rail industry is not up to the level where we can fully compete; however, we should be part of the supply chain. Offset is key in such public investments. If you allocate such large amounts of public funds, there should be some return in the local economy. Instead of awarding the contract to a party that offers a 20% discount, we would rather pay 20% more and see the surplus churn around our own industry. We can learn from the Koreans as their F-16s are locally assembled, or from the Japanese, who build their engines. In the west, it is also common to have a national industrial agenda. We should become more vocal about this and structure the future tender packages better to include the churn factor. Of course, our industry needs to catch up and be capable of taking on the task. In addition, the after-sales element is pivotal—there should be agreements on servicing as well. The foreign party will not stay around for 40 years to do the MRO, which is why you need to be involved from the very beginning.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which macroeconomic factors will be crucial to realizing the ministry's goals of having exports grow by 5% in 2016?</h4><p>The economic situation for 2016 is not bright. We are still in a fragile environment regarding oil prices. The Thai economy depends heavily on exports and over 60% of our exports are goods. However, when looking at exports, we not only look at goods, because our economy is broad. We also export services, which is a growing segment. We are now looking at a two-pronged approach for our exports. The growing market in the region is the reason why we aim for 5%, in particular, with ASEAN countries, because 2016 is when we launch the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), which has the potential to boost the Thai economy. We are in the heart of ASEAN, especially on the mainland, which is significant. We have those two countries with populations of over 1 billion each. Although China's economy is slowing down, it still remains a growth area for us. This is because according to our strategy, not only will we look at these countries as a whole, we will also dig deep into their major cities. When talking about the AEC, Thailand is in a strategic location with unrivalled access to the booming Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam (CLMV) markets. In 2016, we will have an important road and rail link to China through Laos and Thailand. Another two important links will go from Vietnam to Myanmar and also from Thailand through Myanmar to India. These are important aspects when we analyze the future prospects for Thailand.</p><h4>How can the ministry help exporters establish themselves in both well-established and emerging markets?</h4><p>Emerging markets are particularly important for us. We have to separate the two types of markets and look specifically at how we bring people into new emerging markets. For example, I returned from a trip to Iran and Oman. Oman is a small country, but is a member of the emerging GCC bloc and can be a link to East African countries, while Iran has just opened up following decades-long sanctions. Iran is a large market and could also be a link to the CIS. Even large businesses in Thailand do not have the know-how to access such markets, especially Iran. On our trip, we found that both sides are just as enthusiastic about each other. Iran is seeking partnerships, and Thailand is a good fit in that sense. This is the time to bring our businesses to new emerging economies. We still have to continue with traditional markets in the US and the EU, although the EU is slowing down. There are also niche markets, where we try to adapt our business, products, and services to suit each market. </p><h4>With many agreements and FTAs, does Thailand need the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)?</h4><p>It does not hurt to be part of this agreement. We are examining the TPP in detail because Thailand is, of course, part of the production chain and it would help for us to remain in this chain. However, as a new member we know the 12 original members will ask Thailand what they can get from us. If the price is too high then we cannot enter; however, we hope we can receive support from our friends in the TPP and learn from them, for example, Vietnam and Malaysia, whose level of development is similar to ours. We can learn how they adapted and prepared themselves to be part of that huge agreement. It is important to be part of the TPP as a trading partner. Even though we are not part of the agreement, we are a trading nation in a trading world. We have new investment opportunities, such as in high technology and R&amp;D, with which we attract foreign investment into Thailand. In that sense, we have been moving up the scale, even though we are not a member of the TPP. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[strengthening-the-market]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is behind Bangkok Insurance's strategy to diversify more into the non-motor segment?</h4><p>We are working to increase business in personal lines segment. Traditionally, we have emphasized commercial lines. Over the past five or six years, we have been trying to gain more share in personal lines. That is an area where the market is much bigger and the growth potential is sharper. Currently, commercial insurance products have limited growth potential, especially when the economy is in a bad shape. Whereas for our personal lines, we have a number of products, including fire, health, personal accidents, and, of course, motor—everything except life. In the motor segment, the margins are currently low in comparison to other areas. There has been no growth in the last two years in motor because the demand has dropped a lot. First-time buyers contributed to a lot of the growth two or three years ago, and right now we are witnessing a downward trend, which is why we are hopeful of boosting non-motor segment while focusing on personal products.</p><h4>How is this decline in the automotive sector affecting the overall insurance market?</h4><p>Over the last two years, especially in motor where there is no growth, there have been a lot of companies that are struggling to gain clients. As such, the sector has been experiencing a price war in a bid to secure new premiums. Therefore, Bangkok Insurance is trying to boost other segments of its portfolio, while also being innovative with the motor products it offers. For example, we hope to put more emphasis on female drivers, or to calculate premiums according to distance travelled. We install telemetric systems at the request of the customer and it measures how much they travel and where they go. The less they travel, the less premium we will charge them. Now, we are looking at regional factors, i.e. which part of the country has the fewest accidents. Certain parts of the country are better than others, so we are hoping to reflect our rates in those areas.</p><h4>Do you feel the AEC opening will provide opportunities to move into the region?</h4><p>It's not as simple as that. Every country has different requirements in order to do business, such as setting up a representative office and entering the business with a certain amount of capital. Myanmar announced a year ago that foreign-owned companies are allowed to open in Myanmar on the condition that they have market capitalization of USD50 million. This is more than the premiums of companies, which makes it difficult for insurance firms to expand there. However, for example in Cambodia the required capital is USD7 million, which makes it much easier. We have had operations in Cambodia for about 10 years and in Laos for four or five. We have also had about 25 years in Indonesia and 15 years in the Philippines. All of our operations overseas are joint ventures with local partners. We do not have anything in Malaysia or Singapore, as they require high capitalization. Nonetheless, it is possible that the AEC will encourage these markets to relax their regulations. This will depend on how the local companies operate; if they do a good job and expand reasonably well, they will be able to compete with the foreign firms.</p><h4>What changes are you expecting for the Thai insurance market in the coming years?</h4><p>There is a law being discussed by the parliament to raise the minimum capital requirement from THB30 million to THB500 million over the next five years by gradually increasing the requirement, which will end up reducing the number of companies in the market. At the moment, we have 60 non-life insurance companies, which is a lot for a small market like Thailand. Malaysia is much bigger and has about 20 companies and Singapore only has about 15. Especially if you are going to allow foreigners to open companies freely, you need strong local companies to compete with the foreigners. The only way you can strengthen the local market is to have fewer, but stronger companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the creation of Aira Capital?</h4><p>About 18 years ago, the economic situation in Thailand was quite poor due to the financial crash that hit the region. Aira Capital was born as a financial advisor and later evolved to take over the license for securities. After that, we saw our business was growing from strength to strength. The factoring business in Thailand is interesting, because it goes together with the SME sector; therefore, we purchased a company in this field from Central Group, which is listed on the stock exchange as Aira Factoring. Later, we met with Japanese group AIFUL, and after two years of discussion we formulated a plan to expand into consumer finance, after which we initiated a joint venture. The venture started in November 2014, and now we have opened companies, accounts, and produced new products. One of our new products is called “A Money" and has paid-up capital of THB1 billion.</p><h4>How has your performance evolved with the introduction of new products?</h4><p>We always want to know the requirements of our customer in advance so that we can set up products to serve their needs. Staying in Thailand is not easy because there is political and economic uncertainty; hence, we have to learn how to survive by ourselves by managing the crisis. We believe that the situation in our country right now is quite smooth. After the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance announced public expenditure for 2016, the future is bright. The cash inflow of the country is moving a great deal at this moment. This is evident in the financial sector. In early 2015, the minister announced this process, and now it is growing and showing a lot of potential. In 2016, with transport projects increasing and other financial or industrial hub developments being launched, the local government is planning a concept similar to China's “new normal." It is not necessary to have fast growth, but the fundamentals should be strong.</p><h4>What would you advise an investor looking to come to Thailand?</h4><p>One good thing to think is that, even during crises in Thailand, the capital reserves are strong, which means the economy is able to absorb any shock and ensure the stock exchange is stable. We all have something outside the economy; therefore, you will see that the stock exchange of Thailand is still stable. The economy is forecast to grow by around 3% in 2016. This is in line with global GDP growth. We passed the worst-case scenario so we expect the economy should grow now. The bottom line was around 1997, and since then the fundamentals of the economy have changed. At that time, we did not have major infrastructure projects such as the BTS Skytrain or the underground, both in Bangkok. In the past, companies had to pay 30% tax; however, now we pay 20%. There have been major developments in the telecoms sector also, with the bidding for 4G completed in late 2015. Emerging markets such as Thailand have the possibility to achieve the high growth rates we witnessed in the past. For that reason, I would advise investors to look closely at Thailand and explore the sector-wide opportunities.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the company in 2016?</h4><p>We have a plan to purchase a joint venture in another three or four businesses. The first one, which is almost complete, is a leasing business. We will start construction in the middle of 2016 in a prime area of Bangkok. We have another company, Aira Property that will manage the project through a joint venture which itself will be listed on the stock exchange. Over the next four years, we have a plan to purchase another four buildings in Thailand. We will purchase existing buildings that have aged about 10 years and have current occupancy averages of 50-60%; we will renovate them over 10-12 months and then rent them out again. With the AEC opening in the beginning of 2016; anyone that wants to invest in Thailand or in the Southeast Asian region will be attracted to Bangkok due to the great inner-city infrastructure and the planned high-speed rail being built. Therefore, if you want to invest in Myanmar, your head office should be in Bangkok. It is possible for Thailand to become the hub for the region. There is a new plan to get all the headquarters of the companies in the region to set up in Bangkok. The government is launching new projects for this, such as tax relief for about eight years if you set up a head office here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the goals behind the establishment of the SEC in 1992?</h4><p>The establishment of the SEC was a landmark development because it was the first time we had an independent organization exclusively take care of Thailand's capital markets. The way in which our commission is structured is quite a departure from normal government administrations in the sense that we tried to have a combination of private-sector representatives and government officials on our board. It was with the view that capital markets are dynamic and we need to be able to keep up with all the changes and developments that can come from all sides. Over the years, we have tried to remain close to the private sector to understand the landscape of where we are going and also react to the changing environment throughout this period, both good and bad.</p><h4>What are some of the biggest challenges in ensuring an efficient and transparent capital market in Thailand?</h4><p>One of the biggest challenges is promoting effective corporate governance practices in the market. Linking back to the view by many financial analysts that the 1997 financial crisis started in Thailand, the crisis had its roots in the failure of corporate governance, particularly in the financial sector. That is one area in which we are doing plenty of reforms on many fronts. One of the most successful developments has been the creation of the Thai Institute of Directors, which helps develop the professional knowledge and skills necessary for directors of listed companies. It is important to universalize standards and get people to understand what corporate governance is. There have also been many rules, laws, and regulations put in place; for example, the requirements on independent directors, related party transactions, disclosure, and accounting standards. We have come a long way in creating awareness and the practice of corporate governance. Under the ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard initiative, for example, last year, out of the top-50 companies that achieved the highest rankings across ASEAN, Thailand had 23 companies there and two were among the top five. It is an achievement we are proud of. Now the key issue is moving from basic corporate governance to issues such as ESG and anti-corruption, which we also play a major part in. We have Anti-corruption Progress Indicators initiative to encourage listed companies to put in place serious anti-corruption measures, and so far we think there has been satisfactory improvement in this area. Another big challenge for Thai capital market deals with the investment side. As types of financial products offered in Thailand are still quite limited, we are working to allow investments in things like hedge funds, high-yield bond funds, and leverage funds, so investors will have greater choice for their investments.</p><h4>What are the challenges from a regulatory point of view regarding AEC?</h4><p>The AEC is not yet a single market nor is it aiming to be: It is not the EU. It is more of a loose form of cooperation whereby we try to have more harmonized rules and regulations. But we will not have one set of rules and regulations issued by a central authority that covers everyone. We are not talking about single currencies, visas, or passports. It involves cooperation in trying to promote ourselves as one community to the world rather than a single platform: That is the key difference. However, Thailand's positioning in the neighboring countries—Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam—should be noted. Vietnam has already grown at a rapid pace, but for the other three, there are quite a few challenges to tackle for further capital market development. At the same time, all these countries need a great deal of funding as they look to the future. Things like infrastructure funds will likely play a strong role both domestically and regionally. I think this will be one of the key issues for people to keep track of. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[reinforcing-confidence]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Confidence in the Lebanese economy and pound is relatively resilient despite a challenging external environment. What factors are behind this confidence?</h4><p><span></span>Confidence in the Lebanese economy is threefold. First and foremost, exchange rate stability has been the anchor of financial stability in Lebanon since the late 1990s. This fact has been manifested in the systematic decrease of the dollarization rates of deposits and loans for the past two decades. Trust in the Lebanese pound is thus higher than ever and has in turn reinforced confidence in the economy as a whole. Second, the historical accumulation of a large stock of foreign currency assets has shielded the Lebanese economy against major political, security, and economic shocks. Banque du Liban's foreign assets increased from around USD3 billion in 1993 to around USD37 billion today, and this is not even including gold reserves which at July 2016 market prices were estimated to be more than USD12 billion. Finally, the large remittances from the Lebanese Diaspora have been the backbone of the Lebanese economy for several years. They have helped in adjusting sizable current account deficits and have supported the multiplication of bank deposits to the point where they represent three times the size of the Lebanese economy. According to the World Bank, total remittances were estimated at around USD7.2 billion in 2015, making Lebanon the 16th largest recipient of remittances globally and the second largest among Arab countries.</p><h4>Banque du Liban has been the main promoter of entrepreneurial activities in the knowledge-based economy. How would you assess the level of response to these initiatives and what are the prospects for this segment to become a flagship economic sector in the near future?</h4><p>The idea to inject money into this sector came about when we recognized the significance that the knowledge economy had and the potential it could bring to develop the national economy. In order to capitalize the sector, we decided to increase banks' investment possibilities in this sector from 3-4% coming out from their own capital.  Three years on from the emission of Circular 331, we have seen palpable results through the growing number of startups attracted and benefiting from this equity-financing scheme. To date, banks have committed more than USD300 million, with capital value of more than USD700 million. The ecosystem as a whole is systematically growing, increasing its ability to cater to the various types of sectors the knowledge economy is revolutionizing. Human capital has always been, and will remain, the main driver of the Lebanese economy, so our prospects for the future of the ecosystem are rather promising. Lebanon is effectively witnessing its highly qualified youth pushing the limits of innovation and creativity to the next level. The knowledge economy is thus undoubtedly one of the fundamental sources of inclusive growth for Lebanon's medium to long-term outlook, in addition to the financial and the oil and gas sectors. </p><h4>Banque du Liban recently launched a new circular to stimulate the real estate sector. How will this stimulus contribute to revitalize the real estate industry?</h4><p>Until recently, the real estate sector was a rising star in the Lebanese economy with ambitious and extensive projects all across the territory. The economic complexities posed a threat to the industry and the sector lost its impetus, so in June 2016 we decided to issue Circular 427 with the aim of stimulating the real estate sector. This incentive scheme allows Lebanese banks and financial institutions to offer credit facilities of up to 60% to real estate companies, so they can acquire built properties with the purpose of selling them at a later stage, subject to specific conditions. This new scheme will not only benefit real estate developers, but the entire supply chain in this industry.  By stimulating the sector we aim to increase our GDP.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can banks try to encourage more digitalization and technological innovation in the banking sector?</h4><p>Such a change is not just up to banks but must also involve the private sector and the government as well. One of our initiatives in our five-year plan is digital banking, which we are working closely with the government for. This would help digitalize SMEs, promote more online banking, support e-commerce and e-government, promote payment procedures both nationally and internationally, and encourage other banking practices.</p><h4>Many banks have been looking to expand in the region. How has the AEC benefited the process of expansion for Thai banks internationally?</h4><p>Thai banks are growing, not just in Thailand but internationally as well, although not as fast as banks in other ASEAN countries. Our main purpose is to support them in these efforts and to expand into new markets and regions. The AEC will help open these markets in ASEAN through the Qualified ASEAN Bank (QAB). That being said, Thai banks have already set up branches overseas, in Cambodia and Laos mainly. Thus far it has been difficult for Thai banks to penetrate other markets, particularly in the retail segment. That may change now thanks to mobile banking and e-banking practices and technologies. It would have been hard in the past as it was necessary to be there physically on the ground, but now and in the near future we expect more Thai banks to offer their services across the border. Looking further afield, we support Thai banks' expansion into any and all markets and try to facilitate that process, regardless of the region, whether it is Latin America, Asia, Europe, or Africa.</p><h4>In terms of ease of doing business in Thailand, what role can the TBA play in improving Thailand's ranking worldwide?</h4><p>I do not think banking services play a major role in that ranking. In terms of how we can facilitate ease of doing business, in the AEC and ASEAN we look into policies that ensure we have a more convenient and efficient way of doing business and conducting transactions between AEC and ASEAN countries. We set up the ASEAN Payment Network as part of this initiative, for example. This will make it easier to use credit cards and bankcards for payments in other countries, ease foreign currency exchanges, and also increase online transactions and e-commerce opportunities. Regulators have also supported new investment tools and procedures that will make the exchange rate more competitive through various exchange and swap arrangements with foreign countries like China and Malaysia.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the banking sector in the long and medium term in Thailand?</h4><p>As part of our five-year plan, we are trying to make the banking system in Thailand more efficient by reducing unnecessary costs and procedures and barriers in the system. The Thai system is now sound, with a healthy financial ratio. The payment system in Thailand has not changed greatly. One thing we need to address is the predominance of cash payments in transactions, which make up to 80% of all transactions. We want to bring that down to at least 50%, which will help reduce costs in the Thai banking system. Banks also need to cooperate more and work closely together to help achieve these goals. We also look at helping Thai banks expand into other countries, especially neighboring countries. As for any major activities at the domestic level, regulations are tight to open a bank in Thailand, but we may indeed see mergers in the future. Expansion will ultimately be driven by customer needs and demand. Right now we have 15 member banks, and it remains to be seen whether more are needed, but I am also sure the QAB will bring in more banks to Thailand. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Healthy Levels]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[healthy-levels]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>We started off this year with heightened volatility in the global financial markets, mainly due to concerns over China's economic slowdown, declining oil and commodity prices, and monetary policy divergence among major central banks.</p><p>Amid the fragile global financial climate, the Thai financial markets have been relatively resilient compared to those of other emerging markets, thanks to Thailand's strong external position. The current account position last year registered a surplus of 9% of GDP, and is projected to remain at that level in 2016. Our international reserves have been at a healthy level, standing at around three times of the short-term external debt and 1.3 times the total external debt. Foreign holdings of the Thai government and Bank of Thailand bonds outstanding are less than 9%, compared with more than 30% in some other emerging markets in the region. External debt of the corporate sector has been relatively low and mostly belongs to large companies, which manage their exchange rate risk sufficiently well.</p><p>In 2016, the Thai economy is projected to gradually recover, driven mainly by government spending and the tourism sector. In addition, the Thai economy has benefited from expanding investment in certain sectors, notably those related to telecommunication and alternative energy. Exports of goods to CLMV countries, which now account for around 10% of our total exports, have supported economic growth and have potential to grow further, despite a recent slowdown due to transitory factors. On the other hand, amid fragile and gradual global economic recovery, exports of goods and private consumption remain subdued. Against the backdrop of low inflationary pressure, monetary policy will remain accommodative to support Thai economic recovery.<br>In the longer term, as the Thai economy is in need to upgrade growth potentials and increase competitiveness, the Bank of Thailand will contribute to this process of economic transformation by taking a proactive role in financial sector development policy.</p><p>Under the Financial Sector Development Plan Phase 3, our motto is to promote a “competitive, inclusive, connected, and sustainable" financial system. After five years, the Bank of Thailand expects to see growing financial innovation with more diverse players, both banks and non-banks, especially those offering digital financial services. These services will allow a new segment of customers to gain access to financial services through new channels. SMEs and entrepreneurs, for example, could pitch their ideas to a wider group of investors through crowd funding and peer-to-peer lending platforms.</p><p>On the road to enhancing regional connectivity, under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework, we encourage banks to further extend their regional presence to support expanding economic activities, or to use Thailand as a springboard to expand their business in regional countries, leveraging Thailand's established legal framework, financing facility, infrastructure, logistics, and IT capability.</p><p>Another plan we are working on is the Payment Systems Roadmap. The plan is aimed at promoting safe and efficient electronic payment services with new technologies and innovation, with a view to reducing transaction costs, improving governance standards, and being supportive of expanding economic activities. In particular, integrated payment channels, such as mobile phones, internet, debit and credit cards, and e-money along with a competitive fee structure, will support e-Commerce/m-Commerce and benefit both businesses and consumers alike.</p><p>The last area is the plan to deepen Thailand's financial markets by allowing greater flexibility and diversification in products and services offered to residents and non-residents and to support the growth and development of the Thai economy. So far, a number of regulations on foreign-exchange management have been relaxed for greater flexibility and lower transaction costs, and we plan to further relax foreign-exchange regulations this year.<br></p><p>In essence, the Bank of Thailand is committed to creating financial infrastructure and nurturing the financial eco-system to help lift up growth potentials of the Thai economy. We aim to promote financial innovation, financial inclusion, and financial literacy as strong foundations for sustainable economic development.* </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has transport in Thailand changed since you served as the country's Minister of Transport?</h4><p>Our country is going in the right direction. This year we started to establish the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), and Thailand is perfectly situated at the center of it all. If we can link the AEC with Thailand as a central hub, it would be good for our economy, good for investment, and especially good for tourism. This is why the government is pushing for a large transportation upgrade. For example, we will have a high-speed train from Bangkok to Hua Hin and Bangkok to Rayong, which is an important industrial zone and export base, and also close to Pattaya, a top tourist destination. It is important to have this link between the industrial and tourism zones. Other than these two high-speed trains, the government has invested in double tracks that are expected to shorten travel time. The government has started taking bids for the double track train from Bangkok to Hua Hin and many other places. This is the start of expansion by double track and high-speed train. We have started to develop the motorway from Bangkok to Korat to link Bangkok to the northeast of Thailand by motorway. We will also have a motorway from Bangkok to Kanchanaburi, which will link Thailand to Myanmar—a route that did not exist before.</p><h4>What are some of the major trends in Thailand's tourism industry?</h4><p>When we look to develop our country, we have to see where our strengths lie. Thailand's advantage is its agriculture and tourism potential. When foreigners think of tourism in this region, they think of Thailand: the food, the culture, the beaches, the malls, the hospitality, the Muay Thai. Our economy may not be great right now, but tourism is our strength. This year we expect a record 30 million visitors up from 25 million last year. More importantly, once the AEC becomes better established and really kicks off, Thailand's central position will open up more opportunities to attract holidaymakers from across the region. We have every kind of infrastructure to accommodate guests. Furthermore, with low oil prices, the cost of traveling is becoming cheaper and many low-cost airlines are springing up, offering routes to places that were never served in the past. These airlines create a platform to open new tourism hotspots; a new roadmap. We have Bangkok, Pattaya, Phuket, Koh Samui, Hua Hin, and Chiang Mai, but now low-cost airlines can bring tourists to new, hidden places in Thailand, especially in the northeast.</p><h4>As former Deputy Prime Minister of the country, how would you say Thailand's reputation has grown in the world?</h4><p>We are now starting to reform our country. We are going to have new construction and it seems that the government is keen to reform our economy sector-by-sector. As we have begun to reform our laws and regulations, we will accommodate business much faster and better for people looking to invest. That will give investors more confidence, and this has to be our priority. Whilst Thailand is economically strong and sustainable already, we need to improve our efficiency and ensure we implement the necessary upgrades across all sectors of the economy. The first step is to focus on infrastructure to make use of the regional connectivity and ensure we are the logistics hub of ASEAN. Simultaneously, we have to continue developing our business culture and attracting the right types of investments. If we achieve this in the coming years, Thailand will be a country that really stands out, which is open for investment, which you can rely on. However, we cannot stand alone; we need connectivity, and not only amongst our neighbors, but also with the world. We have realized this and are going further afield, establishing new partnerships and trading deals with markets that we never had much access to previously. This is our strategy to grow in the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What benefits would Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) membership bring to the Thai economy and US firms operating here?</h4><p>The TPP is more than just a free trade agreement; it includes many important elements such as requirements over labor rights, human rights, the environment, and other social issues. Assuming the ratification process of the various countries sail through, Thailand stands to lose considerably by not signing up—a significant volume of Thailand's exports go to TPP-member countries. If Thailand were on the outside of such an agreement, it could put local manufacturers and Thai companies at a potential disadvantage in trading compared to others in TPP member states. AMCHAM certainly believes it would be beneficial for Thailand if it joined the TPP, and it would also be beneficial for US companies investing here. US businesses have invested significant amounts of money in Thailand—we estimate about USD50 billion, creating approximately a quarter of a million jobs locally.</p><h4>How has AMCHAM helped facilitate US investment into Thailand?</h4><p>AMCHAM provides comprehensive advice and guidance to US businesses that express an interest in Thailand. We also provide connectivity between the Thai and US governments, as well as a network of established US businesses here. In 2015, AMCHAM held over 330 events for our members. Many of these events were organized by AMCHAM's over 25 committees, which cover various business sectors such as auto, energy, healthcare, travel and tourism, food and agriculture, and ICT, as well as special interest areas ranging from legal, to marketing, to community engagement. Companies can sign up to learn more, and use these events as a way to build their networks, seek assistance, share opinions, and try to lobby the Thai or US governments for greater support. There are many issues that are common among all foreign investors in Thailand, and AMCHAM coordinates with the JFCCT and other Chambers on these issues too. Examples of such issues on which we collaborate include things like intellectual property rights, customs, data privacy, and visas/work permits. AMCHAM is strongly supported by its over 800 member companies and is a well-funded chamber. It uses its resources to contribute to the local community, and to try to find ways to improve the Thai economy, and in so doing the investment prospects for US businesses.</p><h4>How important is the corporate segment of Citibank's services in Thailand?</h4><p>Our business is evenly split between our institutional and consumer businesses. In terms of our institutional business, we support government and quasi-government entities, top-tier local corporates, and local multinationals. Citi's competitive advantage is the fact that we can support our clients directly across 160 countries around the world. We are physically present with on-shore banking resources in 101 countries, so we can connect our clients seamlessly on a global basis in a way other banks cannot, even those deemed to be “global." It would be impossible in today's regulatory environment to build the type of network that Citi has. Naturally, that leads us to the types of clients that will have operations in multiple countries. We are unlikely to be the best bank for you if you only operate in one country. For instance, we are the global cash management bank for Thai Airways; we support it across the over 40 countries in which it has a presence. We support a number of top local Thai companies with their business around the world with advisory services, funding and liquidity, foreign exchange, hedging, and other services. We do the same for global multinationals that are based here in Thailand. But our institutional business has synergies with our consumer business, too. The key decision makers at our corporate clients also tend to be globally minded high net worth individuals who benefit from our wealth management and premium card services, as well as our ability to connect retail clients through our online and mobile technology to Citi accounts around the world. And if companies are with one of our multinational clients moving to Thailand, we can set them up seamlessly with consumer banking services here and avoid the hassle of sorting out personal financial affairs when moving to a new country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bangkok Bank is the top commercial bank in Thailand. How would you describe your customer base and services range? </h4><p>Although we are particularly strong in corporate, SME, and international banking, we are an integrated financial services provider, operating across all customer segments and reaching all levels of Thai society. Our full range of services includes deposit taking, business and consumer credit extension, trade finance, project finance, loan syndication, debt securities underwriting, custodial services, capital market, and advisory services. We also provide investment and brokerage services through our subsidiaries BBL Asset Management and Bualuang Securities. Our customers benefit from the complementary synergies between our international, corporate, investment, business, and personal-banking services, provided through both physical premises and digital channels tailored to their needs. </p><h4>What does ASEAN economic integration mean for your bank?</h4><p>Since opening our first overseas branch in Hong Kong in 1954, we have grown with our customers' business overseas and now operate in 32 international locations in 15 economies worldwide. These include wholly owned, local subsidiary banks in China and Malaysia, which have organically grown. We support overseas Chinese business communities and Thai customers internationally, as well as local customers that invest and conduct business in their home countries and elsewhere. Our particular strengths are in Southeast Asia and greater China; however, we also have branches in the major financial centers of New York, London, and Tokyo. In the last 62 years of our international banking operations, we have come to know the countries covered by our network well; we understand their cultural differences and help to build bridges between clients and the private and public sectors. The formation of the AEC at the end of 2015 provides us with even greater opportunities to connect businesses and investors across the region, as well as support investors coming into Southeast Asia from other parts of the world. While we have no immediate plans to open new international branches, future expansion will reflect the needs of our customers, which we monitor closely at all times.  </p><h4>You are the first Thai bank, and one of the first international banks, to have received a banking license for Myanmar. What are your objectives in this country?</h4><p>We are grateful for the opportunity to contribute to Myanmar's economic development by providing financial services for the benefit of its people, supporting the country and local banks in developing the financial sector. By sharing our expertise with domestic banks in areas such as credit assessment, risk management, and product innovation and cultivating long-term customer relationships, we can help strengthen Myanmar's entrepreneurial sector. Over the long run—as our experience in Thailand has shown—the emergence of a vibrant entrepreneurial base is the key to successful economic development. As a long-term partner, we have supported trade flows and FDI to Myanmar for many years, especially from Thailand, and we expect these to benefit further from having a branch in place. For our customers in Thailand and elsewhere, the new branch has enabled us to offer corporate banking products and services to those interested in investing or doing business in Myanmar, as well as supporting local entrepreneurs in their business endeavors.</p><h4>How does fintech and digital banking factor into your vision for the future of the bank? </h4><p>Crucially, we place a great deal of emphasis on digital banking, which we see as the future of the industry. Our award-winning mobile banking service is a key example. By providing a service that is secure, fast, and convenient for customers, we encourage them to adopt digital channels in support of the government's policy to reduce the reliance on cash and encourage electronic payments. The successful implementation of the government's National E-Payment Master Plan is expected to reduce the level of cash transactions, increase the efficiency of the payment infrastructure, improve business competitiveness, and promote financial inclusion. Bangkok Bank aims to be at the forefront of this significant change. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which sectors will your investment strategy look to focus on?</h4><p>As a holding group, we previously came out of a financial brokerage and thus have investments in a securities brokerage firm and an asset management firm in our portfolio. We would like to keep these investments and consider them good revenue generating assets. We will continue to run these and maximize returns. We see real opportunity in the property, hospitality, and energy sectors as there are low interest rates and we expect the interest rate to remain low for a long period of time. One of the subsidiaries that we recently acquired was initially a mining company that transformed into an energy company. That particular company, PDI, Paedang Industries, is listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. It has subsequently made investments in solar farms in Japan and seeks to acquire some in the region and locally as well. On the property side, one of our affiliated companies, Country Group Development, is working on developments in various sectors, including hotels and schools. We recently acquired a school in Brighton and are looking into the data center revolution. There is a global surge in data use that is showing no signs of slowing down and we are taking an optimistic, yet pragmatic, approach toward data centers, cloud servicing, and so on. The mandate of our property arm, Country Group Development, is to look for unique opportunities in global property markets. It will only make niche investments.</p><h4>To what extent will you be pursuing opportunities internationally, as compared to within Thailand?</h4><p>We feel there are perhaps even more opportunities internationally right now due to the strength of our currency. We have been fortunate in the recent past that our currency has stood extremely strong against other markets and we feel that this is an opportunity, and, therefore, we want to look outward. This includes Europe and the US; however, specifically right now, we are targeting the UK. Some may question this after Britain's decision to leave the EU; however, we believe Brexit is a great opportunity. Although the UK market may take a few years to recover, we believe it certainly will. Japan is an extremely safe haven and the currency has been performing well; hence, our investments in the derivatives sector in Japan have also been strong. Australia is good as well; it is coming off its issues with commodity depressed prices and is starting to recover so this will definitely be a market to look out for. Closer to home, the AEC coming together is a positive move and we will look to strengthen our presence in the region. PDI is working on regional renewable energy plants at the moment. We are looking at the less-advanced AEC countries, the CLMV namely. The more advanced economies are obviously more saturated and so it is more difficult to get projects in the renewable energy sector; however, in the property and hospitality sectors, if there is an opportunity, we would want to know.</p><h4>What stage are you now in your investment strategy and where do you envisage the company in 12 months' time?</h4><p>In 2016, we recently announced that we had divested most of our retail assets of the brokerage, which leaves us with a light holding company that is financially cash rich and stable, with a solid cash flow that is now ready to do more investments. Predominantly, in 2016 we will be progressing with a step-by-step approach. The first is managing our capital carefully and actively. We are able to tap into our network in order to manage that capital profitably. We can generate high returns through the management of our short-term capital. The second strategy is to make additional investments into the sectors that we have discussed. We look for large, well-established companies to buy over, and we are currently in negotiations for a couple of these transactions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the recent formation of the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) and what role will it play in boosting incoming FDI?</h4><p>We just announced our economic policy for the year and the policies that we have set out are clear: we have to actively promote and support infrastructure development, as well as agriculture and industry sectors as they are crucial for job creation and strong economic growth. Clearly, a major part of this is to create the best possible conditions to attract foreign investment, which is why in 2016 we launched the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC). The underlying reason of the new formation is to undertake the responsibilities of FDI promotion in Myanmar in a more pragmatic and efficient manner. The commission will play a leading role in attracting inward FDI in Myanmar; it will basically act as our national investment promotion agency. Moreover, investment policies are under way to improve our business environment, particularly through implementing rules and regulations that will help shape a stable economic landscape. One of the notable measures was to integrate our previous two investment laws into a sole Myanmar Investment Law, which is currently being drafted. In addition, we are also drafting our new Myanmar Company Law, which will play a significant role in establishing this secure and thriving business environment.</p><h4>Which sectors of the economy show the most potential for future trade and investment relations between Myanmar and Thailand?</h4><p>Thailand is a friendly neighbor to Myanmar, sharing several similarities in history, culture, and religion. In previous years, our cooperation was mainly based around border trade, agriculture, energy, and education. However, as I say to people in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Thailand (CLMVT), it is great that we have such a long history, but now it is time to look to the future and turn a new page. In this future, we cannot have one-way dialogue or policies. What I want to see is a one-for-all approach. We have to work together more, consider our environment, and make sure no one gets left behind. As of June 2016, Thailand was ranked the third biggest investor in Myanmar, exceeding USD10 billion. But apart from boosting investment volumes, we are also working on developing new areas of cooperation, so our Long-Term FDI Promotion Plan adopted in 2014 has identified agriculture, food-processing, textiles, automotive, tourism, and IT as the most promising sectors, going forward. In terms of trade, Thailand is our biggest partner in ASEAN and our second biggest partner globally, after China. Given our proximity, cross border trade plays a crucial role in our relations. Along this border, we are building the Myawaddy Industrial Zone, which we expect to open in 2017 and to further facilitate business between our countries. </p><h4>What impact will the recent integration of the AEC have on attracting investment to Myanmar?</h4><p>The historical similarities that we share in CLMVT suggest that we are all one nation, not one region. Yes, we are divided into five states and brought together by the region, but going forward we have to behave like one nation, and the AEC brings us one step closer to these goals. In fulfilling Myanmar's commitment to the AEC for free flow of investment, we have undertaken tremendous reforms to develop an enhanced legal framework that will guarantee investors a level playing field in our market. To date, Myanmar sees the ASEAN community as a major investment partner, contributing significantly to our FDI. Singapore is our second biggest investor, contributing to just over 20% of total FDI, while Thailand ranks third with 16.5%. One segment that we expect to benefit greatly from the AEC is SMEs. We expect them, and will encourage them, to take full advantage of the single market by opening up their operations and collaborations throughout the region. Overall, by bringing our economies closer together, I believe the AEC will have a positive impact on Myanmar's economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the outcomes from your recent meeting with Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha?</h4><p>I am pleased to have met Prime Minister Prayut as well as my counterpart, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Gen. Prawit Wongsuwan, during my last visit to Thailand in November 2015. Besides thanking Thailand for its friendship, another objective for my visit was also to reaffirm the excellent bilateral relationship between both countries. Defense is a key pillar of this bilateral relationship. We value our defense relations with Thailand. We have a long history of military exercises and joint training together, between both armies, navies, and air forces. We agreed that both countries share the same desire to further strengthen our defense relationship so as to foster mutual understanding and interoperability between both armed forces. Singapore sees Thailand as a critical and valuable player in ASEAN for peace and stability in the region. I discussed regional and international security developments with Prime Minister Prayut and Deputy Prime Minister Prawit, where we agreed on the need for an open, inclusive, and robust regional security architecture. As fellow members of ASEAN, we share similar perspectives on security issues confronting our region. Terrorism is one common transnational threat that both countries face, and one that necessitates cooperation from our key partners in the region. No one country has the resources to address these threats alone and it is important for countries to undertake practical cooperative activities that will build mutual trust and confidence, as well as enhance our capabilities to address these threats.</p><h4>How would you assess the bilateral defense relationship between Singapore and Thailand?</h4><p>Defense relations between Singapore and Thailand are close and long-standing. This is reflected in the frequent exchange of high-level visits, as well as military exercises and professional interactions across all three services. Most recently, our air forces concluded a trilateral exercise, Ex Cope Tiger, with the US in March 2016, and both armies conducted Ex Kocha Singa in February 2016. We also work together at multilateral events like the ADMM, ADMM-Plus, and the Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD).</p><h4>What are your expectations for bilateral defense ties between Thailand and Singapore in the year ahead?</h4><p>Just last year, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. We have an excellent defense relationship, which I am confident will continue. In addition, we are always striving to do more to strengthen the relationship and people-to-people ties of both armed forces. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for Thailand's strong support for the SAF's training in Thailand for many years. I am also appreciative of Thailand's strong support for Singapore-hosted multilateral events like Singapore Airshow and SLD, and I hope Thailand would continue this for SLD16, which will celebrate its 15th anniversary.</p><h4>In your view, what impact will the opening of the ASEAN Economic Community have on defense cooperation and regional security?</h4><p>The AEC aims to build closer economic ties amongst the 10 ASEAN member states. This complements the existing efforts made by the defense establishments under the ADMM framework to foster greater trust and mutual understanding in the region. Beyond measures and policies that will help grow our trade and investments, a wide range of initiatives under the AEC—encompassing tourism development, infrastructural connectivity, food security, amongst others—have also played an integral role in community building on the economic front. In particular, through inter-governmental cooperation, we have grown to understand and develop shared policy and regulatory objectives. ASEAN's economic and technical capacity building efforts, especially in supporting the development of our least developed member states to narrow the development gaps on the economic front, has also engendered greater cohesion. Our economic community building efforts and the closer relationships between our peoples have therefore fostered a sense of greater trust, kinship and mutual understanding between the 10 member states, and serves as a consistent reminder of our mutual interests in building regional security, stability and success. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What benefits does the opening of the AEC bring to ASEAN member states? </h4><p>ASEAN member states stand to benefit significantly from the establishment of the AEC as it will bring about new opportunities in the form of a huge market of over USD2.5 trillion and 620 million people. The community comprises of some of the world's most dynamic economies, and amidst the diversity lay complementary strengths and potential. The collective efficiency arising from the economic community will contribute toward higher growth and employment creation in the region. The AEC has led to the creation of a business-friendly and innovation-supporting regional environment through the adoption of common frameworks, standards, and mutual cooperation across various areas such as agriculture and financial services, competition policy, intellectual property rights, and consumer protection. It also supports improvements in transport connectivity and other infrastructure networks that have facilitated cross-border transportation and contributed to reducing overall costs of doing business, while providing ASEAN's people and businesses with better opportunities to work together more productively. </p><h4>To what extent are member states prepared for the AEC?</h4><p>Member states have continued to maintain strong commitments toward the region's economic integration agenda. The recent establishment of the AEC 2015 and the launch of the new AEC 2025 Blueprint are testament not only to this collective commitment but also to the importance accorded by the member states in preparing for the realization of the AEC. Indeed, the near completion of the implementation of the AEC Blueprint 2015 and the renewed commitment to complete the implementation of pending key measures by end 2016 along with the immediate priorities of the AEC Blueprint 2025 signify the readiness of member states to embrace the AEC.</p><p>As many of the low-hanging fruits have been achieved, member states have realigned their focus to tackling the more challenging areas of economic integration. </p><h4>Which sectors should member states prioritize in the AEC? </h4><p>ASEAN member states possess varying comparative sectoral and resource advantages. In a world of global value chains, however, economic specialization is bound less and less in terms of sectors or industries, as mobility of skills, technology, and even capital becomes more fluid. The collective strength that is built on these complementaries has in turn contributed to collective competitiveness. As economies globalize and integrate, more economic opportunities arise as production becomes internationalized. The correct question is no longer about which sector to specialize in but how to specialize; having said that, ASEAN previously embarked on the priority integration sector initiative, aimed at targeting the region's limited resources at those sectors that were deemed of great economic importance. In the newly launched AEC Blueprint 2025, enhanced connectivity and sectoral cooperation are emphasized first by focusing on functional sectors that serve as critical inputs to other sectors and industries that contribute to economic connectivity and enhancing ASEAN participation in global value chains. Second, the new blueprint also focuses on strategic sectors of economic importance to the region ranging from food, agriculture and forestry, tourism to healthcare, among others. These are areas where sector-specific form of cooperation and initiatives is deemed meaningful for deepening economic integration. </p><h4>What role can member states play in boosting infrastructure capabilities within the ASEAN bloc? </h4><p>Infrastructure remains the backbone of the region's economy. ASEAN has set out the regional plans to boost infrastructure capabilities that include improvement of the infrastructure, networks and operations in order to build a more interconnected region. To this end, to translate regional commitments into national implementation should be a top priority in the ASEAN agenda by pushing for ratification of ASEAN agreements, alignment of domestic laws and regulations to regional commitments and setting-up of the requisite institutions and infrastructure to support the implementation of ASEAN agreements at the national level. In this regard, ASEAN's work toward improving environment and opportunities of infrastructure investment can play a pivotal role in attracting investment into its regional infrastructure which is key to securing stronger and more sustainable economic growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Thailand's integration into the AEC mean for the country's diplomatic standing in the region, and beyond?</h4><p>As one of the founding members of ASEAN in 1967, Thailand sees the launch of the AEC as a key milestone. We believe it will raise the diplomatic standing of all its members for good reasons. Above all, economic integration will bring tangible benefits to more than 600 million people in the region. Intra-ASEAN trade grew 10.5% on average during 1993-2013. ASEAN has also been outward looking. Beyond its own region, ASEAN has established five FTAs with six dialogue partners and will conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with the six dialogue partners. RCEP will be one of the largest FTAs in the world, with the potential to stimulate trade and investment for Asia and improve the livelihoods of half of the world's population. Thailand will actively cooperate with other members to achieve the AEC vision for 2025: an economic community that is highly integrated, competitive, dynamic, people-centered and engaged at the global level. A team effort by the 10 members will push ahead important work such as trade and investment facilitation and further liberalization of the services sector so as to maintain the AEC as an attractive trade and investment destination for the international community. According to Baker &amp; Mckenzie, it is projected that the AEC will realize its potential as the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2050. The AEC—as part of the ASEAN Community—will engage dialogue partners and stakeholders to ensure that the AEC remains relevant to the millions of people in the Community and beyond. </p><h4>What are some of the most important provisions in the upgraded ASEAN-China FTA as it pertains to Thailand's economy?</h4><p>The successful upgrade of the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) on November 21, 2015 will help ensure that our region remains resilient in the face of a slowdown in global economic growth. The ACFTA was signed over 10 years ago and the upgrade was long overdue. As ASEAN's first FTA with a trading partner, ACFTA has helped to propel the establishment of other ASEAN+1 FTAs. The ACFTA upgrade will improve trade and investment opportunities between ASEAN and China through more facilitative customs procedures, more options for rules of origin, increased liberalization of services, increased investment promotion and facilitation, and increased areas for economic and technical cooperation. Thailand's private sector will find the new rules of origin more flexible. As a result, more than 2,000 goods from Thailand could gain greater access to China. As the service sector is an increasingly important driver of economic growth for the AEC, ASEAN stands to benefit from greater opportunities arising from the newly liberalized services sector in China, such as tourism and financial services, construction, and engineering. Moreover, all parties stand to gain from measures such as investment promotion, industrial complementarity and production networks, information exchanges, and one-stop investment centers. Thailand hopes that the ACFTA upgrade will boost trade and investment between ASEAN and China and help to achieve the targets set by leaders for USD1 trillion in trade by 2020 and USD150 billion in investment by 2021.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The year ahead will see an increasingly globalized and interconnected world. There will likely be many challenges including threats and problems that know no boundary. At the same time, opportunities will be immense. A key to handle this is to further strengthen and expand international cooperation. In 2016, Thailand has set out to play a leading and constructive role in the global arena, particularly among developing countries. We are also laying down a 20-year strategy for the country that will provide guidelines for our positioning in the years ahead. Our goal is for the country to achieve stability, prosperity, and sustainability. The priorities of the current Thai government are to enhance the country's strength in various ways, including increasing Thailand's competitiveness. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>A decade ago, Thailand and New Zealand signed into effect the Thailand and New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership (TNZCEP). To what extent has this FTA been the bedrock of modern bilateral ties?</h4><p>The TNZCEP was one of New Zealand's first trade agreements and has helped create significant trade and economic benefits for both countries since it came into force in 2005. Through improved market access, customs procedures and trade facilitation, increased efficiency, and enhanced profitability, as well as the transfer of technology and skills for businesses, trade volumes have more than doubled in the last 10 years. Thailand is now New Zealand's eighth-largest trading partner with total trade between our two countries worth NZD$3.25 billion. Thailand exports mainly manufactured goods to New Zealand, while New Zealand primarily exports agricultural goods and wood to Thailand. While there is some work to do in relation to services and the safeguards that apply to some dairy and meat products, we expect this trade agreement will continue to strengthen our important economic partnership. </p><h4>During your previous visit to Bangkok, you suggested that Thailand could become a key hub for New Zealand's investors looking to expand into the region, with a particular focus on the F&amp;B, logistics, IT, and manufacturing sectors. Over two years later, to what extent have these goals been met and has New Zealand since made any revisions to its strategic economic interests with the Kingdom?</h4><p>Taking a long-term view, New Zealand continues to recognize Thailand's potential as a strategic hub for investment in the region. It is geographically located in the center of Southeast Asia and is the second-largest economy within ASEAN. Significant infrastructure proposals such as high-speed rail connections to China are promising and would further incentivise investment in Thailand and the region. A number of New Zealand manufacturing, logistics, ICT, and F&amp;B companies have established a presence in Thailand, and a number of dairy, beef, and fruit exporters are using Thailand as a hub to explore other markets in Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar. </p><h4>What impact does the recent integration of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) have on New Zealand's strategic relationship with the region?</h4><p>The AEC presents a great opportunity for New Zealand to further our relationship with ASEAN and the AsiaPacific region, and expand our trade and economic links. In 2015, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of New Zealand-ASEAN relations. Two-way trade between New Zealand and ASEAN has increased nearly 100-fold, from USD133 million in 1975 to USD10.6 billion in 2015. Much of this growth has been underpinned by the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA), which has been the cornerstone of our trade and economic relationship with ASEAN. New Zealand is supportive of initiatives that broaden regional economic integration such as the AEC. Mega-regional free trade agreements—the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP)—seek to broaden ties of economic cooperation between countries in our region. The more New Zealand can link into such agreements, the more New Zealand is able to contribute and benefit from regional prosperity and future economic opportunities.</p><h4>What are your expectations for New Zealand's bilateral relations with Thailand in the year ahead?</h4><p>We are looking forward to realizing the full potential of the bilateral relationship when Thailand returns to democratic governance. In the meantime, our people and business links with Thailand remain strong. Every year, more than 40,000 Kiwis visit Thailand and more than 20,000 visitors arrive in New Zealand from Thailand. Thai Airways has just increased its scheduled flights to Auckland and I expect tourism will be an important area of continued growth. Thailand is New Zealand's largest source of international students from Southeast Asia and our educational institutes continue to build partnerships and foster connections. In 2016, we commemorate 60 years of diplomatic relations between our two countries. Special events are being held in both Thailand and New Zealand throughout the year to celebrate this special milestone. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the current state of Sri Lanka's bilateral ties with Thailand?</h4><p>The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the Kingdom of Thailand have historically shared strong traditional and religious links. The establishment of diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Thailand in 1955 was the formalizing of a longstanding, mutually beneficial friendship. Today, as the relations celebrate 60 years, both countries are given the opportunity to assess the relationship, seek novel ways of cooperation, and take the different aspects of the relationship to a higher level. In the context of Asia's latent strength emerging in the world economy, Sri Lanka and Thailand need to seek diversified avenues to work toward the mutual benefit of the countries, their peoples, and the region. Sri Lanka values the support extended in international fora by the Thai government during the difficult period in our recent history, and we stand together with Thailand as steadfast friends.</p><h4>What were the major talking points and achievements from your official visit to Thailand last November?</h4><p>One of the major talking points of the meetings was shared religious ties; one of Sri Lanka's most venerated Sacred Relics of the Gauthama Buddha enshrined in the Mahiyangana Raja MahaViharaya was brought to Thailand on the patronage of the Sri Lankan people to provide an opportunity for the Thai people to pay homage. It was indeed gratifying to learn that more than half a million Thai devotees paid homage to the relics during their two weeks in Putthamothon. His Excellency, General Prayut Chan-o-cha, also expressed his appreciation of the bringing of the Sacred Relics to Thailand, as well as the gifting of the Buddha statue to the Dhammarama temple in the Ayutthaya province. Discussions were also conducted on ways to address the significant trade gap between the countries. We discussed several areas of cooperation to bring this existing status quo to a more mutually beneficial status. The key is that the two countries be partners and not competitors in this path to benefiting our citizens. A wide range of issues of mutual interest covering politics and the economy, culture and religions, cooperation, agriculture and fishery industries, tourism, and person-to-person contacts were also discussed. The developments stemming from these productive talks will be reflected in the broadened areas of cooperation between the two countries in the coming years. We expect a further increase in bilateral relations in political, economic and trade, cultural, religious, and social spheres in the coming years.</p><h4>Which economic opportunities has Sri Lanka identified in Southeast Asia following the recent integration of the AEC?</h4><p>As the ASEAN region emerges as a unified economic community, Sri Lanka aims to be a constructive partner. My government works closely with many international partners such as regional bodies, governments, and other international organizations. The changes brought about since January have of course raised the profile of Sri Lanka and propelled the country toward a more harmonious and cooperative relationship with the international community. This has been reflected in the collaborative engagements in international fora. The re-establishment of rule of law and good governance to accompany the peace and security that had been won has resulted in an investment friendly environment of more trade in Sri Lanka. The increased FDI and presence of global companies in Sri Lanka have illustrated the recognition of the international private sector of these positive changes. Sri Lanka welcomes collaboration and looks forward to playing to the strengths of our economy. While ASEAN integration will provide a good platform for the member states to improve corporation among them, Sri Lanka sees a unique opportunity in it to develop trade relations with a group of countries that are culturally close to us. While we look forward to a booming renewables sector in Sri Lanka, we will continue to play an increased role as a partner facilitating naval transport between the AEC and the rest of the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major events have characterized the past year for you?</h4><p>KDIPA has benefited from the positive momentum witnessed in the past few years in Kuwait that has enabled the licensing and approvals of renowned global companies in the services sector, particularly ICT and energy activities. KDIPA is committed to its vision of Kuwait as an added value and innovation-based investment hub that fosters technology transfer, creates jobs and training for Kuwaitis, and supports local content in accordance with the national development agenda to pursue economic diversification and support a leading role of the private sector in the economy. In line with this, KDIPA also seeks to position itself as an efficient investment promotion agency (IPA) in charge of Kuwait's image building, investor targeting, investor servicing, and providing facilitation and aftercare, as well as policy advocacy. A key milestone for KDIPA this past year was organizing the Kuwait Investment Forum (KIF), the first investment promotion conference, under the patronage of HH the Emir of Kuwait and with the personal inauguration of the Prime Minister in early March 2016. KIF attracted more than 600 high-ranking officials, dignitaries, and private-sector participants from 24 countries. The KIF showcased Kuwait's unique attributes, highlighted the evolving legal and regulatory favorable developments, and presented a host of lucrative investment opportunities that portrayed a new culture of achievement in the dynamic Kuwaiti market. Such achievements, reinforced by a host of new economic laws passed, provide a profound basis to further consolidate KDIPA's efforts to ensure that direct investments are conducive to national sustainable growth and prosperity. In addition, KDIPA also entertained several outreach events, received delegations, participated in bilateral agreements discussions, and conducted extensive orientation to introduce its services, incentives, and guarantees under its establishing law. KDIPA is emerging into a new era of operation as a center of institutional excellence by adopting the best practices, nurturing a learning environment, and hiring young national professionals whose enthusiasm and energy will be the engine of growth and the way to achieve intended objectives.</p><h4>The authority further collaborates with the Kuwait Authority for Partnership Projects (KAPP) to strengthen public-private partnerships. What PPPs does KDIPA hope to facilitate in the coming years?</h4><p>Under the current second medium-term development plan, around USD103 billion has been allocated toward megaprojects covering north zone development, electricity and water, oil and gas, urban development, education, health, transport and communications, tourism, media, and environment. The Kuwaiti government is aware of the urgent need to expedite the diversification process of its revenues by getting the private sector to increase its share in GDP. Moreover, the government is actively seeking to attract powerhouse industries into new areas that focus on advanced technology and technical know-how to support economic diversification and to establish the needed ecosystem to build the pillars of Kuwait's knowledge economy.</p><h4>How would you describe the business and investment climate in Kuwait at the moment?</h4><p>Kuwait's business and investment climate is witnessing continued improvement. Incentives such as 100% ownership and being able to receive a license within 30 days are integral components of KDIPA's offer to attract foreign investors. Other incentives include performance-based tax credit, customs duties exemptions, and guarantees against expropriation, allowing free transfer of capital and profits, and sharing benefits under bilateral agreements. In doing so, KDIPA acts as a specialized agency promoting Kuwait as a lucrative investment destination, receiving applications for investment licensing and granting incentives, servicing investors, facilitating procedures, providing aftercare, as well as playing an active advocacy role for streamlining business environment and enhancing Kuwait's competitiveness in close coordination with all other government entities and various stakeholders. Under this advocacy role, KDIPA is assigned to head the Permanent Committee for Streamlining Business Environment in Kuwait (PCK), established by the Council of Ministers decision to coordinate national efforts, document achievements, and communicate improvements. Current membership of PCK includes nine concerned government entities entailing the Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Ministry of Justice, and the Kuwait Municipality. Additionally, KDIPA launched a series of public-private open dialogues to identify reform priorities that will contribute to improving the business climate in Kuwait. Furthermore, KDIPA, in accord with its mandated tasks, keeps communication channels open with the investors, receiving their issues, addressing their concerns, and resolving identified barriers to doing business in Kuwait, in close cooperation and full coordination with other relevant government entities.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>KDIPA plans to become more pro-active in the coming year. We hope to adopt a well-planned and assertive approach when implementing our multifaceted promotional campaigns, generating investment leads, conducting investor-targeting initiatives, and developing investor services operations. The dedicated efforts of our team of young professionals, accompanied by well-articulated strategic directions, are fundamental to achieving our intended goals to make Kuwait an investment location of choice. We shall be building on the success attained this year and will work to further strengthen our service delivery model and geographic outreach. In this regard, we take it upon ourselves to continue providing the needed facilitation to attract value added investments that will advance our country's economic growth and steer its development path toward an innovation-based economy focusing on ensuring sustainability in the face of rising global commitments and challenges.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2016, Top Glove announced its second listing, this time in Singapore, after already being listed in Malaysia. What were the objectives in doing so?</h4><p>The main objective of the secondary listing in Singapore was to create and add value for our shareholders and stakeholders. Singapore is a good country for us to associate with, develop our business, and learn from. The financial market in Singapore is also larger than in Malaysia. As a business we want to ensure that we invest where we can get a good yield or return. The time and cost involved in this investment will pay off with a higher return. Even with our Singapore listing, we still only need to have just one annual report, AGM, auditor, language, and announcements for our listings on Bursa Malaysia and the Singapore Exchange; therefore, we do not have many extra costs associated. The image and brand we are building by listing in Singapore is positive. We want our customers to see us as an international company. The image created is stronger as the regulatory standards are higher in Singapore than in Malaysia. Listing in Singapore is also a sensible long-term strategy for us should we decide to acquire other companies as the new listing opens up the market for us. There is a greater demand for shares on the Singapore market as well. Therefore, our share price and value should be better.</p><h4>Top Glove currently has 25% of the world market and you have targeted capturing 30% by 2020. What growth strategies do you have in place?</h4><p>We are the world's largest rubber glove manufacturer and currently export to 200 countries. It is not easy to be the world's largest producer of any product and maintaining that position is even more challenging. In business, you have to set a direction and target. Our target is to expand our market share to 30% by 2020. To achieve this target, we have to continue to expand. To this end, we have been building two or three new factories a year, but that has not been enough. Therefore, we also look to acquire new companies in order to grow faster. The cost of doing business is increasing every year and we need to grow as a company to keep up.</p><h4>Are there any particular geographical areas that you want to expand to next?</h4><p>We look to expand all over the world into numerous countries. The US is the country that contributes the highest percentage of our sales revenue at 28%. We are present in all countries in Europe and that represents 34% of our sales revenue. We have customers in Latin America, including Brazil, which is a major market for us. After the US, Europe, and Japan, Brazil is our fourth largest market. We are able to expand to almost every region around the globe because standards of living and life expectancy are going up.</p><h4>How is your innovation agenda part of your growth strategy?</h4><p>Innovation is a must. Without research and innovation, there is no quality or future. We need to continuously improve our products to stay ahead of the competition. Other countries, such as Thailand, India, China, Indonesia, and Vietnam, are also producing rubber gloves. We set up a new R&amp;D center three years ago, where we employ 100 researchers to engage in research on a full-time basis in order to improve our quality.</p><h4>How is the ecosystem in Malaysia for glove manufacturers, given the country's numerous rubber plantations and the government's drive to develop the medical equipment industry?</h4><p>Malaysia is ideal for rubber glove manufacturing because we have the raw materials, good technology, and machinery for production. We also have high-quality control in our manufacturing. Malaysia has sound infrastructure in terms of transportation, including seaports and airports, and in communications. The country has a relatively stable government, and it is a safe country to operate in. This stability is important for business. Malaysia is good for global marketing, because we speak many languages here, including English, which is essential for international business. Our staff speaks many languages, which enables us to serve customers across the globe. The level of entrepreneurship in Malaysia is high and the country has a good banking system. Hence, Malaysia has many advantages that help make us competitive.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your recent product innovations?</h4><p>We continuously search for new and innovative products and we recently introduced a new type of synthetic glove for people who are allergic to natural rubber, or latex. Also, we have introduced a polymer coating that enables you to don a glove even with wet hands. Every year we introduce about five new or improved glove products. We have also expanded our glove range to serve the food industry. We manufacture color-coded gloves for use in different types of food preparation. We have also expanded into gloves for use in hairdressing salons and households. We are always looking to innovate and expand into whatever colors and features consumers want.</p><h4>What are the key challenges ahead for your business?</h4><p>The quality requirements for our gloves differ greatly from country to country in terms of regulations, labeling, and so forth. This can make it more difficult to export to some countries. For example, for Brazil we are required to print certain numbers on our products. Of course, the more requirements there are, the higher the cost to us and to the consumer. The US' FDA is also strict in its quality requirements. Basically, we have to have numerous certifications to meet all the different countries' standards.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the next two or three years?</h4><p>We think five, 10, or 20 years ahead. We have to grow more and grow faster, or make acquisitions to keep up with the escalating costs of doing business. To do this, we need the right people and recruiting the right talent is extremely important. I founded the company 25 years ago and I am still happy to come to work and always on the move—work is my hobby. I never stop learning and improving. I keep fit and we encourage our staff to stay healthy and fit too. We have a gym, which staff may use for free and organize sporting activities every month for our staff. We have established a policy that as long as you are healthy and are making a positive contribution there is no fixed retirement age; you can keep working if you want to. We manage the company on a democratic basis. Anyone can be the head of the company if they are good enough to do the job. The opportunities are open for the best people to run the show. This is the message and philosophy we want to pass down.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major contributions of JTB to the Lebanese economy since you were first established?</h4><p>We have been part of Lebanon for over 50 years, providing financial services to a wide array of customers. Lebanon has a large number of people working in the informal sector, in what is often called the “grey economy." When we talk about the informal economy, we mean those small family businesses and micro shops that are not formally registered on government books, but still have their fair share of economic development in the country. JTB has been there since the outset to actually support these promising micro firms. This has been our major contribution to the overall economy.</p><h4>How has your customer-sensitive approach set you apart from other banking institutions in Lebanon?</h4><p>There is a popular birthday wish in Lebanon that is “We hope you live to be a hundred years," which we often apply to entrepreneurs opening a new business in the form of “We hope you become the largest in your sector." For JTB, this has never been the case. Since its emergence, the bank has never aimed to become the biggest player in the financial sector, nor to become the largest bank. Stretching our capacities to these spheres would make us lose our 'Uniqueness' and force us to treat our customers as just numbers rather than individuals. Something that still makes JTB what it is today: to serve people. we want to have a genuinely personalized approach to banking; something that has gotten lost in most places around the globe.</p><h4>How has JTB promoted microfinance among society, and what benefits does the banking segment bring?</h4><p>We were the first bank to introduce micro-credit into the Lebanese market. We started this segment 17 years ago serving the unbanked; those who would recur to their neighbors or friends to borrow cash and who would end up paying back multiples of what they initially borrowed. We approached those people who were skeptical of dealing with banks, and we encouraged them to abandon their taboos of not using banking institutions for their financial needs. It is of relevance to mention that Microfinance is often confused with the microcredit you can obtain from a retail shop to purchase a determined item. As opposed to microcredit that only aims at improving people's livelihood, microfinance aims at lending money to people to develop their business and to improve their livelihood. </p><h4>Considering 90% of Lebanese companies fall under SME, has JTB found its niche market in this sector?</h4><p>One of the characteristics that is constantly overlooked about the SMEs operating in Lebanon is that only around 50% of them are officially registered on government books; with the rest operating informally but still contributing enormously to the economy. Throughout JTB's history we have catered to all those small businesses in Lebanon and effectively managed to migrate them from the unbanked group to the bankable group of businesses; and they flourished. It has been a demanding journey and we, at JTB, are proud of every step, every touch point, and every turning point. A journey some large banks decided to shy away from. There is a know-how, an appetite and a certain finesse required to do business with these small firms.</p><h4>Looking ahead, where would you JTB going in the next two years?</h4><p>We will move up a few notches in the industry but never pass the 15th position in the overall banking sector ranking. This is because of the reasons I explained before that set us apart from other players in terms of customer satisfaction and how we approach them. Our slogan “We Speak Your Language," remains as strong and as real as ever.  That doesn't mean I don't dream big. I would like to see JTB move abroad to other markets in Africa and in Europe to serve our clients needs there. We have big plans for the future, but with cautious steps as we have always been.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the most important milestones for the company in Costa Rica during 2016?</h4><p>It was important to see the start of a project that will have such an impact on the country. We wanted to be a part of the largest project that will improve the economic development of Costa Rica. This is a year that has been marked by important milestones, one being the successful start of this construction in Costa Rica. Another milestone was the signature of the USD110 million contract for the purchase of all the lifting equipment that is going to be installed. This has been an important year thus far, and 2017 will also be important because it is then that we will be seeing the finished Infrastructure and we will be getting ready in parallel for the operations. We are investing a large amount of money, and people can see and feel this. The whole region now starts to react to the economic growth, which is also been important for us, in order to have support from the community and the country so that we could materialize our expectations. People are looking at Limon for touristic development, logistics, other services, and even for improvements to restaurants and services delivered for the area. We had a good year so far in 2016 keeping the project on time and within budget, and we will hopefully be seeing a lot more of that in the coming years.</p><h4>What are the main highlights of APM's 33-year government concession for Moin Container Terminal, and how did the company win the contract? </h4><p>Moin will not be the largest container terminal in Latin America, but it will strive to be the most efficient one, a standard in safety and security to look up to, and in harmony with the environment.  It will represent a major change of current paradigms since because of its efficiency in servicing and deeper draft it will be able to attract the exact same transoceanic vessels that go through the Panama Canal, thus connecting for the first time Costa Rica to this first tier shipping network. This will be a big game changer. The concession invited all interested parties to an open bid, and APM Terminals won the concession by proving to be the best partner for the Costa Rican government to develop a specialized container terminal. This is the first time in Latin America that a port of this level of specialization is being built on an artificial island. Since the design, we have been using various methods to build the facility a minimal environmental impact. We are going to have 650m of quay, a draft of 14.5m, and six STS cranes in the beginning. That will allow us to dock vessels of up to three and a half times the biggest vessel that actually docks in any port in Costa Rica. In the second phase, we will add another 600m of quay. By the end of the third stage, we will have 1.6km of quay, and more than 85 ha of container yard on the back to be able to handle all of the cargo, and workshops that will support the logistics.</p><h4>Infrastructure remains a major challenge in Costa Rica. How do you see projects like the improvements to Routes 32 and 4 progressing?</h4><p>There was recently a government sanction of the new concession contract for the construction of Route 32, which is an important step. The winners of the bid that was selected to take over this concession will spend seven to eight months in the design stage, and then approximately three years in building the expansion. Even though we would like to instantly have Route 32 tomorrow, we understand that it is also a major construction project and the involved parties will take their time. Route 4 that is the one connecting route 32 to the Nicaraguan border through the west plains of Costa Rica and has actually been in the building stage for several months; there is still a small connection of 10km that needs to be finished. Route 36 connecting Limon with the Panama border is one route in need of expansion, especially the bridges that still have only one lane. The good news though is that the construction of the bridge connecting the two countries over the Sixaola River has already begun, which is a major step in the right direction, and now demands the road leading to it. With the concession contract there is an obligation for the operator to secure funds for development projects in the Limon province. This is 7.5% of gross revenues, which in the first year alone results in about USD12.5 million. Development projects that promote the creation of jobs and economic improvement like this can make a difference not only for the Atlantic coast, but Costa Rica as a whole. A recent economic impact study requested from the Danish consulting firm Qbis showed that under very conservative assumptions we can expect from the Terminal investment the creation of 140,000 jobs.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2017? </h4><p>Obviously, we have a priority to complete the building of the Terminal, and ensure that we have trained resources to start operations immediately. Also, we will continue with our involvement in the betterment of the community, providing through our CSR programs support to continue with the improvement of schools in the area, as well as coordination with Police and Public Authorities to work on Public Safety. How this can be done is not always simple. There are many points of view, so the priority is to reach a consensus on an agenda regarding what has to be done, regardless of political colors or personal interest. This is necessary to be able to push through those three or four items that will move us forward. We are on time, and 2017 is going to be the year of challenges. We are already hiring and training our operators; therefore, it is another dimension not only in building the asset but also building the operating structure that we are going to have in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the operational strategy of AUBK changed under your leadership?</h4><p>When I came to Kuwait in April 2015, the Board of Directors had recently approved a new five-year strategy for the bank. The strategy concentrates on business growth in Kuwait. We are traditionally viewed as a strongly corporate bank but have a growing retail banking presence comprising almost 40 branches across Kuwait. Private banking and treasury services are also important businesses for us. Over the past 15 months, the operational model has been changed for both business and support functions. Businesswise, a review has been conducted on the products and services offered to our clients with each being carefully and considered for either enhancement or replacement. Consideration has been given to customer focus and needs, greater use of technology, cost-effectiveness, compliance with the regulatory environment, and, of course, sharia compliance. The infrastructure of the bank and its channels network has been considered for a major upgrade to accommodate our customers and their business, including those with special needs under the required level of protection. Offering such services will give a greater access for the bank to this segment and hence attract more businesses and contribute to the nation's initiatives toward humanitarian support and welfare. In addition, our branch concept and design has been reviewed to reflect the new size and design required to change the retail business modeling by converting the classical branch staff roles to be sales-focused workforce and service ambassadors. Equally, we have increased our alternative channels through enhanced internet and mobile banking services. From the operational modelling perspective, the bank has moved toward operations excellence and efficiency. Process reengineering tasks have been undertaken for remodeling different operations and credit policies and processes within the bank.</p><h4>To what extent is AUBK involved in infrastructure and construction projects?</h4><p>We are involved in some major projects in the oil sector for the production of clean fuel in addition to public projects for water desalination and purification. Ahli United Bank has been also part of the major syndicated transactions and consortiums formed to finance large construction and contracting projects in Kuwait. Historically, over its 75 year history in Kuwait the bank has been involved in financing many significant building and infrastructure projects.</p><h4>What are your expectations and outlook for the upcoming year?</h4><p>The coming year is expected to continue under the pressure of low oil prices and regional geopolitical uncertainty. It is therefore prudent to remain conservative and cautious but we will continue to seek fresh opportunities and support bankable business ventures and projects. Kuwait offers a stable investment climate with significant sovereign reserves and internationally well-regarded and admired institutions. Ahli United Bank will continue its growth by maintaining its position as the second largest Islamic Bank in Kuwait on a sustainable basis.</p><h4>What do you consider to be the most important change your company will implement in the medium term?</h4><p>Not so much a change, but a considered response to the regulatory environment with Basel III, IFRS9, and local regulatory requirements. The regulatory environment post 2007-8 has been challenging for banks internationally and Kuwait is no exception. However, we welcome the regulatory changes that ensure the continued soundness of the banking system and that offer improved transparency and protection for customers and other stakeholders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[first-in-line]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the competitive position of Razi Insurance among private insurers in Iran?</h4><p>Approximately 14 years ago, there were only four state-owned insurance companies in Iran. At that time, parliament passed a law allowing private insurance companies, and our shareholders were the first group to establish a private insurance company in 2002. Since then, we have issued around 12 million insurance policies and currently hold a 4% market share, insuring 2.5 million people. Since our establishment, some 25 other private insurers have been set up as well, but in most of these cases their shareholders are institutions related to the government. Currently, there are only two or three insurance companies in Iran that are 100% private, and Razi Insurance is one of them. Another difference is that our income does not come from the shareholders; 99.5% of our business comes from our customers. We are a general insurance company active in health, life, liability, engineering, projects, construction, and automobile insurance, where most of our policies are focused. However, we also insure numerous oil and gas projects, such as the Azadegan oil field, the largest oil field in Iran.</p><h4>The Central Insurance of Iran is adapting some policies to modernize the insurance market, including separating the life and non-life business. How is Razi Insurance planning to adapt to these changes?</h4><p>The Iranian insurance industry started 100 years ago, and 50 years ago the law on third-party liability (TPL) automobile insurance was passed. Over the last 50 years, TPL automobile insurance has been the most important segment of the insurance industry and still is, with 50% of the total premiums written in Iran. During these years, life insurance has not had that big of a share of the insurance business. However, it is a growing business, with a 7% share of all premiums written now. Its future growth will depend on how insurance companies can introduce new products. Another important factor would be if European insurers decide to enter the Iranian market. This will make the market grow up to 9%, but not to the level of countries like Japan. In this sense, if the regulator decides to separate life and non-life business, we are ready to divide our company into two to meet this requirement. This is a good idea because in most of the developed countries, life insurance companies are completely separate from non-life insurers. For the time being, general insurance companies can play in both life and non-life business.</p><h4>Would you like to enter into a joint venture with a foreign insurance company to increase your share in the market?</h4><p>This is a decision we are considering and we are negotiating with well-known foreign insurers. A joint venture would help Razi in many ways. Firstly, partnering with a strong company overseas will help to strengthen our brand. At the same time, it will give us more knowledge about the insurance industry in terms of processes, types of services, and new products. Finally, an international partnership will give us access to new technology. The insurance industry is currently very much related to IT, so getting the latest software could help us to sell new products and provide a better service. We are looking at some European insurance companies, a number of which are coming to Iran to study the market and hold discussions. We are in talks but we have not finalized anything yet.</p><h4>Is it part of your strategy to expand across the region?</h4><p>We are preparing a business plan for developing our regional expansion. We are looking at neighboring countries, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as countries in the north, particularly the CIS countries. We want to establish branches in the region and are already talking to some of these countries, although their rules are different; in some of them we will be able to open a branch but in others you have to set up a new insurance company.</p><h4>How do you see the future development of the insurance market in Iran?</h4><p>Iran is an excellent market from the insurance point of view. There are many differences between Iran and other Middle Eastern countries; for example, in many Islamic countries conventional insurance is forbidden and only takaful insurance services can be issued. However, in Iran and Turkey, conventional insurance is not forbidden, and this is why we are the second-largest insurance industry in the MENA region. Moreover, Iran has a population of 80 million, being the second-largest country in the MENA region in terms of population and extension. Further, Iran has the second-largest gas reserves in the world and the third-largest oil reserves. In this regard, the insurance industry plays an important role in the oil and gas sector, and this is why we are going to play an even larger role going forward than in previous years.</p><h4>What are your objectives for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have a 10-year strategic plan that we review annually. One of our objectives is to grow our market share by 0.5% annually. In the first four years of our 10-year plan, we have achieved almost all of our objectives, and in some cases, we have even exceeded them. Therefore we hope to continue with this success; our goal for 2016 was to have a 3.5% market share, but we have achieved 4% already. Due to the increase in the number of private insurers in Iran and the decrease in the presence of the in the sector, we think that by 2022, whichever insurance company has 7% of market share will be the largest insurance company in Iran. This is our goal, to be the first insurance company in the country in terms of market share and number of premiums. For the time being, we are already number one in profitability. If we continue with the same progress, Razi Insurance will be the largest company in the Iranian insurance industry in 2022.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current status of Costa Rica's accession to the OECD?</h4><p>Costa Rica approached OECD seven years ago and, since then, has embarked on a process with six main phases. First, Costa Rica worked closely with the OECD to demonstrate its like-mindedness with the organizations and its potential as a member country. Because of these joint efforts, Costa Rica executed an action plan agreed with the OECD with the aim of evaluating the position of the country in some strategic areas. This second phase required an exhaustive gap analysis to identify key issues to be addressed in order to become a member of the organization in some areas such as public governance, competition, investment policy, and vocational education and training. Costa Rica's reputation and capabilities have shown that the country, as a pioneer in cutting-edge policy, has immense potential to contribute to the OECD. As a result, the third phase started when the OECD Council decided to formally invite Costa Rica to start its accession process and approved the accession roadmap in 2015, which sets the terms and conditions of this process. Since the accession process is well structured, and the OECD has a well-defined road map, Costa Rica is now implementing its fourth phase. This phase includes the preparation of an Initial Memorandum and the execution of the 22 accession reviews defined in the roadmap. It is my role to be the coordinator of the process. The Ministry of Foreign Trade has been appointed by the President to lead this important goal. Costa Rica is committed to update and upgrade our standards, our public policies, and our practices, in the context of this major transformation process. Improvements at two main levels will be required; the efficiency of public policy and markets are key elements to improve the wellbeing of our citizens. The next phase is the implementation of the recommendations derived from each accession review to achieve the 22 positive formal opinions from each committee in the OECD. In order to do so, we have been putting in place all the efforts and resources needed to be able to complete this fifth phase by the end of this administration in May 2018. Still, since the last phase includes the approval of the accession protocol by the Legislative Assembly, its completion will be left for the administration to come.</p><h4>The Ministry of Foreign Trade works to increase trade internationally. What are the main free trade agreements you are working on right now?</h4><p>Costa Rica has in place 14 FTAs comprising trade with 50 commercial partners. The FTA with Colombia, which entered into force on August 1, 2016 is our most recent FTA. In addition, there is an ongoing FTA negotiation process between Central America and South Korea, which is expected to be concluded by December 2016. Hence, our road map in this area has a specific approach basis. Our political definition is focused on completing FTAs, bilateral investment protection agreements, and/or double tax agreements, preferably with all OECD countries and some selected additional countries. This is our main priority, and yet we have also identified opportunities in terms of both investment and trade with some specific countries such as the GCC states of Qatar, UAE, and Abu Dhabi, Kazakhstan, and some countries in South America. In Africa, we still need to complete our due diligence to identify the right country or countries to start our trade penetration. Those are the areas where we are the most active. In regard to the Pacific Alliance integration process, it is an initiative for which we are in the phase of studies. It is important to take into consideration that as our trade policy matures and evolves we need to gradually pay closer attention to those sectors that may be challenged by trade openness. Some countries, such as South Korea, the US, Canada, and European countries directly support their sensitive sectors, especially agriculture. They do not support them through tariffs, but rather by providing the type of internal support that complies with World Trade Organization provisions. We are committed to exploring and to developing a similar model, and we are in the final stages of preparing this proposal, which will be shared in the coming months with the productive sectors and the rest of the cabinet.</p><h4>Exports in Costa Rica increased 7% YoY in the first semester 2016. According to forecast, the country will export at least USD10.8 billion in 2016, 12% more than 2015. What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Costa Rica was one of the two Latin American countries where exports increased during the first semester of 2016. Certainly, we are on the right track to meet our national targets, and for the time being I do not foresee any condition that may prevent us from achieving the goal. Brexit and the US elections are of course giving us some bumpy feedback, but I do not expect a significant change in the current international trade scenario. I feel confident and optimistic that we will reach a two-digit growth rate in exports, as forecasted. Specifically, the 7% number includes solely the exports of goods, while the 16% growth rate comprises exports of goods and services, as the latter is the main driver. We are optimistic that exports will achieve a two-digit growth rate in 2016 and everything looks aligned; therefore, we do not foresee any surprises on the horizon.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's priorities for 2017?</h4><p>Our main priority is clearly the OECD accession program, followed by the improvement of the trade platform by this strategy to negotiate FTAs, bilateral investment agreements, and/or non-double-taxation agreements preferably with all OECD countries plus six or seven other strategic countries. Internal discussions on the Pacific Alliance will probably continue in 2017; nevertheless, we still need to complete some internal analysis regarding this initiative and some political goals before moving to the next stage, so I'd rather be more conservative and cautious with its pace. Even though the majority of Congress supports the Pacific Alliance, the truth is that the priority at Congress is devoted to fiscal reforms. We require fiscal reform to access public funding to be able to join the Pacific Alliance in a win-win situation. Of course, active promotion of trade and investment, which is transversal to what we do and is a significant piece of our agenda, also has high priority in our 2017 planning.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most important milestones of Gol Gohar in the industrial and mining sectors?</h4><p>There are more than 1 billion tons of iron ore to be exploited in Gol Gohar mines. We think that by exploring new areas we can increase this quantity; therefore, we are negotiating with the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade to extend our explorations area. We expect to produce more than 16 million tons of iron products in this Iranian year. At the moment, we are producing 5 million tons of iron plates, and in the middle of the year we will start a new 5 million ton line. At the same time, we are developing a new line of direct reduction iron (DRI) to produce 2.5 million tons. At the end of the year, we will have increased iron production by 68%. Our melt shop is also under construction and will produce one million tons of steel billets by the end of next year. Furthermore, we will finalize our contract for producing 3 million tons of thin slabs with one of the most reputable companies in the European market. We also have a power plant with a capacity of 500MW to supply energy for our factories. Last but not least, we are currently conducting one the largest projects in Iran, which consists of transferring the water from the Persian Gulf to dry areas in the south of Iran. This project is a joint venture with the National Iranian Copper Industries (NICICO) and Chadormalu Mining &amp; Industrial Company. The first, 120km, phase of this 300km pipeline project has been completed.</p><h4>Which markets are you targeting for exporting your products?</h4><p>The iron concentrate main customer is China, whereas the best markets for DRI are Europe &amp; Turkey. That is why after the lifting of sanctions we are looking for cooperation with European firms. We also have a good relationship with the Persian Gulf countries such as Oman, where we have recently opened an office. The most important project to increase our exports consists of developing a railway system to transport our products from GolGohar to Bandar Abbas port. After the visit of President Rouhani to the mines a few months ago, we signed an agreement with Railways of Iran (RAI) to start a 200km railway project between Sirjan and Kerman, which will be connecting Bandar Abbas to this area. We can proudly say we are the first private company conducting a railway project in Iran. For this purpose, we established a company that has already bought 10 locomotives. We are looking for joint ventures to finance this railway project.</p><h4>Is it also part of your strategy to develop projects outside of Iran?</h4><p>We are ready to develop mine projects in Afghanistan. In fact, we started negotiating with the Afghan government and held a meeting in Iran. We are studying the mines located near the borders of two countries, which is also a good area for transportation. We will visit the mines soon for further discussions. Moreover, we bought a copper mine in Kazakhstan, which is under development for producing copper now.</p><h4>How do you assess your appeal to attract foreign investment into the iron ore chain?</h4><p>We are eager to cooperate with foreign companies in the iron and steel production chains. The iron market globally has decreased; therefore, we have to make sure that we control everything to be profitable for our shareholder's benefits. For this reason, we have been increasing the factories' production and we had a successful commissioning of our last projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the regulatory framework for investment in Colombia?</h4><p>Colombia has a regulatory framework that favors foreign investment. As you know, Colombia has been an investment destination for some time now. The past and current governments have been very interested in fostering foreign investment and have tried to cut the red tape and help foreign investors in their incorporation process and operations in the country. That has been achieved to a certain extent, but it is a work in progress. However, there have been recent modifications to the tax regime that, in the view of many foreign investors, may affect their future investments in Colombia. This message has been conveyed to the government by several key players and stakeholders, and there is something to be done in that respect. Due to this scenario and international prices of certain commodities, our clients and foreign investors are now cautious about their investments in Colombia, waiting to see how the situation evolves, both tax-wise compared to other Latin American countries and also in terms of the ongoing peace talks with the guerrilla FARC in Cuba. Under the current global and local circumstances, being cautious makes sense.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the legal security and the rule of law in Colombia?</h4><p>Legal certainty and rule of law are alive and well in Colombia. We have some of the highest standards in Latin America in this respect. For example, there is legal certainty about several things. Justice, although slow in countries like ours, is still reliable, especially at the higher court levels. Laws are enforced, and, if they are changed, they change toward the future, not retroactively, which provides legal certainty. In the past, foreign companies have entered into legal stability agreements with the government, which shows the clear intention to promote stability and the rule of law. Furthermore, an arbitration procedure can be handled independently and without the interference or influence of the government, other sectors or third parties. Colombia has adopted a flexible and internationally derived regulation on international arbitration, which we believe meets international criteria. In 2012, though not entirely derived from UNCITRAL's Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“Model Law"), Colombia's Arbitration Law bears several similarities with the Model Law when dealing with international arbitration.</p><h4>What are the priorities for Norton Rose Fulbright in Colombia right now?</h4><p>We continuously hold conversations with other members of the legal community and key players in the Colombian market about achieving sustainable growth while maintaining our current ratios of profitability and success. At Norton Rose Fulbright, we always want to hire and retain the best legal talent there is in Colombia and the region. We want to have the same quality and compare ourselves to other law firms not just in Colombia or Latin America, but anywhere in the world. We are a London-based global law firm, and that is our standard. We have to continue to provide legal services of worldwide quality.</p><h4>What is your outlook on FDI in Colombia in 2016?</h4><p>I am somewhat optimistic because of the many projects and huge investments in the infrastructure sector. This will greatly help the Colombian economy, and FDI in this sector will continue to grow. However, it is justified to be somewhat concerned with many macroeconomic forecasts for 2016. Next year will hopefully bring a concrete result in the peace talks in Cuba due to the agreed deadline for the peace process, which has taken more time than originally expected and generated uncertainty among foreign investors and our clients for the past three years. At the same time, the government has also discussed and analyzed tax impacts on foreign investment and it seems to be willing to explore possibilities to modify the current tax structure. This will not happen in the short term due to the great pressure of international oil prices on our economy, but the finance officers of the administration know this has to be addressed at some point. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[lets-take-a-trip]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the tourism sector evolved, and which areas are you promoting to bolster tourism in the country?</h4><p>Colombia's tourism sector has evolved and developed greatly over the last few years, and this is down to two major factors. First, Colombia is one of the most geographically diverse countries in the world and, second, it has an extraordinary cultural heritage that is as diverse as it is rich. So Colombia really stands out from other in Latin American nations and indeed the world. Colombia has something to visit every season, 365 days a year, with jungles, mountains, beaches, desert, tundra, savanna, coastlines on two oceans and the Caribbean, and a blend of African, European, American, and other cultures and civilizations. We also have some of the richest variety of flora and fauna of any country in the world. We really are blessed with an incredible country, and that makes our job really easy.</p><h4>How has the perception of Colombia changed and evolved globally, and how has this reflected on the tourism industry?</h4><p>The tourism sector has been perhaps the most positively affected sector of the whole economy by the ongoing search to create a lasting peace in Colombia, which we are getting nearer and nearer to achieving. Our government and president have been doing everything in their power to try and find a lasting solution between the two sides, and once that is done, the tourism sector, and Colombia as a whole, will boom. We are closer to a lasting peace than ever before, and this will really spur the small and medium businesses and operators in the tourism sector, expanding and filling capacity, making new investments, and building up international networks and connections to bring more tourists and visitors into the country. But most importantly, beyond just the tourism sector, a lasting peace will transform our society, our economy, our politics, and the country as a whole. Many of the most beautiful, fertile, and productive regions of Colombia have been unable to reach their potential because of decades of conflict. We have developed a plan whereby we think tourism can help foster and protect lasting peace and help develop these areas that have been ravaged by war. We want tourism to develop in a sustainable way, in a way that complements the conservation of fragile habitats and ecosystems, while also being able to make all the treasures that we have to offer accessible to Colombians and the outside world. In that sense ecotourism is a key part of our strategy.</p><h4>What are you doing to attract more tourists to Colombia, and from where do most of the international tourists originate?</h4><p>The US continues to be the number one source of tourists for Colombia. But we also get many visitors from Europe, mainly Spain, and also tourists from other Latin American countries. Tourism is growing in all areas, be it ecotourism, beach and hotel tourism, cultural tourism, or business tourism. We are also looking to attract visitors from new markets and also open new tourism sectors and sites, while developing new products and packages to attract more people to the country. We want to focus on developing Colombian tourism to international standards, with the right certifications, licenses, permits, training, and educational activities that would help us achieve our goals so that Colombia occupies the place it deserves in the global tourism market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the depreciation of the peso affected your performance?</h4><p>Our activity is directly related to the exchange rate. A high exchange rate is the better for us because our expenses are in pesos while our income is in US dollars. Consequently, the situation has been good for Aviatur because people still spend to travel. In 2003, the exchange rate was at COP2,985 per one US dollar, and people still traveled. I do not expect demand to decrease. My view is that our currency has been overvalued. We had good sales in 2015, but taxes are still high in Colombia, which means 60% of our income goes to the government.</p><h4>How many tourists does Colombia receive annually, and what is your outlook for the tourism industry?</h4><p>Colombia received around 1.8 million tourists in 2014, the same as in 1982. The government says that by 2018 Colombia will have 5 million visitors who are not tourists. A tourist is a foreigner who stays overnight in another country. The government counts all visitors, such as people who cross the border from Venezuela to Colombia and back to their country, but that is a visitor and not a tourist. What matters is the number of tourists and, unfortunately, the image of Colombia abroad is still negative. Nearly 50 countries have travel warnings for their citizens coming to Colombia. Nevertheless, the peace treaty with the guerrillas will significantly improve that and could boost tourism in Colombia.</p><h4>Does the image of Colombia abroad match the reality of the country?</h4><p>Colombia's image abroad does not match the reality and it is, in my opinion, a jewel in the rough in Latin America. The world needs to come to Colombia and discover the beauty of its landscapes, its nice people, and the excellent gastronomy. Customer service is excellent and the highlight of this country for the tourism industry is its people.</p><h4>What segments in the tourism industry hold the greatest potential?</h4><p>All of them hold potential. There are architectonical wonders, beautiful beaches, and colonial cities. Certain cities could be promoted overseas thanks to their astonishing colonial architecture, as Mexico has done with some of its cities. In addition, scuba diving is a segment that has seen huge growth in the country in recent years.</p><h4>You have administered Tayrona Park since 2005. Do you plan to administer other national parks?</h4><p>We have administered Tayrona Park since 2005, a temporary role with the aim to create the conditions for sustainable tourism in Tayrona. However, in the future we want to focus on the development of touristic projects on our own land in certain areas of the country. We do not want to continue participating in concession-held land, although it has been an interesting stage for the company. We have given back all the national parks that were on a concession and we are returning them to the government with excellent infrastructure.</p><h4>What measures need to be taken, in addition to the peace agreement, to boost the tourism industry? </h4><p>The tourist site Ciudad Perdida is virtually unknown. Barely 2,000 people travel there a year. It is a three-day trek; however, it is important to let the world know about this place. Furthermore, there are many beaches that can be improved and promoted overseas. Sometimes people complain about the lack of infrastructure and the poor quality of the roads, but to me that is an advantage because it makes driving around the country more attractive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges to implementing your strategy of increasing English language education?</h4><p>In Colombia, wealthy families pay for their children to attend private schools, where they receive bilingual education. That situation leaves underprivileged children at a disadvantage as they are not able to receive the same opportunities. The English Teaching Fellowship Program is shifting that situation. There are 600 fellows, from more than 50 different countries that co-teach with our Colombian teachers, reaching more than 176,000 students from 46 cities in Colombia. The program endorses the notion of our students as global citizens, providing them not only with the opportunity to interact with a native speaker and improve, therefore, their language skills, but to also get to know different cultures from around the world. Additionally, most of the students from public schools do not have textbooks to work with. The ministry has created, in collaboration with teachers, local education authorities, and experts in ELT, textbooks for our students in grades nine, 10, and 11, as well as a suggested English National Curriculum. More than 192,800 textbooks have been distributed across the country, and an interactive version is available free of charge for both students and teachers. </p><h4>What are the main challenges the Ministry of Education has to deal with in the short and long run?</h4><p>Although Colombia needs to keep increasing access to education and reducing the dropout rate (particularly in secondary and upper secondary education), the main challenge faced by the country in the short, medium, and long term is increasing education quality. This is essential for Colombia to increase its productivity, and, more importantly, close the inequality gaps that exist in the country and consolidate internal peace. In the long run, our main challenge is changing the quality trend in order to become the best-educated country of Latin America by 2025. In the short run, our main challenge is increasing the resources for the education sector. Increasing the resources received by the sector so far is fundamental in order to design, develop, consolidate, and expand the programs and policies aimed at increasing education quality. At the moment, the basic educational basket per child in the public sector is around COP2.5 million per year ($806). In a study conducted by the ministry, it was found that we would need COP5 million ($1,612) per child per year in order to close the existing gaps between the public and private sectors. Increasing COP1 million per child would represent a total investment of COP8.6 billion. </p><h4>What are the main programs you are developing to overcome these educational challenges?</h4><p>Since late 2014, we have implemented and strengthened several key programs to overcome our current challenges and increase education quality. Currently, the main program is called Jornada íšnica (Single Shift), aimed at providing eight hours of education to all the children in the country. Public schools have two shifts and every child receives four-hour education, while private schools have a single shift and offer children eight-hour education. Our goal by 2018 is to have 2.3 million students benefiting from this program. So far, we have been able to reach out to 867,000 students. Other significant programs include Teacher Excellence. Under this strategy, we have the Scholarships for Teacher Excellence Program that has to date given out 4,667 scholarships for teachers who want to get a master's degree. In addition, we have over 4,000 tutors who provide in situ training for teachers, which benefits 2.3 million students. We have also changed the way teachers are evaluated in order to focus on their teaching practices instead of their theoretical knowledge. We also established a way in which they can get feedback or support classes for those who need it. Another important strategy refers to educational materials; between 2010 and 2014 we delivered 20 million school texts for language and math. By 2016, we have delivered 10.36 million educational materials for language and math that have benefited 88,000 teachers and over 2.4 million students. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your manufacturing capacity here in Colombia?</h4><p>We only have a factory here in Colombia for construction chemical products. This is where we produce additives for concrete so that the customer can change the features of the concrete to make it easier to dry or to delay the drying process to enable it to be more resistant and solid. Through these additives they can add features to the concrete depending on their needs. If a customer is going to build a bridge then he or she will have different requirements compared to constructing a building, for example. </p><h4>How will the new plant in Brazil strengthen your position, particularly in the Colombian market?</h4><p>We opened what we call the Chemical Complex in Camacari, which is related to the butyl acrylate value chain. There you can produce monomers such as butyl acrylate and acrylic acid, and from that you can derive the production of super absorbent polymers. We are already seeing positive results because we are supplying customers here with acrylic acid and monomers from the butyl acrylate, but we are also supplying customers locally with the super absorbent polymer. For example, these polymers are used for diaper production here in Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador with local customers and globalized ones like Procter &amp; Gamble and Kimberly Clark. </p><h4>How competitive is your market in Colombia in terms price, innovation, and foreign and local investment?</h4><p>There are many customers who have more possibilities to export to external markets. This is one of the positive impacts of the 70% depreciation over the last 18 months. This reduction in terms of the dollar is giving some advantages to our customers who have export capabilities and the opportunity to capitalize abroad. With the depreciation the country gains competitiveness against other nations where it has not been possible to devaluate. Even against countries with a strong devaluation such as Brazil we are gaining competitiveness. It takes some time to adjust and in other areas we see that it is difficult. </p><h4>How will infrastructure developments increase demand for BASF chemicals?</h4><p>We have a presence in almost all industries. We can go into infrastructure through different routes. We have the chemical construction division, one of BASF's 13 different business units. We can also do so by supplying chemicals to customers who are present in the infrastructure sector. There we have dispersions, resins, and other chemicals like monomers, which are used to produce dispersions. We can reach the infrastructure sector in different ways.</p><h4>How does the agriculture sector factor into your portfolio in Colombia?</h4><p>Agriculture is one of the main sectors, and it will increase in importance in the future. Colombia and Ecuador have huge potential to export fresh produce or agricultural commodities. We have a strong portfolio and are investing in the registration of new products and technology. Innovation will continue to play a critical role in the development of agriculture. Sustainability is key, because if you want to export to consumers in Europe or the US, the market wants to know if the bananas or pineapples are produced in a sustainable manner. This is where we are strong; we work with small and large growers to improve capabilities for a more sustainable agriculture sector.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>It will be a challenging year because we started with depreciation, inflation, and El Niño. What will really help us develop positively is being closer to our customers to know what they need, work in collaboration with them, understand their needs, and together create new products and solutions for the market. Sustainability drives will help us differentiate our offers to our customers and the market. Last but not least, the development of our internal capabilities is crucial; the development of our team to understand the market and be able to tackle the opportunities that will arise out there. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important will the peace agreement be for the development of rural Colombia, and what role can agriculture play in achieving peace and stability in the coming years?</h4><p>The Ministry of Agriculture plays a key role in achieving peace. Without a doubt, it is the right setting for various opportunities for progress and development. On the one hand, it is the right time for Colombians to reconsider the countryside and to rediscover the essence of rural development at the heart of being an agricultural country. This is outlined in the Integral Rural Development Policy (Politica de Desarrollo Rural Integral — RRI), which places the family and community as pillars of a balanced economy based on a restructuring and transformation centered around farming. At the same time, the strengthening of this new institutionalism allows for the articulation of programs and projects that integrate committed municipalities with families and organizations, organized by the Ministry of Postconflict, the Office of the High Commission for Peace, and other entities. The test of this institutional transformation is represented by the new agencies for rural development, land, and Territorial Renewal that serve as guides for regional policy. In this sense, the carrying out of the obligations of the Regional Articulation Plans will continue, taking into account the differences and particularities of the country, and the issues of women and young people in the countryside, indigenous groups, vulnerable rural populations, victims of conflict, and the general concept of seeking reconciliation for the country. </p><h4>The Colombia Siembra program is designed to encourage the development of agriculture. What innovations will be implemented as part of this program in 2016?</h4><p>In 1Q2016, producers were offered the chance to express their interest in participating in this plan, and the results have confirmed that there is a strong appetite for turning agriculture into a primary sector of the economy. The provisional information gathered indicates that 391,667 producers are interested in sowing 2,588,075ha of land, surpassing the expectations of the national government, whose objective with the Ministry of Agriculture was 1 million hectares over the coming three years. The people believe in the project; the challenge now is to obtain additional resources to finance double the target that we had set out. This is positive news, and we need to achieve it for the people. We are working together to reinvigorate investment, growth, and employment in the countryside. At the same time, we will soon announce new credit instruments to finance this policy.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the Colombian agricultural sector for 2016?</h4><p>The forecasts of financial organizations in the private sector and the Ministry of the Interior project that the economy will grow by between 2.5% and 3.2%, respectively. We hope that the tendency toward growth of the past two years will be maintained, with growth of between 3% and 3.5% expected for 2016. This growth was sustained thanks to the beneficial exchange rate for permanent export crops like coffee, bananas, and flowers. Elsewhere, rice continues growing, with cultivated land growing by 18% in the second quarter of 2015. Modified yellow corn, according to FENALCE, grew from 51,541 sown ha in the 1Q2014 to 75,720ha in 1Q2015, that is to say an increase of 47% in terms of area, with production expected to stand at around 400,000 tons in the first quarter of this year. We believe that with the reduction of the effects of drought, short-cycle crop yields will be rejuvenated thanks to financial support provided by the government through FINAGRO and the Agrarian Bank, and by projects from MADR such as Colombia Siembra. The Colombia Siembra strategy will continue to expand in the countryside, and in 2016 it is expected that 232,215 new ha of prioritized crops will be sown. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Recently you acquired two companies in Colombia. What is motivating this level of investment?</h4><p>Our company is a German company that operates in the Latin American region, with investments in Argentina, Brazil, and a commercial office in Chile. There was a gap in the northern part of South America, as well as Central America and in Mexico in terms of Knauf products. The company has a presence in North America with Knauf Insulation, which is the glass wool that is used to insulate against weather or even fire. Most of the plants for business are in the US; therefore, we began the analysis of potential investment destinations and Colombia was designated as a good opportunity north of Argentina. There are three plants in Colombia that produce this product, two of which we now own. One of the attractions is that the economic environment is better tailored to companies that want to invest and get returns. For example, the market in Ecuador is smaller, while Peru could present a good opportunity if it was not for the fact that we have a plan to start quarrying gypsum in Chile further down the line, and producing there. That was why we chose Colombia.</p><h4>Why did you decide to come to Latin America at this time?</h4><p>The company momentum is targeting Latin America. In March 2016, we bought a gypsum plant in Honduras. We now have three plants in the region and will continue investing. These two companies were producing three of the main gypsum board types, namely standard, the type used in more humid environments, with the other being for passive fire protection. The final product was joint compound plaster to cover drywall. The difference with Knauf is that we build and sell systems, rather than just offering basic products. We also look into ventures with locals, and are potentially setting up new production facilities. We will establish a joint compound plaster production facility in July in Bogotá to mitigate the high transportation costs in Colombia. The government has made a great deal of effort to improve the transport networks, but much remains to be done.</p><h4>What kind of construction does the system suit best?</h4><p>The biggest market is housing, which is a little harder than the commercial segment, as businesses will never complain as long as we can get their office ready quickly. In Colombia, the biggest area for sales at the moment is in ceilings. The internal drywall market is just opening up. At the moment, builders place bricks and then a board on either side, and instead of using cement, this is a much cleaner and faster method. Our main drivers are currently malls and hotels, because they need their jobs done quickly and the flexibility of our system is attractive to them.</p><h4>Are you exporting from Colombia?</h4><p>This is a major driver for our business. We currently export around 30% of our production, and we aim to reach around 50%. The natural market for us is the Andean region, Central America, and the Caribbean, which is where we are focusing. We are planning to control this expansion into northern Latin America from Colombia. We set up in Honduras but are looking into other markets like Mexico. In Colombia we are on the coast, which is useful. We do not yet have a plant in Bogotá because there are no gypsum quarries in the area.</p><h4>What are your views on the construction industry in Colombia?</h4><p>There was a 6% increase in license approvals in 2015 compared to 2014, meaning there are projects coming. The government was investing a great deal in housing for lower-income people, but as you know the state budget has been reduced because of oil prices, so that could be a challenge. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Forsa's background?</h4><p>Forsa is a pioneering company that has operated in the commercialization and development of construction systems with aluminum formworks in Colombia, South America, Central America, and some countries in Africa and Europe, since 1995. We were first established in Colombia and we now operate in more than 25 countries. The company started as a group of Colombian businessmen and engineers with the goal of transforming the construction sector and developing a more practical, specialized, and efficient system for the benefit of builders. The goal was to improve profitability in the industrialized construction of housing and civilian infrastructure. We were one of the few companies established in the mid 1990s, thanks to some tax advantages in the Cauca area. We have invested in our operations through training people and establishing partnerships with universities, tech centers, and sector associations. Our people are highly specialized and that has been something we have always considered one of our priorities. Today, we employ more than 800 people, 70% of whom are from the region.</p><h4>What are the main characteristics of Forsa's construction system?</h4><p>It is a formwork system that is 100% aluminum and complying with high standards. It also guarantees good performance in housing construction. Building housing units using the Forsa system achieves organized, fast, and progressive processes, maintaining more balanced inventories, reducing labor, contributing to a cleaner, greener construction process, and increasing the productivity and profitability of the construction. With this system, we can develop innovative projects of high-quality architectural design. One of the main challenges we face has been to change the construction culture in the region. Our system allows the industrialized construction of housing, building housing units like a production line, one housing unit per day.</p><h4>Which foreign markets does Forsa operate in?</h4><p>We started exporting in 1999 when we saw the opportunity as a way to balance the situation locally. We started with neighboring countries in Central America and Mexico. The late 1990s and early 2000s were challenging years for the Colombian economy and in 2001-02, 40% of our sales were in Mexico. This was a common trend up until a few years ago and Colombia now represents 40%, Mexico slightly less than 10%, Brazil less than 15%, and Central America (the Dominican Republic, Panama, and so on) making up the remaining part. On top of that we have had projects in Iran, Spain, South Africa, and other markets abroad. At the moment, we are also considering establishing a plant in either India or South Africa; these are our main targets in the short and medium term. However, this project is still at an early stage of development.</p><h4>How important has being located in the Cauca FTZ been for the success of the company?</h4><p>The Cauca FTZ represents the large majority of exports. This FTZ has generated many employment opportunities and industrial development. Throughout the years, we have been able to generate a true associative network between all companies operating here, giving every company more stability. This FTZ has certainly been instrumental for us to reach current levels of performance. Public authorities have developed much-needed infrastructure along with the FTZ, which was key for companies like ours to export. Security levels have also increased since the construction of this FTZ. Cauca has developed significantly in the last decade and made several key infrastructure projects possible, and has increased collaboration between local and regional authorities.</p><h4>Where do you see Forsa in five years?</h4><p>I see Forsa even more consolidated than today, with a strong product portfolio in which innovation plays an even more important role than it does now. I expect the service of renting out formworks expanding to other Latin American countries after it further consolidates in Colombia. We target Peru, Mexico, and Chile first and then other countries in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[constant-growth-and-great-opportunities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which regions have the most investment potential in the real estate sector?</h4><p>The northern coast of Colombia is an attractive investment destination, not only for real estate, but also other economic sectors due to the fact that it has the best ports, in Cartagena, Santa Marta, and Barranquilla. There is plenty of trade and traffic going through those ports, which are strategically and centrally located, providing connections to the Caribbean, North America, Europe, Africa, and the rest of Latin America. Barranquilla is one the most interesting cities along the Atlantic coast because several positive initiatives and incentives have been introduced for businesses and investors; there is a large and well-educated population, and it is only one hour away from Santa Marta and Cartagena. Barranquilla is strategically located to keep growing and offering great opportunities in real estate. The peso's fall against the dollar has made people nervous about real estate in Colombia, but this has also made the local real estate market much more affordable on an international level. We can expect a serious injection of foreign investment along the Atlantic coast this year.</p><h4>What is your target market? </h4><p>We work with all people from all segments of society and all tiers of real estate, from low-income housing to luxury, from houses worth $15,000, to houses worth upward of $400,000. The government has a program called Vivienda Para Ahorradores (Houses For Savers), which helps people own their own houses through subsidies whereby homeowners pay a significantly lower monthly quota on their homes. About 100,000 houses have been sold as part of that program and we have participated with 1,500 houses. Colombians want to own their houses, which is different from Venezuela or many other countries in the region where renting is perfectly acceptable. So this program makes sense for Colombians, even though there have been some doubts regarding its sustainability in the long term.</p><h4>What are the main projects you are working on at the moment?</h4><p>Most of our projects are located along the coast. We have three main projects, each targeting a different segment of the population. One is called Ciudad Caribe, which includes 4,500 units, valued between $15,000 and $30,000. Another big project is Ciudad del Mar, which features more than 3,000 units aimed at middle-income families, worth between COP170 million and COP280 million. And we also have a top-tier project between Barranquilla and Cartagena called Novaterra, which is like a small city in itself, and houses there go from $400,000 onwards. We also have other large-scale projects that we are working on at the moment. For example, we are involved in 52-storey hotel AC Marriot by the sea, Amura, which will be the tallest hotel and condo in Cartagena. We were previously involved with various projects in the US, but now we have decided to focus on the domestic market; most of our projects are in Bogotá, Barranquilla, and along the Atlantic-Caribbean coast in the north of the country.</p><h4>What are you expecting for 2016 in the Colombian construction sector and what are your targets for the year?</h4><p>I expect to grow around 15-20% in 2016 as our projects continue to come online. Government housing subsidies will continue to spur the sector and add to its growth figures. The depreciation of the peso might tighten up the domestic market somewhat, but it will also entice foreign investments into Colombia, especially from the US, mainly from Colombian expatriates or people with Colombian roots living there. Other sectors will also keep growth rates stable, with the coffee sector, flowers, and other sectors expected to post high export rates due to the added competitiveness they will see internationally from the weakening of the peso. We expect a growth rate for Colombia of 2.8% in 2016, which is not ideal compared to previous years, but at least it is still growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The government is active in getting low-income households on the housing market. Can you explain the initiatives?</h4><p>This is the year of housing and the national government made 150,000 subsidies available for families wishing to own a housing unit as well as a series of plans tailored to the socioeconomic characteristics of Colombian households. First of all, My House Now is for savers and helps households earning up to two minimum wages to acquire priority interest housing. Urban priority interest housing is worth up to the equivalent of 70 minimum wages; therefore, the government assigned subsidies for up to 30 minimum wages to cover the down payment and 5% rate of interest on the mortgage. Secondly, My House Now is part of a scheme that aims to reduce paperwork and procedures, facilitating the acquisition low income housing to households with incomes between two and four minimum wages. The government provides a subsidy of up to 20 minimum wages for the initial fee plus a housing subsidy interest rate of 4%. Thirdly, My House Now subsidizes interest rate on priority interest housing and low income housing, whereby we grant a subsidy to the interest rate of loans of 5 or 4%.</p><h4>Foreign investment in Colombia has an increasing impact on national GDP. What opportunities would you highlight within the construction sector for international investors?</h4><p>The arrival of foreign capital to non-speculative investments like the construction of housing benefits the housing market and the national economy. In a turbulent economic environment, business confidence figures kept growing and construction is one of the economic sectors where foreign investment continues to grow, witnessing 14% growth in 2015.</p><h4>With programs like My House Now, Colombia has endeavored to develop social housing. How would you assess its impact on the housing market and what are the plans for the near future?</h4><p>Government housing programs have had a positive effect, making the housing market dynamic and creating jobs. Sales have grown by 6.9% and permits to build housing rose by 5% in the last 12 months, all driven by these programs. Employment in the sector climbed to 3.1 million people and we project to close 2016 with at least 3.4 million people. In the next few years, we will continue to generate economic growth with the development of our plans, with which we intend to build 450,000 housing units with direct support from the national government. The offer is varied and subsidies are intended to cover various population segments, from the most vulnerable sectors to consolidated middle class families.</p><h4>The year 2016 is set to be the year the armed conflict will end. How can the peace process influence the construction sector?</h4><p>Housing plays a key role in peace building. During the post-conflict process, we will find institutional challenges and cities, municipalities, local authorities, local communities, and departments must be ready to take on the tasks and responsibilities necessary to sustaining peace. These processes need to emphasize social inclusion and adapt to the new conditions of our democracy. Former armed actors and victims will become urban actors; therefore, cities will take on the challenge of inclusion and reconciliation, and housing is part of this. The government has sought to ensure the housing rights of the victims of the armed conflict. People are the most vulnerable in urban areas, with investments of about COP2.2 billion through the Free Housing Program framework for the care of housing for victims of the internal armed conflict, benefiting about 60,000 households in more than 220 municipalities and 28 regions and Bogotá. Much of the tensions in the country lie in the huge gap between rural and urban Colombia. Our main challenge is to integrate rural areas with large urban development poles. This is critical and as a government we have made closing regional gaps an explicit objective of the National Development Plan 2014-2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your strategy regarding planning and design?</h4><p>We are driven to have projects finished on time, according to the budget and to the quality required by the client; this is our main purpose. The founder of the company, my father, used to say, “Colombia is about to be built," and today the country is still under construction. We, therefore, modified it to our vision, which is one of transformation, progress, and wellbeing through infrastructure. This means that we truly want to be a key player in the transformation of Colombia through the provision of quality infrastructure. We do so with the clear understanding that most of the resources that we manage are public resources, and we, therefore, have to ensure that those resources are well invested to make Colombia a better place; this is what drives us. We have a number of testing laboratories around the country in addition to our central lab in Bogotá, which is operated as a center of excellence from which quality standards are transferred to the satellite labs. Planning and design are key steps to ensure that projects are well structured before they are put forward to the market. Our experience in delivering projects positions us on a good platform to provide planning and design services.</p><h4>What factors have driven the company's success?<br></h4><p>The main factor is the track record of the company; we have successfully delivered more than 150 projects in Colombia, ranging from road design contracts to the supervision of multi-year concession contracts. This experience is instrumental in the preparation of tenders for our public sector clients. Another important factor is the financial health of the company; we strive to maintain strong balance sheets and financial indicators that keep us ahead of similar companies. Our partners provide project experience as well as operational and financial capabilities that, when combined with our own, results in successful tenders for large contracts. Finally, we have strengthened our bid team, which invariably produces impeccable offers. All of these factors have lead to an attractive client portfolio that includes INVIAS, ANI, IDU, the Ministry of Transport, Fondo de Adaptación, and the Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications, all of whom are modernizing the infrastructure and transportation services in Colombia. Traditionally, we have focused on providing services to public sector clients, but nowadays we have expanded our portfolio to cover 4G concessionaires, particularly in our role as Lenders Technical Advisors, a key role providing lenders with confidence in the execution of these megaprojects.</p><h4>How do you assess the efforts that the government is making to develop the 4G roads?</h4><p>I welcome the initiative and the effort that the government is making to push forward the development of road infrastructure in Colombia. The many offers that were received by ANI for the 4G program demonstrates that there is interest in the market, and it is encouraging to see large international contractors and concessionaires associated with traditional local construction firms, as this should bring expertise and state-of-the-art construction techniques. I expect to see positive transfer of knowledge as a result. On the other hand, the 30-50 offers received by ANI for the Interventorí­a contracts was excessive, indicating that the tender requirements were low. This raises doubts regarding the quality of the service that ANI will receive from some of the winners, who in some cases do not have a track record of delivering projects of this magnitude. The level of planning and design at which the tender documents were issued is better than what we have seen in the past; however, there is still room for improvement. The provision of infrastructure through concession contracts will ensure that the road network is maintained for the duration of the contracts, providing the required level of service that is otherwise difficult to achieve. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was the previous year for MPI?</h4><p>MPI sells asphalt to the construction business and we are expecting 2016 to be much better that 2015. In 2015, we forecasted the demand to exceed 70,000 metric tons per month; however, it dropped to 35,000, half of what we were expecting. We export asphalt after buying it from the refinery and transforming it to meet international standards. We have been able to do that for many specifications. There are more players in this market right now, rising from four to six, which has reduced our share of the market. Generally, the road construction business has been delayed because it has not been easy for developers to start new projects and environmental, social, and other issues are delaying projects. We are preparing for the demand of asphalt to increase compared to last year, and consequently we expect the price to rise.</p><h4>What new innovations are you adding to your products?</h4><p>We introduced asphalt rubber eight years ago, and this is the best solution for pavements. It is asphalt mixed with tire-crumb rubber. We did all the necessary tests and implemented the technology, and proved that we were providing an excellent product that had been successful in Europe and the US. We are extending this level of quality and value addition and have a new division specializing in pavement preservation. These surface treatment techniques are common in Europe and the US. We are the only ones doing this maintenance service, which puts us ahead of any competitors.</p><h4>How much of your total production are you exporting?</h4><p>Exports reached close to 50% of our production in 2015. We were able to ship nearly 6,000 metric tons per month, which was aided by the price of the dollar. The asphalt is shipped from Hawaii to Maine, because we sell it to global suppliers. The use of asphalt rubber is entirely new in Latin American markets, and even in the US. It is used from California to Texas, but other states are not using it yet. We know that technique, and there is no patent holding on it. We are looking to other countries. Logistically, it is not that challenging for us because we have facilities in Cartagena, next to the Caribbean Sea. We make a major effort to participate in meetings and conferences to increase awareness of our services. Part of our strategy here in Colombia is to find an additional refinery to increase the diversity of the pricing, because here the price is fixed.</p><h4>What is your forecast on asphalt consumption in Colombia in the short term?</h4><p>It might rise the next year, but not to the level the government is expecting. Besides, cement companies want to get involved in the road construction business. They are of course already involved, but they want to move into the pavement business. I do not see 2016 being easy; however, the good news is that we are producing more value-added products. Contractors do not just look at price, they look at the quality and the way we work.</p><h4>What do you expect of MPI in the coming year?</h4><p>It is difficult to forecast projects. I can at least say that in terms of revenue we are expecting the same figures as 2015. In terms of products it is going to be different. Asphalt products and services will be better. We sell half of our product abroad, but those are spot businesses. We will import, not every month but at least once every three months. These commodity companies are vulnerable, because around 50% of their sales depend on 10 customers. At the same time, they want to improve the asphalt themselves but have only one supplier. We buy from Ecopetrol Barranca, but want to diversify our sources, too. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2015 for Gelco?</h4><p>Overall, 2015 was a complex year. The entire country faced difficulties when it came to securing raw materials; however, that drove us to become more efficient and creative, looking into alternative sources in US and Asian countries. We also had an increase in our costs due to the fact that we depend on the US dollar, against which our currency depreciated. When our plants are working at full capacity, we export 57% of our production. The gelatin industry is a sector that always tends to export more than it sells locally and this is because most countries, with the exception of the US, do not produce these products. </p><h4>What factors are behind the lack of raw materials for manufacturing jelly products in Colombia?</h4><p>One of the main reasons for the lack of raw materials in the country is the lack of export restrictions for raw material producers. They choose to export rather than sell to the local market. It is not a problem of capacity to serve the local market, but of willingness to serve this. Every month between 100,000 and 150,000 skin units are exported. If you multiply every unit by 18kg, which is the average weight that we can use, then you can understand how many kilograms of this raw material we use. Both our industry and the leather sector cannot compete with foreign players because we pay in Colombian pesos, and abroad they pay in USD. In 2015, we stopped production for an equivalent of two months, which drives up costs even further. Another factor is the free trade agreements Colombia signed with countries like Mexico. From that we see how other countries in the region have taxes for leather exporters, creating a level playing field for the local and foreign markets. However, Colombia is the only country in Latin America with no exports restrictions at all. We created a lobbying group to represent our interests to the government and protect our industry. We try to document the situation and provide facts and statistics from our sectors. Unfortunately, the government sees us as an industry aiming to live off subsidies, with no commitment to work. There is a lack of real interest from the government to address the situation, and it has become increasingly difficult to do business in this industry.</p><h4>In 2008, you acquired a production plant from Kraft in Brazil. What drove that decision?</h4><p>The plant is the largest cowhide plant in the world. From the beginning of our operation, we had Brazilian managers in the factory; therefore, we understand the particularities of the Brazilian market and the local needs. One of the main challenges with that plant came from the staffing point of view, in terms of costs. This move was thought to expand the export side of our business and we transformed the factory from a local producer to a global player, raising the standard levels. Today, it is a mature company, regardless of the current economic situation of the country. Over the past 15 years, we have seen an increasing level of specialization and technicality in the industry alongside the traditional artisan section of the industry. This has allowed for greater flexibility in the market as a whole. </p><h4>How would you rate Barranquilla's economic development?</h4><p>Barranquilla's growth has been a surprise for both locals and foreigners. In the last decade, we have seen a boom in housing and infrastructure that has changed the face of the city. We have also seen a boom in population in the city with many people venturing here from other regions. We have an economy that is focused on exports, which means that the economy is dynamic. We have also seen an increase in cost of living and services such as hospitality and restaurants. This has been accompanied by an increase in the purchasing power of people in the city. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the flagship projects of the company?</h4><p>In Barranquilla, we developed the Corridor of the Maritime Port, a maritime infrastructure concession that provides access to the main maritime ports in the city. This infrastructure represented a turning point for the city and its logistics development. We started the construction in 2010 and completed it by 2014. This infrastructure has been a key element in the development of Barranquilla, providing a solution to traffic problems as well. The greater context of the port development are the FTAs Colombia has signed in recent years, which will leverage Barranquilla's role and weight in the national economy. We have also just completed a 7,000sqm low thermic emission plant, the only one of its kind in Latin America, with a $8.5 million investment.</p><h4>What other opportunities do you see for Barranquilla in the context of the FTAs?</h4><p>The construction sector can strongly benefit from these FTAs and the arrival of foreign investment. It goes without saying that imports will experience rapid development in the upcoming years, especially if foreign exchange rates continue along the same trend.</p><h4>Foreign investment in construction in the first nine months of 2015 increased significantly compared to the same period the previous year. Will this trend continue in 2016 and beyond?</h4><p>This trend will undoubtedly continue. There are many Colombians living abroad who have invested in housing and other properties in the last year and this will only increase in 2016. The country is working on replacing oil as one of the main income sources, and peace will also increase the flow of investment into the country, especially the construction sector. Hopefully 2016 will bring positive transformations and projects that will boost the country's growth and development even more. The country is also in desperate need of tax reform with a long-term vision. This is required to generate greater interest among investors and would help generate further income from other non-oil sectors and boost industrial activity and exports.</p><h4>What are some of the key infrastructure challenges that Barranquilla still faces?</h4><p>The city must complete channeling the streams in various areas of the city, particularly the south, which will save many lives. The city also needs to expand current road infrastructure to reduce traffic congestion. In terms of our involvement, we will lead a project on Barranquilla's only island, La Loma; we received 50% of the land, owned by the government, and purchased the remainder from all the different owners. We will pay back the government with the construction of the new council building for Barranquilla. Eventually, we will urbanize 100ha of the city. This project has a budget of COP450 billion. We will later commercialize the industrial lots of the island, and we are now about to start construction works. The goal is to connect La Loma with the Fair and Conference Center of Barranquilla.</p><h4>How do you see the company evolving in the future?</h4><p>We will consolidate the work we have done in our first five years of activity. We have undergone a structural transformation in order to make the next step, and now we want to grow nationally. We will have a role to play in the second wave of 4G projects. We see great opportunities both locally and nationally and we will expand activities to cities such as Bogotá and Medellí­n. We are set to start some key project such as the Children Development Centers for the Atlantic Coast, a project with a budget of COP57 billion.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the company in 2016?</h4><p>I hope we have a year as positive as 2015, and our goal is to reach or surpass a COP154 billion turnover. We want to further consolidate and strengthen our position in Barranquilla and the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has characterized Latco's developments since its inception in 1998?</h4><p>Latco is a family-owned business that builds in a variety of sectors including universities, schools, hospitals, and commercial centers. We have done a great deal of work in hospitals and social housing; however, our main projects have been in the industrial area. In early 2015, we were awarded the bid for construction of the international terminal for the airport in Cali, and we started construction in July. Our goal is to complete the project in October 2016. The project has an investment of COP104 billion. We are leading in a consortium with 70% of the participation, along with a Portuguese firm.</p><h4>How important is this new terminal for the development of Cali and the economy?</h4><p>Since the current airport infrastructure was built in 1971, the only renovations made were structural reinforcements, because the terminal is in a zone with strong seismic activity. There have been electrical improvements, but in general little infrastructural work has been done. They have been working on the international terminal for about 10 years, mainly because the airport is operating through a concession. This new terminal will also be instrumental in attracting investment for the city. Generally speaking, Cali has a great need to improve its infrastructure to solve circulation and mobility issues.</p><h4>Latco's vision is to strengthen the footprint of the company in the national market by 2016. Do you think you will be able to achieve this?</h4><p>We are in the process. For example, we have undertaken many projects in areas near to Cali. We currently have a construction project in Buenaventura, which is a port on the Pacific. We also have another job in Bucaramanga, which is in the northeast of Colombia.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the economy of Cali?</h4><p>The connection with Buenaventura is important for Cali. Many businesses are established in Cali because of the imports and exports that go through Buentaventura. My expectations for Cali are very high. Cali and its surroundings have been able to attract investment; for example, the Marriott was built in Cali, and we worked on that project. Unilever started operating a new plant close to Cali, which we also built. The pharmaceutical business is growing, especially through Tecnoquimicas, and we are involved in building its plants and offices. Not only is Tecnoquimicas a local firm, it is also exporting to different countries. There is plenty to be done in Cali but the economy is in a good position to accomplish it.</p><h4>Are you planning on expanding to other markets outside of Colombia?</h4><p>We are excited about expanding into international operations. For example, last year we were invited to bid on a cement plant in Peru. We are also considering partnerships with different firms. The correct thing to do is first consolidate our work here in Colombia, and then we will start thinking about going abroad.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Latco in the year ahead?</h4><p>The airport is a challenging job for us, and we have to finish it in October 2016. Latco is investing a lot of its resources to make that happen. We are also considering undertaking our own projects in the commercial and social housing segments, and housing in general. We are positive about 2016, because we anticipate that the city is going to be building more infrastructure. Overall, the economy is doing well in Cali and the construction is going to do well, too. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Navigating Colombia]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[navigating-colombia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>One of your landmark projects in Colombia is improving the navigability of the Magdalena River. How is that project progressing?</h4><p>We are dealing now with the pre-construction phase of the project and will have until mid-2016 to complete it. We initially took over the river's control in June 2015 and we were affected by the drought in the region. However, we managed to maintain navigability in the river, and we have also undertaken the financial side of the project. The project foresees five years of construction, but we expect to complete it in four years. This is a rather short-term project that presents a 13.5-year concession between pre-construction and construction activity. We foresee intelligent dredging in the river, especially between Barrancabermeja and Puerto Salgar, which are key areas for project feasibility. We looked at similar projects like the river Rhine in Germany to develop something similar in Colombia.</p><h4>You stated that investing in the Magdalena River project is safer than investing in 4G projects. Why is that?</h4><p>In our opinion, the Magdalena River project actually has less or smaller risks than the 4G projects have. For example, the environmental issues concerning the project are almost non-existent in the Magdalena River. The licensing for this project is also less bureaucratic and we expect minimum social challenges as well. This occurs because we are doing the works of maintenance in the river and the navigable channel since the first day when we assumed control of the river. We will carry out 150 works of breakwaters that will not affect either villages or towns along the river and we are committed to not causing any social or environmental concerns.</p><h4>What other sectors offer great potential for you?</h4><p>We can play an active part in the energy projects the government wants to boost. There is a lack of energy infrastructure along the coast and we could offer many alternatives as solutions there. Water recycling systems and sewage water projects are also areas where there is much to be done in Colombia. Water is the main challenge in the 21st century, and Odebrecht can positively affect Colombia's development in that regard. The water tariff culture in the country must change. We also see great potential in the agribusiness industry.</p><h4>Do you think that the corruption charges that the CEO of Odebrecht faces in Brazil could affect your operations in Colombia?</h4><p>We truly are a decentralized company. We are a group with more than 100 companies distributed in 15 different business areas. Each company acts independently and, because of that, problems abroad do not affect our local operations. Besides, we consider ourselves a Colombian company; we have been operating in this country continuously for almost 25 years and most of our workforce in the country is made up of native Colombians. Today, we have over 6,000 people who depend directly and indirectly on Odebrecht in Colombia. We are also a highly reputable company from the performance and financial points of view in Colombia thanks to our activity throughout these years. One of our main assets is our people; we invest a great deal in them and have training facilities, offering programs and courses to our people.</p><h4>Where do you see the company in 2017, the company's 25th anniversary in Colombia?</h4><p>We are among the top-10 construction companies in Colombia. We want to be among the top five. In addition, we want to become the most attractive company for young people to work for when finishing their studies. We want to generate benefits for our people, our activities, and our society. We want to further help Colombia to develop its infrastructure and be ready to take on future challenges associated with its continuous growth and development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Flood Control]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[flood-control]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What projects is FCC involved in throughout the country?</h4><p>We have two projects; one is the new control tower for El Dorado International Airport and another building next to the tower, which is the civil aeronautics management building. The latter will control the airspace in Colombia along with another such center in Barranquilla. The control tower is a 90m high building, doubling the current size of the tower. Both projects are very important for the expansion of the airport. We expect to inaugurate the tower in November this year. The second project we currently handle is the flood control project of the Bogotá River for the Regional Autonomous Corporation of Cundinamarca. We dredged the river to an average of 2m and built a dike and small beach areas in order to control the growth of the rivers and avoid future floods. By doing this, we doubled the hydraulic capacity of the river from 100 cubic meters per second to 200 cubic meters per second. At the same time, this project also includes the development of natural areas along the river to compensate communities for the activity we currently carry out. This includes planting over 100,000 trees. We are talking about a $60 million to $70 million investment.<br>What is the importance of the 4G highway projects for Colombia?<br>As of October 2015, there have been almost 20 projects as part of the 4G tender waves and most of them need to be financially closed now. This is important also because in a year's time the projects should be completed and the financial closing reassures parties of having the funding necessary for the construction of the projects. This is a common situation and we have seen projects being postponed for five or even 10 years already. This is bad, since the concessionaire also sees its terms postponed, and that limits part of the funding it counted on for the construction of the project. </p><h4>What are some of the challenges the infrastructure development sector faces right now in Colombia?</h4><p>Land availability and land property are some of the main issues right now. This also includes relationships with local communities and environmental licensing. At the same time, the country faces a challenge in terms of project and equity management. There should be a more common understanding of the importance of these projects, because the country needs them for its future development.</p><h4>What are the main elements foreign companies should take into account when targeting projects in Colombia?</h4><p>One of the main elements is to have foreign expertise in such projects, which FCC has with the main infrastructure projects we developed in Spain. Also, foreign companies require a local partner; a company that understands and knows the local market. In this context, it is very important to establish clear roles for both parties. Having said that, I think that PPPs have great potential here and have to be fully exploited.</p><h4>What coming projects will FCC be participating in?</h4><p>We will be actively participating in the Toyo Tunnel, the longest such infrastructure in the country at 9.8km, which has a budget of over COP1 trillion. The expansion of the Wastewater Treatment Plant of Salitre is another project and has a budget of more than $500 million. This project is publicly funded, The World Bank being one of the public organizations backing it.</p><h4>How do you see FCC developing in Colombia in the next couple of years?</h4><p>We want to consolidate our activity here with the two projects I mentioned. We know that over 85% of the infrastructure projects here require joint ventures and PPPs, meaning private investment. Our consolidation will come with our increasing participation in several of these projects. There is the third wave of 4G projects coming up soon and FCC will try to position itself as a key player for the development of some of these projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[An Infrastructure Revolution]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[an-infrastructure-revolution]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much do you expect the construction sector to contribute to the Colombian economy in 2016? </h4><p>The average share of the infrastructure sector in GDP has been around 3% for the past five years. I do not expect this figure to change dramatically in 2016, because of the huge investments in the road concession program that will commence late this year. However, taking into account that the oil and gas sector will lose its share in the economy, other sectors, such as ours, will increase in relevance.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that Colombia faces in developing its infrastructure projects?</h4><p>In the short term, the main challenges are mainly related to managing financing and environmental licensing. Our main goal is to overcome these issues in order to start the execution of the construction phase of these infrastructure projects. Once this happens, our next efforts will be to focus on land acquisition for the first units.</p><h4>What steps is CCI taking to ensure that SMEs play a role in infrastructure development?</h4><p>Last year CCI was part of a roundtable lead by the Vice President's office, which aimed to outline the obstacles that SMEs are facing in the sector, and to identify exactly what is standing in the way of them finding new and different business opportunities. The main conclusions of this exercise suggested that an assessment of the incentives that Colombia's Procurement Act offers in terms of access to tenders and bidding processes must be carried out. Figures show that the majority of the processes offered by national and regional governments end with just one player, which means that there is no real competition. Corruption is also still a major problem in the procurement process, and this issue illustrates the need for public policy to be oriented toward building capacity and creating a standardized system for applications. Thankfully, the OECD commission that is assessing Colombia's admission to the organization has shared its concern over the lack of standardized forms with us, and I hope that its recommendations and the results contribute to convincing the government about the importance of this matter for the strengthening and development of SMEs.</p><h4>Has the Colombian PPP law made the country more attractive as an investment destination?</h4><p>Our PPP law was introduced for understandable reasons. However, our competitive advantage in the region is not the law itself, but the economic guarantees that Colombia offers to investors. The country has long had effective rule of law and tight fiscal discipline, both of which help investors feel more comfortable. The challenge we have now is to maintain this positive image abroad, while working to overcome the threat of Dutch Disease and the challenges presented by the drop in global oil prices in 2015.</p><h4>What will the infrastructure of Colombia look like in 2020? </h4><p>By 2020 we will have a modern and service-oriented road system. This implies a revolution in comparison with what we have now. The construction of more than 140 viaducts and 150 tunnels will change the experience of traveling by road, and will increase the country's competitiveness dramatically. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of the company, and what projects have defined your tenure here?</h4><p>Ferropetrol is a railway project that stretches from Neiva to La Dorada. La Dorada is 385km existing corridor, which means we do not face social and community conflicts in its implementation. This project foresees the mobilization of cargo from Neiva to the center of the country and passenger transport in the medium term after approximately 10 years. Certain areas of this project have narrow-gauge railways. We expect to start construction works in a period of three years and be operational in five years' time. The main opportunity this project represents for investors is the high profitability level; the current cost of the project is $700 million, and we aim to raise equity of between 30% and 40%. This means we expect to attract foreign investors to join us and cover some $250-300 million. The RoI of this project is high, at around 30-40% as of the fourth year of operations, which is when we will start to distribute dividends.</p><h4>How do you assess the state of development of the railway sector in Colombia?</h4><p>We currently handle as many as eight railway projects in the country; four of them have already received the green light from the National Infrastructure Agency (ANI) from a feasibility point of view. The remaining four are still in a development stage and these are in already constructed corridors. The cost of rehabilitating these kilometers is $1 million per km, whereas for totally new projects the cost per km is around $3 million to $4 million. Colombia used to have 5,000 active km of railway, whereas now the country has 1,200km. There are 3,500km of inactive railway now in this country; there are many opportunities for foreign companies. In fact, the projects we are involved in represent a total of 2,500km of railway that will be rehabilitated. The problem with inactive railway lines is pretty common across South America; after the 1950s many railway lines were abandoned due to these being property of the state and the difficulties they had to make this sector profitable. Currently, we have seen a regional reactivation of the railway industry under private and public-private partnership schemes. The rehabilitation of inactive railways would be a key economic driver for the country and its logistics sector. Railway would give support to road transportation and reduce transportation costs across the country.</p><h4>How do you see the logistics sector evolving up to 2020?</h4><p>Colombia manages around 280 million tons of cargo every year, and cargo logistics will undergo a massive transformation. Final consumers will benefit from this transformation through lower transportation costs, increased agility, multimodal transportation systems, and the capacity to transport large amounts of cargo. Multimodal logistic transport systems will definitely be implemented in Colombia. The Magdalena river represents a key project for this transformation as well. We have seen cooperatives of truck owners and companies investing in Ferropetrol, because they understand the need to do so in order to survive in the future. We have a company of 700 trucks that has already agreed on investing in Ferropetrol, and we just need to formalize everything and make it public. Nevertheless, this is a good indicator of market activity and the opportunities this project has, as well as its importance in the transformation of the Colombian logistics sector.</p><h4>What role can PPPs play in the transformation of the logistics sector in Colombia?</h4><p>PPPs certainly have a vital role to play. We have become highly specialized in PPPs and we currently have PPPs totaling as much as $30 billion in logistics, real estate, education, health, and so on. This is a segment that offers many opportunities to foreign investors across the country. Colombia has a high deficit of infrastructure in all the sectors and PPPs are just the perfect tool to close those gaps. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company developed since its foundation in 1962?</h4><p>The Colombian Air Force (CAF) was founded 96 years ago, and during the development of its institutional mission it was deemed necessary to create an air transportation firm to connect the remote regions of the country. Most of those regions were among the least developed areas of Colombia, and commercial airlines did not have any interest in operating flights there. Satena was created to offer national services to those remote areas using the pilots from the CAF, and that mission has always remained clear. We have played a key role in generating a network to connect all the regions of the country.</p><h4>Satena expects to have over 1 million passengers in 2016. What factors will lead to attaining that success? </h4><p>We have implemented several strategies to consolidate the company in Colombia. We have always brought the latest technology to our aircrafts in order to provide our customers with a good service as well as security. Our customers know that Satena is the only government-backed airline in Colombia. Customers see us as one of the safest travel companies for domestic travel. We are strict with the quality of our service and the fulfillment that we offer. We have added four brand-new planes to our fleet in order to guarantee the quality of our flights.</p><h4>Which routes are the most heavily trafficked?</h4><p>Our main destinations are the most isolated geographical areas, which are in the western, southern, and eastern areas of Colombia. These are not typical destinations for tourists, but for rather for Colombian nationals. Those regions have not experienced much development, and some of them even struggle with an ongoing guerrilla presence. We do not fly to the northern regions, where cities like Santa Marta, Cartagena, and Barranquilla are located. Our mission is not to fly where the rest of airlines are, but instead serve the destinations forgotten by commercial operators.</p><h4>Besides the important social role that Satena plays in Colombia, what other advantages differentiate you from your competitors?</h4><p>We do not want to compete with other companies, as that is not our mission. Competing with those companies would also not be easy. Competition among the large airlines is already strong, and our goal is not to compete with them. Satena will stop its services once a commercial airline finds a potential market where it is flying right now. That is why Satena flies to routes that connect the most remote regions of Colombia.</p><h4>Are there any particular regions or cities that need to be included among your destinations?</h4><p>There are regions such as the Amazonas that have this need. It would be costly to send a large aircraft there, but we are thinking of sending new smaller planes. We are planning to add some 19-seat planes to our fleet to be able to connect certain cities in the Amazonas to the rest of Colombia.</p><h4>What benefits could the peace agreement with the FARC bring for Satena?</h4><p>The peace agreement will help tourism, and more foreigners will come. Many of our destinations are in areas where the guerrilla militia has had great presence. Tourism in those areas has not developed as a result of that, even though there are some regions with amazing landscapes and excellent locations for outdoor sports. The great outdoors in Colombia are fantastic; however, a tourism industry could not develop in those regions because of FARC and ELN. If the government is able to close an accord with both groups, tourism in Colombia will grow exponentially, and those remote regions will have a chance to develop. Caño Cristales is the most beautiful river in the world, situated in a place where guerrilla activity was high and was off limits to travelers as a result. These days, the guerrilla presence in that area has diminished and people can access those natural wonders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do your international operations complement your local operations?</h4><p>We have different partnerships with companies around the world that give us the ability to move products and merchandise around the world. We support land, sea, and air shipments; the whole package. We can import products from all over the world, take care of the customs process, move the product from ports to any city within Colombia, manage the warehouse operation, and then handle the distribution to our customer clients both for modern and traditional trade (all channels), all of these giving our customers an integrated view of the operation.</p><h4>How do government-backed infrastructure projects benefit your business and the logistics sector in general?</h4><p>The investments will be a huge benefit for us, for the sector overall, and a crucial benefit to Colombia. The government's extensive investment in infrastructure projects will help us achieve our ambitions even more effectively and will expand our capabilities. In the last couple of years, the economy in Colombia has been outstanding and the global economic difficulties have had a minimal impact on Colombian growth. We do not discriminate based on company size; we serve the largest to the smallest companies, so we have tried to develop a custom-fit type of logistic service depending on the client and the sector in which the client operates. Some cities are growing at a faster rate compared to others, but the new infrastructural investments, roads, and ports, for example, are changing the whole landscape and opening up much more opportunities and potential.</p><h4>What is the scope of your consulting services?</h4><p>We have a strong and unique consulting service at Almaviva. We do not go to our clients with theoretical analyses or recommendations; we give them solid, practical, on the ground, specific, and in-depth consulting services. We have 76 years of logistics experience and a highly experienced consulting team, which is what we leverage for our clients. We do not want to just execute the logistic operation; we want to optimize the way our customers are leveraging the logistics operation and services. We want to give them a strategy and framework that suits their needs in terms of efficiency, financial and operational results, and, more importantly, their service quality to their customers. This will all have a final benefit on our customers' market growth.</p><h4>What kind of financial products do you offer and how have they grown and evolved over the last few years?</h4><p>Our finance products have had huge importance for Almaviva. We are part of the Banco de Bogotá and the Grupo Aval, and we have a huge financial and economical background. For this reason, financial products are a critical part of our business, and we are one of the few logistics companies that offers these unique products in Colombia. We enable our customers to get bank credit by providing them with certificates of deposit for their merchandise. We have different markets, industries, and clients that work with us in Colombia, and we have an outstanding track record in these 76 years of experience.</p><h4>How is the exchange rate affecting or benefiting Almaviva?</h4><p>Exchange rates do not affect Almaviva directly, but affects our clients in different ways depending on the industry and sector they operate in. For some industries, the impact is positive, while for others it is negative. The job of Almaviva is to understand our customers by knowing their requirements and needs so we can redesign and operate their logistics operations to make sure they have significant cost and time reductions, which will allow them to counter the impacts of a disadvantageous exchange rate. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the current economic context influence in the government's investment plans for transport infrastructure?</h4><p>We are working to continue with a program of new highways, the concessions of which are fully allocated and running. We also promote the development of a transport system based on what we call intelligent infrastructure, where we not only construct roads but we promote an efficient logistics system through intermodal connectivity and competitiveness, linking the private sector as the main actor. In this context, the Fourth Generation program is an alternative for the development of road infrastructure in the country, accelerated by ensuring the quality of roads and facilitating the country's competitiveness.</p><h4>What new developments will we see in the national transport network in the short term?</h4><p>The planning and execution of major road infrastructure that the government has been promoting have reduced risks for investors and this has influenced the influx of foreign capital. Among the most notable developments are institutional strengthening through the creation of the Vice Ministry of Infrastructure, the National Infrastructure Agency, and the Funding Institution for National Development, which focuses on structuring projects. The PPP law was enacted in 2012, introducing improvements in the procurement regime. We have also sought to consolidate the national road network through increased connectivity between centers of production and consumption with the major cities, port areas, and borders that have shorter travel times and operating costs. This has enabled production and marketing of low-cost goods produced and consumed throughout the country, which has increased competitiveness and improved the quality of products. For this reason we are expanding the portfolio of infrastructure projects in all transport modes to improve conditions for the mobilization of cargo and passengers. In the National Development Plan 2015-2018, one of the crosscutting strategies was the construction of the PMTCT. This articulates the national logistics system and seeks to identify a portfolio of transport projects in the short, medium, and long term (2015-2030) with an intermodal approach that responds to the present and future needs of the economy. This project portfolio is established under an appropriate methodology, which identifies the projects required to meet the present and future demands of the road, river, rail, airport, and port networks. By December 2018, the country will have about 11,000km of national roads under concession. ANI had about 6,820km, 1,870km of which correspond to dual carriageways built through concession. We will continue with programs like Prosperity Corridors by Invias, and we will also structure a road-paving program that prioritizes those necessary sections for closing regional gaps. We will boost the development of the tertiary network through a joint effort with institutions, promoting the use of local labor. All these actions will stimulate the economy and generate employment both directly and indirectly. Therefore, all other structuring programs of projects advanced under this government enjoy a degree of maturity that establish not only an excellent distribution of risks in contracts but a guarantee of legal stability that allows us to advance with greater certainty in implementing them. The sectors with growth expectations, such as industry and infrastructure, will benefit from this first wave and thanks to these sectors, the economic slowdown will be orderly and gradual, and recovery will begin to strengthen in the 2H2016.</p><h4>What measures does Colombia have in place to regulate the expansion of mobile applications offering private shuttle services?</h4><p>First it is important to point out that we have a regulation that states that passenger transport is considered a public service. Therefore, you cannot use private transport to provide public passenger service. Secondly, the government sees technology platforms as a tool that duly empowered transport companies can use to improve service delivery in order to be more efficient and accessible to the user. In this context, we have been regulating the conditions to be met by technology to be used in public transport passenger platforms. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What underpins Colombia's growth despite the negative factors it faces?</h4><p>Colombia has been affected by the same issues that have confronted other Latin American countries; therefore, it is by no means an exception in that regard. Nevertheless, we have been able to sustain growth at a higher level than other economies in Latin America, even Brazil. While 3% is not something to be proud of, it is still better than being in a recession. The reason Colombia can grow is that internal consumption is strong. Latest figures show that growth might even be above 3% in 2015 and 2016. This is also due to the fact that the employment situation in Colombia has not deteriorated the way it has in other countries in the region. At the same time, due to a lucky coincidence, the ambitious infrastructure development program that the government has undertaken is picking up pace as a counter-cyclical policy, so that is also keeping the economy churning just at the right time.</p><h4>To what degree will the signing of a peace agreement between FARC and the government help improve Colombia's image abroad?</h4><p>There is no doubt this country will be better if a peace agreement is signed with the oldest guerrilla group in the country. At the same time, the effects will be slow in terms of immediate gains. We need time and more agreements to be made, but if things go to plan, we can expect more investments being made in rural areas than were made in the past, and that will be a huge gain for the country, especially if we can get our act together in terms of agricultural production. But at the same time, I do not believe those who think that a peace deal will lead to an added 2% growth in GDP. That is too optimistic. A peace deal would be the end of the beginning rather than the beginning of the end.</p><h4>How has the company adapted to the online trend and what steps have you taken in this respect?</h4><p>We are always trying to push the brand on different platforms, be it on paper or digitally. Our online presence is very strong, and we are one of the top-five websites for economic and business news in the Spanish-speaking world. We are also active in mobile phones through our Portafolio app and push our brand in terms of organizing meetings and events. So we have a much more diversified offering compared to the past, when it was only about our printed media. We are not just a newspaper anymore; we are a brand. That said, the majority of our revenue still comes from our printed offering, but we see incredible growth also in online and mobile traffic and revenues. The information cycle has changed dramatically. Instead of producing new news and content every 24 hours, we have to produce it all the time, constantly updating our content.</p><h4>Where do you see Portafolio by 2020?</h4><p>It will be a stronger brand, with basically the same platforms that we have today, but with changes in which part of the brand receives how much of overall revenues. Print will recede somewhat from being our main breadwinner. When looking at traditional media, business journals have done best with the traditional print media model compared to other kinds of journals, so that gives us a bit more room to breathe. As safety has improved, more companies have been willing to open up and talk more candidly to business journals in Colombia, showing greater willingness to share information with the media and our readers. It is much more open now than before, audiences are much more educated than they were, and the size of the middle class has doubled over the last decade or so; all these factors have improved numbers, revenues, and readership for us, and we will continue to see this improving trend into 2020 and beyond. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Ikonosoft evolved in the last year?</h4><p>In 2015, Ikonosoft underwent a transformation process to respond to developments in this rapidly changing sector. We went from being focused on integrating well-known brands such as IBM with other producers to actually preparing our own products. We used to sell to the largest companies in Colombia; however, many of these companies then began to deal directly with the larger IT service providers, which forced us to reorient our strategy toward SMEs. There is huge potential from these customers. Out of the 10,000 largest companies in Colombia, only 1,000 are considered to be large companies, with the rest designated as SMEs. </p><h4>Why did you decide to change your strategy?</h4><p>The main reason for the change was the impact of the cloud on customers in Colombia. Today, every single customer can access these services without having to go through to an intermediary. In Colombia there are more than 500 IT intermediary companies, which is a figure that is far higher than it should be. We needed to reassess our services and objectives, and understood that we could reach a larger audience by producing rather than being an intermediary.</p><h4>What products are you currently developing?</h4><p>As an SME, our turnover is around $5 million, and we create products for medium-sized companies. To manage our stock with software designed for a multinational company, we would need to spend some $300,000 on it every year; therefore, we leverage our capabilities and base our strategy on signing partnerships with small producers. We provide our products and services with relevance and flexibility to adapt to the different needs of the different economic sectors, with a reasonable price and viability. We also base our strategy on developing a long-term strategy with our customers and partners.</p><h4>What economic sectors hold the greatest potential in the short term?</h4><p>Our main focus is on manufacturing companies, but we also have different applications depending on the product. We launched IkonoCloud Asset Management, a tool for companies to manage their assets on a renting basis. We also offer IkonoCloud Commerce, a tool for small and medium producers to reach their customers through e-commerce channels. In this context, we also focus on small and medium manufacturers selling regionally and nationally. We have products and services in the CRM sphere.</p><h4>What are the main trends in the Colombian IT industry?</h4><p>We see the greatest opportunities in the SME segment, which has been overlooked up to this point. There are more than 8,000 SMEs in Colombia, yet nobody has made specific IT products and services available to them. There has been a lack of technical and strategic innovation in Colombia. This has started to change, especially taking into account that today, 8,000 SMEs are driving innovation development due to the fact that they had to revise their cost strategy without negatively impacting their growth strategy to survive.</p><h4>What are your competitive advantages?</h4><p>We aim at making a difference by leveraging our capable and skilled workforce to provide our employees with the necessary tools for development. We have created a training and educational platform, Ikonoflex, on which we spend around $5,000 per quarter to provide learning opportunities to our staff. Since the creation of this educational service, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of people interested in working for Ikonosoft. We also distinguish ourselves from the competition through our management of social media channels. We started to do thing differently in the sector and aim at further strengthening these innovative activities.</p><h4>What are your main expansion plans for the future?</h4><p>Over the course of 2016, we will invest more than $500,000 in the acquisition of systems in the training and recruitment spheres in order to broaden our services and product portfolio. We also want to expand our body of staff to around 40 engineers. In the future, we also see strong potential for exporting our knowledge to other regional countries, starting with our neighbors Panama and Ecuador. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have underscored SoftwareONE's performance in Colombia?</h4><p>The talent and passion of our people is a critical factor. Our recruitment team in Colombia uses a refined process to ensure our employees are fully aligned with our organizational culture and Seven Core Values. We aim to create a fun place to work, and we provide flexible time shifts and opportunities for our people to be able to work from home or from other cities. The idea is to work hard but have fun; we believe this enables our people to bring their best selves to the job everyday. In addition to our company culture, our portfolio of products and services supports companies to be successful in other businesses and more efficient in their IT infrastructure in a way that goes hand-in-hand with their business needs and goals, providing a complete return on every dollar that they put into their technology capabilities. We have the tools and methodology to help IT professionals be successful in their business, mitigate their unique challenges, and fully realize their IT vision. SoftwareONE adapts its service delivery according to meet our clients' business needs.</p><h4>What have been your main investments over the last year?</h4><p>We have been investing in platforms and solutions such as PyraCloud, through which our clients can manage their entire global software portfolio through a single pane of glass. It integrates seamlessly with their internal ERP systems such as SAP, Oracle, or Ariba, as well as their Software Asset Management tools such as Snow or Flexera. What truly makes PyraCloud unique, however, is its ability to help organizations that have a Microsoft Azure deployment better forecast their resource and budget allocation to key business segments based on a usage trend analytics. In other words, just like with your phone bill, you can see which departments are using Azure the most, and budget for them accordingly. As one of Microsoft's premier partners, we offer end-to-end Advisory Services to help put all of this software and infrastructure in our PyraCloud platform so that our clients can analyze how much space they are using and what kind of contracts they have. We have invested more than $10 million in this platform worldwide and we are using scaled economies, developing the software from our corporation to deploy it around the world.</p><h4>What services and solutions are most in demand in Colombia?</h4><p>Every single IT manager, CFO, or COO seeks efficient solutions that allow them to do more with less money. Companies are cutting their budgets, their investments are constrained, and in some industries all investments are on hold. People measure every single dollar spent and evaluate how much value it generates for the business, while trimming costs that are considered superfluous. Our portfolio is in a great position right now to cope with the challenges that businesses are facing during this global economic downturn.</p><h4>How important is Colombia within the global operations of SoftwareONE?</h4><p>Colombia is an important market, and we are proud of that. We are one of the most efficient subsidiaries of SoftwareONE around the world, and we are ranked eighth worldwide and third in terms of efficiency. That is an important statement for us, as SoftwareONE is a multinational company with offices in 62 countries around the world that cover 145 countries on five continents.</p><h4>What opportunities does the Colombian IT sector offer to international investors?</h4><p>Creativity is an important asset that Colombians have. It is a highly creative and innovative sector and we are well prepared to offer services from Colombia to other countries. The government is investing a great deal of money to sign international agreements with other governments in Europe to generate knowledge, studies, and skills in order to grow in the IT industry, and Colombians are responding well to those new opportunities. There are excellent opportunities in this sector, and people in this country are well prepared to face global challenges and provide knowledge, talent, and services around the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Colombia has advanced four positions in Huawei's Global Connectivity Index. What factors have led to that improvement?</h4><p>Connectivity is key in telecommunications. Coverage essentially provides connectivity, but that is migrating more to the internet and digital-based user experience. End-users expect to have coverage everywhere; they want to have service whether they are in the city or in the countryside. They want data services, and they want fast speeds. This is a basic need for people to be connected. The government has a new initiative called Vive Digital, which encourages companies to invest in improving their connectivity. Being active in telecommunications means we are already everywhere and are willing to participate in all aspects of that initiative. </p><h4>When and how do you foresee the 4.5G network being implemented in Colombia?</h4><p>We are talking about 5G, which is the official name of the next generation, whereas the current technology is 4G. Huawei was the first to deploy the 4G network in Colombia, and in Medellí­n, with LTE technology. We are now connecting people through smartphones, but in the future we see that through the Internet of Things (IoT) all devices will be connected and will have to communicate with everything else. 5G will accomplish this and is, therefore, a relevant technology to develop. That is the next level, and that is where our users will enjoy the technologies, capabilities, and reduced latency of IoT. We have another solution called Enhanced-LTE (E-LTE) based on 5G that allows users to see each other, talk to each other, and sync up all together on a big screen. Another technology is Narrow Band, which can connect users' electricity bills to their computers so that they can keep track of use, expenditures, and so on. 5G is the next revolution, and we will ensure that it takes place in Colombia at the fastest pace possible. </p><h4>What factors have led to your strong share of the market for smartphones in Colombia?</h4><p>We are a major player in the smartphones market here in Colombia, and indeed throughout all of Latin America. We always introduce the latest cellphones, technologies, and models to the market, and we also focus on user experience to improve connections between phones and people. We invest a great deal in branding and working with public icons such as Lionel Messi in Argentina as our spokesman and football player James Rodriguez in Colombia. All of that has led to our success in the Colombian market, where we have about a 40% market share. The advantage of smartphones is obvious here, in that they provide better value for individuals, the market, and the industry. Smartphones are necessary to allow users to access mobile broadband and data services, to enjoy more information, to work better, and to bridge the gap in the digital divide. </p><h4>What role does Colombia play in Huawei's global portfolio?</h4><p>Latin America accounts for 10% of our global business and is the third-biggest country in Latin America for Huawei after Brazil and Mexico. We always regard Colombia as a key market when introducing new technologies, and this year we are in the throes of a digital transformation. Operators are moving toward IT and cloud computing and leading a digital transformation. We have another important program in the country named Safe City wherein we work alongside governments and major firms to create safer cities through shaping a smarter city. We work with the national police, municipalities, and local governments to provide command centers, data centers, and cameras everywhere through which they can easily monitor the city and take precautions and preemptive measures where necessary, while also responding quicker to security situations. Everything is recorded, and if something happens it can be tracked to reveal what has happened, to help track criminals. By creating smarter cities, we are on the brink of developing a safer Colombia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the long-term objective of the government's Computers to Educate program to acquire tablets and computers for schools across the country?</h4><p>The ICT Ministry seeks to contribute to strengthening the quality of education through technology via the Computers to Educate program. To achieve this, the ministry set aside a budget of COP1.4 billion between 2015 and 2019 to support the education of young Colombians. For this purpose, “Computers to Educate" developed a strategy that includes three aspects: the delivery of technology to educational sites (tablets and laptops acquired through public auctions); training teachers and principals through a certified course after which they will receive a diploma and a tablet as a tool for their work, as well as training parents through the so-called ICT Family School; and dealing with electronic waste as part of our environmental commitment and responsibility. The goal for 2018 is to provide tablets to every teacher in the country's public educational centers and qualify them with an ICT diploma.</p><h4>What are your plans to support the development of Colombian public television?</h4><p>The government of President Juan Manuel Santos has made an unprecedented bid to strengthen public television. That effort has resulted in co-productions with world-renowned houses and domestic producers to continue to position public television with high quality content. Since 2010, the government has invested about COP25 billion on a multi-platform content, developed with the support of international production houses, with a scheme that is improving programming and public TV content. In addition, we have opted to strengthen the capacity of personnel involved in these large projects, promoting good practices in television production; and 2016 will be no exception. We continue to focus on the development of a convergent strategy for our public television, increasing the production of local content and strengthening regional TV channels for users to find a wider range of content.</p><h4>What projects are lined up in the area of mobile broadband communications for 2016?</h4><p>The award for the best government strategy for managing spectrum, handed out by the World Mobile Operators Association (GSMA), recognized Colombia's excellent management of spectrum. Our strategy aims to ensure the availability of this resource to support the growth of mobile broadband internet connections, which we project to have with the implementation of the “Plan Vive Digital." We have been making projections for spectrum requirements for the next 10 years and these are updated annually. In 2016, plans to continue with this strategy of judiciously studying mobile spectrum needs for the coming years, with an additional component: the study of frequencies for the fifth generation of mobile communications and participation in 5G in international forums such as ITU and CITEL. Colombia expects to continue to have an important role in these discussions. These activities of international participation go hand-in-hand with the management of international agreements for the use of spectrum in several frequency bands to ensure proper provision of telecommunications services in the border areas. In the telecommunications area, in 2016 we have a major challenge: forward the auctioning of 700Mhz band, the most coveted spectrum by mobile operators thanks to its coverage characteristics and propagation. This process will ensure us better telecommunication services for Colombians.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the fact that Colombia is now one of the top countries for internet penetration in Latin America?</h4><p>The work that Colombia has done in the past five years makes us proud. We have worked hard to provide the country with the tools for the digital revolution. We cannot rest on our laurels; we have to bring connectivity to the lower strata, to ensure that all citizens enjoy the benefits of being connected to the network, no matter what area of the country they are in. To do this we have an ambitious plan to increase internet connections from 12 million to 27 million in 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which of your services are developing at a more rapid rate?</h4><p>Our strength is operation and manufacturing software, and this trend will continue in the same line for the near future. With the recent changes, we intended to boost consulting and services. Our experience and knowledge enabled us to start offering services of supervision and auditing, enterprise architecture and cloud. Up until now, our main customers were government and large corporations and through the new services, we intend to reach to SMEs, widening our portfolio of customers. All the services we recently started providing have great potential; however, since our main strength is in software development, we understand that supervision and auditing services are those with the greatest potential, because large companies are the ones requiring these kinds of services.</p><h4>What is the role of R&amp;D within your overall business activity?</h4><p>R&amp;D and innovation are key elements of our business. We have a dedicated group of people developing this activity and have a particular methodology. This group works on a full-time basis to develop new tools as well as the application of these tools. These people also work alongside our quality department to develop and improve our current procedures. Thanks to that group of people, we apply innovation to our products and services. We also invest a great deal of effort in the development of pilot projects alongside our customers, where innovation is key in this context. </p><h4>What are your advantages compared to the competition?</h4><p>We have received several awards in the last few years. For example, the Ingenio Award is for the IT sector and is judged on the IT solutions presented by a customer and has to be technologically innovative. In 2014, we presented a joint project with the Ministry of Culture as part of the Read Again project where we tried to boost the reading culture, especially among children. We developed a strategy to link all the public libraries in the country as part of the virtual libraries network of Colombia, and we received the award in the category of education. In 2015, we participated in another joint project with Certicamara, a nationwide leading entity when it comes to digital certificates, where we presented a solution in the field of dematerialized securities from a digital perspective. One of our strongest points with these projects is that we always try to understand the structure behind the problem and generate value from that. </p><h4>How would you assess the current investment environment within the IT sector in Colombia?</h4><p>The IT sector in Colombia is one of the most attractive sectors in our economy for foreign investors. This is due to the fact that we have become a key sector for the economy and we have an aligned political strategy from the government, in order to strengthen the investment environment. The government has appreciated that IT is one of the country's greatest assets in terms of potential. There is a public strategy to diversify our economy, which in the past used to be based on traditional sectors such as mining and coffee. One of our main challenges is the lack of enough qualified human resources; however, the country also has a nationwide strategy supported by the government to develop more IT professionals. Colombian IT professionals are extremely innovative and creative, we always say our workforce is our most valuable asset.</p><h4>What are your expectations for SoftManagement S.A. for 2016?</h4><p>This is a year full of challenges, and we have targeted 24% growth; however, this goal has to be put into context because the country expects to grow at a 7% rate. Furthermore, from now until 2020, we expect to grow by 200% and expect to have operations in two other countries, consolidating our brand and company as a leading provider of IT solutions and services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the dollar exchange rate affecting your growth?</h4><p>We expect growth to be in the double digits in 2016. In 2015, our growth will be similar to 2014 — around 5-6% —­ but the situation with the dollar is going to impact us significantly; most of our factories work with raw material coming from abroad, especially explosives. Explosives use ammonium nitrate, which is something not really produced in the area. This kind of raw material has to be imported from Eastern Europe or Asia. We export about 2.4% of the production and are trying to increase exports but, until now, our focus has been to produce for consumption within the country. In the last three to four years, Indumil has been looking to export more, but so far it is a small part of our total production.</p><h4>What steps has Indumil taken over the past years to diversify its product portfolio?</h4><p>Indumil has to perform based on what the constitution dictates—to produce and commercialize arms, ammunitions, and explosives. In the beginning explosives was a minor business line for us; however, it is growing, in large part due to mining activities and the construction of mining roads and tunnels. The core of our business has not changed necessarily, but it has given us the opportunity to expand our business. In Colombia we have a different situation compared to the rest of Latin America or even the whole world, as private companies are not involved in the production and commercialization of arms and explosives.</p><h4>What are some examples of research by Indumil that has increased innovation in Colombia?</h4><p>There are many things that we have done in the past; for example, we invested considerable resources in developing prosthetic arms and legs for people that were injured in combat. That is a project that we are undertaking with the Universidad Militar. Currently, we are investing heavily in mining research. Right now we have a scientific and technical research plan in one of our factories, in collaboration with universities and the Presidential Office in charge of mining, to conduct research on increasing efficiency in mining.</p><h4>What are your main priorities for Indumil the coming years?</h4><p>Our first priority is growth. We want to diversify the portfolio that we are offering to our customers, not only in terms of products but also in terms of services. Indumil is a production-focused company but we have not been providing the service to our customers that we should. If we provide an explosive, we should also provide the knowledge of how to use it, such as the calculations needed to use the explosive. We have eight laboratories that we need to use not only for production but also for providing knowledge services for the customer in different aspects. Explosives account for around 68% of our sales, but we need to diversify and we have a huge metal working capacity in one of our factories in Eramosa.</p><h4>Where do you see Indumil by the year 2020?</h4><p>I see Indumil continuing to fulfill our potential as the biggest provider for the armed forces. We will continue being that as that is the mandate of the constitution. Even though we are thinking about industry, mining, and tunnels, we will not lose our focus on providing the police and military forces with what they need and what we can provide for them. However, by 2020, I see Indumil as being the provider of many products for the development of the country. We want to participate in this development and we will do whatever is needed. Because of the current infrastructure situation of Colombia, roads and railroads will be one of the main engines of this development. Right now we are participating in the construction of tunnels; for example, in Antioquia there is the construction of 39km of tunnels and we are there providing explosives directly to the tunnel. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2015 for Siscoax?</h4><p>Last year was successful for us. We grew by more than 30% in 2015, even though the economy was sluggish and the dollar rose against the peso. We had a financial structure and strategy in place to ensure the devaluation did not affect us in a negative way. Instead of selling, we focused on stocking up on primary products and cutting down imports of new products while reducing costs. </p><h4>What factors are driving your growth in 2016?</h4><p>The first quarter of 2016 was great, and there have been some interesting projects. The biggest and most important one was the national fiber optic project in Colombia and the national fiber optic backbone network of Peru, both of which are being undertaken by Azteca Communicaciones. We have been the primary provider on those projects, delivering services and sales. In 1Q2016, we have grown by 28%, and with many countries seeking the same kind of fiber-optic investments and projects that are under way in Colombia, and we expect to grow more in the future. In municipalities outside the major cities, many people do not have access to television or internet. The fiber-optic network will connect all of these households and people to the internet, which is a huge development in terms of data access and services in media, banking, entertainment, online services, shopping, health, and education. Telecommunications is growing at 13% annually in Colombia, and there is an average of two cell phones per person; therefore, there is great demand for a robust network that only fiber optics can provide. </p><h4>Is there room for growth in the sector in 2016, both in Colombia and throughout Latin America?</h4><p>Fiber optics are being deployed throughout the region, connecting the police force, hospitals, schools, municipalities, and homes in almost every country in Latin America; hence, the potential is huge. We see many opportunities in Mexico, Brazil, and Central American countries, specifically Guatemala, along with the ongoing projects in Colombia and Peru. In fact, supply is not keeping up with demand. Everything is growing rapidly, and there is an ongoing transformation of the whole communication structure and systems of the region creating a truly revolutionary level of interconnectivity among society. That being said, first and foremost we are placing special priority on Pacific Alliance markets and countries.</p><h4>What kinds of changes will the fiber optic network bring to Colombia and other countries?</h4><p>It will revolutionize these countries. Businesses, cell phone operators, and media and entertainment companies will see huge growth in capacity, with an unprecedented number of TV channels on offer as well as fast internet and broadband capacity. Everything is faster, safer, and with far more data capacity. It is a network that will belong to none because it will belong to all. </p><h4>What innovations have you brought to your products, and what innovations do you plan to add in the future?</h4><p>It is simply about the quality of the materials we use. If there are any new technologies or innovations that add to the quality of these and the process of production and delivery, we will invest, be it machinery, chemicals, or materials. The aim is simple: to always use and offer top quality products. At the end of the day, we are competing with top international brands. </p><h4>What do you expect of Siscoax for 2016?</h4><p>In terms of business development, keep a double-digit growth in comparison to previous year, which is a realistic objective considering the exchange rate and the growing inflation over the last four years. We also want to keep providing the best human resources and the best quality in all aspects of our business to our end clients. We will keep growing and keep improving through 2016 and beyond. Our main goal is to engage our customers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[From SME to You]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[from-sme-to-you]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the progress of Riyada's multifaceted business incubation centers?</h4><p>Incubation and business centers are the main technical assistance services we provide as the government authority responsible for ensuring a nurturing SMEs ecosystem in the Sultanate. Our services include SMEs registrations, support and development, mentorship and training, media, easing regulations monitoring and evaluation, marketing, and events. As for government incubators there are three; one is in Riyada, which is the centerpiece, one is in SAS, and one is at the National Business Center. We also have private centers like the Zubair Business Center, Ajyal, The CELL, and youth co-working spaces such as The Lounge. There are a total of five incubators in Oman now, but we plan to expand and encourage the private sector to enter this business, because it is one of the tools that assists SME development in the early stages. These are all part of the SME ecosystem. The opening of the SAS mobile applications center means we have reached a satisfactory level in the areas of pre-incubation services, which include improving access to viable business ideas and plans for SMEs. The fact that there is a diverse number of incubators run by the government and the private sector is another good indication for Oman. In the future, we hope to have mixed-use incubators and accelerators as well. One of our roles within Riyada is to facilitate public- and private-sector partners to diversify the services offered in incubation services to SMEs. The mobile application services are a part of this, and they are also an indication that we are moving from generalization to specialization. We are hoping to see more incubators in logistics and in other sectors more relevant to development plans as well.</p><h4>What was the reason behind removing the OMR150,000 capital requirement to start a business in Oman, and what effects will this removal have?</h4><p>This is one of the government's initiatives to make the business environment easier to enter and to encourage businesses to start their business in Oman. This initiative makes the SME ecosystem friendlier in Oman, which in turn attracts more business. This is all part of the direction of the government.</p><h4>Do you expect to see a sharp rise of SMEs since the removal of this requirement?</h4><p>The amount of SMEs has steadily increased since 2013. The idea is to establish the authorities to help and encourage small businesses and others to start their own businesses. We believe with this focus the number will increase this year and in many to come.</p><h4>How does Riyada use its position to forge partnerships with some of the biggest companies in Oman to offer support for their SMEs?</h4><p>Riyada has been successful because we work closely with the private sector. We have good relationships with major companies like PDO, Microsoft, and BP. They are keen to support us in Oman, and we highly value these partnerships. Within this framework, we cooperate with public- and private-sector entities that correspond to the services that are set in our mandate. Within our mandate, we are responsible for the registration and database of SMEs, facilitating incubation for SMEs, training and mentoring, marketing and events, media and public relations, and support and development. For each of these services, we sign MoUs with corresponding public- and private-sector entities that offer services in that field as well.</p><h4>How is Riyada working to facilitate SME development in hot bed investment areas in Oman, such as Duqm or Sohar?</h4><p>We are starting to work a lot with Duqm. There was recently a major investment opportunities forum in Duqm to link investors to SMEs and to start business relations between the small and big businesses operating there. There have been extensive discussions, and there are huge opportunities for SMEs in Duqm. Since 2013, there has been a government mandate for all government projects to award not less than 10% of their tenders to SMEs. There is close coordination with the Tender Board port for this initiative. This is all within the framework to improve the economic ecosystem for SME development. Additionally, we work with relevant authorities like the Ministry of Finance and the Tender Board to ensure that governmental units and government-owned companies comply and have an incentive to work toward implementing this process. We are also working with the free and special economic zones. We started with Duqm where we are in collaboration with Duqm Special Economic Zone Authory of Duqm (SEZAD) and the National Youth Commission (NYC). We are also collaborating with national and multinational companies Salalah companies as well. Riyada has a total of four branches including our main office in the Governorate of Muscat, a branch in Sohar that interacts directly with public and private stakeholders in that area, a branch that is working with stakeholders in Dhofar, and a branch working in Sur.</p><h4>What opportunities does Riyada offer to foster growth and further opportunities for local SMEs on the international level?</h4><p>Having local SMEs participating in various trade fairs and exhibitions is a big opportunity for growth. We have been promoting SMEs to market their products internally and outside of Oman for the past three years. Another way we foster growth is by sending SMEs to international exhibitions that take place outside of Oman, like in Dubai and Saudi Arabia, for example. This helps to build links between SMEs, big companies, and their customers.</p><h4>As the country looks to diversify its revenue away from oil and gas, can SMEs play a larger role in this effort moving forward?</h4><p>SMEs are definitely a part of achieving this goal, and we believe they are one of the pillars to achieving new growth in Oman. Part of our vision is to make sure that we are providing job opportunities for SMEs and raising the contributions of SMEs toward the national economy. For example, we have around 1,000 people a year benefiting from our training services. We have an annual award in which we recognize Omani entrepreneurs who are role models in the area of SME development. These awardees help us promote SMEs as contributors to the economy and sources of job creation. We also have 24 incubated businesses that are here with us in Riyada. Since we were established in 2013, we have seen over 7000 Omanis officially registered as business owners. This is important because this number was in the hundreds when we started. Overall, we have registered around 20,000 SMEs already in our database.</p><h4>What are some of your targets at Riyada over the next 12 months?</h4><p>Our target is to continue facilitating four types of access to SMEs: innovative ideas, resources, growth, and markets. SMEs not only contribute to economic growth, but also to the overall balanced progress of the nation. We hope to see more Omanis working as SME owners or working for SMEs. Lastly, we expect SMEs to continue playing a big role in the economic diversification efforts of Oman.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Gerfor perform in 2015?</h4><p>Gerfor had an excellent year in 2015. We had interesting growth and good profits. For many years, we have continued down this path of growth, and we expect to maintain it. We have introduced new technologies and are investing in human resources and improving the skills among our workforce. The construction industry in Colombia has developed recently and that has benefited us immensely; however, we have to be cautious of what happens in 3Q2016 as things might slow down. We will have to see what happens with the peace process and oil prices.</p><h4>How do you think the manufacturing industry sector will evolve?</h4><p>The sentiment is that things are going to improve. We see that the government wants to continue infrastructure projects, and if that is the case things are going to improve. However, nothing is agreed and there are no dates yet.</p><h4>What are your views on the peace process, and how important will it will be in fortifying the economy?</h4><p>It will be key; however, it is difficult to know what is going to happen because we do not know exactly what has been discussed and agreed to in Havana. Even though we have the peace process, another problem that Colombia has is corruption. Corruption is huge in Colombia, meaning although the peace process is important, corruption also needs to be tackled.</p><h4>How do you think the industrial sector and economy can successfully absorb a part of the guerilla members?</h4><p>There are some programs that the government has and we have contributed with some programs to try to incorporate children who lived the streets into the industry. In those cases it was difficult to integrate them into our workforce. The government has to have a road map and a well-defined program on how to bring these people into the industry and society. We have to train them and provide them with skills, because they are not used to living in society. We are willing to collaborate but we need the government to do something to help. For example, we need the government to train them before sending them to companies.</p><h4>How can the devaluation of the peso open opportunities to foster industrialization in Colombia?</h4><p>It is difficult for us to find certain raw materials in Colombia; hence, we need to import them, which could create problems if there are further devaluations.</p><h4>What new investments is Gerfor planning?</h4><p>We are doing several new investments. We are looking at important investments in training for human resources, which is important. We are also doing some automation to improve and enhance our processes. In addition to this there are some investments we need to make in software. We also have a plant in Guatemala that requires some investments.</p><h4>Why do you have plants in Peru and Guatemala, instead of exporting locally produced products to these markets?</h4><p>It is expensive to sell to these countries due to tax requirements. Besides, our products are not ones that are easy to export and people would rather buy locally. That is why we decided to go to Peru and Guatemala.</p><h4>What advantages would you highlight for international investors looking to invest in Colombian industry?</h4><p>The human factor is important in Colombia; people here are dynamic and energetic. The human capital is excellent, and I believe that is the main factor they should look at. Gerfor has nearly 1,200 employees in Colombia.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Colombian economy in 2016?</h4><p>There are people who say that Colombia will have 3% growth and others say that it will be near 2%. To make those forecasts for a company such as ours is difficult; however, at a micro level we can say that things are starting to move. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2015 for Quimica Cosmos?</h4><p>We entered the year as a more consolidated brand in the market, taking second place in terms of market share, only behind Pintuco. We reached our sales budget and ended with 12% YoY growth. This growth was above the GDP and 5% higher than our growth in 2014. Overall, we further consolidated our brand in the second position in the architectural paints market and it was a positive year for Quimica Cosmos.</p><h4>What factors drove your growth in 2015?</h4><p>We expanded activities in our architecture product line; we grew business coverage with our traditional products reaching the entire country, even to areas where other companies are not present. We also boosted innovation and new technologies in the launch of new products; last year we launched a product with three different features within water-based paints: antibacterial paint, low odor, and low VOC gas emission. Finally, we implemented an expansion in terms of infrastructure and production, increasing production capacity by 50% in the architectural paints segment with new machinery with the vision of being able to serve the market's future needs.</p><h4>How do oil price trends impact your business?</h4><p>The country's economy is susceptible to changes in oil prices, and current trends triggered a devaluation of the Colombian peso. This had an impact on imports because we import 70% of our raw material for the production of paints. Another element that had certain impact on our activities is the fact that oil derivate products did not have the same impact in price as oil price had globally. We expected a fall in price of oil derivate products that did not happen. </p><h4>Does the company export any of its products?</h4><p>Currently, we do not export, despite having a consolidated position in the national market. We see plenty of room to grow our current 12% market share in Colombia, getting closer to Pintuco (50%). We see export of products as the next natural step in the next few years. We would most likely look at Central America.</p><h4>What makes Colombia an attractive destination for foreign investors?</h4><p>Colombia has always been an interesting market for investors. Attracting investment in dollars is key for the development of the country and since the devaluation of the peso in 2015, profitability for investors, especially for those who produce locally with local raw materials, has increased. It is a great moment for investors to come to Colombia. There are other factors such as the peace process, the social and economic development, and higher standards in terms of transparency and accountancy, which brings higher security levels for investors.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the development of the paint sector?</h4><p>There are plenty of challenges ahead due to the devaluation of the peso. We have seen an increase in prices and this is the main concern for Colombian families. Therefore, products such as ours are not a priority. However, we see an increasing movement in the region and small to medium cities in terms of infrastructure such as shopping malls, which presents a great opportunity for us. Also, the government has launched two housing programs targeting middle and low-income families to whom they provide support. We see government support to further boost the construction sector. We also invest in new technologies and innovation to develop new products demanded by the market as well as environmentally friendly products. We have two laboratories: one monitoring quality and another developing new products. For new products, we can either do internal testing or alternatively our suppliers can support us on the development of new products with their products. We already invest heavily in  the environment; for example, we treat rainwater to use it in the production of our paints. We also have a residual and industrial water treatment plant and are monitored by the main national agencies. We also manage chemical waste through partnerships with a third party to comply with national regulations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate Litoplas' performance in 2015?</h4><p>It was a challenging year due to the macroeconomic trends in Colombia and the region. We underwent a transformation and adaptation process to increase our competitiveness. For example, we upgraded our technology, which enabled us to close the year with strong growth of around 32-34% in turnover and 11-12% in volume. The currency devaluation in 2015 helped us to be more competitive both in domestic and international markets, where we have become more competitive exporting our products and services. Decreasing oil prices did not have a big impact on our operations, but they did create volatility. In Colombia, availability and competitiveness within the energy sector has suffered from last year's trends because production costs are greatly linked to oil prices. This situation generated uncertainty and high levels of inflation. In such a challenging context, we have become more focused on the food industry, a segment that has not suffered as much from lower demand as other segments have. We directly export 8% of our production, but the level of our indirect exports is above 25%.</p><h4>What growth opportunities is Litoplas looking at in 2016?</h4><p>We will invest in new production equipment that will increase our production capacity by 25%. All of our investment in machinery and equipment is always aimed at increasing unit volumes. One of the key elements in our industry is efficiency and to achieve that you need to invest in technology and equipment. Over the years, industrial reconversion also becomes essential, especially with old machinery and equipment.</p><h4>What opportunities and gaps do you identify in the market?</h4><p>The market is well served with high quality companies; however, there are opportunities in terms of consumption across social strata where people do not consume much flexible packaging. For example, people from strata 1 do not consume flexible packaging at all and currently around 35% of Colombia's population are from that strata. Also, consumption per capita at the moment is around 8% below levels of developed countries. We have to educate the public that flexible packaging has more advantages than glass or other rigid materials. Also, we have the advantage of being more environmentally friendly than other packaging types and driving innovation up in the industry. This target audience offers many growth opportunities. </p><h4>How does Litoplas invest in innovation?</h4><p>Being an underdeveloped country has its advantages; you have the opportunity to travel to other developed markets and learn from their experiences. In this context, one of our competitive advantages is flexibility and adaptability. Therefore, our focus on innovation goes towards that adaptability of foreign experiences and knowledge of our reality. </p><h4>Who are your main customers?</h4><p>We are a B2B company with a strong focus on protecting the goods of our customers. Our responsibility is to enable customers to provide the market with their products that have the same characteristics and shapes as when they are produced. One of the main challenges for us when serving such large customers is flexibility in packaging, especially because the packaging not only protects the product, but also communicates for the brand. From a logistics point of view, serving these big brands and their several products requires flexibility and a great deal of responsibility, for they are well-known brands that communicate a great deal through their packaging.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the economy of Barranquilla in 2016?</h4><p>We need to strengthen the industrial network and the synergies between the industrial sector and companies, as well as between the public and the private sector, bringing the conversation to the academic sector as well. We have the opportunity to secure faster growth rates in Barranquilla than in the rest of the country. Barranquilla also needs to take even more advantage of its privileged geographic position and its surroundings to boost exports, as we do not face large logistics costs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The International Stage]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-international-stage]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Last year was a record year in terms of worldwide revenues. How did Colombia contribute, and how was Liebherr's performance in Colombia?</h4><p>First of all, Liebherr Colombia covers the mining line of Liebherr and the construction equipment, namely mobile cranes, deep foundation equipment, tower cranes, and the maritime division line. We are called a mixed-sales company. Of course, every division performed differently, and as you know, mining has been experiencing continuing difficulties since 2013, but other sectors relating to construction and infrastructure are performing pretty well. We want to continue walking that path, as we expect the Colombian construction sector will grow, although we will still focus on mining, as sooner or later the picture will change.</p><h4>What is the competition like in Colombia? Have you seen many foreign players entering the market and competing against local players?</h4><p>That depends on the product we are talking about. For example, in mining, which is the division that I am in charge of, we do not have unusual players. The big four in mining on the excavation side are Caterpillar, Ingersoll Rand, Hitachi, and Liebherr. In trucks, there are a couple more competitors, who are mostly Chinese, but at this stage they are not as strong. It is completely different in earthmoving, for example, where the smaller excavators are Chinese and really strong, but not yet in mining.</p><h4>What gaps in the market can Liebherr help fill?</h4><p>I do not think that there are any opportunities in the mining market that are not being tackled by us. The mining market in the country is rather small, consisting of a few mines and contractors, and that is it basically. There are a couple of quarry mines, and we also have some of our equipment in operation here in Bogotá, but even the smallest pieces of equipment for the quarry mines are still quite big.</p><h4>Why did you decide on Barranquilla as the location for your head office?</h4><p>We started in mining and there was no other division that wanted to join Liebherr Colombia, so we opted for Barranquilla. Barranquilla is the operational center for mining; all the sub-contractors are based here. Another factor was that Barranquilla was close to the mines where all of our equipment was operating; it is four to five hours to Cerrejon and to the Cesar region, which is why we opted for this city over Bogotá.</p><h4>How important is Colombia for the Liebherr Group?</h4><p>You cannot just take the figures. If you take the turnover generated by Colombia versus the turnover of the Leibherr Group in total, then we are not important. But we do have a couple of very important clients here that are using our mining equipment. Colombia is a mining country. There are opportunities on the horizon once coal prices improve.</p><h4>Has devaluation affected Liebherr significantly?</h4><p>Because we purchase goods from Europe to sell to customers here in Colombia, we have been affected. The COP devaluation is affecting our business and we are afraid that the operators in the construction sector, which is currently experiencing a boom, will decide that this is not a good time to buy equipment from Europe, and we expect customers to postpone purchases. The COP is the main determinant of our business right now. Last year our main sector was civil construction, while in mining we suffered a recession with regards to our sales figures. We had a positive turnover, increasing it by 3.4%, but it was not enough due to the mining crisis as well as the COP devaluation, as our liabilities are in Europe. Right now, our concern is that customers will decide to postpone purchases and projects, which represents a big opportunity for us. We are cautious about how this project will develop in this high dollar and euro environment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[all-the-right-advantages]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the lack of water affect consumers in Colombia?</h4><p>Fortunately, some proactive distribution companies signed contracts five years ago with fixed prices. The contracts market ultimately affects the end consumer, and because distribution companies signed contracts well in advance there has been a minimal impact on citizens, even though there was a significant increase in prices on the spot market. There are some companies that have more exposure to the spot market and it could have some impact; however, the structure of this sector puts a ceiling on the impact so that they are protected.</p><h4>How will El Niño affect your operations in 2016?</h4><p>We are prepared, and it is part of our risk management policy. We need to ensure that we have enough water in our reservoir to get through the end of El Niño. We have certain obligations with the market, and we have the capacity and the water storage needed to make sure that we are able to comply with all of our obligations beyond El Niño. We are already used to this effect because it happens every four to five years. We endured extensive rationing in 1992 and 1993, and we structured the sector to prepare the country for this type of event.</p><h4>What stands out about the Tunjita plant, which will become operational later this year?</h4><p>Tunjita is unique because it takes advantage of existing infrastructure and the water resources of Chivor, so we are able to produce additional energy. The project is in its final stage of construction and we expect to complete it by the middle of 2016 and start producing in the second half of the year. Construction has taken about four years because we need to make sure that the impact of the current operation at Chivor is at a minimum.</p><h4>Is Chivor planning to diversify and invest in other kinds of energies?</h4><p>AES in general is very enthusiastic about diversifying its energy portfolio. Currently we are leaders in energy storage, which is a key component for the development of non-conventional renewable energy. We hope that we can make new investments in Colombia in energy storage. The country is also promoting wind and solar energy through changing regulations, which will create opportunities that we can develop in the future.</p><h4>How attractive is the current legal framework for foreign investors to invest in the energy sector?</h4><p>One of the advantages of Colombia is that it has a strong commitment to private investment and welcomes foreign investors who can compete under the same conditions as the local competitors.</p><h4>What are your views on the privatization of Isagen for the sector?</h4><p>The government investment in Isagen was reaching a mature stage, to the point where there was no significant difference between the role of the government and the role of the private enterprise, so the government decided the money could be better invested in other sectors of the economy, particularly in much-needed infrastructure. That was the reason why the government privatized Isagen, which was very successful, and it was able to sell it to a well-known international company that will bring its know-how while respecting the skills and knowledge of the local people. This is an excellent demonstration of Colombia's openness to foreign investments and both local and international companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what areas is Galqui specialized? </h4><p>We are a Colombian company specializing in oil services. We guarantee operators and oil service companies a standardized and efficient execution of our services. We prioritize customer satisfaction as well as the health and physical integrity of our workers, whilst managing the environmental impact of our work. We also focus on the social responsibility we have to the communities where we operate. We specialize in water and waste treatment, engineering, and management of plants, as well as other services such as design, supply, installation, and operation of water treatment plants, for oil production, industrial and domestic water, treatment and disposal of special waste, tank cleaning procedures under work in confined spaces, equipment rental storage, and mobilization of special fluids for the oil industry. One of our main aims is to send back treated water to the fields from where it was extracted in order to efficiently manage the resource.</p><h4>How does the company invest in innovation?</h4><p>In water treatment, we have improved hydraulic designs and have incorporated some technologies that have driven up innovation in the sector. For example, we have imported water pumps from Japan that generate micro bubbles. This shortens the treatment process as well as increases the quality of the water. We are still looking for new technologies abroad that would enable us to recycle this water and use it in the industrial process it originates from. This would benefit companies using large volumes of water, especially because it would help them to economize in terms of licenses. This is already happening on a small scale, but we want to start implementing it on a much larger scale across the entire country.</p><h4>How do you see Colombian oil reserves in the medium to long term?</h4><p>It is critical for the country to invest in exploration and research, especially taking into account the important role that oil plays in the economy. Colombia has its own supply secured for at least seven years; however, there has not been enough investment in exploration lately for a medium- to long-term vision, which needs regular investment. If the country does not discover a large field within the next couple of years, the situation might become critical.</p><h4>What other industries offer opportunities for Galqui?</h4><p>We would like to research a new technology process that takes advantage of the temperature of residual water above ground to generate electricity. We have a joint project with the Universidad Nacional and we are looking for expertise in this particular area. The Rubiales field produces about 3 million barrels of water and the temperature of that water is very high and it needs to be cooled before it can be properly treated. This is expensive and our idea is to increase that temperature in order to generate electricity. We are currently developing a working team with a Spanish company to implement this project.</p><h4>What is your medium-term outlook for the oil industry in the region?</h4><p>Each market is at a particular point. For example, Mexico is currently restructuring its oil industry after the Pemex years. Pemex provides interesting challenges in terms of how to increase production levels. The production potential is huge in Mexico; hence, why we have already set up meetings with Pemex. Peru is a completely different field; it has yet to be explored and reserves are widespread. Some discoveries have already been made such as Los Angeles field. Argentina has some promising fields such as Vaca Muerta, which has great potential.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Galqui for 2016?</h4><p>We hope to double our income for 2016 after a three-year period in which we invested a great deal in the Tececor plant and its construction. After that period of time, this year we already had some positive cash flow and we have high hopes for 2016; we have interesting projects and contracts. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What unique technology does CTAC use?</h4><p>Our technology is the result of more than 30 years of investigation developed by scientists from Ukraine and Russia and millions invested aiming to help develop the hydrocarbon and mining sectors. Our technology is called Oil &amp; Gas Finding Technology (OFT), Minerals Finding Technology (MFT), and Water-Finding technology, and that is exactly what it does. In general terms, any of these applications of the technology are based on three phases. The first one is a remote satellite sensor followed by laboratory data processing using resonance frequencies that allows us to detect any undersurface deposit that alters the electromagnetic field of the Earth, which gives rise to anomalies of the local type that evidence the presence of the material sought. The satellite uses a platform that captures electromagnetic information from any area of interest around the world. After that, together with the client we select the most interesting areas and proceed to fieldwork (the second and third phase). Our technology focuses on exploring areas where the fluids of interest are detected, unlike seismic technology, which looks for geological traps or structures where hydrocarbons might accumulate. Like complementary methods, the proposed technology is a wonderful tool for the industry and geologists.</p><h4>How important is R&amp;D for CTAC?</h4><p>The last few years have been of great importance for our company because of the industry circumstances. As the companies in the oil and gas sector worry for the market situation, we find this moment to be an opportunity for change. Companies are now trying to think differently and are more aware of the importance of strategic management. In the last few years, the oil prices have gone from above $100 to $20, so now everything is possible. Nowadays, our technology can do wonders in helping operators make better investment choices, which is a major step. In 2016, oil companies began to rethink their methods. We try to invest 20-30% of our annual revenues in R&amp;D because we want to increase our knowledge on the topic.</p><h4>How large is your client portfolio, and how is it divided?</h4><p>We work maybe 70% in hydrocarbons, 25% in minerals, and 5% in water. Water research is interesting because it is becoming more important each day, and our technology can help this problem worldwide. We have the unique capability to find fresh water and differentiate these deposits from salty water deposits. We foresee water as the future, because everyday the world is more concerned about it. In Colombia, we are trying to help the government control these deposits and explore them with responsibility.</p><h4>What characteristics would you highlight about the sector for international investors who want to invest in the country?</h4><p>The most important thing for international investors in Colombia is how much work still remains to be done. Colombia has explored and exploited no more than 30% of the whole country's resources, and the level of the entire infrastructure in downstream is low. Therefore, there are many new opportunities to develop and improve. International companies can explore new areas of the country, and the government is making the right adjustments to make it more profitable and attractive for investors.</p><h4>What are CTAC'S expectations for 2016?</h4><p>The energy market has to wake up from the lethargy it fell into as result of low oil prices. It is necessary to start again and reactivate the economy. We are ready to help the industry to do it faster, more cost-effectivly and by taking care of the environment. Next year and the following will be great for Colombia. The peace agreement and the oil prices will create many opportunities for international and national investors. In addition, the new legislation will encourage the private sector outside the oil and gas industry to invest in other sectors, which will create plenty of new opportunities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is Colombia for the Andean region?</h4><p>All of the regional operations are managed from Colombia, which represents more than 60% of total sales. In 2014, we started to align our vision and make several investments to ensure were ready to lead the region. Now, we have 20% more people working from Colombia than when the region was created. Dow was recognized as one of the great places to work in Colombia for the first time, which represents an important achievement after the restructuring. The beginning of the year was difficult due to the demand variation and the uncertainties surrounding currency, among other factors. Once the value chain understood that currency fluctuations are permanent, the industry adjusted and we saw a much better third and fourth quarter, ending 2015 with a 4% YoY growth. </p><h4>What level of R&amp;D does Dow carry out in Colombia?</h4><p>Dow in Colombia does R&amp;D in conjunction with universities, as Dow does not have local laboratories. We have agreements with two top universities for the development of products, as we also do with some of our customers whereby we work together, having our R&amp;D knowledge and people who come in from around the world to develop tailor made solutions for our local needs, such as solutions for building a tertiary road on the coast of Colombia. For those kinds of projects, an expert is selected to perform all the tests that are required with the soil, conditions, and climate, to develop local solutions. </p><h4>What are the main goals of your $23 million investment plan for the next four years?</h4><p>The investments that Dow is making are also in joint collaboration, and depending on the results of current discussions it may increase. This $23 million is what Dow have invested in increasing capacity and expanding our production portfolio in Barranquilla and Cartagena. Barranquilla is 100% aligned with the agro business, while Cartagena is evenly split between the agro segment and the chemicals and polyurethane business. Dow is investing in producing even more locally. Those two sites together account for 40% of what is exported, not only meeting the country's needs but also opening a door to foreign markets. Dow is diversifying its production portfolio, which already consists of globally competitive assets. Achieving 40% of exports is great progress, as in the past we were less competitive in the export market. </p><h4>Can you elaborate on what Dow is doing in Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela?</h4><p>Recently, the whole leadership team of the Andean Region met in Peru to assess the opportunities that currently exist there. As it is a region with double-digit growth for some years already, Dow has been increasing the presence of its operative structure every year. In Ecuador, we are betting in terms of logistics and positioning, and have made some changes to how Dow participates in that market. The beginning of 2016 has been difficult in Ecuador; however, it is a country in which we should continue to invest. Some of our competitors and other players left Venezuela due to the current situation; however, Dow has been there for a long time and made the decision to stay. In spite of difficulties Dow will remain in the country as we believe that the business environment will improve. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the rest of 2016? </h4><p>The devaluation of the Colombian peso opens an opportunity for exports. Colombia is growing by 3-4% per year in the areas of the country with no rebel presence; therefore, the potential in new regions that will be open to investments is exciting. These will be leapfrog investments; for instance, infrastructure in the rural areas where investments stopped 50 years ago will advance to a better stage starting  in 2016. Dow is betting on Colombia, which is why our President for Latin America was here in June along with our board of directors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was the past year for GE in Colombia?</h4><p>
	We have been present in Colombia for almost 90 years, and, in this time, we have seen positive and sustainable results, while emphasizing our social responsibility commitment. Talent is critical for GE and that is what shapes the way we do business and the way we maintain our integrity. Overall, 2015 was positive locally and globally. GE is present in Colombia with all its business units and that strong presence signals our commitment to the country.
</p><h4>What steps are you taking to gain more market share?</h4><p>
	First, the company acquired Alstom, a French company with deep involvement in the energy value chain. It is strong in renewables and has built a strong presence in hydro and offshore wind farms. That global acquisition is an important pillar for our future growth in Colombia. Additionally, we acquired a local distributor for healthcare, Gemedco, a company that for a long time was the distributor of GE's healthcare products with an excellent position in the market. Part of the motivation for that acquisition was to be closer to our customers and grow beyond what we have been doing over the last few years. We have established a strong plan for strategic growth in key areas where we believe the country will be growing.
</p><h4>How important is the energy sector for GE?</h4><p>
	Traditionally, the oil and gas industry was one of the key sources for growth. We also see great potential for power generation in renewables, non-renewables, and even non-conventional renewables. We want to support our customers not only with equipment, but with business solutions. There are also opportunities for developing the country's grid requirements. We also participate in intelligent light technologies helping consumers to save 40% to 50% of their bills.
</p><h4>What efficiencies could be implemented in Colombia to make the price of electricity more competitive?</h4><p>
	It is a combination of several things along the whole value chain; the matrix needs to be well diversified in the long term. For non-renewables, Colombia needs to make the right investments to increase  natural gas  reserves to have competitive and reliable generation. We can also provide highly competitive steam technologies that have low generation cost, are environmentally friendly, and will not affect the communities in which these plants operate. We are confident that a smart use of our resources, including gas, coal, and wind, and the right technologies to create a diversified matrix will maintain not only competitive prices, but more price stability in the long run.
</p><h4>
	<span class="red"></span>What strategies is the company implementing to ensure that the digital revolution takes place in Colombia?
</h4><p>
	The digital revolution is the new industrial revolution. It is absolutely critical that this takes shape in Colombia because it is related to the competitiveness of the economy. GE's equipment is already “intelligent and digital," with sensors to gather data on performance so that we can better predict and optimize the asset operation and maintenance. That is applicable to everything we do, from locomotives to airplanes. We believe the digital industrial revolution will bring us to the next level of growth.</p><h4>What do you expect of GE for this year and in 2017?</h4><p>
	There are challenges in several of the industries in which we participate, but good opportunities remain in oil and gas, energy, and healthcare. Companies like GE can help develop the country in that sense. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the market factors that led to the establishment of Confervio Agregados in Colombia?</h4><p>The political, economic, and security situation in Venezuela pushed us into Colombia, where we set up Confervio Agregados. Additionally, we have to keep in mind that security levels in Venezuela are far from optimum. Colombia was and is a booming economy in which the oil sector has yet to reach its full potential. We see the opportunity to transfer all our knowledge and experience in this sector into Colombia. Arriving in this country and starting from scratch was a big challenge because the cultural and sector differences are palpable. In fact, Venezuela's oil reserves are larger than Colombia's. However, it was a great learning experience and pushed us to diversify our business portfolio, targeting other industries such as cement.</p><h4>What industries offer the highest potential for Confervio Aregados?</h4><p>The food and beverage and the cement industries are our two top priorities right now, and we put in great effort into entering and consolidating our activity there. In fact, we manage concrete production plants in Venezuela and we aim to do the same in Colombia. We currently have two offices, in Bogotá and Cartagena. We will be opening a new office in Villavicencio and Barrancabermeja. This move is aimed at participating in two key projects; the expansion of the Barrancabermeja refinery and the construction of the Meta refinery. We have the aim to introduce and consolidate the JC valves and the high-pressure cylinders we commercialize through these projects. In this context, we have certified all our products and represented products in Colombia, something that has been a challenge in itself due to the fact that if you do not provide certified products, you are not competitive in this market.</p><h4>What are the main factors behind your success?</h4><p>Our experience in the oil industry has been one of the key elements in our success. Also, despite the large number of players in the sector, there are segments in it in which there is still not much of an offering, such as valves. In this context, we have been very competitive with delivery dates. I think that our quality and certified products have also contributed to our rapid expansion. It is also increasingly in demand for suppliers to have certified processes. Confervio got its processes certified last year. Our success and consolidation will most likely be based on companies considering our products for their engineering projects.</p><h4>What are the main differences in doing business in Colombia and in Venezuela?</h4><p>Legal security levels in Colombia are much higher; Colombia has reached high levels of finance and legal security thanks to the strengthening of its finance and banking systems. For example, there is more certainty to get your invoices paid within the terms agreed in Colombia. The bureaucratic burdens or steps toward registering businesses are faster and much more organized in Colombia as well.</p><h4>How has the devaluation of the peso affected the company?</h4><p>It has had an impact on our business. We import products from China, the EU, and the US. Consequently, the depreciation has generated unexpected extra costs. However, we must be constant and continue with our business consolidation. This is our main business objective along with the diversification of our products and customers. With time, we can produce high-technology products in Colombia, something few companies already do in the industry.</p><h4>What are some of the other competitive advantages of Colombia?</h4><p>Having access to the sea is a competitive advantage for any country. Both Colombia and Venezuela, for example, have access to the Caribbean Sea. However, Colombia also has access to the Pacific Ocean, meaning access to the east and west coasts of the US, Caribbean countries, Europe, China, and the rest of Asia. In Colombia, import and customs clearance procedures are also much faster and more organized than in other neighboring countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Reficar's competitive advantages in the Latin American refining sector?</h4><p>Our location and the quality of our products makes the Cartagena refinery a competitive choice versus the Gulf coast refineries for the Caribbean and South American markets. In addition, Reficar has the latest technology and a fully automated scheme incorporated into our design. We have over 45,000 instruments and several hundred kilometers of fiber optics. By square meter, the network is one of the most intensive communication networks in Colombia. It is a modern refinery and the infrastructure is designed to run with a reliable, real-time information system that is in full communication with the laboratory. This means we monitor flows, barrels per day, gallons per minute, temperatures, pressures, and which valves are opening and closing at all times. We can gather information about the quality of products directly from any unit via several online analyzers.</p><h4>How have low oil prices affected Reficar's performance given that the refinery was designed during a high oil price environment?</h4><p>The impact is positive since it is our main raw material. The current pricing for crude oil provides an even better opportunity than originally planned. Crude oil is usually a seller's market, but we are currently in a buyer's market. There is an opportunity to buy crude from everywhere at a competitive price given the current market.</p><h4>FDI in Colombia has decreased between 2014 and 2015. How can Reficar help Colombia attract more FDI?</h4><p>There are several ways in which foreign investment can be positive for Colombia's future. First, this project was financed and built in the middle of the banking crisis, and yet Colombia was still able to capture a competitive rate. Honoring bank payments will send the right message to the banking community. We do plan to pay on time. Secondly, we believe the banking community that helped us at that time is satisfied with the performance of the project so far. In this regard, it sends the message that this size of project is viable in Colombia. A megaproject of this kind has never been undertaken here before, and it has been completed and we are starting to produce. With the refinery in operation there will be potential for further industrialization within the petrochemicals industry. The refinery is the first phase of the downstream sector, which is followed by the chemical and petrochemical industry, which is waiting for our operations to stabilize to proceed.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans for exports?</h4><p>We have just started testing the market. This is novel because historically we have never exported, and now we have the opportunity to do so. We are now also in better shape to cover our national market. Anywhere from 20,000 to 40,000bpd could be available for exports, and we could become competitive in the Caribbean and Central and South America. Nevertheless, our first export cargo was aviation fuel that stayed in the Caribbean, and there was a gasoline component going to the US.</p><h4>What is your short-term outlook for the Colombian energy industry?</h4><p>I am optimistic for several reasons. Colombia has grown to be a peaceful place to live and that plays a huge role in the growth of the country. I have high expectations about Colombia, particularly because of Ecopetrol's potential. We have an economist as our new president with a fresh perspective, and he is proposing a profound transformation of the company. The current low oil prices are an opportunity to renew business strategies. When the prices come back up, we will be more prepared than ever. We have made significant internal savings with a minimum affect on our employees, and we are still making money. This is a well-managed company, and my perspective on Colombia's oil industry in general is positive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the ANH doing to promote investment in the offshore segment?</h4><p>Article 28 of the PND and Agreement 2 of 2015 allowed equal time conditions for offshore contracts awarded by 2014. That means the period of exploration and production for all offshore contracts became nine and 30 years, respectively, while before it was six and 24. On the other hand, in a joint effort with the Ministry of Mines and Energy we are preparing to draft technical regulations for offshore activities, which we hope will be adopted by the Ministry in early 2016. Finally, the government issued new rules allowing the declaration of tax-free zones for offshore exploration and production activities, which significantly reduces the rate of income tax and provides benefits for sales tax and tariffs.</p><h4>How important is the development of unconventionals for Colombia's oil industry?</h4><p>We have to find a way to increase production and make room for unconventionals. We need help in four main areas: unconventionals, offshore activities, enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and coal bed methane (CBM). There are only a few individuals in Colombia lucky enough to have had exposure to these areas in previous roles. We need help from countries that have extensive experience in these areas, so we went to Australia, which was the first country to introduce CBM, and we have just signed an MoU for CBM regulation development. To gain more knowledge about offshore activities we have signed agreements with the governments of both Australia and the UK. For unconventionals we are in the process of signing an MoU with Canada, and we have had close cooperation with the US in this area. For EOR we are learning from Canada and the US. Finally, we have requested that the government of Norway integrate Colombia into the Oil Development Program, which seeks to reduce poverty with resources from the sector.</p><h4>What were the results of the Baker &amp; McKenzie study for the ANH to boost competitiveness?</h4><p>We identified four major areas that could definitely be improved. These include improving prospectivity, strengthening the ANH, making economically attractive projects, and encouraging time conscious and efficient processes. The first on the list was the quality of our geological and geophysical (G&amp;G) information. In the past this information would only be provided when an operator or other party expressed interest in acquiring a specific block. We realized that we needed to increase our prospecting efforts by providing more G&amp;G data on a permanent basis. At the same time we will provide investors with four additional ingredients: an environmental baseline, infrastructure information, a social baseline—as there are some communities that are opposed to the oil business and other communities that are far more supportive of it—and security information. As for the strengthening of the ANH, our market strategy will be based on two central elements: a custom service approach in accordance with our customer segmentation model, and a mixed and permanent licensing model. Regarding economically attractive projects, our advisors recommend us to make adjustments to exploratory programs for onshore frontier areas and increase competitiveness through potential adjustments to fiscal measures in order to reduce government take for frontier areas. Finally, the time-conscious and efficient processes refer to the optimized licensing times.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the near future?</h4><p>We have been able to promote more than $1.2 billion in investment. In the short term I am satisfied with what we have done to ensure that operators will carry out their operations correctly. Our team has been recognized by the industry. The President of the World Bank claimed that Colombia is the most-prepared country for the drop in oil prices. The country has adjusted well to the current situation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Measured  Approach]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[measured-approach]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved over the last decade?</h4><p>Initially, we engaged with performance bonds associated with public works, but after the law was reformed we started to work with the contracting of outsourcing contracts. In 2009, we took our business in a new direction, with cooperative funds, which is also known as economic solidarity. We initially launched a product that was extremely well received, called Aficativa. Ever since that strategic move, we have grown at average annual rates between 40% and 60%.</p><h4>What are the main features of Afiactivia?</h4><p>It offers guarantees to the employee fund in relation to the debtor balance. In other words, when an embargo of a debtor takes place, we give an immediate response, paying the credit fees, and we manage the collection of the money from the debtor. One of the competitive advantages that we offer over insurance companies is that we considerably reduce bureaucratic barriers in order to pay. Overall, payment guarantee is our main strategy and mission. For example, when people ask for credit to purchase a vehicle and they do not have a good credit record, we offer payment guarantees. If the person does not pay, we assume responsibility and also embargo the vehicle. We have also become a stronger player thanks to partnerships such as the one we signed with PMI, an insurance company, related to people affected by El Niño. It offers us comprehensive support, which provides us with a reinsurance capability that no other company has in Colombia</p><h4>How do you see the company evolving in the near future?</h4><p>I see us increasingly targeting employee funds and cooperatives. When it comes to employee funds, we have been increasingly engaging with large companies and public institutions and we see this as the path to take. We would like to have a stronger presence in the construction sector as well. This industry will be the main economic engine of the national economy in 2016. I expect to consolidate our activity in the cooperative segment over the next year and close the year with a moderate growth rate. We see potential to grow with our renting bond Afiarriendos. I also foresee a crisis in the insurance market within five years due to increasingly low interest rates. There are also far too many players and, in fact, we have seen several companies joining efforts through merges and acquisitions. I think we have managed to find our niche market and we have become a strong player there with a competitive product. We will, however, open offices in other neighboring countries as we see more opportunities and facilities there.</p><h4>How would you assess developments in the reinsurance sector?</h4><p>There is a lack of appropriate regulatory framework and we have raised this topic to the national authorities. In this context, we are few steps behind compared to other Latin American countries and we should consider our current situation and how convenient it is. There is concern among insurance companies that they could end up losing business and they are not very keen on such a regulatory framework for reinsurance.</p><h4>What opportunities does economic solidarity offer?</h4><p>There are plenty of opportunities and the fact that many banks have decided to enter the business means a great deal. It has a high social component that at the end of the day is an essential ingredient in this recipe. Colombia stands at the forefront of economic solidarity in the region. In my opinion perhaps only Guatemala is ahead of us. In Guatemala, the largest bank is the Employees Bank and this was born from a cooperative. Unfortunately, the gap between rich and poor people is growing. There is still a cultural element of informality and other historical factors holding back Colombia from economic equality. Nevertheless, the concept of economic solidarity can really help to narrow economic gaps in our society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main action lines since being appointed president of Campetrol in 2014?</h4><p>I have worked primarily on two fundamental aspects. The first of these is to show the country the importance of the future of oil, as it represents around 50% of the country's exports and over 25% of its tax revenues. It is a sector that positively impacts the country's economy, even with the currently low prices facing the oil sector. The oil sector is the largest exporter in the country, which is why it so directly impacts the economy. Depending on the flows of foreign currencies, the economy has the opportunity to grow through exports and the level of foreign currencies. From my point of view, the oil sector was and is a somewhat dormant sector despite its already important role in Colombia's economy.</p><h4>What level of growth in production has the Colombian economy seen over the last few years?</h4><p>There were some policies undertaken a few years ago that have contributed to the strengthening of investment in the oil segment in the economy and that has spurred production up to 1 million bpd. This process started in the last years of Pastrana's government to impress the intermediate companies, and the production level over the past decade has risen from nearly 600,000bpd to around 1 million bpd. That increase in production generated more income for Colombia; however, the country should have administrated this ideal condition to boost other industries, which unfortunately did not happen. Since I arrived at Campetrol, we have tried to demonstrate how the hydrocarbon and oil sectors could have contributed in different ways to the economy in order to provide a more sustainable system of growth to Colombia. We are trying to change the conception of the unique exclusivity of the oil sector.</p><h4>How can the oil sector contribute to the Colombian economy with other alternatives?</h4><p>Campetrol has shown to the Colombian government and ministries how the oil sector could help other sectors to create a more stable economy. We think about the future, because oil will eventually dry up and Colombia should not miss the opportunity to develop alternative sectors while we still have this natural resource. Some of these alternatives include the agroindustry and industrial sectors. We have shown to regional governments how the oil sector could directly contribute to the development of industry in Colombia; we are focused on that and if we do not strengthen the economy, we will find ourselves in a risky position. Colombia has missed several chances to start this process, but there are still opportunities to do that.</p><h4>How could the peace agreement boost the oil sector?</h4><p>This is a crucial issue for developing the oil sector, because many remotes areas where guerrillas are present have not been explored by the oil industry. We have to give more importance to regional authorities and public entities, and we have to strengthen them in those regions. We need to further institutionalize Colombia, and oil can play a significant role in doing that.</p><h4>How competitive is the oil sector in Colombia and what steps is Campetrol taking to face this difficult scenario?</h4><p>In these kinds of scenarios of such volatility in oil prices, it is difficult to boost the sector. Companies are currently experiencing difficult times, struggling to survive while trying not to diminish production. It is a complex situation for companies and the sector on its own, because investments have been cut and many people have lost their jobs in regions where the oil sector is the only economic prospect. Some measures have been taken, and Campetrol has aims to help the sector. We have convinced oil companies of the repercussions of their decisions and how the falls in oil production affect everyone. It is the main business chain of the country and connects the economy with society. It is a challenge that we face with the current production decrease. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The COLCAP index experienced a sharp rise in 1H2016. What factors drove this nearly 30% increase?</h4><p>The 2016 balance of the year has been positive; we have had 15% growth in prices and have virtually erased the losses from 2015. The exchange has also recovered liquidity, with growth of 25 or 30% in volume compared to the last quarter of 2015. Several factors contributed to this performance. Institutional, foreign, and local investors have resumed their positions. They have also boosted purchases after the government's announcement that it would adopt measures to improve tax conditions for investments in Colombia, which has raised the desire to take positions in companies that are traded on our stock exchange. In addition, there were some companies that were heavily hit in their prices by external factors. However, they continued to generate value and profits, and these were companies with low prices compared to their fundamentals, generating good entry opportunities.</p><h4>What is the outlook for investments in securities in Colombia for 2016?</h4><p>We have seen institutional, natural, and foreigner investors increasing their positions. Furthermore, the government of Colombia has committed to approve a tax reform that balances and encourages businesses that are generating employment and economic growth. Markets are waiting for these changes and recognizing that the country has always implemented the right economic measures, which gives more comfort to investors. Furthermore, in a joint effort with the government, suggestions are being taken from the industry and the government announced measures aimed at improving market liquidity as well as increasing business in the trading screens. Investments in Colombia ultimately reflect international and local conditions. Outside of the country, the sentiment toward emerging economies has recovered and the tax scenario shows much anticipated rate increases. There will be movements in the range of portfolios, but we do not foresee a major setback for the market.</p><h4>What new companies do you plan to list in 2016?</h4><p>There are several companies that are in the process of being listed. These companies have shown interest and have made progress toward that end. We believe there are several companies in the final stage and they expect a window of opportunity in the market to present their shares and bonds, but this is a corporate decision in which the Colombian Stock Exchange has no say.</p><h4>How do you foresee the expected increase in the Federal Reserve rates affecting the Colombian Stock Exchange?</h4><p>What we have seen is that nervousness leads to investment decisions being taken with utmost caution, and it is undeniable that decisions of the Federal Reserve move markets worldwide; however, we are convinced that the speed of these changes should not greatly affect Colombia provided we aim to lower dependence on external factors. Colombia absorbed the new oil prices well, and must now focus on productivity.</p><h4>How significant is the Integrated Latin American Market (MILA) for the Colombian Stock Exchange?</h4><p>MILA has demonstrated itself as a driving force for our economies. In these five years, the MILA has been the driving force of business between Chile, Peru, Mexico, and Colombia. We now have a broader and more diversified investment pool with new opportunities in assets through a local brokerage house. In addition, MILA broadened the vision of our countries and made the governments think of a deeper financial integration beyond the market, allowing flows of savings and investment in transit within an enlarged border as is being created by the Pacific Alliance. We are moving in that direction, regulators are accompanying the initiative, and we will soon be in discussions regarding an integrated regional market. Today, MILA is the largest market in the region, both in terms of the number of issuers and market capitalization. At the end of April 2016, a total of 711 issuers were participating in MILA, while the market capitalization reached $861 billion. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Key Principles]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[key-principles]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What design philosophy informs your work in Kuwait, and how do you approach the design of a project?</h4><p>Each and every project Pace undertakes follows five key principles of working, reflecting my own values and mission, so to speak. These values underpin everything we do at Pace, and reflect also the way I wish us to work with our clients. They are: creativity, adaptability, efficiency, absolute professionalism, and integrity. This is what we at Pace believe in, and deliver. The design process and our philosophy are based on collaboration among ourselves internally, the architects and engineers and other partner disciplines, and with our clients in response to their and the country's needs and environmental considerations. These are the precursors to how we start our design process. Our aim is simple: deliver outstanding results to our clients, whether working on a building, a road, or a masterplan for a whole new residential community. To achieve that outcome, it is crucial that our various specialist teams at Pace work extremely closely with our clients, from brief to concept to breaking ground, to completion and handover. In this way we can ensure our clients get the best return on what is a significant investment. Any design that has the name Pace associated with it must above all else be to our exacting Pace standards.</p><h4>You are involved in several road projects.  How do you plan to meet the growing infrastructure needs of Kuwait?</h4><p>I and Pace are extremely proud to be involved in the two largest viaduct projects underway in the Middle East, if not the world. We have worked well with Louis Berger, designing and supervising construction of both Jahra Road and Jamal Abdul Nasser Street, both of which are still under construction, and on schedule, I might add. I see collaboration such as this—with designers and leading architects from around the globe—as being an essential way of delivering the best possible outcomes for the state and our people in the future. And I want to remain in the vanguard of that collaborative way of working. For us and the MPW, our client, 2016 is a key year. We have started delivering the first part of the Jahra Road project. Pace leads the road engineering and construction market in Kuwait. It is great that these projects are progressing well as there are major traffic issues in the country that still need to be resolved. But we are also delivering infrastructure projects outside of Kuwait. Indeed, of the 40% of our business that is in infrastructure, we are glad to say that includes projects in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. And we are very pleased with our work in Africa, where we are successfully building strong and rewarding relationships with international development agencies operating in the continent. Through our different projects in that region, we strive to be trusted partners, supporting developing and emerging nations in their development plans. To reflect this increasing activity, in 2015 we appointed a Head of Infrastructure dedicated to this one sector. But it is important to say that our infrastructure capability goes further than roads. In Riyadh we are working on Metro Line Three, where we are successfully applying our experience learnt from our projects in Kuwait. The metro project presents a fresh challenge that will enhance our portfolio. Of course we are also looking to the future, and looking toward 2020 we have set a strategy that includes planned entry into a number of new countries. We know we are going to engage certain countries at a specific time, but we have to know what is in that market. And I say again, when we look for these new opportunities and territories, it is not just about infrastructure. Pace want to deliver the whole portfolio of skills we have to each market, when the time and the economic climate and competitive conditions are right. We wanted to establish in Saudi Arabia, so we went, because we identified a need for the quality that Pace brings to projects. Paramount in all we do—in all our projects, for all our clients—is a proper and correct balance between buildings and infrastructure, with continued focus on the built environment as a whole. We will maintain that approach for each market we work in, as we have always done here in Kuwait.  So to build upon our presence in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain, we are realistically aiming to expand to the UAE by 2017.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>As an optimist, I expect our volume of work to increase. We have a good pipeline, so I anticipate a progressive year ahead. I cannot see the future; it is impossible for me to say how many potential projects will be released for tender. But I am very confident that we can maintain our market position and look forward to expand. Our optimism is well founded, I feel, and is reflected by our ongoing projects. In Kuwait, The Avenues Phase 4 will open, adding a further 100,000 sqm of prime retail and leisure space to an expectant and hungry market. In 2017, the Jahra Road should be complete and handed over. Jamal Abdul Nasser Street will be mostly handed over, other than one section. Those three projects alone constitute $2.5 billion worth of projects that will be handed over in 2017. We are the only architecture and engineering firm that has worked for all the blue chip real estate developers in Kuwait. We are proud that we've have been working with many of our clients for more than 25 years, so we must be doing something right! It is the strength of these relationships that allows us to learn from each other and that is what keeps the team fresh.</p><h4>What do you consider to be the most important change your company will implement in the medium term?</h4><p>Our medium term vision is not purely exclusive to Pace establishing new territories. We as a firm recognize and respond to global economic challenges and market advances. Our strategy has mapped clear objectives in order to position Pace tactically in the market. We consistently recognize the need to develop our existing and prospective client base, both here and internationally. To achieve this we continually seek to bring to our market, to our clients, and to Kuwait fresh vision and creative thinking, smart use of the best in IT where it can deliver benefits, and innovative and efficient delivery and construction techniques. I want Pace to be properly recognized as a thought leader in the region, in all that our practice can deliver. An element of this leans toward technological enhancements, along with environmental awareness, both of which we embrace in order to deliver greater creativity, thus delivering better outcomes. So, short, medium, or long term, our goals are the same. We must evolve at the same rate as our clients and at the same rate as their customers. We must embrace cutting-edge technology, as I believe it can catalyze the transformation we will need to make to ensure Pace delivers on its strategy. Effectively managing this degree of change, and the new working practices that will result, will place demands upon me as a leader and all Pace management and colleagues to adapt. I am confident we will achieve our vision, and I look forward to its realization.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does online banking play in your operation?</h4><p>In order to have new channels of access, we are developing services for mobile devices. This will reduce our costs, make us faster, and make our service available across the country. Internet is not always available large cities, like Bogotá, Cali, and Barranquilla. People are shifting away from the old way of doing transactions, but they need time to transition. Internet penetration in rural areas is also growing, as the Minister of Technology is working to give coverage to the entire country. Working with the technology and education areas and the other ministers is important to us. Having access to cell phones and mobile data is also a critical advantage. On top of that, clients need a bank and an institution. About 60% of our costs in transport are incurred because we transport money by airplane or helicopter. It is difficult for us to be so spread out, but clients need money to conduct transactions. This means we can generate value through reducing the use of cash, but we need the infrastructure to meet that goal. Our goal is to reduce the use of cash and then be available in other channels, not just with our branches and offices, but also with the mobile bank, the e-wallet, ATMs, and all the other ways we can be available to customers.</p><h4>What role has the bank played in boosting financial inclusion here in Colombia?</h4><p>The two most important issues to us are bank inclusion and agricultural insurance. In that way, we are working in insurance for agricultural products, which is still low. We need to make a huge change in the use of insurance because people do not understand the importance of being covered. It is perceived as just another cost, not an investment. To this end, we are working with all the educational processes at our disposal, and we are incentivizing these products by reducing the interest rate. Home insurance is mandatory in Colombia, but not in agriculture. With inclusion, it is also important to educate people and show them why it is important to have access to formal credit, which is not easy. In many places they have informal credit at the store, with their friends or their neighbors, and so on. The interest rates may be high in these instances, but they get the money quickly and easily. Banks are perceived as more complicated. So we are working on making bank access very easy.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the agricultural industry for the coming year?</h4><p>For the agricultural sector, the outlook is above average. In some segments such as flowers, bananas, or coffee, the devaluation of the peso had a positive effect and increased their income. But for other sectors, like pigs or cattle, which need food imported from other countries, the devaluation of the currency was negative. The overall outlook for the agro industry is positive. The government needs to work with all major agricultural institutions and focus on issues where we have a competitive advantage, and we need to increase our production in order to be a supplier for the Colombian people and the global market. We were a major agricultural player in the region, but now we are almost at the end of the line, so we need to catch up. We need to be specialized and define what we want to have. Until 1990, coffee was the main driver. The most important thing is to define what we want to do next. In that way, the ministry is working with the planning area for the agricultural sector. Our bank will be aligned with the agricultural planning. There will be credit for everyone in every product, but the support from the government for agricultural institutions must be aligned with one policy in order to have long-term development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you expect the new budget to affect the country's economic position?</h4><p>Oil played an important role in 2013, representing 20% of government revenues in 2013; in 2016, the oil industry will only represent around 2%. We have implemented a tax reform that increased the tax contribution from companies. We also cut public investment and had a slightly higher fiscal deficit. This represents a strong response to the drop in oil prices. The budget for 2016 has seen cuts in several areas. We have tightened our belts, accounting for around 1% of GDP without impacting social and infrastructure expenditure. We refer to these policies as intelligent austerity. This means a cut in the budget, but having clear priorities such as continuing to reduce poverty levels and maintain growth rates. In 2015 we had growth above 3% and we expect to continue at this level in 2016</p><h4>How will tax reform take shape in 2016?</h4><p>In 2014, Colombia implemented a tax reform that raised taxes for companies. We recently organized a commission of independent experts to comprehensively revise the tax system in the country. The objective is to make the system more equitable and more competitive. The commission recently finished its report, and we expect to implement a tax reform in the country. One of the key ideas behind this reform is to reduce the tax burden on companies to a manageable level.</p><h4>How do you expect FDI and exports to develop in 2016?</h4><p>One of the mechanisms we had in place to accommodate the fall in oil prices is the flexible exchange rate. Colombia has not interfered in the forex market, which led to a devaluation of the Colombian peso against a stronger dollar. This enables us to develop sectors like agribusiness and tourism, as a higher exchange rate makes our exports more competitive. This situation varies from that of dollarized economies or economies that are strongly dependent on the US dollar. Devaluation will also bring long-term results due to the fact that companies' investments take time to demonstrate results. All in all, this devaluation and low oil prices will help Colombia diversify its economy and increase the competitiveness of our exports.</p><h4>What is your overall assessment of your term in office?</h4><p>Colombia is one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America in 2015 and this is thanks to the programs we implement to boost economic activity. This is a major achievement within a year in which oil prices dropped—we need to keep in mind that 50% of our exports come from the oil industry. This has been made possible thanks to trust and the focused social expenditure. We implemented several programs to prioritize social investment and expenditure, and these have paid off.</p><h4>What joint strategies should Pacific Alliance countries implement to boost economic growth in the region?</h4><p>We are transitioning from one phase to another in the Pacific Alliance; we achieved commercial integration and now are working on financial integration. We have implemented FTAs and agreements to encourage the flow of services between the countries, and now want to achieve a higher integration of financial markets. In this context, we have taken steps to achieve a higher integration of our stock exchange markets. We also want to boost investment and traveling of investors among these economies.</p><h4>What goals does the ministry aim to achieve by the end of President Santos' term in 2018?</h4><p>We would like to see a very solid economy with strong growth rates and a long-term vision. I would like to see a more diversified economy—a Colombia that is part of the OECD in which extreme poverty stands below 5%. I hope to leave a country in which the bond credit rating is BBB+. We need to achieve peace, because with peace Colombia will boost growth by 1-1.5%. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your company's subsidiaries include Supersonic Imagine, a company that focuses on ultrasound imaging, and Innomedics, a platform for medical devices. What are some other projects that KLSC is running?</h4><p>Usually our work here is to educate people on what the life science industry is. Basically, it is any business or product that is concerned with extending the life of living organisms; this obviously includes the healthcare sector. The challenge we are facing is that life science sector in the entire Middle East region is still a very nascent industry. We at KLSC have to be pioneers and build the industry from scratch, which means a lot of our initial focus has been in investing outside of the Middle East, in global markets, such as in Europe and in the US. We have also developed very specific platforms to enable technology transfers into the region and all these companies have been growing at a very fast rate. Today, these companies are mainly based in Dubai and Kuwait, but at the end of the day the focus is to incorporate the entire Middle East region as a part of our mandate. KLSC is primarily a technology transfer company, where we focus on nationalizing the most innovative life science technologies for the Kuwaiti and regional market. We are now also developing a project management and project delivery arm to work with our government on key healthcare projects such as Jaber Hospital. We have platform companies where we own a majority stake or have had a very strong role in the company. These are five major platforms; one of them is the Life Sciences Academy (LSA). It is actually the first ever life science and healthcare focused academy in the GCC. It offers 80 courses per year for three types of customers: leaders in healthcare—these are the managers and administrators; clinicians in healthcare—these are people who are actively involved in healthcare services such as the doctors nurses and technicians; and last but not least, the most important component of the healthcare sector, the patients. The second company we have invested in since 2011 is ClinArt, which is a Clinical Research Organization (CRO) that provides a one-stop-shop service for running clinical trials for the governments and pharmaceutical companies in the region. There is a global trend whereby multinationals pharmaceutical companies are developing targeted therapies on regional genomes, for example for the Middle East, and to achieve this level of specificity, these companies need to do trials on people from this region. The third company we invested in is Dubai-based NewBridge Pharmaceuticals. This is the company we invested in back in 2010, and is a great example of the venture capital invested here in the Middle East. This company today is projected to deliver USD50 million in sales this year with operations in 20 different countries across Africa, the Middle East, and Turkey. It licenses and distributes medicines that would not be available here in the Middle East otherwise. Our fourth platform investment is a company called Ecore, which used to be called Maskem. It produces the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that go into the drug manufacturing process. Most companies just take the drug and distribute; however, we are taking it a step further with Ecore. Eventually, our vision for Ecore is to expand its services to be a mixer and a manufacturer of novel pharmaceuticals. Innomedics is our final platform company and is focused on bringing in the latest medical technology and has differentiated itself in the market by also importing and distributing products in consumer health—products that actually impact the consumer directly.</p><h4>What are the challenges you are facing in the life science segment?</h4><p>I think the major challenges life science entrepreneurs face are that there needs to be more success stories in terms of exit. There are a lot of entrepreneurs who develop very interesting projects but they do not really focus on the business aspect. We help them to license but they need to start commercializing their ventures full time. In the past, entrepreneurs needed to allocate one year to get a business license, now it thankfully takes one month, but, obviously, we need to aim for it to be as quick as one week like in Dubai or one hour as in Singapore. These are the milestones to keep in mind. In this regard, KLSC has mainly acted as a regional business incubator for companies such as Median in France, whose personalized technologies are being used to treat cancer around the world. We also invested in four different investment funds globally such as Wellington Partners in Munich, New Leaf Venture Partners in New York, and Presidio Partners and Kearney Venture partners, both in San Francisco. These funds have in turn invested in hundreds of life science and digital health companies. This is something that, I believe, we need to continue because that is the best way to get exposure to these new technologies.</p><h4>Studies show that an extraordinarily high number of Kuwaitis suffer from diabetes and obesity. How does KLSC counteract against these health challenges?</h4><p>The GCC is globally competitive in three things: oil production, amazing airlines, and obesity. What people do not understand is that when you have obesity, you are very likely to get diabetes. When you have diabetes, you are four times as likely to be hospitalized. And the cost of treating diabetes can run up to $1-2 million per patient a year. What we do through our platforms is we train people about prevention. Other than obesity and diabetes, which are very closely related, the major challenge here in the healthcare system is that we do not really have a data-driven system; there is no single unified medical record today. This is something that we are working on together with the Ministry of Health. We actually are working on developing Jaber Hospital, a 1,168-bed hospital, which would be one of the largest hospitals in the Middle East, to become the first ever paperless or, at least, paper light, hospital in Kuwait. Another project we are working on with the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences is the National Genome Center of Kuwait. This will bring Kuwait to a new era of medicine.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the upcoming year? </h4><p>The Kuwaiti healthcare sector is in a very interesting position because it is a sector that affects every single family—it is a sector people experience on a day-to-day basis. Thankfully, there has been a very important development in the way we think about financing the healthcare sector in the long term. Traditionally, what was done in Kuwait and in many other countries in the GCC is that the healthcare sector was directly funded by Ministry of Health budgets supplied by the Ministry of Finance. This model is certainly not sustainable in the long run. There is an initiative by His Excellency the Minister of Health to develop a universal healthcare system here in Kuwait. This law was passed earlier this year and Gulf Insurance Company won the bid to actually develop an insurance program for retired citizens. This category of population is roughly about 110,000 and embraces people as young as 40 in case of early retirement as well as regular retirees; the age of retirement in Kuwait is 65. This category of population will soon no longer be reliant on the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of Healthcare. This has been the most important development, and it will have a lot of trickle-down effects on the healthcare economy. Eventually, we hope to develop a unified payment system for the sector, whereby public and private healthcare providers can compete on quality not access or price. The private sector remains a very important stakeholder in the way healthcare is delivered, so it must be involved. We only need to look at our neighbors in the region for quick solutions; for example, Abu Dhabi. There is a healthcare council, which includes different stakeholders from both private and public sectors that meet on a regular basis to decide how the healthcare sector in Abu Dhabi is shaped. In the UAE, Abu Dhabi and Dubai both have a universal healthcare system. We need to think about how we can develop a sustainable model for the healthcare economy and I believe that Kuwait can truly become a regional hub for the life sciences and healthcare sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy does Procomer follow to promote Costa Rican SMEs globally and to increase their competitiveness?</h4><p>Our strategy is centered on maintaining diversity and inclusiveness. This means expanding to as many countries with as many products from as many companies as possible. Costa Rica enjoys a great level of diversification and none of our 4,500 products represent more than 7% of our total exports, which says a great deal about our diversity. Being diverse prevents volatility in international markets and dependence on a single commodity or product. We do not have any commodities, fossil fuels, or minerals that we can sell and this has forced our country to be creative in diversifying and bringing more value to our exports. To maintain this trend of diversity, we had to open new offices around the world and have grown from 13 international offices to 35 to expand opportunities for Costa Rican SMEs. We also modernized our organization by installing a project management office that manages up to 12 strategic projects for the country and for Procomer. This includes e-commerce, a buyers network, distribution centers, single windows of investment, and so on. We have also developed a stronger strategy around services in Costa Rica and exports have grown from 10 to 40% over the last 12 years. This shows that not only is there talent and highly skilled people in Costa Rica who can meet these needs, but also opportunities for new generations. Currently, Costa Rican exports of financial enterprise and ICT services are higher than tourism, for example. It is becoming a strong hub for multinationals willing to offer great quality services at a reasonable cost.</p><h4>What are Procomer's targets and next expansion plans?</h4><p>We have grown from 13 to 35 international offices and are exploring regions where we never had a presence before, such as the Middle East. We have opened an office in Doha to take advantage of the fact that Costa Rica has an embassy in Qatar; however, this office targets the entire Middle East as we see many opportunities in the Emirates and the Arab world. We see opportunities there for Costa Rican flowers, plants, health food, agriculture, pineapples, bananas, and coffee. We have also opened an office in Istanbul and see this office not only as a way to reach the 18th largest economy in the world but also as a gateway to the entire eastern European region. In addition, we will strengthen our presence in Europe with new offices in Rotterdam and Madrid and have enabled new offices in every country in Central America. This is a way to help SMEs or first-time exporters as our natural market is Central America after the US. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We expect to see growth in our exports and are dealing with several competitive challenges, such as exchange rates not favoring our exports and some infrastructure and structural challenges. However, we are optimistic about the outlook and expect to have low single-digit growth in the export of goods and high single-digit growth in services. The main challenge is to innovate and add value. If we continue to compete in cost then that is long-term suicide for Costa Rican exports. We have to leverage our country brand, essential COSTA RICA, which is well respected and known around the world.</p><h4>How is Procomer working to create national brand awareness and to promote the value of investing in Costa Rica?</h4><p>The country brand is our most important and competitive tool to position our country abroad. It is a brand that has evolved from the well-known “non-artificial ingredients" brand that Costa Rica had and was successful and helpful for 20 years in positioning Costa Rica in the world map from a tourism standpoint. Costa Rica was positioned as a sustainable green country; however, over time we decided that we needed to refresh and improve the way that we position ourselves worldwide and three years ago we came out with the essential COSTA RICA brand. This intends to position not just tourism but also foreign investment, exports, and culture under a single brand. We want to tell the world we are not just about beautiful beaches, volcanoes, and rivers; we are also about talented people who deliver great products and services. We are about the quality products that we can provide. This is the main difference: moving from a destination brand to an integrated country brand—buy, visit, and invest in Costa Rica. We developed this strategy over the last three years with special emphasis on positioning the brand internationally, also running a communication campaign locally so that Costa Ricans understand and feel proud about our country brand. Over the last three years, we have used our country brand in several international fairs, events, and ATL adverts for tourism, investment, and exports. We used the World Cup as a great way to bring exposure to Costa Rica and as a result we have growth in tourism, exports, and FDI. The strategy is working and we feel proud because it is an integrated effort; a country brand that has no political links and goes beyond government. It was formulated during the last government; however, the new government that comes from a different party has embraced, respected, and supported the country brand. This says a great deal about the importance of the country brand and the maturity of our leaders by not making this a political issue and instead understanding that it is a project that goes beyond governments. In other countries, they change the country brand every time they change governments. It is an effort that combines several institutions: Procomer, Ministry of Foreing Trade (Comex), The Costa Rican Investment Promotion Agency (CINDE), and the ministries of foreign affairs, culture, and tourism. We all use the country brand for our different agendas, events, and activities.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2017?</h4><p>From a quantitative perspective, it is growth in terms of value of exports, the number of exporters, and the number of products that we export. From a qualitative perspective, our ambitions are around innovation that will help us maintain our leadership position and our number-one position in the global ranking. We want to maintain the level of diversity because that reduces our exposure to global volatility. We want to develop exporters outside of the central valley and the most populated areas and help companies that are based in rural areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the business of Willis Colombia evolved over the last five years? </h4><p>Willis Colombia has changed dramatically in many ways. Willis acquired 100% of the operation in Colombia three years ago, which forced us to change some of the ways that we were doing business. We had an excellent base in the country, but we wanted to bring the best of Willis around the world to Colombia. We have many resources globally; we have centers of excellence for different areas in our head offices in London and New York, and we wanted to bring all the tools and knowledge to Colombia. A new process was started by our current CEO when he joined in January 2013; he wanted to create a broker that was closer to the client and one that was not just transactional—a broker that was more analytical. We changed and hired many people in Colombia, and the senior team in the country has an average of two years tenure in the company.</p><h4>Will you continue to bring new products into Colombia that are already operational in other countries?</h4><p>We will bring knowledge, but particularly knowledge tailored to the needs of the local companies. A product offered to a client in New York or in Boston will not be the same as a product offered to a client to Bogotá or in Medellí­n. Companies here are evolving rapidly, and we have to keep evolving even faster, as we cannot afford to lose pace to those companies that 10 or 15 years ago were medium-sized companies in Colombia but are now present in 20 countries.</p><h4>How has the implementation of new services and products worked in Colombia?</h4><p>Implementation has been challenging. It is a system that has been used in several Willis offices around the world, but we were going to be the first office in Latin America and the first office that would launch the system in Spanish. We were working with our IT team in London, the regional IT teams in Sío Paulo and Mexico, and the developer in London with a developing hub in Singapore. It required a great deal of work both from our partners and ourselves. We have had no problems or issues with the launch of the new system and can see that our employees and colleagues are now seeing the benefits of the new system.</p><h4>What opportunities will the merger with Towers Watson bring to the company in Latin America?</h4><p>The opportunity is, as our chairman explained, for our clients, as they are the ones who will benefit from this possible merger. It is an ideal merger because we are complementary companies that do not do the same business. The services it provides and the services that we provide will create a stronger force in the risk management and brokering business.</p><h4>What industries have the best customers in Colombia?</h4><p>Our client base is mainly corporate, and we are strong in the food, manufacturing, and energy sectors. We are also strong in utilities and work with some of the largest utilities firms in the country: We are their broker and partner in risk management. We have three separate lines of products; affinity, human capital and benefits, and property and casualty. We are growing in all of them but have had the strongest growth in human capital and benefits in 2015</p><h4>What factors explain why Colombia has the one lowest level of insurance penetration in Latin America?</h4><p>These rates are the product of a lack of knowledge and the fact that our culture of insurance is still in its infancy. As risk managers, we see one of the reasons is that the people have other needs before buying insurance. Certain levels of society and large companies are able to buy insurance with no problem, but the middle class and below are under protected because they have other priorities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2015 was the 70th anniversary of Fenalco's establishment. How has the organization contributed to Colombia's economy? </h4><p>We have played an important role and have always been a positive player for the country over the years. Fenalco has helped to develop many important sectors of the economy, such as financial, transport, security, and industrial companies.</p><h4>Fenalco covers many sectors of the economy, but which sectors does the company represent most? </h4><p>We have a strong presence in sectors related to commerce and services, with more than 18,000 affiliated companies and members, constituting 18 macro sectors. In the automotive sector, there are many players such as distributors, sellers, dealers, and garages. We also have large supermarkets as well as small ones, which demonstrates our strength in the retail trade; it is a long chain that does not end. </p><h4>How do you assess the performance of commerce in Colombia in 2016?</h4><p>I expect 2016 to be a difficult year for the Colombian economy. It is difficult to estimate how much commerce will contribute to GDP; however, in 2015 commerce contributed a significant amount to economic growth and we are satisfied with its performance. </p><h4>Do you think that the devaluation of the Colombian peso can help promote a stronger industry and commerce? </h4><p>Generally, the devaluation will slow the economy, because Colombia is a country that imports many commodities or it is an intermediate goods importer. The amount of imported fast moving consumer goods has already fallen.</p><h4>In the last few years, Colombia signed several FTAs with different countries. What effect have these agreements had on Colombian commerce?</h4><p>The treatments are economic, political, and geopolitical instruments. It is known that countries with open economies grow more than closed ones. It is necessary to take advantage of those FTAs and try to find sellers and businesses beyond our borders because this will reinforce the national commerce industry. Now is a good time, with the devaluation of the peso, to go out and conquer other markets or to recover old markets that were lost. </p><h4>How big is smuggling in Colombia and how does it affect the national economy? </h4><p>It is difficult to measure; however, official figures estimate that it is valued around $6 billion, which is 10-12% of Colombian imports. Smuggling occurs in some of the most sensitive markets that have high import restrictions, such as footwear, liquor, cigarettes, fabrics, or auto parts. With 46 million inhabitants, Colombians consume 2.5 pairs of shoes per capita annually, which is around 120 million pairs. If Colombian production levels can only satisfy 60 million pairs, the country has to import another 60 million pairs. </p><h4>How do you expect the economy to perform in 2016?</h4><p>I expect that 2016 will be a calm year, with a growth between 2% and 3%; however, for us this is low in comparison to previous years. For Colombians, to grow less than 3% is painful and we consider it a crisis. I do not view it as a crisis; however, it is true that some sectors, such as automotive and home appliances, have suffered falls. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In March 2010, Honduras and Colombia signed an FTA. Since then, how has trade between both countries changed?</h4><p>The FTA between Honduras and Colombia sets the rules for a bilateral relationship with clear and predictable trade standards between the two countries. Honduras' experience has been positive. While we still have a trade deficit with Colombia, aspects agreed to in the FTA have led to an increase in imports for Colombia from Honduras as a result of the placement of new products in the Colombian market, especially in the clothing segment. Without a doubt, this trend has had a positive impact on the economy of Honduras through generating jobs and attracting investment toward product placement in non-traditional markets that have great potential. It is worth mentioning that the framework of dialogue that the FTA generates with Colombia also leads to regular assessment of its performance in order to strengthen it and improve bilateral trade. To date, it defines an agenda for further market access for products that do not now have preferential access. Our entrepreneurs should take advantage of the opportunities offered by the market in Colombia, and we hope to help them find new markets in the sister country.</p><h4>In September 2015, Honduras and Colombia signed a unilateral agreement to fight against terrorism and organized crime. How do you expect this agreement will help progress toward achieving better safety levels?</h4><p>The MoU for the Establishment of the High Level Group on Security and Justice (GANSJ) will be used as the primary instrument for the coordination and monitoring of actions of all legal instruments in force between Honduras and Colombia on security and justice, drugs, combating organized crime and human trafficking, and others. The partnership between the two governments and coordination through GANSJ has allowed us to accurately hit criminal gangs, especially drug cartels. Honduras used to be a country widely used as a bridge for the transit of drugs from Colombia and other neighboring countries to Mexico and the US, and this has been greatly reduced. The US government itself has acknowledged that traces of drug flights have been reduced by over 70%, and all of this is possible thanks to the cooperation between our governments and their agencies. The seizure of drugs is increasing every year and we hope to continue working on it, because it is beneficial to all parties involved.</p><h4>What is the present political and economic relationship with the government of Colombia?</h4><p>Honduras and Colombia established diplomatic relations in 1825. Since then, the bilateral relationship between the two countries has been marked by strong ties of cooperation and friendship. It is important to mention the results of the active relationship, such as several legal instruments, to regulate cooperation actions (security, trade, investment, culture, education, and technology exchange), as well as common interest issues marking the international agenda. We have a Bilateral Mechanism for Dialog and Political Consultations created by the MoU signed in Tegucigalpa on September 4, 2012. The Bilateral Mechanism provides a mechanism for consultation at the level of ministers to address political, cooperation, economic, and trade issues, as well as the updating of regulations, security issues, regional and multilateral issues, and also a bi-national mechanism at the level of Vice Chancellors responsible for reviewing commitments, who to date have met twice. The Joint Committee on Technical Cooperation, Science, Culture, Education and Sports was created under the Agreement on Technical and Scientific Cooperation signed on March 4, 1980 and the Cultural and Educational Cooperation Agreement signed on August 12, 1961. The last meeting of the Joint Committee V was on April 4, 2013 in Bogotá, where we defined the Cooperation Program 2013-2015. Besides trade, Colombia has increased investment in Honduras. The Honduran banking and cement sectors have benefited from the arrival of new capital. We are excited about this and hope that more Colombian companies and investors can settle in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is ANDI's contribution to the Colombian economy?</h4><p>Not only is ANDI an industrial association, it is also a business association of entrepreneurs. ANDI contributes to 50% of the GDP in approximately 30 different sectors in commerce, while it also represents many other businesses such as banks, insurance companies, and lawyers. In many ways it is the association for the private sector. The association began as an industrial association, and I joined the association during a challenging time as industrial activity in the country was falling dramatically.</p><h4>In 2015, ANDI published the book Strategy for a New Industrialization. What steps does this book suggest Colombia take to pursue reindustrialization? </h4><p>One of the topics this book covered was how to solve obstacles to competitiveness created by infrastructure, taxes, and permits and licenses, and how to promote social dialogue. We believe in social dialogue; however, we need extremely clear and strict rules about how companies should deal with specific issues. There are many things that have occurred as a result of the way the market was designed, in terms of free trade agreements (FTAs) for example, which are not completely balanced. The book also recognizes the fact that economies can no longer only focus on increasing exports and that global markets are shifting toward value chains. </p><h4>How important is it to link Colombian companies to global value chains?</h4><p>Without an awareness of global value chains, comprehensive success is not possible. It is necessary to identify the appropriate global value chains and make strategic decisions as a country in order to be competitive and attractive in the eyes of major corporations. The national industrial sector has to decide where to be active. In our book, we propose that Colombia be the global leader in food and agriculture, for a variety of reasons. We have the land, the people, the water, the climate, and the big companies. The market is large enough to provide companies with the initial support to start working and expanding, and then start exporting to the rest of the world. </p><h4>What do you predict will be the medium-term impact of the currency devaluation?</h4><p>The most significant aspect of the devaluation is that we are still recovering from the exchange rate we had in 2003—at that time the rate was COP2,900 to the dollar, and we are just returning to that range. Colombia has a free and open market, which allows the exchange rate to float and respond to supply and demand. Recovering that exchange is definitely a huge opportunity. It gives us 40% competitiveness in terms of international pricing. We have learned many things; for example, over the past decade it was said that Colombia had the most expensive energy on the continent, which was only partially true, and it was because we had an uncompetitive exchange rate. Now, we have the second cheapest labor costs and the second cheapest energy cost, and the current situation is a return to the natural equilibrium for the economy and competitiveness. </p><h4>What are you expectations for the economy in 2016?</h4><p>The years 2015 and 2016 will both be transition years. We have to take advantage of the fact that the global economy is on hold by making all the reforms that we need to implement. We have to be prepared in terms of infrastructure and the tax system. This is the agenda we proposed to the country and the government and they have adopted it, creating a large matrix and naming every involved ministry for each activity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In the US, we are big fans of Colombia. We love its culture and we love its contributions. We love Shakira, Carlos Vives, and Sofia Vergara. We are joined by many friends from Colombia, and we have a lot of proud Colombian-Americans.</p><p>The bonds between our two countries are not just at the level of government. They are people. They are cultures, friendships, and family. This is one of the strongest partnerships in the hemisphere and, increasingly, we are global partners. It is a partnership grounded in mutual interests and mutual respect, and Juan Manuel and I discussed ways that we can continue to strengthen our ties with more trade, more investment in clean energy, and ever-deeper cooperation in the region. Of course, much of our work focused on how to seize this incredible moment of promise in Colombia. We all remember a time, not long ago, when Colombia was torn apart by terrible violence and plagued by insurgency and civil war. And that is why the US and Colombia forged what became Plan Colombia, starting with President Pastrana and transcending administrations in both of our countries. We were proud to support Colombia and its people as it strengthened its security forces, reformed land laws, and bolstered democratic institutions. Plan Colombia has been a tribute to the people of Colombia and its efforts to overcome so many challenges, and after 15 years, a tipping point has been reached; the tide has turned.</p><p>From Cartagena to the campo, there is no denying Colombia's remarkable transformation. Today's Colombia is a country of artists, entrepreneurs, and dynamic cities. In the “barrios" of Medellí­n, new businesses along with giant outdoor escalators up the hillsides are quite literally lifting people out of poverty. Children who once hid in fear now have the chance to pursue their dreams. In short, a country that was on the brink of collapse is now on the brink of peace. I had the privilege of seeing some of this extraordinary change myself when I visited Cartagena. I still believe what I said then: in Colombia today, there is hope.</p><p>Fully realizing that hope requires a just and lasting peace, I admire the great courage and resolve that President Santos has shown in pursuing negotiations to end the war. Santos is committed to an agreement that upholds Colombia's national and international legal obligations, and the President put victims at the center of this process. I want to thank all of the parties for their efforts, including the government of Cuba for hosting the talks. We all know that it is easier to start wars than end them, but after half a century of wrenching conflict, the time has come for peace. It is time to make real the words of the young Colombian who said, “The only thing I want to see die over here in the west side of town is the sun at the end of the day."</p><p>Peace will be just the first step. Any agreement will have to be implemented, and just as the US has been Colombia's partner in a time of war, I indicated to President Santos that we will be its partner in waging peace. Today, I am proud to announce a new framework for the next chapter of our partnership. We are going to call it Peace Colombia—Paz Colombia.</p><p>As Colombia transitions to peace, the US will work hand-in-hand with the country. I am proposing that more than $450 million be devoted to helping reinforce security gains, reintegrate former combatants into society, and extend opportunity and the rule of law into areas denied them for decades. We will continue to stand for human rights and justice for victims, and we will keep working to protect our people, as well as the Colombian people, from the ravages of the war on illegal drugs and the violence of drug traffickers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>President Santos visited Mexico in May 2015 and signed several agreements. In which specific areas did the two countries decide to collaborate and boost bilateral cooperation?</h4><p>During the visit of President Santos to Mexico, we did in fact sign several agreements, the most important of which was the MoU for the Establishment of Strategic Relationship. Specifically, we signed academic and diplomatic cooperation agreements, as well as others in the fields of production linkages, tourism, higher education, and consumer protection. In addition, we identified areas where we can continue to cooperate, such as sanitary and phytosanitary regulation to facilitate trade between Colombia and Mexico. Other areas of cooperation include air transport, culture, student mobility, migration, and science and technology, particularly directed at the agricultural, environmental, and healthcare sectors. In the same vein, we reiterated our commitment to the consolidation of the Pacific Alliance.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Pacific Alliance in connecting companies from these countries to the productive value chains?</h4><p>The Pacific Alliance is at the same time both a valuable tool in the ongoing project of integration and trade liberalization in Latin America and an open and inclusive mechanism that provides a solid basis for cooperation between its members and its observer countries. Through this mechanism, companies in Colombia and Mexico, as well as Chile and Peru, are closer to each other thanks to the facilitation and unification of trade rules. In particular, the Pacific Alliance has a Working Group on SMEs, with the strategic objective of inserting them into global value chains. To this end, three major actions were promoted, namely the development of a collaborative study with the OECD to identify opportunities for SMEs in global production chains, the establishment of Network Business Development Centers that will start to work in 2016 in order to provide training and advice to SMEs and all entrepreneurs in the region, and the creation of the Venture Capital Fund, which will have an initial investment of $100 million and will start operating in 2017.</p><h4>How has the FTA between Colombia and Mexico helped drive growth between the two countries?</h4><p>The FTA signed in the 1990s has promoted significant trade growth between Colombia and Mexico. In 1994, we had bilateral trade of about $427 million. We have seen this figure grow by 1,300% to its current level of more than $5.7 billion. Colombia is now the second largest trading partner of Mexico in Latin America and the Caribbean. Among other products, we export cars, computers, transportation vehicles, iron, steel, plastics, and tractors into the Colombian market. We must not forget that the signing of the FTA was the original seed for one of our greatest successes, as it allowed us to forge in the Pacific Alliance one of the most dynamic and innovative mechanisms of cooperation in Latin America and the Caribbean. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>For over half a century we have not been a normal country. For over half a century we have suffered the burden of an armed internal conflict that gave us the stigma of being a “different" country in the continent. While others overcame dictatorships and difficult periods of violence, we were still tangled in a confrontation with the largest and oldest guerrilla group in the hemisphere, as though the end of the Cold War had not happened on our soil.</p><p>We had to rid ourselves of this burden. We had to rid ourselves of this obstacle on the path of our development and social progress. We had to finally be part of the third millennium. Today, after more than three decades of attempts by the different governments that have led the nation, we are achieving that walking hand-in-hand with congressmen and all Colombians. I do not only refer to the legislative initiatives that have eased the development of the peace process and ensure the proper implementation of the agreements.</p><p>Peace—as we well know—is much more than the end of the armed conflict with the guerrillas. Peace also requires reforms to ensure greater development, equality, and coexistence in our nation and together we have made these reforms, not only since 2014, but since 2010, when many supported initiatives of enormous significance.</p><p>History will examine the work of the Congress in these two periods, and I do not doubt that it will show that this Congress produced the most progressive initiatives of its time and that it worked more than any parliament before to further guarantee the rights of Colombians. In the last six legislatures, Congress and the government had to risk it all to shape an agenda that is changing for the better the lives of our compatriots and for the victims, who finally have law and institutions that safeguard their rights, and to work to repair and return the seized lands. For regions, which have improved their management capacity and equality of their income through reforms such as the law of land management and for the strength of our economy through an innovative legislation, such as constitutional reform and the laws that impose fiscal discipline, ensuring healthy finances and resources to the most vulnerable Colombians. For employment, creating norms such as Ley del Primer Empleo (the First Employment Act), reducing payroll contributions, and in this last parliamentary term, Ley del Empleo Juvenil (the Youth Employment Law).</p><p>As for the poor, to continue furthering poverty reduction—as we have accomplished in recent years more than any other period in our history—with initiatives such as the Ley de Vivienda Social (the Social Housing Act) or a law that turned the program Más Familias en Acción (More Families in Action) into state policy. As for our health, we passed laws that improved financing for hospitals, as well as a statutory law that enshrines health as a fundamental right and even became the first social right in the history of our Constitution. As for our children and our youth, education has been the sector with the most resources allocated in the last two budgets through programs such as Todos a Aprender (Everyone to Learn), Ser Pilo Paga (It is Worth Being Smart), bilingualism, and Jornada Unica (The Single Day), as well as building more schools than ever before.</p><p>I have to highlight and thank the law passed this year by Congress that turns the Estrategia Integral por la Primera Infancia de Cero a Siempre (Comprehensive Strategy for Early Childhood from Zero to Forever) into state policy. This is a crusade that we began at the start of this government to guarantee that children under the age of five and pregnant mothers will receive the proper attention, because we know they are the best investment for the future. With that law, Congress has sown the seeds of the biggest transformation in Colombia, which is what happens from the first phases of life. I want to thank the congressmen for achieving that milestone.</p><p>I also want to highlight and recognize—before the country—the commitment shown by my wife Maria Clemencia to this special program, who has been its prime mover.</p><p>And for who else have Congress and the government worked? We have worked for our land, with initiatives such as the Ley de Financiamiento Rural (Rural Finance Act) and authorizing the creation of the Zonas de Interes de Desarrollo Rural, Economico y Social (Rural Areas of Economic and Social Development Interest), known as Zidres, to promote investment and productive projects in the most untapped areas of the country. We have also worked to strengthen the judiciary system, with new legal codes in administrative, general process, and penitentiary and the creation of the Statute of Arbitration; removing the economic incentive of popular actions; Ley de Arancel Judicial (the Judicial Tariff Act), which expanded the sources for funding of the judiciary system, and, of course, the Reforma de Equilibrio de Poderes (the Balance of Power Reform).<br>Even with those parts of the reform that cannot be applied—for recent rulings of the Constitutional Court—we must highlight its importance, beginning with the elimination of the figure of the reelection not only of the president but of all the high dignitaries of the state. Colombia is henceforth moving toward a more flexible and participatory democracy, which also guarantees generational change.</p><p>I would also like to highlight the new Police Code approved by Congress that updates a regulation that is more than 40 years old, and which gives greater and more effective tools to the police to protect the security and tranquility of citizens. We have also done something extremely important, which is to produce an advanced legislation that protects the rights of minorities, including the excluded, and responds to the realities and needs of today.</p><p>There are new norms such as a law against discrimination, a law for people with disabilities, a law for victims of sexual violence, a femicide law, and a law governing the use and production of marijuana for medical uses. There are also laws that improved the working conditions of workers and domestic workers, community mothers, volunteers, firefighters—who went from an annual investment of COP800 million to COP30 billion—and the Ley de Proteccion al Cesante. </p><p>All those new laws represent particular achievements in ensuring social rights of Colombians, and I reaffirm the conviction that the agenda we have accomplished in the last six years is a historic leap for the country.<br>All these mean that the major reforms that transform Colombia, progressive and advanced reforms, are being done from republican and democratic institutions, and not from weapons, not from a revolution, not from authoritarianism. Be proud that you are part of this change that will lead to a new Colombia; a Colombia with much more equity, more progress, more education, and, as we always dreamed, a Colombia in peace. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2015 for SISCOAX?</h4><p>Last year was successful for us. We grew by more than 30% in 2015, even though the economy was sluggish and the dollar rose against the peso. We had a financial structure and strategy in place to ensure the devaluation did not affect us in a negative way. Instead of selling, we focused on stocking up on primary products and cutting down imports of new products while reducing costs. </p><h4>What factors are driving your growth in 2016?</h4><p>The first quarter of 2016 was great, and there have been some interesting projects. The biggest and most important one was the national fiber optic project in Colombia and the national fiber optic backbone network of Peru, both of which are being undertaken by Azteca Communicaciones. We have been the primary provider on those projects, delivering services and sales. In 1Q2016, we have grown by 28%, and with many countries seeking the same kind of fiber-optic investments and projects that are under way in Colombia, and we expect to grow more in the future. In municipalities outside the major cities, many people do not have access to television or internet. The fiber-optic network will connect all of these households and people to the internet, which is a huge development in terms of data access and services in media, banking, entertainment, online services, shopping, health, and education. Telecommunications is growing at 13% annually in Colombia, and there is an average of two cell phones per person; therefore, there is great demand for a robust network that only fiber optics can provide. </p><h4>Is there room for growth in the sector in 2016, both in Colombia and throughout Latin America?</h4><p>Fiber optics are being deployed throughout the region, connecting the police force, hospitals, schools, municipalities, and homes in almost every country in Latin America; hence, the potential is huge. We see many opportunities in Mexico, Brazil, and Central American countries, specifically Guatemala, along with the ongoing projects in Colombia and Peru. In fact, supply is not keeping up with demand. Everything is growing rapidly, and there is an ongoing transformation of the whole communication structure and systems of the region creating a truly revolutionary level of interconnectivity among society. That being said, first and foremost we are placing special priority on Pacific Alliance markets and countries.</p><h4>What kinds of changes will the fiber optic network bring to Colombia and other countries?</h4><p>It will revolutionize these countries. Businesses, cell phone operators, and media and entertainment companies will see huge growth in capacity, with an unprecedented number of TV channels on offer as well as fast internet and broadband capacity. Everything is faster, safer, and with far more data capacity. It is a network that will belong to none because it will belong to all. </p><h4>What innovations have you brought to your products, and what innovations do you plan to add in the future?</h4><p>It is simply about the quality of the materials we use. If there are any new technologies or innovations that add to the quality of these and the process of production and delivery, we will invest, be it machinery, chemicals, or materials. The aim is simple: to always use and offer top quality products. At the end of the day, we are competing with top international brands. </p><h4>What do you expect of SISCOAX for 2016?</h4><p>In terms of business development, keep a double-digit growth in comparison to previous year, which is a realistic objective considering the exchange rate and the growing inflation over the last four years. We also want to keep providing the best human resources and the best quality in all aspects of our business to our end clients. We will keep growing and keep improving through 2016 and beyond. Our main goal is to engage our customers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities does the large public sector in the UAE present?</h4><p>There is certainly a sense—for a trader or an SME coming to the UAE—that we need to carve out an identity and a niche here, but they are different in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. I would say Abu Dhabi is more interested in partnerships and taking an active role in business. Sectors concentrated in Abu Dhabi are oil and gas, defense and security, and financial and professional services. More recently, healthcare and education have become increasingly important, which in the past may have been more focused mostly on Dubai. Within the construction sector things have become more cost driven; at the higher end we do well, but at the lower end it can be more difficult for British companies to compete.</p><h4>How are you trying to attract SMEs over here to support that sector?</h4><p>The UAE UK Business Council has seven focus sectors. SMEs are defined as a sector in their own right, even though they operate throughout each sector of the economy. We are trying to attract SMEs both through a specific sector directly and as a class of business. We have set up, with the help of the British government, an entity called the British Centers for Business, which is so far represented in Dubai, with another planned for Abu Dhabi, and is an incubator for business. We also have sectoral advisors giving counsel to incoming businesses on market opportunities, offering market studies, and generally acting as a nexus for SMEs.</p><h4>How might UAE and British relations develop with VAT coming in at 5%?</h4><p>The drop in oil prices has presented the UAE with a need to find secure revenue streams, and, therefore, the decision to introduce VAT is a really positive development. It is a further part of the UAE's evolution. We all know about taxes in for example the UK or US, and we know that 5% is not the end of the story. The tax will inevitably increase, but the UAE will adjust to that just as any other country.</p><h4>What are some of the overall services that the group can provide to its members?</h4><p>The BBG can assist companies in different ways. There are British companies in the UK that are seeking business in the UAE. The British government supports export businesses in a number of ways, and the group acts often as the first port of call as an adviser to newly arrived British companies in the UAE, or those thinking about entering the market. We hold events around visits by ministers and senior British representatives and act as a networking partner for businesses coming in. This is an entirely voluntary organization and people join to gain business connections, advice and general information. We provide the full spectrum of support, and we continually try to find new ways of making ourselves useful to the resident and visiting British business community.</p><h4>How do you bridge the two businesses cultures between the UK and the UAE?</h4><p>The cultures are indeed different, and regulation is a useful way to contrast the two countries. In the UK, some feel that there is now a little too much regulation, whereas the UAE is just at the beginning of this process. In both social and professional senses, the UAE is moving closer to the UK and other more developed economies. As a long-term partner, the UK still has plenty to offer the UAE, which at least in some senses is still a developing economy. We have tried a number of different experiments ourselves over the years, which the UAE can benefit from, such as privatization and public-private partnerships for instance, and we can also share our experiences where the results were not as successful as hoped. This is the real benefit for a country like the UAE, which is to leapfrog trial and error and implement proven solutions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Culture Hub]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-culture-hub]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>One of the main policies is to develop Saadiyat into a cultural district. What other attractions will make Abu Dhabi a cultural hub?</h4><p>Developing Abu Dhabi as a cultural tourism destination is a cornerstone of our work. We want to add a cultural proposition to complement our UNESCO inscribed world heritage sites. Upcoming attractions such as the Louvre Abu Dhabi, the Zayed National Museum, and Guggenheim Abu Dhabi are all under construction on Saadiyat Island. They will showcase art and culture from all around the world, and cement Abu Dhabi as the cultural hub of the Arabian Peninsula. This is alongside cultural programs such as the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair and the Abu Dhabi Classics. We anticipate the draw of these world-renowned attractions to stimulate awareness and drive tourism through attractions such as Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque and the World Heritage Sites of Al Ain.</p><h4>How has Abu Dhabi attracted visitors against regional competition?</h4><p>We feel this is being enhanced by the zonal model. Abu Dhabi has its draws as a cosmopolitan city, including locations like Saadiyat and Yas Island, the latter as an entertainment destination. We similarly have desert landscapes in Al Gharbia and the oases and heritage heartland of Al Ain. We have a range of facilities for different types of tourism, from golf to halal and cruise tourism. TCA, and the other relevant bodies, have worked hard to ensure that we host a cadre of world-class events, giving another string to our bow when seeking to attract tourists. Our PR department is always looking to develop our audience through informative and promotional materials and selecting the right digital marketing strategies to ensure high levels of engagement. We are constantly striving to push the marketing of Abu Dhabi with our key government entities, notably Etihad Airways.</p><h4>An exciting new addition is the cruise terminal at Mina Zayed, and the creation of Sir Bani Yas. What was the development process behind Sir Bani Yas?</h4><p>TCA Abu Dhabi is currently working in collaboration with Dubai, Oman, Sharjah, and Bahrain under the Cruise Arabia Alliance to raise awareness and stimulate demand for Arabian Gulf Cruises, and to compete with other traditional winter sun destinations. The new permanent cruise terminal at Zayed Port is a game changer, allowing Abu Dhabi to attract primary European and international cruise lines, and winning market share in the Arabian gulf cruise sector. We are positioning Abu Dhabi to offer a viable alternative to traditional winter sun cruise destinations and ensure the sustainable growth of the tourism economy. In this sense, Sir Bani Yas Island is being developed to provide a dedicated desert island cruise stopover beach in the Western Region, which is the first in the Arabian Gulf. The island's addition will encourage double-Emirate calls, add a USP to Abu Dhabi's cruise proposition, and deliver custom to the existing Sir Bani Yas tourism infrastructure. Our aim is to attract in excess of 50 ship calls in the 2016-2017 season to the beach.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi also boasts a world-renowned exhibition venue, ADNEC. How do you assess the role of business tourism? </h4><p>The Abu Dhabi Convention Bureau was completed in March 2013 and offers a one-stop shop for the Abu Dhabi meetings, incentive, conference and exhibitions (MICE) industry, which allows us to compete in an active global marketplace. Our priority focus is to position Abu Dhabi as a leading business events destination and attract and host major conference and congress meetings. There is a coordinated approach bringing government, GREs, public, and private sectors together under “one Abu Dhabi" for bid developments. The Advantage Abu Dhabi program acts as a catalyst for attracting business events to Abu Dhabi and extending the direct and indirect economic benefit to the tourism sector. ADNEC is an asset and the Emirate's range of smaller venues and MICE facilities ensure diversity of product to meet all of the segment's needs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the change in the ministry's name changed your responsibilities?</h4><p>Having just recently been named the Minister of Culture and Knowledge Development in the UAE, I have renewed my interest in the concept of knowledge and its relation to culture. Our cultures, whatever their distinctive characteristics, must create, produce, transfer, adapt, diffuse, and localize knowledge if they are to flourish. A flourishing culture reinforces its basic values by opening itself to the world of knowledge. It has been the good fortune of the UAE to be led by enlightened visionaries who have acted on that truth. A knowledge economy and a knowledge society were the primary goals of our nation's founder the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahayan, and they remain the fundamental goals of our President, His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al-Nahayan, as we aim for the UAE to be a major regional hub in the global economy. The President's leadership team, headed by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, and His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahayan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces, focuses intently on those goals. Our country consequently has become increasingly educated and evermore intellectually curious and adventurous. Our country has matured in the digital age and has capitalized on its opportunities. We have become more aware of the true value of our own culture and far more understanding of the world in which we live. The acquisition of knowledge demands awareness, understanding, interpretation, evaluation, and theorizing. Socrates went so far as to declare that knowledge and virtue are one. He argued that if people failed to live well, it was through ignorance of the virtues themselves. I daresay that we largely recognize wise minds for their reflectiveness and their judgment. The wise mind looks carefully at the rearview mirror while staying focused on the road ahead.</p><h4>How will the further enhancement of a knowledge-based society generate a wider range of positive benefits?</h4><p>It will be our wisdom that will create a knowledge economy and knowledge society that account for the well-being of all our citizens, not just the enrichment of corporate bottom-lines. Our wisdom will be the driver to recognize the moral imperative for improving the health and safety of our communities. It is a tool we can use to address critical environmental issues such as global climate change, waste management, recycling, potable water, and renewable energy. It will be our wisdom that will improve education so that all our citizens can contribute effectively to a knowledge-based economy. Through this medium we will preserve the strengths of our traditional cultures and strengthen our natural moral affinities with other cultures. It will allow us to accept reasonable risk as we advance scientific research and entrepreneurial innovation. It will be our wisdom that will help us to shape the future of our global economy and promote greater emphasis on ethical and transparent transactions and wider individual and institutional participation in all economic activities. And it will be our wisdom that will enable cooperation, creativity, understanding, and mutual support among the different elements of the global financial markets. Together we must reaffirm our conviction that we all live and work in an inter-dependent world. No individual, no institution, no vital element of a country can successfully work in isolation or reject knowledge, whatever its source. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the UAE, women's employment remains at around 27%. How do you assess the importance of developing the role of women in society through sport?</h4><p>Sport goes beyond physical wellness and fosters social development and sustainability. HH Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak, the Mother of the Nation, has made it a lifelong mission to provide opportunities to Emirati women in every sector of social activity. By establishing various entities dedicated to women's development, she has paved a path to realize the vision of the UAE as a modern state. The Fatima Bint Mubarak Ladies Sports Academy (FBMA) is an embodiment of this vision. The last five years of development since the birth of the academy have created numerous opportunities not only for athletes but for female referees, coaches, and administrators. Most recently FBMA has been named the headquarters of the Women Committee of the Gulf Sport Media Association (GSMA), which is expected to lead to a rise in female sport reporters and media personnel as well. The academy aims to give women an active role in the sports industry, inspiring them to pursue a more active role in society. Moreover, through a dedicated education and research department, the academy maintains a dynamic role in empowering women through organizing regular seminars and certification programs in collaboration with local and international specialized entities. It is our fundamental belief that physical education can lead to self-empowerment and social growth, and that in turn will create more employment opportunities for women.</p><h4>The FBMA caters for a wide range of sports, including contact sport. How important is it to offer choices to generate greater engagement with women in sport? </h4><p>The objective being to increasingly get more people interested and involved, it is critical that a variety of options is provided to cater to preferences across the spectrum. If sports are perceived as an activity suitable only for a certain portion of the population, which meets specific age, physical levels, and appearance criteria, then it automatically becomes exclusive. FBMA operates on precisely the opposite idea. We believe that sports should be inclusive and that there is a sport for everyone who is willing to get out there and make the commitment to being active. This is why on an annual basis we host a mixture of events, aiming to expose Emiratis to different sports, and ultimately spark their interest in identifying and taking up a sport of their liking. Along with the training sessions and events that we organize in show-jumping, figure-skating, running, volleyball, football, basketball, bowling and recently golf, to name but a few, this year the academy presented its “ADIB PasSport by FBMA," initiative, a program in partnership with ADIB and the Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) through which we were able to expose 1,800 school girls ages 10-12 from government schools across the Emirate to a wide range of sports that they might not have had the chance to try before such as archery and table tennis. This way not only do we funnel girls' interest into the programs that FBMA runs, but there is the overall benefit of triggering their interest in sport as a lifestyle.</p><h4>What programs are being curated to develop the professional level of women in sport?</h4><p>The academy's main pillars of work include sport events organization, community engagement activities, education and research programs, local talent management, and the biennial International Conference of Sports for Women (ICSW). FBMA also caters for elite athletes and aspires to be a catalyst in their professional development. A great example of this is the FBMA Elite Athletes Program, which was run for the first time this May. The program brought together renowned professionals, academics, and international elite athletes to share with Emirati athletes their insights and experiences from the realm of professional sports. Designed to examine in depth the areas of sport sociology and sport psychology, the program provided athletes with the theoretical and practical tools to progress in their journey as elite athletes.</p><h4>The FBMA Ladies Open is the newest event to the calendar for the academy. Why was golf the right sport in which to create an international event there in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is establishing itself as a prime sports tourism destination. Our research has exposed very positive feedback from sports tourists visiting Abu Dhabi throughout the year, and it is within FBMA's mission to enhance Abu Dhabi's profile as a sports destination. Moreover, the Emirate is known to be a paramount location for golf, given its pristine golf courses and a large number of golf enthusiasts across the country. We believe the FBMLO is the perfect event to generate the same enthusiasm for ladies golf. The academy is currently also running golf trainings for Emirati women of all ages and levels aiming to further increase local female interest in the sport, whether it would be eventually practiced on a professional level or even as a hobby. </p>]]></richbody0content>

What will be its contribution to Abu Dhabi's sports development?</h4><p><span></span>The Player Foundation is active worldwide, having raised more than $62 million and now stages Gary Player Invitational charity events in China, India, Japan, Abu Dhabi, South Africa, London, and New York. It has taken off very well and having raised such an amount of money for a sporting event means every country we participate in benefits. Dealing with the Sports Council has been an absolute pleasure and proceeds from the Gary Player Invitational will go to building a gymnasium center for young people in Abu Dhabi. This development is something the Abu Dhabi authorities have been very interested in and something we are very excited about contributing to. I have been going to Abu Dhabi for many years, having designed the Saadiyat Beach Golf Club, and I have been involved with young people there, holding golf clinics and taking them out to the golf course so they can see, enjoy, and learn the game. Generally speaking, Abu Dhabi has been remarkable in terms of its investment in sports, be it motor racing, golf, football, tennis, and so on. In the words of Nelson Mandela, “sport has the power to change the world," and that has never been more true. On the other hand, sport is a big business, and for that reason we are delighted to come to Abu Dhabi. There is also a very important public health aspect to what we do. Abu Dhabi is facing very similar problems to the rest of the world in terms of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic and lifestyle diseases. Promoting sports here is not just about fun, it is also a crucial public health issue.

Students, teachers, and parents all have to be educated about eating properly, avoiding sugar, eating moderately, and exercising and playing sports. This is not just for the benefit of the children themselves, it is for the benefit of the country. This is a crucial issue, to spread and promote a culture of healthiness, fitness, exercise, good dietary habits, and sports throughout the population.</p><h4>What distinguishes Saadiyat Golf Course from other golf courses, and what kind of events do you organize there?</h4><p><span></span>One aspect of the attraction is tourism.

I want to speak with the Ministry of Sports about playing the Abu Dhabi Championship on Saadiyat Golf Course instead of where it is played now, as it offers so much more of a spectacular setting that would help promote the country.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	Abu Dhabi is attempting to develop a sporting culture within the Emirate. How do you assess that goal, and what is left to achieve?
</h4><p>
	There are specific reasons why we are developing this sporting culture. We want Abu Dhabi seen as a preferred destination for major, world-class events, which has an obvious knock-on effect on the Emirate's overall international positioning and its tourism appeal by delivering huge global media exposure whilst also enriching the lives of residents and visitors alike. We also want to build a sporting culture as it is clearly in line with the aims of the Abu Dhabi 2030 vision of embracing contemporary living and respect for the diverse cultures of those that reside in Abu Dhabi, of strengthening our sense of community, building social cohesion, and encouraging healthy lifestyles among all ages while promoting wellbeing. We assess our progress with surveys at our major events, through stakeholder meetings, through our regular interaction with the community clubs, schools, and universities, and we can clearly gauge the progress. There has been a proliferation of private-sector sports facilities and fitness clubs throughout the Emirate that serve a wide cross-section of the community. Is there more to do? Always. We are never complacent. We also appreciate that sports is a business and can open up a world of career opportunities for UAE nationals, and not just those who want to demonstrate their prowess on the sports field, but the many ancillary jobs behind the scenes, in events organization, marketing, and also the financial arena. People with a passion for sport can find their niche here.</p><h4>How have you gauged Emirati involvement with sports since the council's creation?</h4><p>
	We are regularly in touch with schools, colleges, and universities, assisting them to build their own sporting cultures and supporting their programs where necessary. We are also in regular contact with the many local sports clubs around the Emirate, helping to establish many, with the aim of encouraging grass roots sports within the community. We have come a long way. If just five years ago you were to visit the annual Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship you would be unlikely to see any Emiratis around, but now we even have one competing—Ahmed Al Musharrekh, the first Emirati golfer to turn professional. Only 25 years old, Ahmed is now teeing off alongside the world's best players and he's subtlety delivering a message to our own youth that you shouldn't scared of challenge and to take the opportunities that are presented. Another example is Adil Khalid, who was part of Abu Dhabi's winning Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing team, which clinched the last Volvo Ocean Race. Adil has a huge following across the region and has fans around the world. As the first Arab, let alone Emirati, to compete in this round-the-world endurance race, he sent out a clear signal to our youth that anything is possible. Other Emiratis were also involved in that victory, serving on the vital shore team. Women are not left out either and have the sterling example of our medal- winning and budding Olympic weightlifter Amna Al Haddad to look up to. Her sporting example is admired and hopefully will inspire more young women into the sporting arena.</p><h4>What wider, socio-economic impact does ADSC expect to see from bringing in events such as this one?</h4><p>
	Sports can make a profound and positive impact on individuals, communities, and wider society. There is firm evidence worldwide that physical activity, including sports, helps reduce the risk of illnesses, including cardiovascular disease and some cancers. The socio-economic benefits are wide-ranging and include long-term savings to healthcare costs. Through major events we encourage people to take up sports at a grass roots level. The ITU World Triathlon Series is a great example because it allows budding amateur triathletes, even juniors, to get out and tackle the same course as the elites. Toward the end of last year, ADSC teamed up with HSBC to launch the Emirate's largest grassroots program, Champions of Tomorrow, which has introduced more than 2,000 local school children to the game of golf. This program engages youngsters through modules, including free taster sessions at our golf clubs and unique hour-long guided tours of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship. Our golf professionals visit schools and the children also receive beginner coaching courses at one of the four golf clubs taking part. This is a long-term program that will grow golf within the local community while helping to set youngsters out on a journey of healthy lifestyles, sportsmanship, and competitive spirit. Of course, there is also an economic impact back to the host destination for major sporting events. For instance, our hosting of the Volvo Ocean Race in December 2014 delivered an economic impact of AED189 million to the destination, while the annual Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship brings AED147 million of economic impact to the greater UAE. Some 60,000 people turn up to see the F1 Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix for instance, and many stay on to experience the destination, and then there's a considerable number in the competing teams and their support teams. Airlines, hotels, restaurants, yacht charters, and shops see a spike in revenue, as do event organizers and their ancillary suppliers. With all major sporting events the travel industry benefits by designing packages around them. For example, in 2014 the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship pushed hotel occupancy levels, revenue per available room, and the average room rate up for the month of January by 5.4%, 7.6%, and 16%, respectively. There was a conscious effort to develop tailored packages as hotel providers teamed up with other travel service providers to highlight Abu Dhabi's potential as a golf destination. And this is only on the events side.</p><h4>How do you assess the development of infrastructure that facilitates the Emirate hosting prestigious sporting events?</h4><p>
	We have excellent infrastructure, from our three championship golf courses, each an award-winner, to the Yas Marina Circuit, our football stadiums, and the state-of-the-art Zayed Cricket Stadium, which is arguably one of the world's finest cricket grounds. The Abu Dhabi Sailing &amp; Yacht Club is being enhanced, the wakeboarding park at Al Forsan has hosted the Wake Park World Championships, Wadi Adventure in Al Ain will this year host the World Rafting Championships, while the Hazza Bin Zayed stadium in Al Ain is a head turner and has become something of a landmark. I also look upon our Corniche as a sporting venue in its own right; the promenade is extensive and the waters off its shores are ideal for swimming, sailing, and other aquatic pursuits. This is why we include it in the triathlon course and chose it to host the recent FINA Swimming Marathon World Cup and High Diving World Cup. The area lends itself to hosting spectator sports, in a comfortable and picturesque surrounding. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This is the first venture overseas. How have you carried the company over from India and implemented it here?</h4><p>Our key philosophy of “Excellence in Education &amp; All Round Development" is what guides our decision-making. With over three decades of experience in nurturing children to become global citizens, we have built a strong foundation for delivering quality schooling. This covers all aspects of development of young minds, from academics to sports, cultural and social pursuits, and extra-curricular activity. These learnings, honed over the years, have become embedded in the Ryan way of doing things. This unique ability to identify and bring out the best in children is what has enabled us to carve a niche in this space. This is exactly what we bring to all our new schools, including the UAE. We groom and equip our leaders to implement the unique Ryan culture in new schools. They are supported by our accredited trainers and curriculum developers to ensure the new schools meet all the rigorous standards we measure ourselves with.</p><h4>Why did the Group choose the UAE as its first destination overseas?</h4><p>There was an increasing demand from many in the parent community to open a school in the UAE. Also, we were continuously receiving invites from members of the community, society, and industry to come and start an educational venture. While we are in the process of expanding the Ryan footprint in other countries, we recognized the need for more quality schools in the UAE and lent ourselves to providing quality education. Since the UAE is in close proximity and many of the expats are Indian, it was compelling and simple to begin a school. The government of the UAE is focused on providing quality education to its people and very supportive of our efforts to set up a school in the UAE.</p><h4>What is your strategy to maintain these standards that you have set in India?</h4><p>We have been recognized and awarded by both private and governmental bodies. We frequently receive awards and accolades for our schools. In all the key surveys conducted in the country, Ryan schools rank amongst the best. No matter what processes or systems you put in place, at the end of the day you are dealing with children—with precious lives. We are committed to providing quality education to children from all strata of society. We have a multi-tiered Quality Assurance (QA) system for ensuring educational and school standards. Our staff undergoes rigorous training and internal certification before they begin to work. Regular in-school observations by trained personnel and thorough internal audits are undertaken to ensure that the school meets the exacting standards of the Ryan QA system. The system is also designed for continual improvement, which helps us offer better standards to our children and parents.</p><h4>When your students become graduates, how do they fit into the economy?</h4><p>We are proud to say that our alumni, who are well placed in various fields in different countries, speak of the quality of education at Ryan. Their high performance itself is a way to showcase their alma mater. They have learnt first-hand that education is not just learning academics; rather it is about being a responsible “humane" being. It is about demonstrating godly values and being a positive contributor to society. We are proud to see several of our less privileged children who received free education at Ryan doing fabulously well. Recently I met a boy at the airport who had received free education at Ryan. His father was a vegetable vendor in Mumbai. But, today he has his own business in Dubai and is ever grateful for the education received. Our children never forget our institution and all the values that they absorbed over the years. It is our constant desire to see our children soar to new heights of success and become good human beings. There are innumerable instances of our children coming up and thanking us for the education they have received. We have over 30,000 students graduating from Ryan International Schools every year. We are confident that they are well equipped as leaders to face the challenges of the future, for higher education and life in general. Today, we are delighted to see our alumni spread across the globe excelling and making valuable contributions in various fields. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Masdar Institute play in terms of research and as a feeder for human resources for Masdar City?</h4><p>Masdar Institute develops human and intellectual capital for the global community—not just Masdar City. Graduates have been employed at leading organizations such as Microsoft, GE, YahSat, Mubadala, MOFA, Siemens, ENEC, IRENA, and Nestlé, and have joined PhD programs at leading universities including UCLA, MIT, NYU, UC Berkeley, UT Austin, and Imperial College, London. We, of course, work with Masdar, which includes Masdar City, on a number of projects. Masdar Institute and Masdar were born out of Abu Dhabi's vision to diversify the economy away from its reliance on oil and gas and into advanced and sustainable energy, and thus share many common objectives. We have collaborated with Masdar on projects like Shams 1, the Masdar Solar Hub, and on the recently launched Ghantoot desalination projects. Masdar is one of many commercially driven organizations we work with.</p><h4>Can you describe the programs you offer, particularly ones that relate specifically to projects that the institute is involved with?</h4><p>Masdar Institute is a graduate-level university, and we are a research-driven university in collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Our programs are all in the field of advanced engineering. Currently, we have nine MSc programs and an interdisciplinary PhD program, and all have many active research projects with relevance to the UAE's strategic objectives. This semester, we launched a Master's concentration in space technology with YahSat, which coincides with the UAE's strategic objective of having a space program and a mission to Mars. Even before the UAE's announcement of its Mars mission, we had undertaken a number of research projects with applications for the space industry. We have partnered with local stakeholders to create our space concentration so that UAE nationals can receive the type of training and experience needed for the country to achieve its space ambitions.</p><h4>How are you utilizing the various research centers that you have at the institute?</h4><p>We have two basic models of research centers, namely our Institute Research Centers, which we call our iCenters, and our sponsored research centers. The iCenters follow basic themes of significant relevance to the UAE: water, energy, microsystems, and smart systems and advanced materials, which we pursue research leadership in. A fifth iCenter, the Innovation Center, works with these four thematic centers to identify the potential of technologies that have been tested and developed through the research labs and creates a proof of concept, which will further lead to prototypes and eventually to opportunities for those to become commercial products. This is a unique model, different from most of the innovation centers that are available. We are working with university research technology that has been taken to commercialization. We are following the MIT Deshpande Center model where they look at an innovation, determine potential for a certain prototype, and then seek to take it to new levels from there.</p><h4>What will Masdar Institute be focusing on in 2016?</h4><p>We believe we have a robust, structured approach to research that will continue to support the UAE's economic diversification efforts long into the future, without the need to change our focus on an annual basis. Our research foci reflect the areas where we feel we can have the biggest impact on the UAE's goals, namely energy, water, and the nexus between them, with food also being a part of that nexus. We emphasize an environment of collaboration, through which our research centers support each other so that whatever we do will be deeper and more aligned with our key areas of focus, particularly energy and water. When it comes to materials and smart cities, they are all working toward these strong thematic areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2015, the largest ever intake of students enrolled. What can we glean from that regarding the university's progression and expansion?</h4><p>
	In the five years since I started here, the student population has tripled. The university has graduated two batches of students out of the Abu Dhabi Campus; I believe part of what is going on is that people are starting to hire our students. There is good brand recognition now because we have graduates out there. The other thing we did this year was join the National Common Application and Placement Office (NAPO).We had always done our admissions process more or less completely separately from everyone else. It is the standard for applications in the US, and NAPO is a system by which students can fill out one application for anywhere they want to go. Students can then prioritize the university they would prefer to attend. The vision for the university is to be more selective and our board has been consistent with that. It wants to be sure that we are getting the top students; therefore, we do a little more diagnostic work at the beginning, particularly with math, science, and language.
</p><h4>Where do you see the focus of research?</h4><p>
	Khalifa University is strongly directed by Vision 2030; it is driven by diversification. In fact, Khalifa University and Masdar Institute form the educational arm of the 2030 vision. If the government is going to take the economy in the envisioned direction, it will need universities here that produce local workers that can be employed in these new industries, as well as do research that will benefit future industries. When we made our research plan, we had the 2030 plan in mind, which is where the five areas come in: ICT, aerospace and technology, energy and environment, healthcare technologies, and security.
</p><h4>How will this group of core subjects develop as the economy develops and continues to change until 2030? </h4><p>
	In industry, we are starting to engage with companies like Emirates Steel. Emirates Steel currently has no research staff, though it wants one. Therefore, we are talking about how to collaborate on projects. If there is an intake of our graduates in the next five to 10 years, then we change that situation; however, it takes time. Politically, it is important that more decision makers are technically trained. There have to be more people in government with technical backgrounds; it would make a difference. There is an excellent prospect for that here because the sociological status of engineers in the UAE is strong.
</p><h4>
	There is a new site being built, adjacent to the current one. How will that enhance the university?
</h4><p>
	The construction on the site next to the current location is huge for us, literally and figuratively. It is going to add about four times the space available to us. Just in terms of scope, it is really important. Engineering and science are both resource intensive; therefore, we outgrew our current resources pretty quickly, and we, therefore, need more. On the academic side, the expansion area that is most important for us and will be expanding is science. This refers to applied math and statistics. We are looking to develop programs in chemistry, and eventually physics and biology as well. There are certain inter-disciplinary research areas that will benefit from having more scientists on campus; healthcare is an obvious one. In sustainability and climate change, you need to have engineers, but also atmospheric chemists, biologists, and so forth. I expect in the next year or two to grow beyond a single college university (engineering), to one having more comprehensive offerings relating to science and technology. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Innovation was the theme for 2015. What initiatives are being implemented at the higher education level to maintain progress for this aspect of the economy?</h4><p>Innovation is key for a nation's survival. The two pillars of innovation are education and research. When you combine those two together, you get the heart of innovation. We support innovation and research differently. We had a specific project called the Abu Dhabi Research and Innovation Excellence Award. We decided we would support the universities directly and provide them with seed grants for innovation on the condition that it is in the fields that are relevant to Abu Dhabi's future, like renewable energy, healthcare, education, big data, material sciences, aerospace, telecoms, and space technology in addition to education and social sciences. We invited universities to apply for these awards and received 250 applications, of which 220 met our requirements and were sent for external evaluation. Out of that, we selected 34 awards to be given to the universities. The size of the award was between $200,000 and $400,00 for a startup project. We gave priority to the universities with strong track records and industry partnerships. One particular project developed the delivery of STEM education through 3D printing. The winning universities were the big players, and that is no surprise because it was purely based on objective criteria and external evaluation. Looking ahead, we want to focus our initiatives on sectors relevant to the future of Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>As new sectors enter prominence in the market, how does ADEC legislate for the relative unknowns in the economy?</h4><p>Within higher education there are different divisions, including research, authorization of programs, authorization of universities, the labor market, scholarships, and higher education policy and planning, through which we conduct studies for the government. All of this comes together and helps us to monitor and tailor the education process. Also, we have the employer satisfaction survey, through which we can give feedback to the government and universities on what fields need focus. We offer counseling to schools and students so they can know which fields are more attractive in terms of demand. In the past, studying law was quite common before it became oversaturated. In business administration, we see that there is a degree of market saturation, but there still exist some needs in finance and accounting. We see growing demand in various engineering fields as well as specified fields of medicine and health sciences.</p><h4>How do you work with international partners for knowledge transfer?</h4><p>We are part of a globalized world; therefore, we have various collaborations with international organizations, universities, and sometimes individuals. These take different forms of collaboration. The Abu Dhabi government has many partnerships with international universities like NYU, Sorbonne, and INSEAD, among others. We occasionally collaborate with international reviewers for the review process, like authorization of academic programs and evaluation research awards for excellence. We use international reviewers because we want to be as objective as possible. Also, we run workshops on topics like how to write a research proposal or how to start a startup company, or how to acquire accreditation. We train UAE nationals and professors from universities in how to do reviews of universities, theirs or others. As time passes, we will depend more on local expertise as the process matures and further develops</p><h4>What are your ambitions for 2016?</h4><p>Over 2016 and 2017 there is going to be a lot of emphasis on extension of reading, and in different dimensions. Reading covers everything from writing and reading literature to critical appraisal of scientific articles. The STEM projects will continue, as will the usual focus on access to education. There will be more emphasis on excellence in education, how to raise the level of education, and how to be more competitive in the international market. Maybe the ranking of higher education intuitions will come into the picture. These are some of the ideas for 2016 and 2017. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What unique value does Mubadala Real Estate &amp; Infrastructure bring to developing Al Maryah Island in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Mubadala is an active investor focused in areas that drive both financial and social benefits to Abu Dhabi in line with government priorities. Real estate and infrastructure projects are among those priorities, and Mubadala develops strategic commercial, residential, and leisure districts that are central to Abu Dhabi's long term development plans. Our major projects are part of the government's 2030 plan, a comprehensive strategy to develop the capital into an environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable, world-class city. A true success story for us has been the development of Al Maryah Island as Abu Dhabi's business and lifestyle destination. The hub is now home to Abu Dhabi Global Market, the world's newest international financial center, as well as five-star hotels, luxury shopping, fine dining, and world-class healthcare. Another area would be our role in delivering pioneering education infrastructure projects including the UAE University, Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi, and Zayed University Abu Dhabi's new campus. Mubadala's investment philosophy is centered on world-class partnerships, and because we work to international standards of quality, functionality, and sustainability, we have been able to attract partners like Gulf Related and Paris-Sorbonne to be part of our vision for Abu Dhabi. Collectively, these investments remain true to the Mubadala mandate by generating long-term financial returns and providing strong social benefit for the community.</p><h4>How do you view the impact of the global macroeconomic situation on real estate?</h4><p>The real estate industry is cyclical in nature, and we are accustomed to the periodic fluctuations caused by macroeconomics. Mubadala takes a long-term view with our investments and we project a continued rise in Abu Dhabi's population. Therefore, our strategy remains rooted in our vision to be a catalyst for the development of Abu Dhabi's economy. While we monitor the current markets closely and remain watchful, we do not lose sight of the bigger picture. Having said that, we strategize in the same way as all real estate developers do: we evaluate our portfolio, analyze the performance of our yielding assets, and plan future investments.</p><h4>What is the impact of Abu Dhabi Global Market on Al Maryah Island?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi Global Market, which officially opened for business in October 2015, is a broad-based international financial center for local, regional, and international institutions. It is a cornerstone of Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision, as it acts as a catalyst for the growth of the capital's dynamic financial services sector. As an international financial center operating in Abu Dhabi's financial free zone, which offers 100% ownership and zero tax for 50 years, Abu Dhabi Global Market plays a central role in attracting financial services firms to Al Maryah Island. It has three independent authorities, namely the Registration Authority, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, and ADGM Courts, which ensure its business-friendly environment operates in line with international best practices that are recognized by major financial centers across the world. Abu Dhabi Global Market complements Al Maryah Island's broader offer for businesses, which includes Grade-A office space, world-class residential, leisure, retail, and dining options, and exceptional connectivity to other parts of the capital. We are proud of Al Maryah Island's success—its growth has been nothing less than impressive. Six years ago, it was an empty plot of land. Today, it is a vibrant business and lifestyle destination that has some of the capital's most popular events, finest hotels and dining, luxury shopping, and world-class healthcare. Al Maryah Island is ever-evolving, and there are opportunities available for all kinds of third-party developers to invest in land-plots, which are ready for development, and be a part of the vision that we have for the island and Abu Dhabi. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ready-for-the-challenge]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the UAE economy grows and diversifies, what challenge does this present to the healthcare sector?</h4><p>The healthcare sector is full of challenges, and if you do not have clear directions and priorities you will be lost. One of the greatest challenges we are facing is securing talented staff, which is a challenge everywhere—it is not just attracting good staff, but retaining them. There is always a shortage and there is always a need to have a clear strategy in this area. Our healthcare system has become so complex that it not only requires physicians who do surgery, but also a lot of support staff. Technology is another aspect, and it is developing quickly. If you do not have a clear strategy on what and where to invest in technology, you will be lost. One of the challenges that we are facing here in the Middle East is lifestyle, because people's lifestyles are starting to change; therefore, we started being faced with many diseases and a number of conditions and diseases started to grow here because of these lifestyles. Diabetes and heart problems are examples and they are all linked to the new lifestyles that people are moving toward; they are changing the way they eat, the way they work, and all this will create a burden on the healthcare sector. If we do not include preventative education and explain what is covered with the healthcare in the strategy, then definitely in the future we will pay a lot and the costs will be high.</p><h4>With technology constantly evolving, what particular areas require financing at the moment?</h4><p>Technology enters all areas in the hospitals, from registrations to surgeries, from running management meetings to calling people; therefore, in the healthcare system it is key to use technology that makes work easier and safer while providing high-quality services. Any technology that can help make you more efficient and effective is positive. We have to be smart and clear on the direction we want to go. Financial resources should be available to every level of operation in the hospitals, and the wisdom in selecting which area of technology and equipment to invest in needs to be strategized; otherwise, it will increase the costs.</p><h4>Can you tell us what procedures are dominating your surgery statistics?</h4><p>Sheikh Khalifa Medical City is a flagship, tertiary hospital. We have more than 12 subspecialties that we call unique services, which are only available at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City; therefore, we have a wide scope of services. It is both a challenge and an opportunity to lead the market. We offer different types of surgery from cardiac surgeries to small procedures. We are a unique center for adult and pediatric cardiac surgery, and in 2015 the numbers of adult and pediatric cardiac surgeries was around 700, which is considered a large number. We are the only pediatric cardiac surgery program in the UAE. We are the center of excellence for pediatrics and cardiology, meaning we are capable of dealing with all types of cases related to pediatrics and cardiology ranging from mild to complex ones with positive outcomes. We also have other types of surgery like orthopedic surgeries, and we are having a big number or orthopedic surgeries done here from arthroplasty to other fracture surgeries and minor surgeries as well as pediatric spinal surgeries. We have an ophthalmology division, which is one of the most successful divisions in the system and we are the only pediatric ophthalmology center in the system. We have a diabetic center that offers a wide scope of services. Our emergency department is the largest in Abu Dhabi. Our physical medicine and rehabilitation service offers wide spectrum of services for inpatients and outpatients. Other unique services that are only offered at SKMC include kidney transplant, pediatrics, gastroenterology, and pediatric critical care. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you describe in more detail how enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods will be improved?</h4><p>There is work going on in several disciplines at the PI. In chemical engineering, this involves looking at the effects of injecting different polymers, water, or low-saline solutions into existing oil fields. In the field of electrical engineering, the use of electro kinetics down-hole to stimulate oil flow toward the well head is another field of inquiry that is being pioneered here. Once we gain insights into such technologies, we are better able to apply them in real-life, real-time situations in the field. It may take as many as three to five years before these ideas are fully realized in the field. Despite the time and resources that are required to make advances in these and many other technological areas of research, we are convinced of the value added by such research and are very pleased to be part of the greater mission of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to extend the boundaries of EOR beyond current practice.</p><h4>Can you describe the synergy between PI, the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, and Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research?</h4><p>Individually and collectively, these three exciting institutions have moved past their adolescence and are becoming a group of institutions that work together and collaborate in an ever increasing measure. I have been collaborating in one way or another with colleagues from Masdar and KUSTAR from the very moment I arrived in the UAE. Even then, we were already beginning to see each other as resources instead of as competitors. We have increased the interaction among our faculty considerably. The dynamics among universities are completely different from those at play in the corporate world. For us, the more we share, collaborate, and know about each other's work, without giving away industrial secrets outright, of course, the more we can avoid unnecessary competition regarding the disposition of scarce resources. There is more that can be done. I would like to see the institutions focus their resources on creating consolidated and coordinated investments in instrumentation and research laboratories. The Petroleum Institute Research Center (PIRC) is a great step in that direction. Although we are an ADNOC facility, the more we can create opportunities for faculties at other institutions to have access to cutting-edge technology, the better off we will all be.</p><h4>In terms of diversification, there was the solar car project undertaken by the PI. What other ongoing projects do you have that involve renewables?</h4><p>It is not generally known that our solar car broke world records in the qualifying laps at the Abu Dhabi Solar Car Challenge in 2015, even though we came in second in the race itself. The entire experience was an extraordinary breakthrough for us. It introduced us as an institution with the potential for research and technological advancement in renewable energy that we can expand and exploit here at the PI. We are also proud of our association with Tokai University in Japan, which was our partner in this. We are now expanding our relationship with Tokai University and looking for new paths of collaboration. We intend for two of the new buildings being built on campus to be completely self-sufficient based on solar energy generation. The new PIRC will have green laboratories as part of its roster of research facilities, and we look to solar energy, as well as at other developing technologies, such as lithium-based battery technology for the storage of energy. We are also interested in finding ways to save energy, particularly to save on fossil fuel expenditure. The PI and ADNOC understand that it is far better to earn profits off petroleum products by selling them in parts of the world that are without adequate energy resources, rather than expending that fuel domestically. In the interests of economic prosperity, finding alternative energy solutions, whether it is wind, solar, or other forms, is certainly something we are increasingly involved in. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current national mentality toward diabetes and what efforts do you have in terms of changing people's attitudes to diabetes and its causes?</h4><p>Diabetes is now front and center of people's minds, an important development as knowing there is a problem is the first step to addressing it. At Imperial College London Diabetes Centre, our approach requires us to focus on education, prevention, and management if we are to reverse the long-term trends we are seeing in the region and across the world. We believe that prevention is better than cure. Lifestyle and dietary habits are key to preventing diabetes, and in early 2007, just months after Imperial College London Diabetes Centre opened, we launched the center's award-winning public health awareness campaign, “Diabetes.Knowledge.Action" to address this crucial national issue for the country. The message is simple: a balanced diet, maintaining a normal body weight, and regular, brisk exercise comprise a healthy lifestyle that can help prevent, manage, and even reverse diabetes. The campaign has attracted attention and helped create greater awareness through a variety of means from healthy cooking classes to corporate football tournaments, from community walks to school visits and from diet classes to social media activations. It has become the UAE's longest-running public health campaign, and together with the center's services, over a million people have been directly reached by Imperial College London Diabetes Center. </p><h4>How does ICLDC coordinate and work with other healthcare institutions to deliver primary services?</h4><p>Our on-going vision is to create a Centre of Excellence for diabetes with a multi-disciplinary approach covering all aspects of diabetes and its complications, not just for Abu Dhabi, but for the UAE and the region. It is important, with a population with nearly one in five people with diabetes, to collaborate with institutions that address the complications and also facilitate admissions where necessary and look after the emergencies. The center liaises closely with the various UAE health bodies, government and private hospitals and primary care services within the UAE. In particular, we have well established relationships with our fellow Mubadala entities, Healthpoint and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi. The purpose of these arrangements is to provide specific, quality, focused, multi-disciplinary care as is needed by our patients. For example, we send patients for further cardiology treatment at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, while some cases of gastroenterology are referred to Healthpoint.</p><h4>How is technology utilized to deal with diabetes in the most effective way?</h4><p>When we opened the center, we wanted a one-stop model of care, with everything done in the same visit, from drawing blood to receiving results and seeing the physician, ensuring that both the patient and the treating physician have a complete picture of the condition and any related conditions and complications. This was only possible using customized, innovative software that could link up with all aspects of care, including billing. It also means that a patient journey, from registration through to prescription, can be made within an hour while the patient is still in the center. Technology is central to the future of diabetes and diabetes care. Having said that, face-to-face contact is also important for that ongoing engagement, as patients with diabetes tend to also have other issues that cannot be addressed digitally. We build strong, personal relationships with each our patients, and often their families, as together we embrace the individual diabetes management care program designed for each patient.</p><h4>Are you planning to expand in the UAE or regionally?</h4><p>The vision is that we need to be a leading organization for the delivery and provision of diabetes care for the region and internationally. We are increasing our capacity and improving efficiencies at our two centers, introducing new technologies, and working on developing sub-specialties in diabetes and expanding endocrinology service, which deals with hormonal disorders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since opening, how have appointments and procedures been spread across the respective departments and services?</h4><p>Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi is a multi-specialty hospital serving primarily adult patients. We offer services in more than 30 different specializations across 12 institutes, including five centers of excellence in heart and vascular, neurological, eye, and digestive disease, and respiratory and critical care. We also have institutes for medical sub-specialties and for surgical sub-specialties, both of which offer a complete suite of services in traditional internal medicine, such as head and neck surgery and urology. We do not treat children with the exception of the Eye Institute, because there is such a need locally for pediatric ophthalmology.</p><h4>How does the hospital balance resources between medical tourism and domestic healthcare, undertaken as part of the national infrastructure? </h4><p>First and foremost, it is important to emphasize that Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi is here to serve the local community—Emirati and expat patients who reside in Abu Dhabi and the wider UAE. This is our primary goal: to provide high-quality treatment that keeps Emirati patients and other residents in Abu Dhabi, thereby reducing the need to travel abroad for care. This obviously keeps them closer to their families and loved ones as well. This is the most important part of our mission. The second part of our mission is to ensure Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi makes a lasting change by contributing to the sustainable growth of Abu Dhabi's healthcare sector. An integral part of this effort is the development of Emirati leaders in healthcare and we are meeting this objective by supporting knowledge and skills transfer, particularly through research and innovation.</p><h4>Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi is a Mubadala company investment that brings American healthcare expertise across to Abu Dhabi. How does this provide stability and financial resources?</h4><p>Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi is primarily here to complement the existing offerings in the Abu Dhabi market by bringing the first true replication of the US healthcare model outside of North America, when it comes to highly specialized, complex care. In so doing, we are filling a need for acute and critical care within the healthcare sector. We are fortunate to have Mubadala as our partner in this endeavor. Our collaboration has been exceptionally strong and continues to be so. Without this joint effort, and the collaboration with regulators and the broader healthcare community, it would not have been possible to build this completely new, 4.4 million sqft campus. Furthermore, as part of the Mubadala network, we are able to collaborate with experts across different specialties and work together for the wider development of the healthcare sector. What makes us unique is how our singular focus on patients' needs drives our delivery model. </p><h4>What expansion and further development plans do you have in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Rising population and changing demographics are features of every society and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi's long-term strategy in the UAE could potentially provide for additional services as needs arise in the future. Currently, we are focused on delivering services offered in our 12 institutes and fulfilling our mission of helping reduce the need for patients to travel abroad for complex, critical care. In addition, we look forward to accepting more and more patients and we recently signed three new agreements with insurance providers. This is in addition to accepting patients with Thiqa and select Daman Enhanced insurance plans as well as those who wish to self-pay. We also plan to add two more important features to our medical campus, namely training and education, and research and innovation. Our current focus is to ramp up to our full capacity and better serve patients in the UAE with our complete suite of services, many of which were not previously available here. Then, we will see what the future brings. We have a bright future ahead of us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[build-it-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Having started in 2008, the company managed to ride the financial crash and the subsequent collapse of the property bubble in Dubai. How was this possible?</h4><p>There were two factors that allowed us to get through that period when many banks were struggling. Firstly, we are more selective than some of our competitors in choosing which developers we partner with. Secondly, we have always been careful about our lending decisions. Everybody has different risk appetites, and that is not a criticism—you need some people who are more aggressive, otherwise start-ups would never get financed. However, part of our vision is to help develop a stable and sustainable real estate sector in Abu Dhabi, and that includes helping people to buy a home. We believe that this can only be done by lending money in a responsible manner. </p><h4>What legislative changes have changed the operating landscape for Abu Dhabi Finance (ADF)?</h4><p>The major change in the banking industry in Abu Dhabi has been the introduction of the Credit Bureau, which has been active for most of 2015. As expected, when a Credit Bureau comes in, decline rate goes up, particularly on unsecured finance. In addition, one key element of the Central Bank mortgage regulations was the introduction of a mandated stress test—can a borrower cope with repayments if interest rates rise? Whilst ADF has always applied the stress test, it means that in an environment where rates are rising, some individuals are now not eligible for mortgages on properties they might have obtained previously. We believe this maintains stability for our business, our clients and the wider market because it significantly lowers the delinquency rate.</p><h4>How will ADF's portfolio develop, as the real estate market looks to have slowed and banks become more cautious about lending mortgages?</h4><p>The major trend that we have seen in our residential portfolio is that there has been a shift toward end users. When we first started, 70% of our clients were professional investors, or landlords. Now the opposite is true; 60-70% of our clients are end users, which is good because it brings stability to the market as end users tend to hold onto their property for longer. Also the market is maturing, end users and expatriates are more comfortable putting their money into a house because mortgage rates are low, and people are tired of paying large rents. Even though the number of overall transactions has come down over the last 18 months, the number of mortgage transactions has not dropped. </p><h4>Looking at history of large rent hikes and the legislation that is coming in to stabilize this situation, how will that affect business for ADF?</h4><p>For the last two years, rents have continued to increase; Abu Dhabi removed its rent cap and Dubai introduced one and whilst the Dubai rent cap has been moderately successful in stabilizing prices, overall rents have continued to increase in both Emirates, while mortgage rates have remained low. Even with the recent increases in interest base rates the average mortgage versus the average rent on any particular property is 20-40% cheaper, meaning now is a great time to buy. Additionally many lenders, including ADF, offer a three-year fixed-rate mortgage. I am less worried about real estate prices. We continued to lend throughout the last downturn and we will lend through the next one. As long as we lend sensibly and responsibly to good, creditworthy individuals and apply sensible credit policies we will be fine. The main concern is if interest rates move up too quickly. The government, companies, and consumers are all exposed in terms of borrowing. Consumers in the UAE in particular have borrowed heavily over the last few years, which is one of the reasons why the Credit Bureau was brought in. As a banker, I am monitoring the speed of that base rate moving up, because that can increase the stress on our client's ability to repay. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With the population expected to continue growing until 2030, how are projects like the Strategic Tunnel Enhancement Program (STEP) going to cope with the additional infrastructural challenges that Abu Dhabi will face?</h4><p>We have a master plan due for completion in November, which looks at just this issue, namely how we would cater to the additional population in the coming years. We have used Urban Planning Council (UPC) projections and also historical data to help us formulate the plan and estimate what the flows will be. The main task is simple: ensure we have treatment capacity for years to come. Our treatment plants are already close to their design capacity; therefore, the new master plan will make recommendations on what we should be putting in, or thinking of constructing over the coming years. In all likelihood, we will be thinking seriously about extending our capacity next year, because it takes about four years from concept to commissioning; hence, we have to plan quite far in advance. Currently, we see a doubling of volumes every 10 years starting in 1982. At some point that will surely level out; however, for the near to medium future, we expect that rate of increase to continue.</p><h4>What do you feel has been achieved in these last five years, the span of the company's master plan?</h4><p>We have really achieved a lot. We now have the capacity for treatment we lacked before. We had constraints in our treatment plants because we were overloaded, and because we were overloaded we couldn't maintain them properly. We were still treating the water, but there was a risk that the water treatment quality wouldn't be as high quality as it should have been. Now, we have new operational plants, and we have spare capacity in these plants, although that spare capacity is quickly being used up by the rapid population growth we're seeing. All in all, we are in a much better and stronger position than we were in 2010. The augmentation of the infrastructure is largely complete. We have put new trunk mains in that will take the wastewater from the more outlying developments into the center for treatment. The capacity of these trunk mains are sized for growth. This means we are in a strong position. Some of our work is still ongoing; however, it is going to be concluded in the next year or so. We are also undertaking the rehabilitation of our pumping stations and our mains. We have pumping stations and pipes, which, in some cases, are 30 years old, whereas typically a pumping station would be replaced some time around 15 and 20 years old. We have gone through a large rehabilitation program over the last five years, and many of these pumping stations are now in a much better condition than when we started. </p><h4>Can you summarize the position of the company as we move forward into the next five-year strategic plan?</h4><p>The first and most important thing we are looking at is the commissioning of STEP, which will take place next year. This will depressurize the system and relieve the stress on the network, making our job much easier by bringing normality to the system. Parallel to this is the decommissioning of the pumping stations, which is an ongoing legacy from the 2010-15 program. We will be looking at increasing treatment capacity to deal with population growth, as new plants will be constructed over the next three to four years. Beyond that, we have to look at driving efficiency into our system. So from going to a place where we had to address shortfalls in terms of capacity and in terms of our infrastructure, we are now going to be looking at being more efficient in using new infrastructure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the opportunities for PPPs in Saudi Arabia in the education sector today?</h4><p>There are many opportunities for PPPs in education. In fact, the Ministry of Education is promoting many initiatives with the private sector. For example, we are already in the process of implementing some vital programs, such as private schools, school buildings, and school transportation. We aim to close the gap between the two through such cooperation. Also, we are looking forward to more opportunities to expand our relationship with the private sector, as it will benefit both sides, provide flexibility and competitiveness, and enhance quality.</p><h4>What role can digitization play in the education sector in Saudi Arabia to increase efficiency and reduce cost?</h4><p>The potential is big and we are supporting the use of technology in the classroom. We are developing several programs and we plan to work on many others in the near future. We believe e-learning is crucial to the development of the educational sector and it is a high-priority for the Ministry of Education. It will play a bigger role in the future.</p><h4>What are the specific goals and expectations for the Ministry of Education for 2016?</h4><p>We are optimistic in promoting reform and change for the best. However, our ultimate goal is to improve the quality of education and improve standards at all levels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Abu Dhabi's rapid development and urbanization toward one of the world's top Emirates, especially for business?</h4><p>Thanks to the wise leadership of HH Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and that of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan who succeeded him, in just 50 years the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and indeed the whole nation, has grown to become one of the most important economic centers, both regionally and globally. Al Ain was, of course, particularly blessed, because 20 years earlier Sheikh Zayed was appointed ruler's representative in the Eastern Region of Abu Dhabi and he drove the region's economy through maintaining and expanding the 3,000 year old falaj system, which began the initiation of an expansive green program, laying out a city plan and effectively founding modern day Al Ain. It is our responsibility to maintain this tradition of thorough, well-prepared plans that are properly implemented with a high standard of construction and continued maintenance, so that we can move toward the goal of positioning the Abu Dhabi government among the top five governments in the world. </p><h4>What is the role of Al Ain Municipality on the implementation of Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 is a detailed and comprehensive document that focuses on the important links between urban planning, major infrastructure, and economic development. The Vision 2030 states that Al Ain is a knowledge center, a name developed due to numerous quality museums, universities, and healthcare infrastructure. While the coastline will attract the majority of business, Al Ain should maintain the core focuses that characterize the city. Lifestyle quality is essential, not the quality of shopping facilities and large buildings. Tourism will, therefore, contribute to the Emirate through the attraction of natural heritage, and quiet, but pleasant lifestyle. We are dedicated to the principle that growth will not sacrifice rich cultural and environmental heritage. We work with both the Municipality in Abu Dhabi and the Urban Planning Council, and are sometimes requested to implement aspects of the Vision 2030 policies, particularly when projects require detailed master planning, the construction of local roads, infrastructure, landscaping, coordination of the delivery of community services and so on.</p><h4>What is your strategy to cope with the growth population in the Emirate and to attract expatriates to Al Ain?</h4><p>Al Ain City Municipality assists the Abu Dhabi Housing Authority and the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council as they prepare plans to address matters related to population growth. However, after new housing and industrial developments are delivered, our work does not stop as the community still needs integrated facilities and services. The allocation of land for these facilities, coordinating the provision of the facilities with the relevant agencies is an important responsibility that we are currently working hard to fulfill.</p><h4>In 2015, you signed a partnership with Injazat to implement a comprehensive Business Integration Platform. What are your objectives to support smart government initiatives in order to enhance your operational efficiency, accountability, and transparency?</h4><p>Our Business Integration Platform has been set up for two main purposes: firstly, to enable private organizations and other government entities to link with Al Ain City Municipality's internal services; and, secondly, to improve internal business systems within the municipality. The platform works today with 12 different partners, enabling access to 22 government services and six Al Ain City Municipality service points. It also ties together, electronically, the systems of all three municipalities: Al Ain Municipality, the Municipality of Abu Dhabi City, and the Western Region Municipality. This facilitates safe and secure communication between businesses, regulators, and local government entities, while also providing ease of access and top-tier services. The platform is provided through an operating lease between Injazat and the three municipalities; however, there is also official documentation with 19 government entities and with commercial real estate offices that access the Property Owners Services System. In partnership with the Municipality of Abu Dhabi City and the Western Region Municipality, we plan to continue to develop this platform and will use it to further the integration of municipal services and the improvement of service delivery to businesses. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has ADT facilitated growth in the Emirate's maritime sector?</h4><p>We expect YoY growth to come in at roughly 35% for 2015 over 2014 or around 1.5 million containers in 2015. In addition, we seek 10-11% growth for 2016 in terms of our forecast. The Abu Dhabi export business is the most important segment for us, along with transshipment. Those two segments drive the bulk of our growth. On the imports side, growth is more moderate, as it is related to GDP and government spending and we see fairly normal growth percentages of 3-5%. The major industries for us on the export side are steel, aluminum, polymers, food processing, and agriculture. All these activities have received a great deal of investment over the last few decades. The authorities have ramped up capacity and produced a great deal on the commodities side. Most of this goes out through Khalifa Port and drives our growth. We have also been expanding the transshipment business, moving cargo for other ports in the region. The UAE is still the hub that most shipping lines and traders choose within the Gulf area.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your relationship with government-linked companies that you work with here in Kizad, and how you facilitate trade for them?</h4><p>We take a direct approach and spend considerable time and effort on building market intelligence. We use all the information we collect to map out the markets and the origins and destinations for all the companies that conduct imports and exports in Abu Dhabi and the surrounding markets. We then talk directly to those companies to determine their needs. We look at whether we have all their business, and if not what we have to do to get it. We use that same approach from small companies all the way to large government accounts. Once we figure out what customers need in terms of service and coverage we try to translate that into a network that we can provide. We map that network up and match it to the shipping lines' networks. This way, we can accurately measure if we are servicing the economy and trade satisfactorily. It also allows us to identify opportunities that we would not otherwise know about, such as a packing plant, which is not an obvious activity to do at a container terminal.</p><h4>What can we expect from ADT in 2016 in terms of expansion, development, and major names?</h4><p>At the moment, there are 45 different companies setting up at Kizad. That industrial zone will continue to grow; it just takes time to build and get all the permits in place. Brazil Foods (BRF) is celebrating its first anniversary at Kizad, and once companies are there and it starts developing, the integration will really begin to work. Companies in Kizad typically look at supplying the UAE market, before adding more capacity and entering the Gulf market. We will add the final stage of Phase I in 4Q2016-1Q2017. We will get three more automated stacking ship-to-shore (STS) cranes from China. In 2016, we will be 85% utilized, which is plenty for most ports. We will then enter Phase II, which is the full build of the man-made port island. We expect to start investing in that in 2018. By then, we will be up to over 2 million TEUs and there is a lead time of about 18 months from investment to commissioning. Then, we will have another 2.5 million TEU capacity to grow with. We have been enjoying a fantastic growth profile over the last five years. Container volume in Abu Dhabi grew from 500,000 TEUs to 1.5 million in four years. We will have another one or two years with double-digit growth, before it moderates after 2017. There are a number of wild cards at the moment with low oil prices and budget deficits in the Gulf states, which is relevant for everyone. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How vital are the ports in Abu Dhabi with regard to diversifying the economy?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi Ports is a key enabler of the Emirate's economic diversification. Our company contributed more than AED14 billion to Abu Dhabi's GDP and generated over 39,500 new direct and indirect job opportunities in 2014. As the maritime trade business enabler, the activities of Abu Dhabi Ports in its entirety accounted for 2.9% of the Emirate's non-oil GDP, which resulted in a rise of nearly 2% of overall employment in Abu Dhabi's non-oil economy. Our contribution to the expansion of the Emirate's tourism sector, a major component of its economic diversification, was also significant. Growth in the cruise business generated an estimated value-added contribution to the Abu Dhabi economy of over AED71 million and resulted in the employment of more than 300 people. The Khalifa Industrial Zone (Kizad), the integrated trade and industrial hub of Abu Dhabi, improved its value-added contribution to AED6.1 billion, and created over 3,600 employment opportunities in 2014.</p><h4>Can you describe Khalifa Port's integration within the industrial zone?</h4><p>Kizad's integrated design with Khalifa Port has the potential to meet the future demands of industrial and logistic sectors in Abu Dhabi. Kizad has created clusters for certain industries together, whose offerings can be mutually beneficial to boost their business. As the products and services offered by an investor are utilized by others within the cluster, it becomes a circle of value creation. The “economies of proximity" offer convenient and cost-effective business operations. The aluminum cluster with Emirates Aluminum (EMAL/EGA) is an example. EMAL will convey aluminum to other manufacturers in the zone in hot molten form through our innovative Hot Metal Road, transported by specially fitted trucks. This molten aluminum will also be directly used by other industries in the cluster like TALEX, saving substantial energy and costs of re-melting the aluminum.</p><h4>How is the cruise sector developing after Zayed Port was upgraded?</h4><p>The newly opened Abu Dhabi Cruise Terminal at Zayed Port, a premier cruise hub in the region, has received an unprecedented number of passengers. The state-of-the-art terminal's innovative and efficient mechanism has proved successful in handling the burgeoning number of cruisers, contributed by the homeporting of a global cruise liner, MSC Musica of MSC Cruises. This luxury cruise vessel alone will bring 45,000 of a total of 205,000 cruise passengers scheduled to visit Abu Dhabi during the current cruise season ending April. This rise in number of cruisers during this season will represent over 19% growth compared with the previous season, and a five-fold surge since the first cruise season in 2006-2007. This remarkable growth is projected to reach more than 300,000 passengers expected on 130 scheduled ship calls by the 2019-2020 season. </p><h4>In 2014, Khalifa Port was the third-fastest growing container port in the world, and the fastest growing in the region. How was this achieved?</h4><p>Khalifa Port achieved 32% growth in container cargo volumes and a 27% upswing in RoRo traffic in 2015 compared with the previous year. Our strategic priority to achieve innovation and deploy advanced port technology and well-planned infrastructure expansion made this possible. The increased investments in Kizad and the favorable factors of the Abu Dhabi economy also played a major role. Our significant investments in technology, world-class infrastructure, and services have enhanced our customer experience. The implementation of Maqta Gateway, a new purpose-built port community system, and Jade's terminal operating system is expected to further improve our productivity and efficiency. The new productivity records set by Abu Dhabi Terminals also contributed to the growth. As part of our constant efforts for efficiency improvement, a 12-minute turnaround time for trucks has raised Khalifa Port's profile as an international maritime hub. We have introduced a range of new mobile applications and internal services, including an e-Pass service that helps customers submit all of their security details online in advance. Our YoY growth indicates that we have responded well to demands from rising import and export activities in the Emirate. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What investment opportunities does the country's national aviation industry offer for national and foreign corporations?</h4><p>The opportunities are plenty and varied. Every one of our civil aviation projects is open for private investment, with various business models that range from strategic partnerships to privatization. There are several major investment opportunities for private-sector investments offered by the national civil aviation industry. Five global consortiums are currently competing to win a contract for the new Taif Airport, based on the build-transfer-operate (BTO) business model. Negotiations with an investor are under way for the construction of Prince Naif Airport in Quassim, also based on the BTO model. Five global corporations are also in competition to operate the new King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah. Swissport, meanwhile, has won the second license to offer ground services across the Kingdom's airports. The Dublin Airports Corporation won a contract to manage and operate the recently finished Terminal 5 at King Khalid International Airport, with an annual capacity of 12 million travelers. Airfreight and in-flight catering will soon be open to global competition. Work is also under way to open up commercial real estate investment in airport properties—based on the “airport city" model—to global competition, and to privatize the Prince Sultan Academy for Aviation Sciences. There is also work under way to privatize the Saudia Private Aviation Company, Saudia Real Estate Development Co. Ltd., and Saudia Medical Services Co. Ltd.</p><h4>What reforms do you intend to introduce to improve the level of service the sector provides to customers?</h4><p>We have many reforms in the pipeline, such as creating a separation between our legislative and oversight roles on the one hand, and the day-to-day running of operational and administrative businesses on the other. The idea here is for the authority to become only a legislative and regulating body, while operations are shifted over to the private sector. We are also improving air transport activities according to global best practices and putting our human resources to the best possible use. We have established a new department for customer protection and issued an executive code that establishes, in meticulous detail, the rights of air travelers, such as their right to receive care should their flights get delayed or canceled, and the right for those with special needs to receive attention onboard, among many others.</p><h4>What measures need to be in place to enable airports across the country to accommodate the targeted 100 million travelers by 2020?</h4><p>The authorities' strategic plan is fully in line with the 2030 Vision, one of the objectives of which is to privatize and enhance transparency for better services provided to all clients of the civil aviation industry. We started aggressive operational, investment, and service programs at every airport, with the aim being to enable airports to maximize their local potential. As for infrastructure, new airports are being built and existing ones are being expanded—a key aspect of the authority's strategy that aims to transform services by privatizing the civil aviation sector, turning every unit into a discrete, growing, and sustainable business that operates on a competitive basis. This will secure the rights of the general public and all other stakeholders and strengthen competition, which will ultimately reflect favorably on the Kingdom's civil aviation industry and overall market.</p><h4>What are your targets for 2016?</h4><p>The authority has established the Saudi Civil Aviation Holding Company, which will be in charge of the privatization process. By the end of 2016, we aim to privatize several airports and strategic units. Work is ongoing on a number of expansion and development projects at various airports all over the Kingdom. The completion deadlines for each of these projects, as set in their contracts, may be years away, but the work set to be competed in 2016 is right on schedule.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE's ICT sector is the most advanced market of its kind in the region. What is your outlook on the sector and what have been the main drivers of growth in 2015?</h4><p>The TRA's outlook for the UAE's telecommunications sector remains positive. We have two strong telecommunications service providers that have continued to invest in cutting-edge technologies. They both display high levels of innovation and are quick to respond to the needs of the market. The key drivers of growth in the UAE's telecommunications market in 2015 have been fixed, and we believe this trend will continue into 2016. It is now up to the licensees to continue to act upon the opportunities generated by a growing customer appetite for high-speed uninterrupted data services. Fixed-line bundles including telephony, broadband, and TV services also drove growth in 2015.</p><h4>What initiatives are you planning to develop technologically advanced cities within the Emirates?</h4><p>The TRA is managing one of the most important sectors when it comes to the future of economy and government. ICT is the nervous system of smart cities, providing the infrastructure for IoT and M2M communication. One of our most important projects is the government smart cloud, which is the main product of the Federal Network (FedNet). FedNet provides common infrastructure for enabling availablity and providing convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources for federal government entities. FedNet promotes communication between various federal entities using a single secure common architecture and plays a vital role in enabling the mGovernment. The FedNet program will deliver a cloud environment, which will be a scalable, on-demand network. The FedNet project comes under the direction of connectedness and integration, which is the fourth level in a smart government as mandated by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. One of the other projects is developing the smart data strategy, which includes managing, analyzing, and availing data to citizens. This is essential to serve the business need for apps and other solutions, which cannot be developed in the absence of data.</p><h4>Are you willing to open more opportunities for international business within the ICT sector?</h4><p>The TRA is tasked with overseeing and regulating the telecommunications sector in the state and ensuring competition in the sector according to state policy. The TRA is pleased to have issued a satellite license to Inmarsat's UAE-established entity and is expecting that the issuance will widen the supply and quality of satellite services in the UAE, leading to reductions in the price of such services. The TRA welcomes other applicants for satellite services to the extent that they meet the requirements determined within the Telecommunications Law, namely the localization of the entity—51% UAE ownership.</p><h4>What is your strategy to support telecommunications entrepreneurship, a sector essential to the UAE's economy?</h4><p>Telecommunications services are an essential input for SMEs. SMEs rely on telecommunications services to communicate with customers and potential customers, market products, sell products, recruit staff, and engage with suppliers, among other things. The TRA has several responsibilities to ensure that SMEs can operate at their full capacity. Ensuring the adequacy of telecoms services throughout the UAE while achieving the enhancement of services through quality and variety is a key function. On a wider scale, we are always looking to promote new technologies and ensure that the UAE becomes a regional ICT hub—this is made possible through, but not limited to, R&amp;D. In other words, the TRA seeks to ensure the quality and range of services accessible by SMEs in order to improve the extent to which they can increase the opportunities offered by ICT services. Furthermore, the TRA seeks to regulate the sector in a manner that enhances competition between licensees. It has been well documented that enhanced competition drives down prices of telecommunications services. This will ultimately enable SMEs to offer lower prices for their products and services, thus enhancing their international competitiveness. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What process does the company go through, with regards to tendering contracts?</h4><p>Musanada policies and processes are compliant with Abu Dhabi's Tenders and Procurement Law, Law No. 6. Musanada operates a robust electronic procurement process using the Tejari application. Requirements are tendered openly to the market to pre-qualified and registered suppliers, which encourages strong competition and fair pricing. Musanada supplier registration system is linked to the government systems, which are managed by the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Department of Economic Development. Musanada aims to provide encouragement and support for qualified small and medium enterprises and local vendors, which is in line with the government's strategy for developing this segment of the economy. Musanada's internal governance system including tender opening, procurement and technical and commercial evaluation committees ensures fairness during the award process.</p><h4>Key infrastructure projects such as developing the airport road network and the Future School's Project have come under Musanada's jurisdiction. How does the company balance national and foreign involvement when overseeing these projects?</h4><p>Musanada's project delivery strategy requires project managers to engage directly with the contractors for managing the successful delivery. All sectors are headed by competent UAE nationals who have requisite experience in technical aspects in both engineering and project management. A total of 86% of Musanada's senior management positions are filled by UAE nationals. Through our strong commitment to Emiratization we then incorporate the specialized services and competencies of expatriates as acquired, sometimes offsetting part of the workload, on a project-by-project basis. </p><h4>While developing a project Musanada will work with the relevant government authority. How does the company work with ADDED, ADCED, and the respective SWFs in order to help guide the economy?</h4><p>Authorities such as these translate Abu Dhabi's vision into specific policies and priorities, and through lawmaking will eventually require our services. These priorities eventually translate to specific capital intensive projects, the bulk of which are assigned to Musanada for delivery and maintenance. Musanada contributes to economic development by channeling the demand to the private sector. Musanada operates as a publicly owned, listed company to support government development of construction and infrastructure.</p><h4>Which areas are viewed as the primary areas to invest in for 2016?</h4><p>Musanada is a PJSC fully owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. Based on government priorities, the main delivery focus for 2016 has been housing, roads and infrastructure, and healthcare projects. With regard to internal investment, we will be upgrading our technology infrastructure and are building capabilities to improve the delivery from an asset lifecycle perspective.</p><h4>The population of Abu Dhabi is expected to more than double between 2008 and 2030, reaching over 5 million. How will this impact on the areas of the economy that the company will focus upon?</h4><p>Musanada participates regularly as a key delivery partner, accounting for approximately 70% of new development in the public sector within the Urban Planning Framework. The regional plans are being updated to address the changes in demand and demographics. Musanada's strategy focuses on ensuring that the delivery of projects takes place in a coordinated and integrated manner to ensure complete readiness for community occupation in time with the delivery schedule. </p><h4>Recently, the real estate sector has shown signs of slowing down due to a decrease in government spending. How do you asses the market levelling out and how will this affect the company?</h4><p>The ongoing slump in the oil prices has definitely led to re-evaluation of government priorities. Musanada has been asked to focus on priority projects in different sectors. However, we see that the government is still targeting a healthy overall spend over the next few years. Musanada will remain the main driver of demand in Abu Dhabi, while the rapid infrastructure development in Dubai and other GCC region poses an ongoing challenge for acquiring services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What about the current economic situation makes it vital to attract and develop the media sector as part of the economy?</h4><p>At the 2016 World Government Summit, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, summed up our nation's economic challenge when he said we need to be prepared to sell our last barrel of oil within the next 50 years. When you consider that oil is one of the major contributors economically,  the statement highlights the need for diversification. Hence, Abu Dhabi's 2030 diversification plan, a key pillar of which is creating a sustainable media industry as one alternative source of economic activity. twofour54 is helping the Emirate to become a media and production hub and is a catalyst for content creation in the region. When we look at the industry, we look at how we can develop it commercially, rather than simply being a zone where companies can set up an office. </p><h4>What specific film markets are being developed here, and how is exposure generated into achieving international recognition?</h4><p>We know that we will not be able to guarantee our presence without having international and regional partners. We really believe in collaboration and the power of partnership. I am an Emirati, born and raised in Abu Dhabi, and before 10 years of age there were mainly just cartoons, but then we started to see other content coming from the West, mainly, or Bollywood.  Now, there is also Korean material coming in. And this is in addition to a growing demand for Arabic drama productions across the region. What are we doing to tap into all of this? The first thing is the 30% rebate incentive for filming in Abu Dhabi, to give the Emirate exposure to these projects. This works alongside our efforts to develop talent and build the services and auxiliary companies to support such productions. To help build the model for being a production hub, we partner with productions that come to Abu Dhabi. We are now linking Bollywood and Hollywood for the first time, because we are a meeting point. We recently signed a deal with O3 Productions, a partner of the MBC Group, to ensure more regional drama is filmed here. In addition, we have a sister company called Image Nation Abu Dhabi, which develops drama projects that are fully filmed in Abu Dhabi. This all helps in terms of building up a stronger engine for production here in Abu Dhabi and our efforts are paying off. We are proud to have successfully hosted a number of Bollywood movies, international television series and two of the world's biggest movie franchises, Star Wars and Fast and Furious, all of which add immensely to our international reputation.</p><h4>How is the zone helping entrepreneurs find a physical location and grow their company presence once they have set up?</h4><p>We can have a new company set up in the zone in just three weeks with everything ready; you just plug and play. We offer different office space options to cater for the different needs of different businesses. Our government and travel services team provides all of the services that are required from that perspective, for example, if you have staff who are non-Emirati this is where their visas would be arranged. Our freelancer pool of over 490 people means that if you want to start a company and need certain skills, there is a diverse pool of ready resources already here at twofour54 to tap into. We also manage a program of networking activities to connect media companies with government entities and the private sector. Ultimately, our dedicated client management team ensures that twofour54 media companies have the support they need to succeed and grow with us in Abu Dhabi. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your strategy for a sustainable and environmentally friendly future for Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>The vision of Abu Dhabi City Municipality is aligned with the vision of the Municipal System based on developing a world-class efficient municipal system capable of achieving the cherished sustainable development and enhancing the standards and quality of living in Abu Dhabi Emirate. Environmental sustainability is one of the core objectives of supporting the strategy, vision, mission, and values of the Municipality. Achieving this objective rests on two priorities: contributing to sustainable urban development to satisfy the needs of growth in the Emirate, and enhancing Abu Dhabi's product through nurturing an attractive, clean, and healthy environment. The core municipal business of infrastructural works includes supervising the planning and the construction of internal roads, bridges, tunnels, parks, recreational facilities, and other projects within the remit of the Municipality. It also covers supervising operations, maintenance of internal roads network, and maintaining safety levels. The Municipality also attends to managing networks of rainwater, irrigation water, and street lighting. The municipal strategy revolves around the vision of the government in making Abu Dhabi one of the top metropolitan cities in the world in terms of high-quality services, highly efficient works, improved safety levels, and reduced operational and maintenance costs. The strategy also covers mapping out procedures for adapting to climatic changes through economizing the use of resources, reducing carbon footprint and curbing the environmental effects of infrastructural works.</p><h4>The development of Mohammed Bin Zayed City is a pivotal project. What are the services that will be provided?</h4><p>The Mohammed Bin Zayed City covers an area 49.3sqkm. The current population of the city is about 100,000 persons, with the estimated capacity to accommodate about 228,000 people after the project is complete. Comprising a total number of 9,144 land plots, the Abu Dhabi City Municipality is striving to develop Mohammed Bin Zayed City by building a road network, infrastructure, and parks all over the city. These three sets of infrastructure are needed in order to raise the standard of living. So far three parks and five playgrounds have been built, and we have a further seven parks and 20 playgrounds under tendering process.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi City Municipality is a member in Arab Cities Organization and Islamic Cities Organization. What is the relationship that connects you with other cities in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and how does this connection contribute to the development of Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi City Municipality is committed to the objectives of the GCC General Secretariat to foster and consolidate relations, especially with regard to coordination, sharing experiences, and knowledge, as well as best practices. The Abu Dhabi City Municipality has benefited greatly from the benchmarking visits to various GCC cities by sharing expertise in municipal work. The Municipality has received a number of delegations from the GCC, including a delegation from Al Baha Municipality, Saudi Arabia in May 2015, the Bahraini Ambassador in January 2015, and a delegation from Al Qassim Municipality, Saudi Arabia, in 2014. The Municipality has conducted a number of joint workshops, such as the Municipalities &amp; Smart Cities Conference, held in May 2010, which discussed the global competitive strategies for municipalities, development of GCC cities, and the recent international drive toward building smart, digital, and high-tech cities. The conference reviewed the latest trends and practices used for managing and recycling waste, strategies for planning and developing cities and industrial areas in the GCC, local and regional economic impacts, green cities, and global environmental challenges. These platforms, experience sharing, and integration have contributed to developing work systems at Abu Dhabi City Municipality, which is reflected in the quality of services on offer, thus enhancing the quality of life in Abu Dhabi. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Knowledge transfer is a key component of the work Thales does in the UAE. What topics and sectors are dominating that knowledge transfer for Thales at the moment?</h4><p>We have been present in the UAE for many years, and we have been transitioning from pure export mode to a more local mode. We have a few different set-ups including joint ventures and branches as well. One of the most important branches is the CERT Thales Institute (CTI), which is a training center tasked with supporting the more traditional businesses like National Telesystems and Services (NTS), which is there to support our local operation but is not a substitute to transfer knowledge and technology. When it comes to the Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT) and CTI we are working with Deso and the French government. The trainees have a four-step training program, with the first step here with Thales supporting them as we hold the contract. The second part of their training is in France at a French Air Force base, while the third component is at one of the engineering colleges in France. Finally, the trainees come back to the UAE for on-the-job training. This system has been operating since 1999. We have trained a lot of people in warfare, maintenance, operating scanners and other equipment, civil aviation, and other similar fields. In terms of diversification, we are working a lot with the Khalifa Fund for Innovation. We have been working with the fund to enable it to put together what has been signed between Tawazun and Khalifa University, with Khalifa Fund to have this innovation hub. At Thales, we are going to collaborate with them to work on a design center in the spirit of what we have at the Thales University in France, near Paris. That is the kind of diversification we are driving. It is great to put your name on incubators, but the main point for us is to be in a position to identify the SMEs and start-ups we can cooperate with.</p><h4>Incubating SMEs is part of the Thales portfolio. Do you engage these SMEs as start-ups or offer support and services to growing companies?</h4><p>As a French operator, Thales has always supported French SMEs. That is part of our DNA and, if we can bring SMEs into our export business, that is also one of our priorities. Of course if you want to be a local operator in other countries it is your duty to work on developing some local SMEs. This makes sense from a technology and financial point of view and is actually what we are aiming at. We have a lot of local applications, for example media content for in-flight entertainment activities, radio communications devices for both civil and military purposes, and flight-testing innovations. Of course, we are not investing in just any kinds of SMEs; that is not the point. This is why we wanted to be present with the Khalifa Fund to identify innovation in the early stages.</p><h4>Is recruitment of young talent an issue for Thales in the UAE?</h4><p>We signed an MoU with Khalifa University about six years ago to investigate how we can encourage diversification and attract graduates coming out of university into our local companies for training and internships. One of the issues we have when it comes to recruiting people is that we are at the end of the value chain. Young UAE graduates go to the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) first or to one of the ADNOC-operated companies. After that they might be willing to go to the international operating companies such as Total, followed by local companies, and then companies like Thales. We are very low on their list. This is why if we want to operate on a more local basis we have to find a way to attract and hire young UAE nationals at our companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the business model that you have championed here at ADSB?</h4><p>In line with Abu Dhabi Vision 2030, we are focusing on enhancing the capabilities of the maritime industry in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). As a company we have focused on growing and enhancing our capabilities. When we were first formed, we focused on supporting the repairs and refits of UAE Navy vessels. Now, we have a portfolio, both military and commercial, of construction and retrofit projects, also offering extensive through life support programs for these ships. The successful Baynunah Corvette Program to build six ships for the UAE Navy was the stepping stone for ADSB to prove its capabilities in building highly sophisticated ships, after which we won several contracts to build more than 100 vessels ranging from large gun boats to small MRTPs. The project life cycle of building new ships is much longer than ship repair projects (services), which means it takes a longer time to generate revenue. We have focused on not only growing our capability but diversifying our offering to execute ship repair projects, on both commercial and naval ships, that will help diversify the revenue base and add financial sustainability to the business. Another element of our diversification strategy was the decision to expand our capacity to drydock larger vessels. Our current facility at Mussafah can only accommodate ships up to 80m in length, which means that ship repair for larger ships could not be facilitated. We therefore invested in a new floating dock that can drydock ships up to 180m in length. This new facility will commence operation at Mina Zayed during the third quarter of 2016.</p><h4>Where do these combined services and shipbuilding place the company within the GCC and MENA region?</h4><p>When we talk about shipbuilding, specifically military shipbuilding, ADSB is the leader in the MENA region; no other shipyard has the capabilities of ours. We have an experienced team supported by a state-of-art-facility to build a range of sophisticated ships. We have consistently maintained this core strength while also enhancing our ship repair capabilities as seen by the new facility in Mina Zayed to cater to larger ships. We have also set up an international agent's network to market the services of this new facility in an effort to attract a new network of overseas clients.</p><h4>What challenges are present for the company, and how are those obstacles being managed?</h4><p>The shipyard industry is dynamic and we are constantly looking at ways to build upon our current capabilities. When we look at current challenges, some might be regional competition, maintaining a skilled workforce and the larger impact of the global economy. The ADSB senior management team has formulated a set of effective strategies, which will be implemented over the next five years, to ensure that we effectively address any challenges and continue to be a leading shipyard in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>GAL operates under the EDIC umbrella. What opportunities does that provide?</h4><p>With so many companies providing defense services and products, there is enviably some confusion about the roles and responsibilities of the various entities. The formation of EDIC was meant to simplify and streamline the defense market with the ultimate aim of creating best-value solutions at the lowest possible cost to our customers. For the time being, GAL's primary focus will continue to be aviation and weapons system maintenance for the UAE Armed Forces, along with advanced technical training and creating employment opportunities for Emiratis. We have not fully transferred to EDIC, but we are in the process of doing so. This will increase the synergies because we have 16 companies now and in the next phase we will add several more. There are a few companies that can either work together or be merged due to the same service level that they provide. In the future, these services will be streamlined to avoid duplications in some areas.</p><h4>GAL is the primary company developing aviation and weapons systems maintenance for the UAE Armed Forces. How can you grow the company within that exclusive mandate?</h4><p>For the last nine years, we have been providing first- and second-line maintenance for the aviation sector in the UAE, mainly for the armed forces. Our vision is to go deeper into this and right now we are in discussion with customers in regard to performance-based logistics. This concept will be responsible for maintaining all the fleets from A to Z, providing manpower, doing maintenance service, managing repairs, and logistics—a complete package. We are holding the same discussion with the air force and air defense to enhance the operation of their central workshops. Even under the umbrella of EDIC, the defense market is competitive so we must build a legacy that will continue to be relevant and financially viable to support the UAE for many years to come.</p><h4>The UAE is prominent within the air defense sector in the GCC, and spending is high. Are you considering an extension of your services to other defense forces in the region?</h4><p>Over the last five years we have grown dramatically: there were 700 of us then, and now we are over 3,000. Since the establishment of GAL, the focus has been on supporting the UAE and, while we have been looking at regional opportunities, such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, we do not want to lose this focus. We have created a model that works well here in the UAE and we can use that model to the benefit of other countries in the region. We have also been approached by some OEMs that are interested in discussing projects in neighboring countries: they want a local company to go with them and work on their behalf, to reduce their costs. The plan is there, but we need the right time to execute it.</p><h4>It is impressive that you have achieved such a high level of Emiratization and highly trained staff. How have you gone about this element of the business?</h4><p>The UAE has a lack of local workers, but we are trying to attract a new generation by offering scholarship programs and working with customers to train people on their behalf. On the administration side we have a high percentage of Emiratization; however, on the technical side we are only about 25% local. Three years ago we were invited to a big conference in Bahrain of GCC Labor ministers, where we were presented with an award for localization. We are quite proud of that and we are trying to hire more Emiratis. Our pay scale is slightly higher than other companies, which gives us an advantage, especially when it comes to hiring locals. A recent development has been the new National Service Program and, through this program, we are finding many young people with no previous exposure to the military who would not have considered a career in the defense sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE is import-reliant when it comes to fresh produce. What is being done by the ADFCA to help redress that balance and develop the agriculture sector here?</h4><p>Agriculture represents an important pillar in day-to-day business, not only for locals but for all the residents of Abu Dhabi. We have a limitation in our natural resources especially when it comes to water, fertile land, and agricultural inputs in general. The ADFCA strategy is to guide, direct, and utilize all these resources and convert the effort our farmers put into their farms into something valuable for our clients and customers. We manage and oversee a group of farms in Abu Dhabi, and we have created a strategy to utilize the limited resources we have and produce a high quality product. In the case of vegetables, the crop rotation is fast and we have favorable weather for vegetable production from late September-October to the end of May. Water transpiration is low and the temperatures are reasonable for most vegetable types; therefore, we have a comparative advantage in this regard. Under these conditions, we can produce crops outdoors rather than in greenhouses. </p><h4>What role does agriculture play in safeguarding Abu Dhabi's economic and wider security?</h4><p>Agriculture represents an important area of food security. There have been environmental changes taking place in the region. We used to import vegetables from Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey; however, with the current situation on the ground we need to provide for ourselves locally. We look at the agriculture to provide this food security as an important part of our national security. This is why with the great infrastructure we have in Abu Dhabi, we are encouraging the private sector to work in the processing and manufacturing of agricultural commodities. For example, at Kizad we have the Sadia factory now, which is one of the largest in the region, and its production is for both the UAE and the region. The importance for us is that we now represent an essential part of the whole supply chain. Another private company is working on a rice mill even though Abu Dhabi is not a rice producing country. By having a factory producing 100,000 tons of rice per year, we are contributing to food security by being part of that supply chain. It is good for these international companies too because they want to operate in an easy environment. Licensing, the cost of energy, and labor and technical assistance are competitive in Abu Dhabi. Both agricultural investors and traders look at this as an important advantage.</p><h4>Looking at the UAE's water shortage, what is ADFCA working on to help preserve this resource? </h4><p>In agriculture, we depend mainly on groundwater and its demand is high due to the expansion of agriculture. As part of our current strategy we are trying to utilize the amount of water we have and to calculate the optimum plant requirements. In close cooperation with the Farmers' Services Centre, we are working hard to disseminate this technical information to the farming community. Using exactly the right amount of water for each plant will guarantee sustainability in the future. At the same time, we are looking for different sources of water. For the last two years, in cooperation with the Environment Agency of Abu Dhabi (EAD), we have been experimenting using treated sewage water for growing certain crops, mainly fodder and some dates. We have had a technical report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) saying that the quality of treated sewage water meets the international standard and can be used with no restrictions for agricultural purpose. This will encourage us to expand the use of treated sewage water in some areas, for example, for forestry and landscape purposes. It will cut down the pressure on our groundwater and create a new source of irrigation water. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The company has had its four subsidiaries for a long time. Are there plans in the pipeline to diversify the portfolio or are you working toward consolidation?</h4><p>We are always on the look out for innovation, but it has usually been within one of our divisions. For example, there is a new type of tissue paper machine that produces to specification, which makes it easier for buyers to make a profit. We are one of three plants across the world that produces this product. So far it has only been available in Chile and Mexico. We anticipate considerable interest from European converters who are interested in the new specifications. In terms of carpets, we have also diversified and increased our capacity to make new lines and introduce new concepts. We are the only company in the UAE that produces carpets using a machine called Ax Minster. This is mainly used to serve hotels and we are the only company in the region doing this. The other one, the medical line, uses auto-disable syringes, and this is a patent that belongs to the Abu Dhabi Medical Devices Company.</p><h4>These products are unique in the region. What kind of market access does that grant you?</h4><p>For the medical devices company, we are only selling abroad, and our share in the local market is minimal. We have a line in normal syringes, which we sell here, but our main line is the auto-disable syringes and they are not used here. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set a target for these to be used everywhere by 2020. The majority of our sales are to UNICEF and to the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), and they are mainly for sale in Africa, South America, and Asia. Regarding the tissue line, our main markets are in the GCC, plus some African and Middle Eastern countries. The new line of tissue has interested European markets, and we have started expanding there. One of the major objectives of acquiring this machine was to open new markets. We know that some European and American companies are thinking of investing in this, but for the time being we can capitalize on our uniqueness.</p><h4>Established in 1997, the group has seen various cycles of the economy. Today the economy is at the bottom of the cycle. How is the company strategizing for this?</h4><p>The company started with tissue manufacturing and just one machine. In September 2015 we launched a third line, and our output has gone from zero in 2001 to 95,000 tons. We are now the second-biggest producer in the GCC. In our other major business line, carpets, we started with a low output and have grown to between 10,000 and 11,000 tons a year, and there is still room for growth. The third area is vaccination syringes, for which we have a patent for auto-disable syringes. We are one of the major suppliers to UNICEF for this product internationally. The company has faced some difficult times in the past, but today I am confident that we can manage. I am optimistic about our operations. We are exceeding our expectations, and I anticipate a good year. This year, we will have a new plant for the carpet division, and we are thinking about new lines in this area. We are also expecting expansion of our medical devices or other new acquisitions. With the upcoming Expo, and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, there are many opportunities in real estate and hospitality. We attended conferences with the government on post-oil strategies, and these will work well. The country is set for growth. We have a good reputation for quality, and our costs are not that high. We can always be competitive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Today's steel market provides a challenge for many companies. How has Emirates Steel maintained its position in this environment?</h4><p>The current steel market conditions are challenging and it is affecting the local and global steel sector due to the global overcapacity levels and flow of low-quality, cheap steel imports into the markets, specifically the MENA region. The major source of these imported materials is China. Emirates Steel has been working toward surpassing the challenging conditions by moving away from spot business transactions to more mature business models and responsible partnerships. The gradual growth in demand for sustainable steel products is almost guaranteed with all the current and planned projects in the country. In 2016, steel consumption is expected to grow to 3.1% in the MENA region, after stagnating at 72.1Mt in 2015 according to the World Steel Association. Emirates Steel expects an improvement in the market conditions and increased demand for steel after the stabilization of the region's construction sector with confirmed multibillion-dollar value infrastructure projects. The spending on construction and infrastructure projects by both the private and public sectors has maintained the country's steel demand. On the supply side, the UAE today has 4.65Mt of rebar capacity, installed 1.25Mt of section capacity, and 0.84Mt of wire rod capacity. Emirates Steel has sustained its position in the UAE domestic market through its approach in developing long term supply contracts to meet the market needs on time, with focus on customer service. Emirates Steel domestic market share currently stands at approximately 52%, while it continues expanding its export business, particularly for higher-value added products. The company reported sales of 1.82Mt of finished steel products in 1H2016 compared to 1.56Mt for the same period of 2015.</p><h4>What role does the steel industry plays within the diversification of the UAE's economy</h4><p>The steel industry is the backbone of any modern economy; it is an essential element for any industrialization and urbanization efforts, and is considered one of the indicators for healthy economy. In the UAE, the steel industry plays a crucial role in the country's development plans. Investing in heavy industries is essential for catalyzing and facilitating the development of smaller downstream industry segments and to fulfil the government's ambitions to develop a healthy industrial sector as outlined by the comprehensive economic plan known as Abu Dhabi 2030. Implementing this strategic vision of national importance will contribute to the country's progress, the development of industrial infrastructure, an increase in revenue sources of non-oil commodities, and the creation of additional employment opportunities within the industrial and associated services sectors. Emirates Steel's medium- and long-term plan is to support this national initiative and create further opportunities for downstream manufacturing industries.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2016?</h4><p>Emirates Steel is the largest integrated steelmaker in the UAE. The company ranks as the 77th worldwide in terms of production capacity. Currently, Emirates Steel is implementing an ambitious strategic business development plan to increase its production capacity and diversify its product range. Emirates Steel commenced a major modernization and phased expansion program with a capital investment of approximately AED11 billion in its phase I and phase II, which resulted in a huge boost in capacity and production. In August 2010, the company finalized its long-term financing and secured in excess of $2 billion to finance its expansion plans and working capital needs from local, regional, and international banks, reflecting a real vote of confidence in its business. Phase I transformed the company from a simple steel re-roller to the first fully integrated steel manufacturer in the UAE and significantly increased the company's rolling capacity to around 2 million MTPA. The construction and installation of the Phase I expansion program was completed in June 2009. The Phase II expansion project involved the construction of a heavy and jumbo sections rolling mill, and resulted in increasing the output capacity to nearly 3.5 million MTPA, positioning Emirates Steel as a major producer of jumbo and heavy sections in the Middle East. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the company trying to anticipate market cycles in the steel and construction materials sectors?</h4><p>Senaat is a long-term investor, able to withstand cyclical downturns. We attempt to mitigate cyclical risk using a number of different tactics. For example, we minimize our focus on commodities, although we do have exposure to a select number of commodities due to operational and production requirements. We also pay special attention to niche products that differentiate our offering and allow us to charge a premium. Senaat also maintains extensive connections and networks across the public and private sectors to ensure that we are consistently involved in key projects and in a good position to anticipate market downturns and take the necessary precautions. In addition, Senaat's active advocacy for local content protection policies will allow local companies in the metals and minerals sectors to flourish. These companies have invested in the UAE and play an important role in achieving a larger economic vision. Accordingly, our policies must reflect this and help create a positive economic environment for aspiring industrial ventures.</p><h4>How do you assess the importance to Senaat of building up synergy between companies and being closer to markets and feedstocks?</h4><p>Senaat is committed to developing a portfolio of leading industrial companies that will contribute to the diversification of the Abu Dhabi economy. In recent years, we have added two companies to our expanding portfolio and we continue to seek dynamic companies, which need strategic and funding support locally, regionally, and overseas. Abu Dhabi's economic growth and development is built on leveraging unique collaboration opportunities between significant government entities and the growing private sector. Stretching over an extraordinary 417sqkm, Kizad's vertically integrated clusters provide Senaat and relevant portfolio companies with the physical space to grow. As one the world's foremost industrial zones, Kizad also offers Senaat strength of scale, advisory service, and strong levels of efficiency, profitability, and ease of doing business. TALEX and DAC were created to build on the strategic investments in the aluminum industry at Kizad. Both entities benefit from the modern infrastructure, proximity to EMAL, and access to seaport facilities. These features allow both companies to adequately address global market demand for innovative high-value products. Al Gharbia, on the other hand, will be strategically placed within a market that consumes Al Gharbia's products, greatly simplifying the logistics process. As a leading industrial company in Abu Dhabi and the UAE, it is important for Senaat to maintain a strong presence in the local market. Proximity to feedstocks and consumers and the seamless integration offered by Kizad will support us in achieving these objectives.</p><h4>How important is it to Senaat to ramp up operations in the agricultural sector of your business to full capacity?</h4><p>To reiterate, Senaat's business strategy centers around the creation of companies that can add unique value to the country's industrial development efforts and economic expansion. Subsequently, we take great pride in our holistic approach to agricultural and F&amp;B investments. Most importantly, we understand that while commercial aspects are of tremendous significance, the importance of food security in the UAE is never overlooked when making decisions that relate to agricultural investments. Therefore, when making any investment, Senaat carefully assesses available investment criteria, and expands into industries that can support our existing portfolio with strategic advice, commercial acumen, and financing. Our F&amp;B investments comprise two companies, Agthia and Al Foah. The latter is a global leader in the date palm tree sector with a capacity of more than 113,000 tons of dates processed and packed annually and exported to 48 countries. Al Foah is well structured and operates with a diverse product range. Agthia produces a wide range of products including bottled drinking water, tomato paste, dairy, as well as animal products. In both companies, we are always trying to introduce new and different products, and we monitor the results. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the company investing in R&amp;D to enhance business opportunities?</h4><p>Innovation is the foundation of our offering to the hydrocarbon industry and is part of Linde DNA. Our business model can basically be referred to as Technology-EPC. We possess a variety of in-house and patented technologies. The story of innovation at Linde is coupled with the work of its founder, Mr. Von Linde, who was basically the inventor of refrigeration technology, which is the cornerstone of today's industrial refrigeration and also cryogenic air separation. Hundreds of engineers in our R&amp;D facilities are following his and also their dreams by innovating solutions for the challenges of tomorrow. Linde also takes great pride in being very active in jointly developing technologies and solutions with our customers. Linde's broad portfolio spans across different parts of the industry, from natural gas in upstream and LNG in midstream all the way to downstream petrochemical businesses. Linde group also addresses some of the new frontiers such as hydrogen based solutions in zero-emission mobility or enabling energized fracking with CO2-based solutions. The other dimension of the innovation is to make the existing processes and solutions safer and more efficient and economic. This is where we try to squeeze the last drops of hydrocarbon out of the process and into the bottom line and also enhance the reliability of the operations throughout their life cycle.</p><h4>What do you feel is unique about Abu Dhabi and what does it have  to offer to make it a focal point for the region?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is our regional headquarters for Linde Engineering across MENA. On the business side, the transparency, advanced infrastructure and logistics, ease of setting up and doing business, and availability of skilled resources are unique attributes, while on the social front the security, safety, and quality of life that the Emirate offers have made it a very convenient location for several operations and businesses to establish, operate, and expand and for all of us to call it home. We also have operations and companies in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and some of the other countries in the region. This is part of a business philosophy we follow and that is to ensure proximity to our customers and partners and also to be a part of the local communities in which we operate so that we can deliver on our commitments there too.</p><h4>How do you feel the industry is reacting to the record-low oil prices?</h4><p>Looking at this super cycle that has hit the hydrocarbon industry, you might notice that it is different from the one in the late 1990s or the financial crisis in 2008. This cycle is simply the challenge of fundamentals, sparked by the competition between conventional and unconventional producers. Flooding the markets with product in the quest for a higher market share, this rally stretched the boundaries of supply while the demand took a different turn with a slower China and a more resilient US shale industry that could sustain the price pressure far more than market expectations. Thereafter, it was only a matter of time to add logistics and storage capacity challenges to the overall picture and a very steep and persistent price decline. As all of this unfolded at a different speed and magnitude to what the industry could usually withstand, the initial reaction was a drastic CAPEX cut, hibernation, and as the price descended even further the feasibility hurdle began to knock off some more projects around the globe. However, like any turbulence, the initial shockwaves are almost gone and players started to adjust, optimize their cost and in the wake of a slower growth, rationalize their capacity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Total's involvement in the growing solar energy sector here in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Total is a partner in Shams, the solar power plant operating in the UAE. We also have a partnership with Masdar with an office in Masdar City that covers both solar energy as well as research subjects. SunPower is our solar affiliate and is active both in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. We want to expand our business here. I even have solar installed in my own home—this is not just a business for us, it is a belief. We are genuinely committed to better energy. There are two kinds of solar power projects: small household solar projects and major solar plants. SunPower produces the photovoltaic (PV) cells that are used in these large solar plants, and SunPower is the leader of that technology in the industry. It is efficient; more efficient than any competing technologies, and they last far longer. That also means they are more expensive than some of the competing technologies, and so households tend not to opt for these since they think more in terms of short-term costs. However, when it comes to solar power plants, people make long-term strategies and in that sense PV cell technology is ideal. We are also trying to work with Masdar outside of the UAE, looking at projects in other countries in the area.</p><h4>The energy sector here is such that business must go through the government owned companies. How do you think that facilitates and impacts trade here?</h4><p>The setup in the UAE is unique in comparison to other countries that I have worked in. They still have concessions in the UAE, whereas in most countries we are talking about production sharing agreements. There are two objectives for the UAE here, one is to maximize the reserves that they produce from the fields. In order to achieve that, they need to reach a win-win relationship with the IOCs in order to be able to use their technological know-how to meet their goals. This is why they set up these concessions rather than opt for production-sharing agreements, because in a concession you are more of a partner than a service contract like in production sharing agreements. In January, we won the tender for the ADCO concession, which will last 40 years starting in 2015. The new concession agreement is designed to ensure that there is maximum cooperation and involvement of the IOC, and cooperation between the IOC and the operating company, ADCO. People are very clever here, because we have managed to find a way to attract the IOCs while at the same time making sure that it is a mutually beneficial situation. To give you more detail, ADCO is divided into several assets of Bu Hasa, the Southeast, which is Asab, Sahil, Shabab, and North East Bab. In addition to being awarded 10% of the ADCO concession, we were nominated asset leader in Bu Hasa and the Southeast. Being asset leader requires more involvement on our part in these particular fields, so this is a significant project for us.</p><h4>What will you be bringing to your projects as asset leader?</h4><p>We are currently placing our people within the ADCO system, thereby connecting ADCO to the Total system. We will install a technical hub in ADCO, which will give ADCO access to all of Total's programs, expertise, and know-how. Therefore, ADCO will be able to use Total the same way any affiliate can. That means we are not separated anymore. We are not going to board meetings at ADCO to discuss things; we are directly integrated with access to each others' systems worldwide. It will not just have access to our system in the UAE, but to anything we do worldwide. It is a new type of agreement, a new system, and I believe it will be a major milestone in the relationship between IOCs and OCs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>OPEC will raise the ceiling of production. How does this affect Schlumberger?</h4><p>From a UAE perspective, the market will be challenging in 2016. We do not see any significant delay of major projects starting. Projects yet to start may be delayed; however, ones that have already begun should continue as planned. Definitely, there is pressure from our customers to deliver on our central goal of reducing costs, and we are working with them on this. We have been running a transformation program at Schlumberger since 2008. We believe that as part of our partnership with our customers we are able to pass on some savings gained through our various initiatives without compromising HSE or service quality. It is at a time like this that we should introduce new technology. New technology might be more expensive than conventional means but it is effective if we manage to demonstrate the efficiency gains and value-added to our client. Instead of having a full crew, we have a remote operation to reduce the crew and use various communication methods to transfer the data to our offices, where senior employees can monitor operations. This provides savings that we can share with our customers. By combining some services that we were providing to a customer, we reduce the time for a logging operation by 30%. It was a combination of new technologies and looking at the way we ran the operation. We combined a couple of runs and saved a lot on rig time.</p><h4>Schlumberger remains one of the world's most preferred employers. What is your HR strategy?</h4><p>The good thing about Schlumberger is that we do not stop recruiting, as it is important that we keep investing for the future. We have started a transformation program, part of which entails the remote operations, while another part involves multi-skilled workers. We train our employees to be multi skilled without diluting the specialty of the individuals, which is good for our people because they get more opportunities to develop their skills. This provides us with agility and flexibility, and that definitely helps our costs. We address equipment utilization as well. We look at how we can derive more utilization from the tools we have. We may slow down our recruiting number, but we do not stop. In Abu Dhabi we have the Middle East Learning Center, which is a learning center for people coming from all over the world. On any given day, it can accommodate up to 650 students, making it the second-largest training center we have in the world, and number one in terms of the diversity of training. We can cover most of Schlumberger's segments at this training center. We thank ADNOC for donating this land to us. It opened in March 2007. It is a landmark demonstrating the partnership that we developed with ADNOC through the years.</p><h4>How are you supporting the national energy infrastructure?</h4><p>Our overall objective is to reduce our customers' cost per barrel. We work to get involved much earlier in our customers' projects because then we can look at the way they are executed; the early phases of planning are where we can have the greatest impact on how it is delivered. Part of the needed mindset change is to get involved earlier so that we can work together in the planning phase with our customer and look at how we can execute projects much more efficiently. We have been asked by executives and ministers to work closely with our customers in developing alternative solutions and services earlier, which might even change the status quo of planning. The market for oil and gas is evolving and the challenges that the industry is facing are helping us and our clients to think outside the box and change mindsets. Trust is important as well, and we need to be open. Despite the current challenges, this is an exciting time for the industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the reasons for pioneering the independent power and water producers (IWPP) model in the UAE?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is the pioneer in the region to promote IWPP and other reforms in the water and electricity sector. We view IWPP as a commercial business in which everyone participates in tendering exercises and the one with the best price will be awarded the unit. It is good for business to have certain activities managed commercially, such that people are more conscious of the cost and management, the rationalization, and cost reduction in order to maximize profit. This has resulted in low-cost electricity generation and water production and timely completion of the production plant. The model has been successful in attracting private investment and expertise in the electricity and water sectors and in meeting power and water demands in a timely and efficient manner.</p><h4>Who will be the main beneficiary of new prices amidst the price war among generation companies?</h4><p>Competition, falling costs, and other factors have resulted in significantly lower generation prices from photovoltaic (PV) solar projects. The electricity price achieved for the third phase of Dubai solar project is indeed commendable. Such prices are more favorable than conventional methods, particularly gas-based, generation. More importantly, this diversity increases security for the customers at affordable prices. Any cost saving will be reflected in the unit cost that will be passed on to the customer. Right now, many customers—commercial, industrial, or residential—have different government subsidies, so whatever is gained will be passed onto the customer or the government itself. Where customers already pay full cost tariffs, the gain will be passed on to them. There is an annual price increase of about 5%, which is unlike three or four years ago, when the annual increase was much higher. The planning function within the Emirate has evolved significantly in recent years with more sophisticated energy.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on desalination, and how can the technology be improved?</h4><p>Traditionally, gas-fired power plants have been the mainstay of UAE generation, which was coupled with the traditional thermal desalination process. Desalination in all its forms is an expensive process with energy-intensive needs. However, we are able to reduce the energy required through the use of reverse osmosis together with energy recovery systems. The new Mirfa plant and two plants at Fujairah are applying this system, which provides efficiency advantages over standalone thermal desalination facilities. In addition, we are closely monitoring the Masdar pilot research project to identify emerging technologies with the potential to scale up accordingly in the future. The UAE and Abu Dhabi are committed to improving the security of supply through diversifying the overall energy mix within the country. There is now a significant focus on leveraging favorable market conditions for PV solar technology. Given the large swings of power demand between summer and winter and relatively flatter demand for water throughout the year, we have been planning and working to decouple water production from electricity generation. Reverse osmosis rather than conventional desalination will likely emerge as a more suitable technology.</p><h4>How are tariffs creating another steady and secure revenue source for the government?</h4><p>There was one increase in electricity and water tariffs on January 1, 2015 for all customer categories. We should also note that all government organizations now pay full-cost reflective tariffs as a result of the 2015 tariff reforms. The other customer category paying the cost-reflective tariffs is expat residential customers with high consumption. These tariff reforms are an effective way to encourage our customers to value energy sources and manage their consumption more wisely. To date the government has subsidized water and electricity, but the plan is to reform this subsidy regime over time. This is in line with our green and red campaign a few years ago, where the purpose was to give targets for customers to stay in the green and avoid the red as much as possible. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Takreer wants to be recognized as a trendsetter in creating sustainable value growth through innovative energy solutions. How are you bringing your energy solutions to market?</h4><p>Takreer aims to be the best in the refining industry and capitalize on the opportunities we have here in Abu Dhabi. Our opportunities lie in our large industrial base upstream. We have a good supply and there are other downstream industries we can integrate with by providing the necessary feedstock or other additives. We not only want to be a provider of transportation fuel, but also to maximize the benefits to the country by integrating with local industries and diversifying our production.</p><h4>How do the fuels that you produce—naphtha, kerosene, gasoline, and diesel—reflect the market needs here?</h4><p>We have typically produced transportation fuels and other products that we export. However, we are trying to move away from our typical production and maximize the benefit of each barrel. With the new expansion and our heavy oil conversion project called the carbon black and delayed coker project (CBDC), we will move toward diversifying our production. In Abu Dhabi, there are growing numbers of environmental regulations and all transportation fuels have to meet Euro 5 specifications. We managed to achieve that and were in fact ready earlier than required with the completion of our Green Diesel Project in 2012. With our CBDC project, we will also be able to convert heavy oil into more valuable products. This is again part of our diversification process and the provision of feedstock to local industries around us.</p><h4>How does Takreer's largest site, the Ruwais Refinery, connect to large projects and other companies in terms of integration and facilitating business?</h4><p>We recognize that this industry is a margin-driven industry. Refineries are under pressure, as their margins are not nearly as good as those in the upstream businesses. There are three main factors that will enable us to boost our margins and make us more economically robust. One factor is scale, as this allows us to distribute our costs more effectively in terms of dollars per barrel. Complexity is another important factor. You need to have deep conversion of the crude oil to extract lighter and more viable products. The third factor is integration. If your refinery has a nearby petrochemical industry, this will save capital expenditure and operating costs for both industries. Of course, you also need to expand to cover the local market's requirements in terms of transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstock. When we were looking at our expansion we had these three elements in mind to ensure that we would in fact be in a stronger economic position afterwards. With the new refinery, we managed to achieve all these elements. In terms of scale, we have doubled our capacity by moving from 500,000bpd to more than 900,000bpd. The Nelson Complexity Index (NCI) measures refinery complexity, and after our expansion we will reach a complexity factor of more than 14, which covers highly complex facilities. The higher you are on the scale the better your margins are.</p><h4>How does this relate to the wider economy and the mandate to make Abu Dhabi self-sufficient in gasoline?</h4><p>Importing refined products is not particularly wise, especially when you produce crude oil. It does not make sense to import a product when you can make it here with your own facilities and people and add to GDP. This new refinery will be self-sufficient in gasoline. We do not import jet fuel or diesel as we were already self sufficient in these products. With the new refinery our exports will increase. When you build a new refinery you do it with the next 30 years in mind, not for the short term. Exports will shrink with growth, which is normal. However, with the gasoline we have only designed the operations for the local market; we are not thinking of exporting gasoline. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Etisalat recently offered shares to foreign investors that were well received by the market. How will this and similar offerings develop the ADX?</h4><p>Etisalat is a multinational company that is highly sought after by both local and international investors. However, its Articles of Association did not allow for foreign ownership. As such, we worked with the management of Etisalat to illustrate the added value and benefits of foreign investment in the company, be it shareholding, management, or even ownership. Based on the correlation between foreign ownership and turnover, Etisalat can expect higher turnover, and even possibly blue chip status, through opening up the company to institutional investors. That in turn will have a positive impact on the market, which we have started seeing. We hope other companies will follow Etisalat's example. One of our strategies is to increase liquidity, which is certainly a step in the right direction, not just for Etisalat and ADX, but also for companies not listed on ADX.</p><h4>How resilient has the ADX been to external factors such as the devaluation of the yuan and chronically low oil prices?</h4><p>We are part of the international financial community and are affected by what goes on in other parts of the globe, positive or negative. When things go bad, we are impacted, unlike before when we sealed ourselves off from the global market. Today, the ADX is part of the MSCI and the S&amp;P Dow Jones emerging market index. The UAE works hard to diversify away from oil, although it remains important to our country and the economy. In real terms, non-oil activities accounted for 50.2% of Abu Dhabi's GDP at constant prices in 2014. Real estate activity also accounted for 20.7% of gross fixed capital formation in 2014, with the sector having grown by more than 22% during the year. The financial and insurance sector was second, with growth last year of nearly 20%. Diversification is an important issue for our country, and there are many serious strategic investments in renewable energy sources in the UAE, including, nuclear, wind, and solar.</p><h4>How will the Fed's impending rate hike affect the ADX?</h4><p>Whenever interest rates go up, it attracts investment away from other channels and into the interest rate channel. Therefore, we can base a strategy on that to tackle this problem whenever it arises. This is a cycle, so you have to be prepared for it. Our preparations are to diversify our financial instruments. We do not only have equity available on our market and we have also been concentrating on our bond and sukuk markets and instruments, and need to make more ETFs, warrants, and right issues readily available. It is up to us to give choices to investors. When interest rates go up, these instruments will make more sense to investors than equities. Perhaps in the future we will go into other instruments. When interest rates go up, part of that extra interest-generated money goes to banks, but a major portion also goes to bonds and sukuks. If we have them available on our platform, we would continue having liquidity available under the roof of the stock markets.</p><h4>How does the ADX fit in with the government's Vision 2030 goals?</h4><p>The ADX is one of the newest exchanges in the Middle East. From day one, we concentrated on quality and the performance of our stock market and wanted to be the exchange of choice in the region. I can say we have achieved that goal. When other exchanges want to develop something new, they come to us. We have passed the stage of being part of the MSCI as an emerging market. We want to be part of the developed market as part of the Abu Dhabi Government Vision 2030. That is not easy. It requires changing investor attitudes, setting up infrastructure, and changes to the legal framework. We have developed a clear strategy to develop those three elements, which can be defined as behavior, structure, and law. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has ADS developed since it was established?</h4><p>We built our company from scratch and grew it in parallel to Abu Dhabi's growth. In fact, Abu Dhabi was one of the reasons for our growth, enabling us to build a financial institution upon the solid foundations that Abu Dhabi provides. Abu Dhabi has created a fertile environment from which ADS Securities was able to develop one of the world's largest independent brokerages and then expand our services into capital markets, wealth management, asset management, and investment banking. In a short time we have created a fully fledged financial services institution though we remain selective about who we work with. It is not about how many people we work with; it is about who we work with and what we can deliver to them.</p><h4>What was your growth and diversification strategy away from forex brokerage?</h4><p>The backbone of ADS Securities is our trading ability and our knowledge of the business flows across markets. We had always planned to build the brokerage side of our work, which gives us the insight and feel for trading. This has flourished both internationally and locally. Last year was a good year for us. We survived a strong move on the Swiss National Bank (SNB); we quadrupled our client base, all organically grown, to reach tens of thousands starting from zero. We opened up in Asia working with many sophisticated and professional clients, and we have increased our product offerings. As we developed this area of work, we were also putting together the right people and products to provide a range of high-quality financial services products. Our growth is linked to Abu Dhabi's growth and we are integrated fully into the country's potential and prospects. As the number of major international firms, banks, and people coming to Abu Dhabi increases, so does our business.</p><h4>To what extent is your growth due to the effort and finances you have put into your own technology?</h4><p>In 2014 we launched the first multi-asset trading platform designed and built in this region. This now trades billions of dollars daily. In 2015 we launched a mobile trading app and it is generating fantastic reviews, so technology will always be a driver for growth. But as an institution ADS is not just about making money. It is about achieving something that was never possible before. Abu Dhabi was always focused on the buying side, and now we are focused on the selling aspect of business. People used to come and land in Abu Dhabi with a briefcase and take money away. However, now people come here to give us money for us to manage. To make this work you have to have people with a high level of motivation. The brand of the country is high, and the Abu Dhabi name is strong and is a proven financial platform. Hence, the overall organic growth comes from technology, the people, and the regulations. Keep in mind that we rose and succeeded during a period of economic crisis when you saw currency wars and central banks all still in the middle of their quantitative easing, not to mention all the political turmoil that has been taking place and is still ongoing. </p><h4>Can you describe the success of the $700 million debut bond for Etihad Airways?</h4><p>Etihad has a very successful business model, but the airline business is a tough environment. Etihad acted quickly and wisely to raise additional funds so that it can invest money in areas that will make more and more sense in the coming years. It has a long-term strategy, and acted decisively and aggressively to set it in motion. The success of the bond in raising the money validates the Etihad strategy and approach. It was a clever move. We should also consider that the bond was raised in under 10 hours, and was extended to raise an additional $200 million, taking the full amount to $700 million. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were your key objectives when setting up the ADGM in the UAE?</h4><p>The ADGM was established to support Abu Dhabi's ambition to be an international financial center. Through foresight and prudent management, Abu Dhabi has created one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world and is internationally recognized as a wealth center. It is a natural progression to harness its strengths as a wealth center, with world-class infrastructure, political stability, and security, as well as a high quality of life, education, and healthcare to develop itself as an international financial center focusing on private banking, asset management, and wealth management. The objectives were mainly to develop a conducive ecosystem to support local institutions to grow to become regional and international champions and to attract international players to center their activities here to serve the fast-growing region. We engage our stakeholders closely to understand their needs to fulfill these two objectives and have created a full spectrum of investment and legal structures that support the needs of asset management companies, private banks, insurance companies, and family offices. In response to the high cost of capital post financial crisis, we worked closely with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and other stakeholders to develop an effective and efficient capital netting jurisdiction. To cater to the demand for a clear and genuine common law jurisdiction, we adopted common law in its entirety and that gives the industry legal certainty with a full body of up-to-date case law.</p><h4>How do you tailor international standards to the Abu Dhabi financial sector?</h4><p>We draw from the best practices of successful financial centers around the world and assure alignment with international standards. This allows institutions to operate in an environment that they are familiar with, minimizing compliance costs for global firms that conduct global compliance practice, and assuring a high level of confidence amongst stakeholders. We also work closely with our stakeholders to cater to local needs. The ADGM regulatory model stands on its own in the region. We are an integrated regulator across the banking, insurance, and capital market sectors. This allows us to have a more holistic view of risks. Given the increasing blurring between the different types of products, the ADGM framework allows us to better support our stakeholders in terms of their offerings. Second, the ADGM is responsible for providing a sound, progressive, and vibrant financial services center. The attractiveness of a financial center does not rest only with its legal and regulatory framework, but the broader ecosystem including ease of establishment, time to market, availability of talent, tax treaties, and so on. Together with stakeholders, we are developing an ecosystem that is conducive for financial intermediation and innovation to take place. We have a calibrated authorization framework that caters to both large institutions and boutique firms, based on the business risk and complexity that these players bring. It is not a one-size-fits-all criteria.</p><h4>How do you see the financial framework evolving as the sector develops and financial technology advances?</h4><p>It is a continuous process because international rules and regulations evolve as well. At the same time you have to ensure that you push ahead with your agenda to help local and international institutions. An advantage of the ADGM in this regard is that our board is able to enact new rules and regulations swiftly to respond to the needs of the marketplace. Among the key initiative of the ADGM is to support Abu Dhabi to become the financial technology innovation hub to support the GCC region. We have been in talks with potential partners in the US, Europe, China, and this region about developing the ecosystem to support the fintech industry. We recently issued a consultation paper that proposes that establishment of a regulatory laboratory, a first in the region, and which will provide a controlled environment for fintech players to develop, test, and launch their products and offerings subject to regulatory safeguards. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[thinking-globally]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the most challenging aspect of bringing in companies and registering them in a new financial free zone?</h4><p>Ensuring that the quality of foreign companies registered is in line with international best standards is at the core of our task. Today, our capital markets are more sophisticated, larger, faster, and more technologically driven than at any time in history. This rapid change requires a new regulator to have the ability to quickly identify risks, track emerging trends, and understand how new financial products and evolving market conditions impact both investors and the capital markets. Therefore, one of the greatest challenges we face is that of receiving high-quality information and data on prospective registrants to ensure that they will be able to fit into today's fast-changing environment. Enforcement and transparency issues are also key challenge areas that the SCA must always stay on top of. Another challenging aspect is ensuring that the enforcement division of a new regulator in a financial free zone uses tools that help staff determine whether an issuer's financial statements at disclosure time require further review or not. Another growing challenge is the globalization of securities regulation. Technological advances that have impacted the domestic securities markets have also significantly affected the global securities market and accelerated the movement of capital across international borders. These developments require that a new regulator think more globally and recognize that its registrants will increasingly be global players and that rules and regulations have to take account of this increased trend toward globalization.</p><h4>Fintech is a growing segment within the market. How might its development make operations evolve for the SCA?</h4><p>Fintech is a growing and crucial part of our world economy. Changes in technology are happening at such a fast pace that financial regulators have clearly seen the advantage of establishing special fintech committees whose job it is to ensure that the regulator stays abreast of all the latest technology developments. As innovation is an integral part of the UAE government's strategic goals, the SCA is working on developing its fintech capabilities, which will eventually be responsible for regulatory policies and development strategies to facilitate the use of technology and innovation to better manage risks, enhance efficiency, and strengthen competitiveness in the UAE's capital markets. For example, the SCA has been working toward finalizing a comprehensive set of regulations for the establishment of equity crowd funding platforms. Crowd funding will become one of the most important future means to tap the capital market, especially for the SME sectors in this part of the world. Since fintech companies are clearly entering the MENA region, it is imperative that regulators scan the horizon for cutting-edge technologies. Currently, the SCA is working toward catalyzing greater interest toward the development of emerging technology-driven innovations in financial services. We are considering working together with relevant fintech-related stakeholders including innovators, entrepreneurs, established businesses, investors, and other authorities to accelerate growth and innovation. Here at SCA, we provide a fertile and supportive regulatory environment for nurturing innovation in fintech such as block-chain technology, crowd-funding, high-frequency trading, and robo-advisory services and are constantly trying to balance advancements in technology in relation to investor protection.</p><h4>What does best practice mean for the UAE's capital markets?</h4><p>Over the years, we have had to craft our rules using the concept of best practice in order to develop legislation for margin trading, capital adequacy, custody, market making, securities borrowing and lending, short selling, warrant, mutual funds, investment management and trading, clearing, and settlement. As such, our efforts at best practice were rightly focused on addressing regulatory gaps, which had not been previously addressed. For example, best practice allowed us to remedy key settlement issues surrounding delivery-versus-payment issues as well as other rules related to the issuance of clearer transparency and disclosure requirements and a wide range of other regulatory requirements across the expanse of the UAE's capital markets, impacting equity, debt, boards of directors, conflicts of interest, investment regulations, and investment funds. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>It has been nine years since the creation of the economic vision, Vision 2030, and seven years since its implementation. How do you assess the progress so far, and what areas do you believe need more direct attention?</h4><p>The current trends of high oil price volatility since the end of 2014 has highlighted how wise and forward-thinking our government was in initiating and driving an ambitious diversification plan for Abu Dhabi's economy since 2008. During the last seven years, Abu Dhabi managed to achieve not only a solid but resilient growth despite a challenging environment that is still prevailing both globally and regionally. When the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 was designed, no government around the world would have predicted that the 2008 global financial crisis would occur and that global economic recovery would be that fragile, uncertain, and slow to materialize. In less than a decade, Vision 2030 has radically transformed the entire landscape of Abu Dhabi; the government has invested heavily in infrastructure and development projects in several sectors of the economy.</p><h4>How do you work with the public and private sectors to maximize the UAE's economic potential?</h4><p>The composition of ADCED's Board of Directors, with members from both the private and the public sector in addition to representatives from the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and business councils, reflects our commitment to work with most of the important stakeholders of the economy to achieve the Emirate's economic growth ambitions. Most of our economic studies and initiatives involve regular meetings with stakeholders from both the public and private sectors. Our main role is to identify the main challenges faced by the private sectors in Abu Dhabi and collectively find solutions to enhance the economic potential of the emirate. The core of any successful and sustainable economy is to develop a vibrant, dynamic, and competitive private sector.</p><h4>ADCED has a policy to encourage the growth of SMEs and provide a buffer to economic shocks. How has this plan worked out so far?</h4><p>Our main contribution is to facilitate the business environment and make sure that opportunities are available for the private sector to flourish in all sectors of the economy. SOEs have shown complete inclusive cooperative attitude toward local businesses. We are expecting the private sector to gradually benefit from the development of the SOEs in various sectors. Only a long-term plan and development strategy can guarantee the consistency and the sustainability of a sector's development over time that can benefit the private sector. If we take the case of the company Strata in Al Ain, its development strategy is based on a clear long-term vision of where the aircraft industry and airlines are headed on a global level over the next 10, or even 20, years. Hence, a long-term vision is crucial.</p><h4>How close are you to completely realizing your Vision 2030 objectives?</h4><p>When Vision 2030 was developed, the oil sector represented around 60% of Abu Dhabi's real GDP. It now accounts for around 50%. At the UAE Government Summit held in February 2015, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, when asked if  in 50 years we will be sad when the last drop of oil is shipped abroad, declared that “if we are investing today in the right sectors, I can tell you we will celebrate that moment." This powerful statement summarizes the Vision 2030. We are determined to invest our wealth in our people development and in diversifying the economy for a post-oil future. Both the Abu Dhabi economic vision 2030 and the UAE vision 2021 are pointing toward the same direction: diversifying our economy, empowering our people, improving our competitiveness and developing a knowledge-based economy encouraging both innovation and entrepreneurship. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Khalifa Fund capture and develop entrepreneurial spirit in the UAE?</h4><p>One of my first initiatives as CEO was the Startup Weekend, a global initiative by the Kauffman Foundation, with about 2,500 Startup Weekends worldwide. We hosted one in the first year, two in the second, and three in the third year. My target is at least five a year in different cities. At Startup Weekend, people from all over come and share their ideas, and they know there is a reward if their idea impresses the judges. Out of 50 ideas, you end up with five, and those five are usually the result of a collaborative effort. The winner wins a financial reward and mentorship from the judging panel. In the last few years, we have developed some capacity-building programs to empower young Emiratis to come up with ideas through Startup Weekend—we have what we call an Idea Sourcing Program for Emiratis. We go to universities and ask the faculties to inform students about the competition, telling them we will help them develop support, shape, and mold their ideas.</p><h4>Are there any products that the Khalifa Fund is working on directly?</h4><p>We are about to roll out a smart product through our website so entrepreneurs and the approximately 1,200 businesses we funded can have constant connectivity between the fund and businesses through out website interface and our app. You can click on any business that we have funded and can see all the details about it. We are also setting up a software app for entrepreneurs through which we can track their business lifestyle. We have all the reports, the site visits, the outstanding balances, and all activities captured in the system. It is a transparent system and this is crucial. Many entrepreneurs may be busy with full-time jobs and have a team running their business for them, so they need to be able see everything that is going on with their business. This system provides transparency and accountability all around. The app is static and not too interactive, but by the end of 2016 we want to have a more dynamic application for the entrepreneur, and we also want to link it with the banks such that if there are any updates with their accounts, they will be able to see that.</p><h4>How can banks further SME financing?</h4><p>We need an insolvency law with provisions to protect SMEs. We do not have that yet, although there have been talks. Banks are more focused on personal and corporate banking, developing financial products for megaprojects. Some banks have an SME arm but they generally do not deal with businesses that are worth less than AED150 million. We feel that does not suit the financing requirements of an SME enterprise.</p><h4>Do you feel SMEs are the engine of an economy's growth now that globally the economy has slowed?</h4><p>We are facing a challenging year and a volatile energy price market. This will have an effect on all economic indicators, both locally and regionally. SMEs need to avoid putting all their eggs in one basket at this point in time, that basket being government projects. The government will redefine its priorities when there is more clarity on what is happening in world oil production, and also in terms of regional security. To keep their revenue stream healthy, we want SMEs to focus on smaller projects that may take more time and energy to process, but will pay back much quicker than bigger government projects. An audit we did with the financials of about 120 companies that we have funded and have been operational three years revealed that those SMEs generated AED50 million of revenue in a single year by selling their services and products outside the UAE. If you take that example to and apply it to all SMEs, you can appreciate the opportunities that are out there for SMEs looking to go beyond the UAE's borders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the improvements on the quality of data and assurance of data by SCAD and how has that been compiled YoY?</h4><p>Following the announcement of the Abu Dhabi Plan, the Statistics Center will be one of the major overseeing bodies. For the whole Abu Dhabi government we will implement a system for statistics that was missing before. We have visited many countries and we have a plan for what we will do here. Finland has one of the best offices of statistics for administrative data and it is focusing closely on it. This is the future of statistics, to provide stronger data for government offices and not only statistical output for themselves. This is the focus for the next five years</p><h4>How are you measuring inflation and its impact on the economy?</h4><p>The measurement was based on a 2007 average shopping basket. Now we have changed the basket to the average cost of a shopping basket in 2014, based on around 1,400 items from the large income expenditure survey we conducted in 2013. The first basket for 2007 included around 700 items and each item has a weight on the calculation, so when we calculate this weight it is lower than before because it is compared to 2007. This is improving accuracy and developing the data</p><h4>How do you feel that population growth and the unemployment gap can be developed?</h4><p>We are highlighting red flags to the government so that it can make decisions or request more data, and this is precisely why we go to the field and perform surveys. We give this data to the government and the Department of Economic Development (DED) investigates further in order to provide recommendations. The DED and the executive council perform this further investigation, but our role is to make the survey and provide that data. Our role is not to provide the solution, but present the data. Our data gives a picture of what is happening but it is not our role to make recommendations.</p><h4>How has SCAD aligned itself with the federal vision of digitizing services?</h4><p>SCAD's web portal (Smart SCAD) provides a range of statistical apps that can be downloaded by any member of the public from the website. The portal also serves the population with live data from our database, presenting information through advanced interactive tools, such as infographics and data visualizations. These tools enable users create maps, customized tables and charts that are easy to use and interpret, requiring no analytical skills, thereby increasing accessibility, interactivity and customization of data for users. It is important for decision makers to have a dashboard and be able to read live data. The latest initiative is Sallatna, which is an app that gives each person the ability to see what is happening in the market. It enables individuals to compare prices of products in the market. The data can be found via a barcode and it will be easy for any customer to gauge value through price comparison.</p><h4>How are you trying to reach international investors who are interested in engaging with the Abu Dhabi market?</h4><p>Some send us letters and require more details about Abu Dhabi and it is our job to give them the right picture. We need to give them the right facts so that they know if it is the right place to invest or not, and that must be their decision. It is our role to give them an accurate picture. We have many requests for data and we will always provide that data within 24 hours as per the response time KPIs in our CRM. We also have a foreign investment survey to gauge what investments are coming into the country or leaving, which is made on an annual basis here at SCAD. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Mubadala responding to the pressures of the current macroeconomic situation?</h4><p>Any prudent, active global investor should be managing its portfolio through challenging economic conditions. For Mubadala, this has meant optimizing expenditures, both operational and capital, monetizing assets when value creation opportunities exist, and ensuring that we maintain a diverse portfolio in order to maintain stability through volatility. We continue to meticulously evaluate our portfolio to ensure we are applying the right mix of long-term strategic vision with the ability to adapt when opportunities arise. If we see the right conditions materialize we have and will continue to consider the merits of monetization. We believe that the current global economic environment underpins the importance of our shareholder's vision to diversify Abu Dhabi's economy, and the role Mubadala plays in delivering on that vision. For patient investors, this offers opportunities and we will continue making targeted investments that advance Abu Dhabi's priorities.</p><h4>What role does Mubadala, as a state-owned investment fund, play within the national economy at a time when the deficit has widened?</h4><p>First of all, it is important to understand that Mubadala's mandate to support Abu Dhabi's economic diversification has not changed since we were set up by the Abu Dhabi government over 14 years ago. In fact, our particular focus is even more intense during cycles like these, in terms of delivering and transforming the economy in line with strategic priorities. Against this backdrop, 2015 was another strong year of delivery, with Mubadala contributing to a range of milestone developments in the UAE, including the opening of Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, the region's most sophisticated hospital. This complex care facility is the only one of its kind in the region and reduces the need for thousands of UAE patients to travel abroad for treatment. In 2015, the hospital completed more than 58,000 appointments and 2,300 surgeries for patients, many of whom would have otherwise required overseas treatment. Another success story for us has been Strata, our composite aero structures manufacturer, which saw Boeing deliver the first 787 Dreamliner to Etihad Airways with UAE-made components. Strata is also part of an industrial cluster that is creating tens of thousands of local jobs and providing opportunities for the UAE's residents and businesses alike</p><h4>Which markets are currently appealing to Mubadala, bearing in mind mixed sentiment around BRICS, and low oil prices hammering GCC economies?</h4><p>As a global investor with a long-term perspective, Mubadala is constantly assessing multiple markets. In 2015, for example, we established a $10 billion UAE-China Joint Investment Fund with China Development Bank Capital and China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange. The fund will have the flexibility to look at a range of alternative investment strategies, asset classes, and special opportunities, including greenfield investment projects with the aim of building a balanced portfolio with a focus on sustainable returns and principal capital protection. The strategic and commercial partnership builds on investments we have made through Mubadala Capital, our dedicated, in-house asset and investment management unit. With a focus on sovereign investments, including those with Russia and France, we gain direct access to key international markets alongside trusted local partners, who bring local expertise and investment access to the table. Brazil is another market where Mubadala has interests. In 2015, we finalized the restructuring of our $2 billion preferred equity investment in the EBX Group. The completion of this complex restructuring has enabled us to gain a portfolio of assets that hold attractive, long-term value in sectors aligned with, and complementary to, core Mubadala businesses, such as metals and mining, infrastructure, and real estate. The aggregate value of these assets is now in excess of the original amount invested, and we have opened an office in Rio de Janeiro to manage the Brazil investment portfolio. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[full-steam-ahead]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the economy of Abu Dhabi coping with lower oil prices?</h4><p>Anyone reviewing the economic growth history of Abu Dhabi would recognize that, over the past decades, Abu Dhabi was consistent in achieving its main development objectives and especially in expanding and diversifying the non-oil sector. From simple trend analysis of oil-price to non-oil sector growth, one would find that, since the nineties, the non-oil sector has become almost independent from oil price fluctuations. This has become more evident in the past 10 years, with the non-oil sector achieving around 8% CAGR, regardless of fluctuations in oil prices. And currently, non-oil activities account for more than 51% of the overall economy at constant prices, compared to 41% in 2005. From that aspect, we are really ahead of the trend when it comes to achieving the economic vision for 2030.</p><h4>One of the primary aims of the 2030 Vision is to create a knowledge-based economy. How do you assess that goal, 15 years out from the target date?</h4><p>The vision identified a number of strategic economic sectors that are expected to form the engines constructing a sustainable knowledge-based economy. The industrial sector is expected to play a critical role in achieving the Emirate's aspirations, through developing advanced industries, as is the case in establishing the aerospace cluster in Al Ain. Abu Dhabi aims to develop a highly skilled productive workforce, particularly nationals, that are equipped for the increasingly competitive global knowledge economy. The education sector is a major determinant for achieving the Emirate's aspirations. Thus, there is a strong local commitment to invest in education, coupled with partnerships with a number of renowned foreign universities and academic institutions that are establishing a presence in the Emirate, such as Paris-Sorbonne, NYU, and INSEAD. The Abu Dhabi economy is undergoing a new phase of development with real commitment at both the government as well as business levels to accomplish ambitious goals and deliver our desired vision.</p><h4>The General Secretariat of the Executive Council (GSEC) has just launched the five-year plan. What is ADDED's specific role in coordination and alignment regarding the 83 initiatives and 25 objectives?</h4><p>The Abu Dhabi Plan set out five sectors, which are social development, economic development, infrastructure and environment, security, justice, and safety, and government affairs. ADDED is one of the stakeholders that has worked with GSEC from the early stages of the plan. ADDED is mainly responsible for the economic development sector of the plan in coordination with its strategic partners from the public and semi-government organizations. For example, one of the main programs we have is to create a common platform for the Abu Dhabi government to interact with both local and foreign investors and cater for opportunity development and support at the same time. Another program looks at enhancing the share of entrepreneurs and SMEs in the market and creating the right environment for SMEs to thrive. The main point of all of this is that ADDED will be using the common platform that the five-year government plan provides to assure delivery and continuous push from all stakeholders.</p><h4>Looking ahead, what are Abu Dhabi's most attractive sectors for investment? </h4><p>Abu Dhabi is one of the safest and most stable destinations in the world for living, working, and establishing a business. Vision 2030 has identified several sectors as engines of the Emirate's future growth in order to provide the essential development to achieve Abu Dhabial sectors as engines of the Emiation and to successfully target both regional and global markets, including petrochemicals, metals, aviation, energy, financial services, and media. It is globally recognized that the economy of Abu Dhabi is one of the fastest growing in the region. With Vision 2030 targeting investments to capture more than 23% of GDP by 2030, Abu Dhabi is highly committed to an attractive, business-friendly environment in parallel with active collaboration with private-sector entities and foreign investment companies, in order to release the hidden potential of our economy, marking the Emirate as one of the most favorable business destinations in the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Non-oil economic sectors contribute about 70% of the UAE's GDP today. What are the most important of these sectors in the UAE's drive for diversification?</h4><p>The UAE's non-oil sectors are marked by great diversity due to the government's long-standing and sound economic policies. Among the various key sectors contributing to GDP, wholesale, retail, and maintenance are at the forefront, accounting for 11.9% according to 2014's statistics. Real estate and business services comes next at 10.9%, followed by construction and building at 10.5%, manufacturing and transformative industries at 7.8%, and transport and storage at 6.3%. Other active sectors such as utilities, financial services, insurance, hotels, and restaurants make valuable contributions as well.</p><h4>A sustainable post-oil economy is the target that the UAE aims to achieve in the next few years. What are the Ministry of Economy's plans to promote this government policy?</h4><p>The Ministry continues to help develop laws and regulations that will create a modern legislative system to improve the ease of doing business in UAE and increase the country's attractiveness for foreign investments. Innovation and R&amp;D are key factors in all our plans as well. SMEs, entrepreneurship, and intellectual property are also major considerations under the Ministry's strategies. Of these sectors, we are specifically targeting an increasing contribution to GDP from the industrial sector. We wish to achieve economic and financial integration with the GCC due to the extreme importance of these countries for the UAE's economy. Our foreign trade with our fellow Gulf states accounted for 9% of our total foreign trade in 2014. We seek to achieve integration through the establishment of long-term joint Gulf projects, work on the GCC rail network, remove intra-GCC custom ports, and develop cohesive GCC laws. In addition, the Ministry intends to increase the country's exports by further diversifying its economic partners, signing additional free trade agreements, and implementing national initiatives for export development. Strengthening the role of the private sector in the national economy remains at the heart of our plan. </p><h4>The Ministry of Economy has made remarkable efforts to develop the UAE's intellectual property sector. How far have these efforts gone and what have been the results?</h4><p>The Ministry has come up with a series of initiatives to develop the intellectual property sector in various areas such as copyright, trademarks and patents, utility certificates, and industrial designs related to industrial property. This included a recently launched action plan for developing the industrial property sector, which involves the creation of an International Centre for Patents. This will encourage the development of the industrial sector through new technologies and inventions that will enhance the overall competitiveness of the national economy. The Ministry has conducted a number of visits that have culminated in agreements and MoUs. One such agreement has been made with the Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Service to develop an industrial property program.</p><h4>The Islamic economy is gaining greater importance in the governmental policy of the UAE. How do you evaluate the UAE's experience in developing this relatively nascent sector?</h4><p>The value of international investments in the Islamic economy is around $8 trillion. This sector did not see the same results of the 2008 global economic recession and the total value of Islamic banking equities stands at about $1.3 trillion and is expected to reach $2.6 trillion by 2020 because of high international demand for these financial services from both Islamic and non-Islamic countries. The UAE leads Arab countries and ranks second globally, among 73 countries in the Islamic economy index, measuring economic system integrity in the Islamic banking sectors. This is cross-sectorial, examining halal products, family tourism, digital content, knowledge and research, Islamic arts, and Islamic quality standards. HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, has launched the “Dubai the Capital of the Global Islamic Economy" initiative and established the Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre, alongside plans to establish the first global Islamic bank for imports and exports. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[building-relationships]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE was one of the first countries to establish a permanent embassy in Somalia. How would you assess the UAE's support for Somalia's stability?</h4><p>There is a long shared history between Somalia and the UAE; we have always traded and have shared interests in the stability of the Arab-African relationship. The UAE was one of the first major supporters of Somalia. The UAE saw the opportunity inherent in establishing a strong relationship with Somalia, initially responding to key humanitarian and development needs in an environment, which other donors saw as too risky. We salute the courage and humanity of the UAE governments in doing so. Since then, the UAE has provided a broad range of support to Somalia—but always for on-ground, practical, and tangible initiatives that Somalis feel and see. The UAE has provided extensive military and security support through training Somali soldiers and providing a military training academy. It has supported the resumption of public services, in particular in the health sector—opening hospitals and health centers. It has reached out to Somalis in need of the basics, building wells where terrorists had destroyed them and allowing families to access water for their children and their livestock. Dubai Ports has indicated significant interest in helping to establish three potential ports on the Somali coast. The UAE has been a significant force in the fight against piracy in Somali waters, with great success. Earlier this year, a UAE convoy was ambushed by al-Shabaab, but in testament to the UAE's bravery and friendship, it has not been deterred from continuing to support the future peace and prosperity of Somalia.</p><h4>Oil represents just 2% of Dubai's GDP, with the bulk of the economy comprised of tourism, retail, real estate, trade and logistics, and manufacturing. In what other areas could Dubai's expertise be of value for Somalia?</h4><p>The UAE has set an extraordinary example of what can be achieved when a country combines visionary leadership, wise stewardship, and investment of its resources, and insists on a quality approach to all it does. Standing on the balcony at a hotel in Dubai recently and gazing over the expanse of a city that basically was not there 25 years ago is the best energizer anyone could wish for. Economic recovery and empowerment is the key issue for Somalia—not just in order to be able to finance our own development and future, but also because ensuring that people have access to meaningful work and get paid to do that work is the best investment a country can make in its security and stability. The UAE took a finite resource and turned it into something of infinite value. Somalia is blessed with a huge store of natural resources, from oil and gas to fisheries and livestock. We have the longest coastline in Africa, two rivers, and extensive agricultural land. We have excellent human potential: a young, entrepreneurial population, and a highly educated and returning diaspora. When you combine our human resources with the natural resource potential of Somalia, there are unlimited possibilities ahead of us as a nation. So, apart from technical support in areas where the UAE has significant expertise, key for Somalia will also be learning from the UAE about rapid, self-managed, and self-funded economic development that suits the Somali context.</p><h4>How do you see Somalia-UAE bilateral relations developing in the next decade?</h4><p>The two countries enjoy a frank and full dialogue, and I am sure this will ensure that our friendship continues to grow. God willing, our strategic relationship will also become more balanced as Somalia continues to develop. I would hope that there will be less “take" in the relationship and more “give" from Somalia, not just in terms of trade and export, but also in shouldering regional responsibilities such as working to end extremism and positively contributing to the economic stability of the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The UN deeply appreciates the UAE for hosting the Abu Dhabi Action Day Sustainability Week and World Future Energy Summit. I thanked our hosts, particularly Dr. Sultan Al Jaber and Laurent Fabius, Foreign Minister of France, as COP21 President for their continued devotion and support on climate change and, more importantly, climate action. It is important that we have adopted the visionary sustainable development goals and also ambitious climate change agreement. This year is the first year of beginning implementation. We have been working closely together for the past year, and we are now riding a wave of momentum from the Paris conference to a new, great future. Today's panel discussions had leaders from all the sectors; we need to succeed. </p><p>Now, we have a landmark climate agreement with the potential for helping generations of people and our planet itself. This issue will define the 21st century. It is exciting to see everyone part of a global push to do something even bigger than the global agreement on climate change, namely to make it a reality. People should be able to feel it. That was the main purpose of our action day conference. This is the responsibility of every country, every economy, and every individual. Governments have developed national climate strategies. More and more countries know that climate action boosts the economy, creates jobs, strengthens security, and improves the air we breathe. That means a healthy and more prosperous future.</p><p>The Paris Agreement was adopted just after the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda; these are two plans for transforming progress. Sustainable development goals are the vision. Climate change is our commitment; this vision and commitment should go hand-in-hand. They are part of all our grand design. These should complement each other; if we do not implement a climate change agreement, none of these 17 goals will not be fully implemented. The direction of travel is clear. The leaders have set the path and it is very clear. The Paris agreement has a clear signal that the transformation of the global economy to lower emissions is inevitable and efficient and already under way. The shift away from fossil fuels must start immediately. Investment in clean energy has increased by 4% over the last two years. That translates into $329 billion. We need that number to double by 2020. This may seem like a huge challenge, but it should be doable in a world where a small number of billionaires have a net worth that equals half the world's wealth. Leaders from the private sector know that clean energy is a growth industry that is full of opportunity for huge returns. I call on governments, businesses, and investors to seize this opportunity. We can power the world on a path to low carbon, resilient growth. That will be the economic leaders of the 21st century, those that made their decision or failed to change will be on the losing side of our history. In the next 15 years, the period of the 2030 agenda, the world will invest trillions of dollars in infrastructure for cities, energy, and agriculture. Every decision on investment and resource allocation must be part of the solution and directed towards low-carbon, climate-resilient growth. <br>I urge governments to increase their ambitions even more, higher, and translate these plans into bankable investment projects as soon as possible. The actual agenda showcased in Paris provides a model for the PPPs we need to accelerate climate action. These partnerships must be scaled up exponentially. The UN will spearhead the response. We have already made financial waterlines and reserves. The UN stands ready to assist our member states in implementing the Paris outcomes and sustainable development goals. By working together, we can end poverty, strengthen peace, and issue a life of dignity and opportunity for all. We can protect our planet and all our people. We can secure the green future that we owe to our succeeding generations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Al Masaood Group's extensive and diversified portfolio worked to bring the company stability and security during this challenging economic period?</h4><p>Diversification is a key component for survival in any economy. Most multinational companies make diversification a priority; likewise, Al Masaood Group has always placed great emphasis on this. We already have synergy between most world-renowned companies; for example, in the automotive industry we represent companies like Nissan, Renault, and Bridgestone and these business lines complement each other despite their differences. We have also diversified within the energy sector and the oil and gas industry. We served the oil and gas industry from the start of the UAE government in the late 1960s. We work to provide the best service and product lines to support the industry's development. We have diversified our operations in that sector by obtaining the latest technologies in close collaboration with top multinational companies. For example, in the oil and gas sector, Furmanite, originally a UK company, is now Al Masaood Furmanite. The company specializes in the latest marine technologies for the oil and gas industry.</p><h4>How has the Group's long history in desalination and gas turbines set the tone for the company's success?</h4><p>These industries play a major role in the UAE's economy as a whole, and specifically here in Abu Dhabi. It is one of our top priorities to keep the sector abreast with the latest technologies. Our emphasis is on the restructuring of these companies and the provision of after-sales service. Service is vitally important to the Al Masaood Group and we invest heavily in training. In the area of turbines we collaborate closely with John Brown, a company that has been operating for more than 40 years. This line of our business operates on a global scale and not just within the UAE.</p><h4>What sectors are particularly exciting for the Al Masaood Group and how do you look to develop the group?</h4><p>It is a difficult period at the moment; having said that, with every challenging period comes opportunities. There was a time everyone waited for opportunities but now it is all about creating opportunities and finding an opportunity. In the past, we faced similar turbulent periods and will undoubtedly face more in the future. The focus of our long-term goal is to have the most efficient strategic planning. We look at each and every entity and sector within the group and constantly reassess how we can refresh our operations and add more value. We do this by introducing new and complementary product lines and the latest technologies. We also invest heavily in building infrastructure that can act as a hub for the future developments of our business opportunities. What is exciting is renewable energy, solar power, the oil and gas industry, and any industry in particular that contributes to the development of UAE and the region since these industries have a role to play in the future of society as well.</p><h4>What plans and goals does the group have specifically for 2016?</h4><p>The primary objective within Al Masaood Group for 2016 is to tackle the obstacles ahead of us in the best and most efficient way possible. We remain committed to our investments in the UAE. For example, in February 2016 we officially opened KSB Al Masaood at Kizad. We aim to look at each entity and see how we can be more cost efficient and utilize our resources in the best way, in parallel with the plan put forward by the Abu Dhabi government for Vision 2030 and beyond. Part of our strategic plan has been to work in close collaboration with the UAE government in terms of building infrastructure and contributing to society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SME development has been unprecedented in the UAE, with the total contribution now more than 60% of GDP. How has this development been achieved?</h4><p>The SME segment is part of the UAE's economic diversity policy and its sustained efforts to reduce reliance on oil as much as possible. The SME segment's role has increased YoY as a result of this policy's success. The SME sector plays a vital role in boosting development, strengthening economic diversity, and supporting the steps taken to achieve a knowledge economy that is based on innovation. Efforts to develop this commenced with granting citizens pieces of lands to start their commercial and industrial projects. The government also offered financial guarantees to citizens so it could leverage banking services. This process has developed over the years with the establishment of official government entities that oversee the support citizens are provided in the SME sector, such as the Khalifa Fund for Enterprise Development, Dubai SME, Ruwad Establishment, Saud bin Saqr Programme for Young Business Leaders, and the Saud bin Rashid Al Mualla Program for Youth Projects Support. The UAE Cabinet approved the decision to create a council for SME projects and establishments, and to launch the national program for SMEs and projects to support their owners with benefits and incentives that boost the spirit of entrepreneurship. As a result of the above-mentioned legislations and support, around 350,000 SME companies and projects have been established in the country, creating job opportunities for over 86% of the total workforce in the private sector. </p><h4>Current economic conditions have affected emerging economies and GCC nations, although the UAE has fared better than its regional counterparts. What can we attribute this resilience to?</h4><p>The UAE's economic resilience is a result of many factors, such as its non-reliance on one resource of income, with non-oil sectors currently contributing about 70% to the economy. The contribution of non-oil sectors to the GDP is increasing annually; thus, helping to reduce the reliance on oil. We expect that non-oil sectors will contribute up to 80% of the GDP by 2021, which will enhance the country's resilience toward any negative impacts of market fluctuations or global oil prices. The UAE economy has proven to be strong and promising, regionally and globally. It has maintained a significant growth level throughout the past years. In addition, the UAE's cash reserves in offshore accounts have largely limited the negative impacts of fluctuating emerging market economies over the last two years.</p><h4>In 2018, the GCC region will introduce a regional VAT, at 5%, which will create a new and secure revenue stream. How important is it to balance this with ensuring the UAE maintains its relative tax-free status to attract business?</h4><p>The VAT, which is expected to be implemented across the GCC region in 2018, is one of the most significant financial reforms to be implemented by those countries. The UAE Ministry of Finance has stressed that VAT will be imposed on sectors that GCC countries concur with, noting that it will be preceded by tax-policy unification across the GCC region. Significantly, the ministry has reiterated that healthcare, education, and a list of food items will be exempt from this tax. The implementation of VAT will certainly not affect the country's position as an attractive investment destination. The UAE came first regionally as the destination of choice for foreign investments. In terms of the global investment indicator, the UAE ranked first in the Arab world and 22nd globally in 2015, while over 25% of the 500 largest global companies have chosen the UAE as a regional headquarters for their operations in the MENA region. In general, any future tax plans will ensure that taxation in the UAE will be the lowest in the world. In this way, we will definitely ensure our country's long-term investment appeal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>We are at a pivotal moment not only in the region but also around the world, and fiscal issues have really been taking front and center of the international agenda. More than fiscal, it is the issue of taxation that has been highly debated and has risen on the agenda of many countries. For those of you who think this is a recent development, I assure you that it is not. </p><p>I would like to talk about two ingredients of taxation for successful 21st-Century economies. The first one is the ability of countries to generate robust government revenue, which is, of course, the lifeblood of modern states. We all know that right now many countries have a pressing need to generate higher and more reliable revenue, although not necessarily for the same reason. For example, oil-exporting countries in this region are adapting to a new reality of low commodity prices. Developing economies need more domestic revenue in order to actually realize the goal of sustainable development. Some advanced economies, particularly in Europe, are relying heavily on fiscal resources to provide services and generate financial stability. So that's the first ingredient, the ability to generate significant and reliable taxation.</p><p>The second ingredient is very peculiar to the 21st century, and it relates to international taxation and how our national tax systems, which are associated with sovereignty and, therefore, operate within territories, can adjust to improving trade and the movement of people and capital across borders. Many of you have read recent headlines and now reports concerning the likes of Google, Starbucks, or Ikea, because specific international tax issues have been raised by these companies that operate across borders and can actually take advantage of loopholes in international tax treaties. That does not necessarily mean they are acting illegally, but certainly in a way that optimizes the discrepancy between different tax positions. We need a system in the 21st century that discourages overly aggressive tax competition among our countries, because that overly aggressive tax competition eventually operates to the overall detriment of international tax and the generation of revenues by individual countries.</p><p>In 2015, our staff at the IMF estimates that oil exporters in the MENA region have lost more than $340 billion in oil revenue from their budgets, amounting to 20% of their combined GDP. Not only have oil prices fallen by around two-thirds from their most recent peak about 18 months ago, but supply- and demand-side factors give us good reason to believe that those prices are going to stay low for an extended period of time. The size and likely persistence of this external shock means that all oil exporters will have to adjust by reducing spending and increasing revenue.</p><p>Oil importers in the MENA region generate tax revenue of about 13% of non-oil GDP on average. That 13% compares with 17% in other emerging and developing economies. So there is scope for increased revenues at similar levels of development. That can be done by broadening the tax base, making personal income tax more progressive, and eliminating privileged corporate income tax regimes. These privileged income tax regimes can actually come back to haunt you as they can lead to a significant shortfall of revenue. It was estimated that the total cost of fiscal incentives for these privileged firms amounted to about 2% of GDP in 2012.</p><p>Domestic revenue mobilization is an imperative for countries that are seeking to achieve the new sustainable development goals. This is not a recipe in and of itself for reaching those goals, because it's one thing to raise revenues and attain those thresholds, but it's another thing to spend those revenues wisely and efficiently. To do that, we have seen that strong fiscal institutions and strong public financial management are key to achieving those goals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the company's strategy to be the partner of choice for international investors and chains?</h4><p>Partnerships lie at the heart of our businesses, and as Saudi's most established company in hotel and residential compounds development, our partners can always depend on us to shape the perfect combination of vision, capabilities, knowledge, skills, and resources. Our longstanding relationships and partnerships are key to our past success and future achievements. Together with Marriott, we first introduced five-star hospitality to Saudi Arabia, and we are expanding the scope together with many projects now under discussion. Our franchise agreements, represented by our partnership with IHG, are another example for this; several developments are in the pipeline with our operational arm, Makarem.</p><h4>What is Makarem and how does it increase tourists' experience?</h4><p>Makarem Hotels, the Saudi-grown hotel brand designed by Dur Hospitality, specialized in operating in the cities of Mecca and Medina. Makarem addresses the ever changing guests' expectations and needs, whether they are businessmen looking for a strategic location with practical services, or pilgrims seeking guidance and tranquility during their spiritual journey, or families looking for spacious rooms during their holidays. Makarem is always in the process of innovating exclusive services that aim at delivering a world-class hotel experience with a local spirit for travelers coming to Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How would you assess the opportunities for the private sector to cooperate with the public sector in the tourism industry in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Vision 2030 stresses the importance of PPPs as a key to sustainability and boosting economic performance. Dur Hospitality recently signed an agreement with GACA for the expansion of the hotel at King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh. Our relationship with the airport authority is also a long-standing relationship that we are proud of; it has spanned 25 years now. With the expansion of 20 years, we are implementing our new strategy of rebranding the hotel to an international name, which will be announced soon. We are building 100 rooms, and we are renovating the entire hotel to match the standards of this new brand. In a couple of years' time, it will be a valuable addition to the Saudi hospitality market. </p><h4>How will the Vision 2030 affect Dur Hospitality?</h4><p>Tourism is one of the focal points of the government's strategy to strengthen the economy and reduce dependence on oil revenue. Vision 2030 identifies several objectives such as establishing and developing tourism destinations as well as integrated entertainment and the protection, promotion, and awareness of national heritage sites, as well as the development of hospitality facilities and tourism services. These are enough to confirm our commitment to hospitality and the choices that we have made because they are in line with the visions that have been laid out. We see that the government has plans to increase the number of international visitors from 8 million to 30 million, and we already have a focus on Mecca and Medina. We are working toward achieving this vision by providing a larger supply of suitable hospitality for the guests coming to the Kingdom. </p><h4>Do you have any specific goals or expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We expect 2016 to be a challenging year due to the global economic conditions and the economic situation of the country, with the economy being tied to the price of oil which is declining. Nevertheless, we have good hopes for 2016 and some of the changes have been to our advantage, for example, commodity prices. The demands of contractors have declined, and we expect to find favorable conditions to continue developing our hotels. We have decided that we have to speed up the pace of our developments in the coming years, even though we are approaching a low business cycle in real estate and hospitality, which are both cyclical sectors.  We will continue to invest so that we emerge a leader. We expect to be able to maintain the proper performance of our existing assets, as well as the pace of development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>REC is the leading organizer of corporate gatherings and major events in Saudi Arabia. What are the key elements that have made the company successful?</h4><p>The MICE industry is a challenging sector governed by several criteria, and companies working in the field often find it hard to thrive and succeed. However, from our prolonged experience in the market, we found that the keys to success are in fact simple, as it is all about the structure and organization. We at Riyadh Exhibitions Company have set a comprehensive plan following a systematic approach that includes four main stages: the planning stage, the pre-exhibition phase, the exhibition phase, and the post-exhibition phase. Choosing the right exhibitions, developing identity and branding, planning the exhibition structure, identifying our target exhibitors, and implementing the appropriate marketing plan are all key. Then, the logistics part follows, designing the floor plan, providing the on-ground support, all the way to registration, crowd management, media support, and wrapping up the whole show. All these are just headlines of a complicated and detail oriented process that enable us to have a successful portfolio of events. </p><h4>To what extent can the MICE sector contribute to the tourism sector? </h4><p>The MICE industry is a main contributor to the development of the tourism sector and several countries across the world rely on exhibitions to attract a huge number of visitors from across the globe. Saudi Arabia is a vital business hub in the region and the world, and we cannot neglect the government's efforts in supporting the tourism sector. Business tourism is an essential part of this sector. Challenges still exist in this sector despite all the efforts, but we believe that with the current Vision 2030, major changes will occur that will be in the favor of this industry.</p><h4>How do you expect the MICE sector to grow in the medium term?</h4><p>Vision 2030 is promising and the rules and regulations that will be enacted will definitely have a positive impact on the economy in general and the MICE industry in particular. The MICE industry promotes the economic significance of the country and supports the openness of the Kingdom to the international players and attracts thousands of investors who are eager to enter the Saudi Market. We certainly have a positive outlook on the sustainable advancement of this industry in the near future.</p><h4>What are your ambitions as Chairman of REC for the role that the company will play in the sector going forward?</h4><p>REC is one of the first companies that started in this business in the Kingdom. We have contributed to the success and the progress of this industry, and this has been witnessed by the increased number of companies working in this field. We believe this sector will have a positive impact on the economic diversification plans in Saudi Arabia, and we work closely with all supporting bodies, such as the Saudi Exhibition and Convention Bureau to develop the related internal and external environments to accomplish the sector's economic, cultural, and social objectives.</p><h4>What are your specific expectations and goals for 2016 for REC?</h4><p>REC will plan, organize, and manage more than eight sustainable shows addressing the vital sectors in the Kingdom. These shows include: Saudi Print &amp; Pack Plastic &amp; Petrochemicals, which is the largest industrial gathering in the region; Saudi Health, the Kingdom's largest healthcare event; Saudi Build, dedicated to supporting the construction sector in the Kingdom; Saudi Agriculture, which is looking to unlock the potential of a vital sector; and the Riyadh Motor show, which is one of the most prominent automotive shows in the region. We are also always screening the market for developing new shows that can add value to the Saudi Market. Our dedicated team is always seeking to attract international shows to the Kingdom, and we have several shows that will be announced in the near future. REC is also in the business of organizing trade fairs in promising markets in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Future  of Education]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-future-of-education]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What needs to be done for local universities to produce the talent that companies are seeking?</h4><p>This is a chronic problem in the Saudi education system. Generally, graduates, private or public, are difficult to place in the workforce. There is a gap between market needs and the skills and knowledge being taught to the students graduating from our universities, which feeds unemployment and enhances the need to bring qualified manpower from abroad to fill this gap. We are constantly in touch with the business community to gauge what it needs and how to tailor our programs accordingly. Every program we offer is based on whether there is a market demand for its graduates. Change in the system is difficult because of restrictive bureaucracies in universities. But at this university, changes can be quick, feasibility studies can be done efficiently, and resource deployment can be done effectively. This makes UBT a more flexible and dynamic organization that is quicker to respond to market needs.</p><h4>How do you help your graduates find jobs in the field?</h4><p>We have established a Career Center (CC) in charge of this responsibility. The CC supervises a program whereby students spend three to four months working in a company as part of their studies. This helped many students find jobs and companies to find needed talents. We help to place our students in the market and find them jobs. About 30-40% of our graduates receive our help and find jobs through this program. We also offer through the English Language Academy (ELA) a preparatory year after high school that includes English-language proficiency, research methods, study skills, elementary math, and many others. We reshape our students to help them qualify for university challenges, and then we help them find jobs once they graduate from UBT. We also greatly emphasize work ethic along the whole journey, until the student enters the job market.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges for the education sector in Saudi Arabia in the coming years?</h4><p>The biggest challenge is to reduce the percentage of expats in the total population, which currently stands at 30%. We want Saudis to be qualified enough to fill the needs of their own economy and country. The biggest challenge is also to provide an education system that reduces our dependence on non-Saudis throughout all skill levels and sectors, right down to unskilled labor. This is not just about today but also about preparing for the future, for a growing and young population. All families in Saudi Arabia want their children to enroll in a university. In Germany, only 20% to 25% of high school graduates go to university because the majority choose to join excellent technical institutes. We need to have this option in Saudi Arabia. It is not just about creating intellectuals, engineers, academics, or executives; we also need to have plumbers, electricians, and technicians and many other skills. We have to convince parents that there are other options besides universities and other career paths that can be equally, if not more, rewarding and beneficial.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We want to become an education-research organization and focus more on research, and emphasize research skills in student performance. Furthermore, we want to gain international recognition. We recently signed an agreement with the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), whereby we will be doing joint research and our faculty can use KAUST facilities for research purposes. We signed another agreement with Rouen University in France, with which we are working closely in preparation for a College of Medicine. We have another partnership with Connecticut University to review our curriculum for engineering. Our strategy is to expand vertically as well as horizontally, with more and more emphasis on quality. We do not aim to become a big university; we aim to remain a small university with a strong education and research reputation that puts us on a par with well reputed universities around the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[class-in-the-kingdom]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can universities do to produce qualified graduates who meet market needs?</h4><p>It is not as simple as adding one or two courses; it is that every course needs to have theoretical and practical elements in it so we can connect and close the gap between the university and market needs. If we do not do so, the gap will increase as time goes by with the students from a freshman year to a senior year. If in every course the faculty connects the practical element to the theoretical element, it will truly be of benefit. This is a general theory, but adding a course or adding a program, a new program that really helps the market with its needs, is something that we try to do here. We looked at some of the programs that were not offered in the Kingdom as well as industry needs, and started designing from there. For example, operation and information management (OPIM) is something that explores the supply chain management, but entrepreneurship can help students learn how to create businesses, how to write a business plan, and how to look at the technical aspects. The industry needs this most, so we added it nine years ago and started looking at how graduates are doing in the market. Around 85% of our graduates from that department get employed immediately within six months. Our strategy from now on is not only adding courses and making sure that we connect to the market by doing market research, but also how to incorporate the practical elements, the field study, and the internship in order to close the gap.</p><h4>How would you assess the measures the government is taking to boost the education sector in the country?</h4><p>Over the last five or six years, the education sector got the lion's share of the whole budget. Of course, there is a financial strain that came to the Kingdom last year due to the decrease in the oil prices. Regardless, the government's commitment to education is there, and that it really calms everybody to know that education is a number-one priority, and we are working hard to increase the quality. The vision of the Kingdom is not only just to increase the number of people who will graduate from high school or from different universities, it is really to look at the quality of those graduates. The Minister canceled all distant learning studies programs because they did not give the right quality of higher education, the right knowledge, or the right skills to the students because it is just for one month. However, one of the things the government is now working on is the quality of education, such as establishing the Public Education Evaluation Commission for education in general for K-12 and higher education.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for this university in the medium term and specifically in 2016?</h4><p>I want to see this sector truly developed into the area of research. We always speak of the knowledge society, and now we want to create the knowledge society. A knowledge society does not only come about by educating people. Integrating education as a benefit to society makes a big difference. This not only comes from education, but research and the implementation of this research into the social and economic agenda. I see it as a means of prosperity for the whole country; if I want this sector to contribute more to the economy and the social fabric of society, we need to see this knowledge society happening. The main ingredient of the knowledge society is people who create ideas and helps solve problems. If we do not solve the problems we face, then it is not a knowledge society. We will do an energy program for 2016 for students who study petroleum engineering and renewable energy. We are also trying to offer a program in the 2016-2017 school year for the PhD program in business with Berkeley. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The ministry is applying the Cooperative Health Insurance System in all its medical facilities. How will this measure contribute to the development of the sector and KSMC? </h4><p>One of the initiatives of the Ministry of Health (MoH) is the provision of healthcare at all levels, which ensures that all people in the Kingdom are provided with excellent healthcare. This measure will stratify the relationship between patient, healthcare provider, and service funding. This will put all healthcare providers in real competition by improving the way the service is provided and enhancing the patient experience. At KSMC, we believe that it is a good opportunity for us to serve more patients and to contribute to the wellbeing of the community. We have started on the ground with the expansion of our small health economic office to engage real agreements with insurance companies and to modify our policy to accommodate the change. </p><h4>A shortage of skilled professionals and an exodus of staff to better-paid private sector jobs is a major issue. What can be done to address this?</h4><p> The shortage of skilled healthcare professionals is a global issue, but is more profound here since we are expanding our health services. Competition is stiff between government and private institutions in the international market, amongst the GCC countries, and even inside the Kingdom. The increased movement of healthcare staff creates a struggle for the facility and the patients. We are working hard and training our own people to build the internal capability to cover part of the gap. Over this year, we have sent more than 350 employees for further training abroad. We also provide grant opportunities for our staff in developing their research projects. We also packaged our salaries to attract high-caliber professionals and provide professional career development for them as part of our retention plan </p><h4>Revenue is expected to reach SAR500 million by the end of 2016, up from SAR30 million in 2009. What have been the main drivers of this growth? </h4><p>The MoH is the largest provider of healthcare services and has a huge number of medical facilities and it has a number of facilities that are underutilized. How can we generate revenue? We need a new mindset of achieving growth in assets and increasing income. With key people that can invest and generate  more revenue  from the core competency of the MoH; the  medical services or utilizing the facility where the MoH owns multimillion-dollar prime leases of land in the Kingdom. It is also important to provide paid services to other facilities (government and non-government), like monetary consultation or training</p><h4>What are your expectations and goals for 2016 for KSMC?</h4><p>Since the inception of our strategic plan early this year, we have taken steps to implement our imperatives and to realize KSMC's vision and mission. This year is an exciting journey for KSMC. First, we are looking at having improved our patient's experience where measures are in place to validate their journey from their first encounter with our services to their discharge until our patients' achieve their desired health. We will expand our services to meet the community's needs. We are also starting to work on the transformation of KSMC to a corporate model as a non-profit organization aligned with the Vision 2030. We are continuously working in parallel with MoH strategy to position our role as a trauma center and improve our center of excellence in all our services. With regard to human resources, we are putting in extensive efforts to close the gap of skilled staff. Another exciting project we are looking forward to completing in 2016 is our modern maternity and pediatric hospital, with a 500-bed capacity that will bring added value to the people of Riyadh. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones of SMC since its establishment?</h4><p>SMC opened its doors to patients in 1999 as an outpatient clinic facility. It started by providing healthcare to the local community and their families. Soon after that, it saw a growing demand for day surgery services and added these services. Existing facilities were converted from a day surgery center to a fully operational hospital. In the ensuing years, the number of clinics and beds increased, and with the addition of a second tower, the need to fill these additional beds became a priority. Thus, a concept was created to establish collaboration between the government and the private sector for the former to outsource various types of services to private hospitals. The National Guard hospital transferred some of its patients to SMC. This new model between the government and the private sector proved to be successful and demand for similar services increased, with King Faisal, Security Hospital and military hospitals redirecting some of their patients to private hospitals where they could receive the same level of services and quality.</p><h4>What are the main elements of this center that make it a symbol of trust?</h4><p>The most important is the investment in highly qualified human capital, which is one of the main elements of success. SMC's personnel are well experienced and trained and many have been with us for several years. Second, having a dedicated and qualified management team is essential. We encourage an open door policy, whereby patients and staff can express any comments or complaints to me, the directors, or to any other manager in the hospital. Thirdly, all of us place the patient first and treat them and their requirements as an utmost priority. In order to reach the highest levels of quality care and service, we have partnered with distinguished companies such as Siemens, Philips, and Medtronic. We always expand and seek new strategic partnerships, as they enrich our experience and give us the possibility to assist our patients with the highest quality of care.</p><h4>What is the role of the private sector in the healthcare sector in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The future of the Kingdom is the private sector. We are no different from the rest of the world. In the US and Europe, the private sector is the leader in healthcare-related services. In Saudi Arabia, the private sector is expanding considerably. We now provide tertiary care services, which is the highest care that can be given to patients. The private sector currently accounts for around 20-30% of the Saudi Arabian healthcare market. This trend is also confirmed by the establishment of new medical colleges and the introduction of the private sector to train these medical students. Finally, the government has a long-term plan to provide medical insurance coverage for the entire Saudi population in the next five years. Currently, the largest competitor for the private sector is the government. If the government stops investing and expanding its healthcare network and facilities, it will be our turn to grow, and in the coming five or six years there will be a gradual growth of between 25 and 50%.</p><h4>What are SMC's expansion plans?</h4><p>We are now studying expanding into the eastern and western regions; however, we will not likely start any projects in the next five years. Saudi Arabia is a large country and medical services are needed. It is not just the expansion in buildings that is important, but the methods of delivering services too. At the moment, we are expanding horizontally. We recently signed an agreement with a pharmaceutical company in Lebanon to establish a pharmaceutical factory in Jeddah. This was a strategic plan for us, as the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in Saudi Arabia is quite limited and the government is encouraging the private sector to get involved. We believe that pharmaceutical manufacturing is a strategic area for the future, which is why we are investing in a modern and highly sophisticated manufacturing plant. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the company's key strategies to implement its activities in a commercial and sustainable manner?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia has pursued a path of continual economic reform and development over the past decade. Investment and policy reforms have led to a massive expansion in infrastructure in different areas, resulting in the growth of all major sectors for the Kingdom, leading to the general wellbeing of the Saudi citizens. The rapid growth of the population of Saudi Arabia required an establishment of a specialized project management company, namely TBC, to undertake major efforts in addressing the challenges that are faced in providing high-quality buildings services for the education sector in the Kingdom. TBC's scope is defined to serve the whole general education sector, providing full PMO/PMC covering planning, design, construction, and facility management services for new buildings with a qualified team that is structured to serve this purpose. TBC's vision is to become one of the leading project management companies in the country. In order to deliver this vision, TBC has embarked on a capability-building program, partnering with a leading global project management construction and engineering company, namely AECOM.</p><h4>What are the most significant projects TBC is currently developing?</h4><p>TBC offers a comprehensive strategy that helps our clients to accelerate business growth, mitigate risks, and lower the cost of high-quality deliverables by offering a management solution that is anchored to a set of core principles that fully address the business. Organizations increasingly expect investments in buildings to deliver positive and tangible outcomes. TBC has a broad portfolio that is specifically designed to deliver the services that are needed for its clients.</p><h4>What are the opportunities for the private sector to cooperate with the public sector in developing educational projects?</h4><p>As an organization dedicated to managing construction projects in the Kingdom, TBC, and its partners, fully understand the importance of successful projects' execution. Effective implementation of our projects will undoubtedly yield sustained developmental outcome. Therefore, we propose for each project deployment a reputed team of subject matter experts and a robust project management approach driven by global best practices to assist in achieving the desired outcomes of the project. With such solutions come opportunities for the private sector and investors to partner and create the most suitable programs. Opportunities to partner with the private sector can be applied to any of our services. The Kingdom's whole strategy now is to increase the private sector's participation in most areas of government activity. We are developing investment packages in the areas of interest to various investors in the private sector including design, financing, construction, and maintenance of educational buildings. At a later stage, we can involve the private sector in operation, having them running the schools, hiring the teachers, and so forth.</p><h4>How is TBC coordinating with the Ministry of Education to address the gap between existing education infrastructure and what is needed?</h4><p>The Ministry of Education commissioned a study in 2012 and found that we need a minimum of 10,000 new educational buildings over the next 20 years to meet five categories of demand: replace rented or non-educational buildings with purpose-specific education buildings, replace old buildings, meet population growth in existing cities and new districts, create more space to ease overcrowding in existing buildings that exceeded their capacity, and reallocate elementary, intermediate, and secondary school levels into separate buildings. The role of TBC is to meet ministry demands in developing the educational infrastructure. Currently, the ministry decides their requirements on how many buildings, where, and what size, and TBC delivers. In pursuit of accurate demand determination across all regions of the Kingdom, both the ministry and TBC will embark on a three-year study called the School Master Plan. Under this project, we will gather detailed data about all the existing buildings, teachers, class rolls, capacity, location, and new demand. Upon completion, the School Master Plan will help both the ministry and TBC to determine exactly where the new projects should be, when they are needed, and what their scope and cost should be. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Blended Education]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[blended-education]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the Saudi Electronic University (SEU) play in the education sector?</h4><p>The use of technology in education is not very common in either Saudi Arabia or globally. SEU has embraced King Abdullah's vision in incorporating technology with different knowledge fields. SEU offers a blended e-learning system, which is a mix of distance and face-to-face learning. Students come to campus once a week for their face-to-face classes, where they meet with their teachers to discuss different topics. Also, SEU students attend online lectures. The university focuses more on learning than teaching, which holds a number of benefits such as saving time and money and offering everyone an opportunity to learn no matter where they are. This is the future of learning in universities, and I believe that by 2025 there will no longer be any face-to-face learning.</p><h4>Is blended learning only offered by SEU?</h4><p>The blended model we use is only offered at SEU. There are other distance learning universities, but they use totally different models. SEU is now in its fifth year and we are proud to graduate our first class this year. The university also offers MBAs. Each department has around 33 courses with a total of more than 250 individual courses, all of which are offered online. SEU has many branches all around the Kingdom. These branches are located in Riyadh, Dammam, Jeddah, Jazan, Alahsa, Aljouf, Almadinah, Altaif, Tabouk, Abha, and Alqassim. Students do not need to come to the main campus. The administrative building is in Riyadh and its 50 classrooms can accommodate a minimum of 20,000 students. If we wanted to provide classes for 20,000 students in the regular education system we would need 10 buildings to do so. Also, in our system, students can listen to lectures at home or on the go. We offer morning, evening, and even weekend groups. By doing so, we save a lot of money and reduce traffic.</p><h4>How does the education sector in Saudi Arabia and SEU specifically provide students with the skills employers are seeking?</h4><p>The main problem is that although we have highly skilled graduates, companies are still demanding Saudis who are trained and ready to start work—companies are not willing to train them. We believe that this model of learning helps prepare students to be responsible, manage their time, and learn continually. Usually institutions focus on teaching almost 70-80% of students' time; however, education is not only teaching. Students' time should be comprised of 30% teaching, 50% skills and experience, and 20% attitude. Experience, skills, and attitude are more important than just receiving information, especially today. We live in the age of technology and students need to be reshaped, along with educational institutions. This will have a positive impact on students, especially when they enter the business world. Students who graduate from such universities will be better prepared individuals.</p><h4>What changes are in store for the education sector in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>I used to be Dean at the College of Computer Science, and back then I predicted that mobile phones and laptops would soon be all-in-one. By 2025 there will be no need for universities. Unfortunately, there is a resistance from professors, who are the current leaders now. There is a conflict between the older and the younger generation. Students will not continue to work in academia. Students in the US, especially, believe that they do not need to amass student loans and attend lectures to get a degree. They are starting to demand more available content and flexibility to work. Once current professors retire and the new generation leads, e­learning will flourish. For example, SEU student enrolment numbers tripled over the previous year, but we cannot accommodate all of them right now. We need our university to invest in more content, rather than more buildings or infrastructure. By content I mean developing courses and materials for them. We do not need more buildings—they are a waste of time and money. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the opportunities for PPPs in Saudi Arabia in the education sector today?</h4><p>There are many opportunities for PPPs in education. In fact, the Ministry of Education is promoting many initiatives with the private sector. For example, we are already in the process of implementing some vital programs, such as private schools, school buildings, and school transportation. We aim to close the gap between the two through such cooperation. Also, we are looking forward to more opportunities to expand our relationship with the private sector, as it will benefit both sides, provide flexibility and competitiveness, and enhance quality.</p><h4>What role can digitization play in the education sector in Saudi Arabia to increase efficiency and reduce cost?</h4><p>The potential is big and we are supporting the use of technology in the classroom. We are developing several programs and we plan to work on many others in the near future. We believe e-learning is crucial to the development of the educational sector and it is a high-priority for the Ministry of Education. It will play a bigger role in the future.</p><h4>What are the specific goals and expectations for the Ministry of Education for 2016?</h4><p>We are optimistic in promoting reform and change for the best. However, our ultimate goal is to improve the quality of education and improve standards at all levels. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why will Jeddah Economic City represent a brand new concept for cities?</h4><p>JEC is a private venture supported by the government. We have found an opportunity in the market to develop an urban node to anchor the north of the city to the rest of the urban area. The city has a population of 4 million people living in an area that is 50km by 10km; therefore, a new real estate concept is necessary. Nearly 60% of the Saudi population is below 30 years old and, within a decade, 60% will be below 25 years of age. These young people will need schools, jobs, and housing, with the latter representing a serious ongoing problem. The trend toward living in apartment buildings has taken hold, and people are increasingly moving from traditional houses to towers. Having a city center will attract people to this area, thereby encouraging the use of apartment buildings. These young people are going to need jobs as well, so more office blocks have to be constructed to generate more jobs. That way people can live and work in the area. From a lifestyle point of view, we also need to provide people with leisure, entertainment, and retail facilities. On top of this, Jeddah is a leading tourism destination for both Saudis and the 30 million pilgrims who come here annually. This number is likely to grow to 60 million over the next five years. The city center will be a mixed-use space with different types of housing, business, hotel, leisure, entertainment, retail, healthcare, and education zones. </p><h4>How can a city help its citizens to thrive?</h4><p>Building an urban center in a flat city can change the lifestyle of young Saudis. They will be able to spend less time on the road commuting, and as a result will come to work happier. Their working environments will be more conducive to productivity, as we can already see in Dubai. There will be new job opportunities with seven new hotels going up, major new retail opportunities, and numerous companies that are going to relocate. Young professionals will also be able to find a place to start their businesses in JEC. They can have a clearly defined address and easy location to find compared to setting up in a building in the old city where the street names and addresses are confusing. This will enhance the quality of life and create a shift in the way business is done.</p><h4>What advantages does the country provide for a project like this?</h4><p>This is one of the strongest economies in the Middle East, and we are blessed to be in Jeddah, which is the gateway to the Islamic world. Millions of pilgrims come through Jeddah every year going to and from Mecca and Medina. We also have a beautiful shoreline and are a prime destination for Saudi tourists who are excellent tourism clients. Jeddah is also the first business hub in the Kingdom, like Dubai in the UAE. Some 40% of the top 100 companies have their head offices here, and the city also has the second largest industrial zone in the Kingdom. Furthermore, the economy is the least dependent on oil and gas. My job is to build cities, and on all of my projects I work in close collaboration with the government, service and utility providers, and other major institutions, both public and private, to succeed. It is not about building a place; it is about putting a soul into a place. When you undertake a large project in Saudi Arabia you are in charge of setting up your own infrastructure and linking the city to the relevant services. The government is an important player here because it is investing heavily in infrastructure. Both the government and the private sector are doing their bit, and we cooperate in many other areas, making it a de facto PPP. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you say is the correct approach to city management?</h4><p>Cities in general provide services to their residents, so in a way they should not be viewed as political entities but rather as business entities. The executives in charge of cities, which we call mayors, are city managers, and must play more of an executive role than a political role. Cities should be run more with the idea of serving customers. This approach enhances everything, and changes the way cities are managed. The most effective and simplest way to do this is to capitalize on social media and applications to assess citizens' feedback on how the city is being managed.</p><h4>What are the elements for a successful city?</h4><p>Proximity and diversity are the key factors for the success of a city. In each urban area, there is hard infrastructure and soft infrastructure. The former is easy to provide, in the form of ports, roadways, bridges, and other transport and utility structures. Soft infrastructure, on the other hand, comprises the regulatory framework and the services that you provide to residents, and the lifestyle and amenities that you offer to them, whether in form of food, culture, or public spaces. This is the more complicated aspect of running a city. A city is the result of its residents building their lives over time. If you saw it this way, you would forget about pipes and buildings and would focus on these intangible considerations.</p><h4>What does KAEC offer foreign investors?</h4><p>We deal with two types of investors. There are industrial investors to which we offer a world-class port, best-in-class infrastructure and logistics, and plug-and-play solutions. Then there are the residents who are investing not only their money, but also their livelihoods. To them we offer jobs, housing for all income levels, and lifestyle solutions such as tourism.</p><h4>What are your goals for KAEC in 2016?</h4><p>We have just reached our 10-year anniversary. Over the past decade, we have completed 40 major projects, and over the next 10 years we want to build 170 projects. This will represent a huge increase in investment in the city, and most of these will be building industrial infrastructure, which we specialize in, but also tourism, lifestyle, education, and healthcare solutions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[for-your-health-saudi-arabia-2016-saudi-arabia-2016-saudi-arabia-2016-saudi-arabia-2016-saudi-arabia-2016-saudi-arabia-2016-saudi-arabia-2016-saudi-arabia-2016]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the features of the new platform SihaTech is implementing in the healthcare sector?</h4><p>Healthcare providers globally are moving to online and integrated services. Such growth is due to a shortage in physicians, hospital beds, and expanded healthcare schemes by both the public and private sectors; this shift preempted us to assist the market and regulators to build a gradual shift toward online e-health service. Our solution is a healthcare accessibility and engagement portal, bringing doctors closer to their patients and allowing patients to find the best-fit, most available doctors, book appointments, record results, schedule medication, and follow through on care even after visits until the patient is satisfied with the treatment unless another visit is needed. This is all with a goal of making healthcare services more easily accessible for the Saudi population and the GCC. The new platform will help doctors know and learn more about their patient's symptoms and complaints and communicate with them over the treatment schedule by using our advanced technology. Currently, patients cannot communicate with a doctor without going to the hospital; all other industries have moved electronically except healthcare, which moved more carefully. The engagement portal will allow patients to rate the level of satisfaction from doctors, which is a step forward for quality care; however, for the first time doctors will also be able to rate patients on how well they follow medical treatment and advice. It is a unique, unprecedented method to push both parties to collaborate to achieve better patient health and better healthcare provision.</p><h4>What are the benefits of this new platform?</h4><p>This new platform, called SihaTech, or “your health," is targeted for summer 2016. All doctors will have their own complete profile listing their education, specialties, sub-specialties, and so on. Patients will be able to choose which doctor to contact and can search by location, practice, gender, or just the closest available appointment. Patients want access to doctors with specific specializations, experience, language, or simply same-gender doctors but do not know how to find them. The number-one rule in healthcare is accessibility. The quality of treatment will improve if the right doctor is chosen and the proper information of the patients is provided. Our Kuwait pilot has succeeded greatly and received numerous awards and attention. SihaTech will save patients the hassle of traveling to hospitals hundreds of kilometers away and all the complications that arise from the follow up appointment. At the same time, it will encourage patients to report progress to avoid any complications arising from not visiting the hospitals, reducing unnecessary in-person follow-up appointment, while making sure the patients' progress is followed, too.</p><h4>Do you have any concerns related to safety or privacy issues?</h4><p>We are abiding by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires us to ensure that the data is secured from “reasonably anticipated threats." SihaTech user profiles are secure and saved on the customer's own device under encryption and healthcare provider systems.</p><h4>How do you plan to develop this platform in the future?</h4><p>We have already prepared the online consultations platform, which should enhance the accessibility even further more than booking and messaging by enabling virtual consultation and second opinions regardless of locations, improving treatment compliance through daily monitoring and app reminders, and allowing more than one provider to collaborate in a single treatment plan for better care, reduced tests, and less EMR variance. We currently have a relationship with two large online consultation agencies. As an entrepreneurial business, we need to do something that gives back to society. We are on cloud systems, allowing medical records to be shared and used across all healthcare facilities if needed. Today if a patient requires medical attention abroad or even locally, no one even knows what his or her history is. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be your policy in terms of human resource management, taking into account Saudization requirements?</h4><p>At DHL, our people are our greatest asset and we strive to be the employer of choice; we thus develop our human resources equally, while investing heavily in localization for both male and female Saudi employees. We currently stand at over 40% Saudization and have development programs to retain and grow that YoY; we also invest in every employee and give them world-class training to ensure each one of them is a certified international specialist who will serve every customer to world-renowned standards. Our HR policy is very clear: to be the best employer. Through our carefully structured education and motivational programs, we will maintain the best of our employees and train and develop new recruits that will help us shape the future of the company and lead the standards in the express industry.</p><h4>How do you expect the privatization of the aviation sector to impact DHL's operations?</h4><p>Aviation privatization will help bring Saudi Arabia's aviation industry in line with international norms. By separating the aviation regulator and the airport operator, the government aims to increase productivity and efficiency, improve services within the industry, and, more broadly, diversify its income streams while reducing state expenditure. This would also reduce the burden on the government budget and improve expenditure on infrastructure, which would reflect positively on the economy, local and international investments, and DHL operations in return. Encouraging a competitive market will eventually lead to better services for the end consumer.</p><h4>The GCC will invest $200 billion in rail infrastructure across the GCC. What impact will this have on the sector's development in the region and for logistics?</h4><p>Rail infrastructure will become a critical enabler and driver of sustainable growth for the region. GCC economic growth was primarily enabled by infrastructure investments in ports, as the majority of growth was driven by the export of oil and petrochemicals. As local populations and economies continue to grow, the need for advanced national and regional infrastructure becomes increasingly important to support economic growth. Furthermore, introducing a new transportation mode will create competition that will depend on shippers' needs, amongst other factors. Usually, rail competes with road and marine transportation, and it can become the transportation mode of choice due to its flexibility in terms of types of goods and packaging type. The railway project will definitely open up many opportunities and doors for hybrid modes of transportations to meet the last mile transportation needs of customers, consolidation/deconsolidation services for less than container loads, and logistics in general. It will also have a balancing effect and relieve the pressure on road networks and traffic congestion, particularly at borders and gateways, and all of that will create a better atmosphere for express opportunities. We work with rail operators across the world. Saudi Arabia will not be any different, and we will exploit the rail network in areas where we can add value for our customers.</p><h4>What is DHL's long-term strategy in a key market such as Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>DHL MENA is continuously making great strides to expand its regional aviation network and footprint with greater capabilities through continued investment to enhance service quality and introducing new flights in the region. With a growing demand for consumer goods, cars, raw materials, electronics, machinery, equipment, pharmaceuticals, and oil and gas, DHL is set to soar further in MENA, and Saudi Arabia in particular, in the long run. To date, we have invested over 20 million euros in three new state-of-the-art gateways at King Khalid International Airport, King Fahad International Airport, and King Abdulaziz International Airport, allowing us to bring in more flights from around the world. That is testament to the importance of Saudi Arabia's market for the global logistics and trade industry. In the coming years, this position will only become stronger. Our investment will continue in line with our customers' current and future needs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What changes has the company experienced under your leadership?</h4><p>The company required a great deal of restructuring as it had been neglected for various reasons. It had accumulated losses of SAR59 million and no dividends had been paid since 2006 due to these losses. In the first year we brought in the right talent, identified the right contracts, sold the old fleet, and bought new ones. With God's help and plenty of hard work and support from everyone involved, we were able to turn that around within a year. In 2013 we paid about SAR18 million in dividends, which represents 10% profit per share. After that we had about SAR6 million-7 million in retained earnings. The company was making SAR44 million in terms of revenue but a million or two in net profit from other non-operational income. In 2015 we made about SAR375 million in revenue and about SAR52 million in net profit. The strategy was to diversify our revenue stream, and we stuck to it. You cannot put a goal in place and expect to go in a straight line; there will always be obstacles and challenges. You have to keep your eye on the ball and maneuver until you get there. It is about not giving up and making sure that you persevere and enjoy the benefits of getting the results.</p><h4>Could you describe your strategies in achieving this diversification?</h4><p>In the second year, we implemented the whole restructuring process and got the finances on track. The following year, we acquired Amnco, which was part of the strategy of diversification: growth through acquisitions. Saudi Arabia is still a cash society, and banks require cash transport, cash movement, and feeding ATMs. We identified this as an opportunity from the beginning, but it was not the right time when we first took over management. It became the right time after we had established a firm foundation for the company. It is still part of logistics but a different line. Amnco operates in cash management and the transportation of precious metals and precious stones, such as gold and diamonds. Amnco was only focused on the Saudi market; we signed an agreement with Brinks that allowed it to expand into Saudi Arabia and, in return, allowed Saudi Arabia to open up to the rest of the world. This was a big jump for Amnco, and we now work with Brinks to transport gold and currency from outside Saudi Arabia into the country. Today, Amnco operates in certain parts of the GCC, whereas Mubarrad covers the entire GCC within the transport sector. We used to cover Turkey as well, but because of the current geopolitical situation, we cannot go to places like Turkey, Syria, or Lebanon. We look at companies that have potential at a good price and do the same thing: We restructure them. That is exactly what we have done over the past three years.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans?</h4><p>We try to limit our contracts to certain companies to avoid expanding too fast in terms of the refrigerated transport sector. Now, we pick our clients ourselves so we can give them the best possible service, whereas in the past it was a case of picking up any contract that came along. We are now selective and focused so that we can provide better service. We are always expanding; however, I would rather expand by 10-15% than jump into 40-50%. It is costly to make such a jump, as you have to buy the truck heads and trailers. You then have to bring in qualified drivers and it takes about two months to train them to the company's standard. The expansion is steady but we do not like zigzagging; we like to stick to 10-15%. We are always looking at integrating services to expand. We are looking at the oil and gas sector. We have to approach things carefully, and we need to have the correct level of expertise before we enter any each sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

We are expanding on our training capabilities, including introducing new leadership, hiring more instructors for our programs, and increasing our training staff. All the investments we have made in the last five years and all the relationships we have built with our customers have cemented our reputation. I am proud to say we compete with the largest and most established players in the market, even though NEXUS only came into being in 2010. We are proud of our team, our capabilities, and the vision of our shareholders, who from day one knew that we had to invest in infrastructure and quality. NEXUS saw the changes that were coming and prepared for them. If you can demonstrate to the government that you have the right capabilities and human resources, it will support your company with projects. This is why we have a backlog of government projects for the coming years, not to mention private projects.</p><h4>NEXUS also has plenty of plans around the world. Can you expand on these?</h4><p>Our business in Saudi Arabia has grown and is mature enough. We decided to change our leadership in country to focus on the strategic expansion of our business internationally. We have been in India for the last three years and that has been successful. We are number one in India in terms of capabilities and the quality of our customers and services we provide. We are also in Africa, which has been expanding tremendously, especially in the airline business. In addition, we are in the US through Wyvern Ltd., our safety and quality business headquartered in Yardley, Pennsylvania. We have just established a company in Shanghai to serve mainland China, and we sent one of our most senior team members to Manila to set up a new operations center there to serve the Asian region market and serve as our backup center. We also decided to have a base in Latin America for the middle of 2016. We are looking at Mexico because it is developing with a growing economy where we have opportunities. Also, the number of operators in Mexico is increasing, which is a good sign for business.</p><h4>How would you assess the business environment after one year of low oil prices?</h4><p>The government has provided many opportunities in the market. In December 2015 Saudi Aramco announced it would spend $300 billion over the next 10 years to increase the nationalization of the workforce. It will do so not only within Saudi Aramco, but also in its local supply chain. This will create thousands of jobs in many industries, including the aviation and logistics sectors, which will help the country's economy considerably. It will make sure local service providers deliver to the standards of large corporates and the government, while ensuring that business is driven by locals. Even with falling oil prices, production levels have remained the same so the need for services, logistics, and support has not changed. However, companies have to be smart and think in terms of efficiency to cope with the fall in oil prices. This is where NEXUS excels because of our business model and our efficiency in terms of technology and human resources. It is cost-effective for the government and our corporate clients to use our services, because for a fraction of the cost of other providers you get the full reach of aviation services. The government likes to use local companies, but it wants them to come with an international mentality, knowledge, and know-how. That is why NEXUS is in India, Africa, Europe, the US, and now the Philippines and China soon. My role as chairman is to transfer our capabilities and the platform we have established in Saudi Arabia over to those emerging markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[flight-training]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Saudia Pilot Training Institute was established in 1959, but PSAA only began in 2004. What was the reason behind establishing PSAA?</h4><p>The vision of PSAA was born from a commitment to a brighter future. From its first built training center in 1959 and second flight operations training center built in 1979 to the present facility, which was inaugurated by HRH the late Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz on December 3, 2004, PSAA became a Strategic Business Unit (SBU) of Saudia on April 7, 2010, and provides professional, advanced aviation training to regional and global commercial air carriers, including Saudia. The PSAA privatization process is in the final stage and has resulted in us becoming a subsidiary. We have kept alive the promise to the Kingdom and its people for world-class aviation training and services. This was only made possible with the tireless support of senior officials, executives, and our proficient and skilled manpower.</p><h4>What is the scope of the training PSAA offers?</h4><p>PSAA provides professional, high-quality training to commercial air carriers in compliance with the regulations of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), and international standards. We currently serve Saudia Airlines and its affiliates, including Saudi Private Aviation (SPA), the Royal Fleet SBU, Saudia Cargo, and Saudia Aerospace Engineering Industries (SAEI). We also train other agencies and airlines, including the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF), Flynas, Air Atlanta, Alpha Star, Air Asia, Eaglexpress, and so on. PSAA operates full flight simulators as well as flight training devices covering some of the most widely operated fleet types in the world such as Boeing 747—400, Boeing 777—200, Airbus 330 and A340, Airbus 320—200, and Embraer 170. These are all fitted to industry-leading specifications that permit training on most variants and sub-types. We train pilots, co-pilots, and flight dispatchers. Cabin attendants also take the safety component of their training at PSAA. At some stage of training, some of the aircraft mechanics use the simulator at PSAA for engine run exercises. English language proficiency tests are also authorized to be conducted at PSAA. This has to be endorsed on the pilot license.</p><h4>What is PSAA's strategy and plans to keep up with the rapid growth in the sector?</h4><p>At this point, we are just about matching our customers' demands. However, this will not last for long. In few years' time, we will have to expand our operations again. We will likely double our business capacity to meet the anticipated demand. We need to plan for this now. We have several objectives for 2016. The first is to increase our customer base outside our sister companies. Furthermore, we are implementing a distance-learning program to match the latest learning technologies, scenario-based training, and more. This will require upgrades of our computer-based training infrastructure targeted for completion by the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, by the second quarter of 2017 we will have two new simulators installed. One is the 787-9, and the other is an additional Boeing 777-300 simulator. In the meantime, we have purchased two simulators for basic training; these devices will be utilized for the jet orientation training phase as well as refresher training for new cadet pilots. In summary, PSAA is registered in Jeddah as a limited liability company, LLC, and has the latest flight training equipment including full flight simulators (FFS), flight training devices (FTD), integrated procedure trainers (IPT), computer-based training workstations, cabin emergency evacuation trainers (CEET), and door trainers.</p><h4>What recognitions and awards has PSAA received in the last five years?</h4><p>GACA issued PSAA a Training Center Certificate. Hence, PSAA is empowered to operate an approved training center and can conduct training courses with respect to GACA Part 142 Regulations. We also have GACA authorization to conduct ELP testing and rating, an EASA Certificate for B747-400 full-flight simulator, Airbus certification as an International Training Organization, Boeing Certificate of Compliance, and an ISO 9001:2008 certificate. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Catering to Businesses]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[catering-to-businesses]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Is the company planning to expand overseas or consolidate its market share in the country?</h4><p>Saudi Airlines Catering has one overseas catering unit in Cairo. We are currently obtaining approval from the Egyptian Airport Authority to open a new First &amp; Business Class Lounge to serve the over 100,000 passengers who depart from Cairo International Airport annually. This is the only expansion plan we have outside of Saudi Arabia. All our other expansion activities will be within Saudi Arabia because the market potential is huge. We will continue with our product and service diversification domestically.</p><h4>What projects do you have in the pipeline for your catering business?</h4><p>We have started other business lines to be launched to the market soon. Our major focus now is our Hajj model. We spent three years educating Hajj and Umrah organizers on the concept of frozen meals and getting food to Mecca ready to be cooked in a short period of time to cater to religious pilgrims. They need to be able to provide a huge number of meals, and we produce safe and temperature-controlled meals in large volumes that other caterers and businesses can use. These frozen meals have no additives and a shelf life of up to a year. We have three freezing tunnels in Riyadh with a capacity for 27 million meals. We have the infrastructure in place to increase that number by another 9 million within four months. We currently supply a few companies and the business is growing. It is better and more cost effective because companies do not waste any raw material and do not have to do the preparation work. Saudi Airlines Catering produces and delivers the meals to them and all they need to do is store, reheat, and serve them. This is a huge business. A study done in 2013 found that SAR18 billion ($4.79 billion) worth of food was consumed in Mecca and Medina during the Hajj and Umrah periods. We have done a great deal of work engaging and lobbying on this. We also seek government support for this enterprise to work on a larger scale. Additionally, we supply pre-cut vegetables and recently opened our own smoking plant in Riyadh to produce high-quality smoked food products instead of importing them. We will use the products in our operations and to supply hotels and other businesses in 2016.</p><h4>How is your company dealing with the privatization of the sector?</h4><p>Saudi Airlines Catering was privatized in 2008 and became a publicly listed company in 2012. Our business growth has been solid and consistent with no issues, regardless of our share price in the market. Consistently, we are committed to quality and efficiency to be in a prime position for any emerging market. A license was recently granted to Swissport for ground-handling services. We expect that a license will also be on offer for catering services; nevertheless, we have the major share of Saudi Arabian Airlines' business. The airline is one of our major shareholders, and we are confident it will continue to use our catering services. We are working on our efficiency in all business areas to meet the competitive challenges that are coming.</p><h4>What challenges and opportunities do you see in air travel?</h4><p>There is growth, and it is reflected in our business performance. This will also be augmented with new airlines coming in, as well as additional demand from other airlines. We already cater for almost 50 airlines. Saudi Arabian Airlines also announced some new routes, including Istanbul and the Maldives, starting in 2Q2016. We are ready for this increase in business volume. We have developed our Central Production Unit in Riyadh and have consolidated all our economy-class production to that site. Our existing capacities in Jeddah, Riyadh, Dammam, and Medina are now available for additional catering services to business class, private flights, and other airlines. This keeps us aligned with airline and airport expansions that are launching. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What investment opportunities does the country's national aviation industry offer for national and foreign corporations?</h4><p>The opportunities are plenty and varied. Every one of our civil aviation projects is open for private investment, with various business models that range from strategic partnerships to privatization. There are several major investment opportunities for private-sector investments offered by the national civil aviation industry. Five global consortiums are currently competing to win a contract for the new Taif Airport, based on the build-transfer-operate (BTO) business model. Negotiations with an investor are under way for the construction of Prince Naif Airport in Quassim, also based on the BTO model. Five global corporations are also in competition to operate the new King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah. Swissport, meanwhile, has won the second license to offer ground services across the Kingdom's airports. The Dublin Airports Corporation won a contract to manage and operate the recently finished Terminal 5 at King Khalid International Airport, with an annual capacity of 12 million travelers. Airfreight and in-flight catering will soon be open to global competition. Work is also under way to open up commercial real estate investment in airport properties—based on the “airport city" model—to global competition, and to privatize the Prince Sultan Academy for Aviation Sciences. There is also work under way to privatize the Saudia Private Aviation Company, Saudia Real Estate Development Co. Ltd., and Saudia Medical Services Co. Ltd.</p><h4>What reforms do you intend to introduce to improve the level of service the sector provides to customers?</h4><p>We have many reforms in the pipeline, such as creating a separation between our legislative and oversight roles on the one hand, and the day-to-day running of operational and administrative businesses on the other. The idea here is for the authority to become only a legislative and regulating body, while operations are shifted over to the private sector. We are also improving air transport activities according to global best practices and putting our human resources to the best possible use. We have established a new department for customer protection and issued an executive code that establishes, in meticulous detail, the rights of air travelers, such as their right to receive care should their flights get delayed or canceled, and the right for those with special needs to receive attention onboard, among many others.</p><h4>What measures need to be in place to enable airports across the country to accommodate the targeted 100 million travelers by 2020?</h4><p>The authorities' strategic plan is fully in line with the 2030 Vision, one of the objectives of which is to privatize and enhance transparency for better services provided to all clients of the civil aviation industry. We started aggressive operational, investment, and service programs at every airport, with the aim being to enable airports to maximize their local potential. As for infrastructure, new airports are being built and existing ones are being expanded—a key aspect of the authority's strategy that aims to transform services by privatizing the civil aviation sector, turning every unit into a discrete, growing, and sustainable business that operates on a competitive basis. This will secure the rights of the general public and all other stakeholders and strengthen competition, which will ultimately reflect favorably on the Kingdom's civil aviation industry and overall market.</p><h4>What are your targets for 2016?</h4><p>The authority has established the Saudi Civil Aviation Holding Company, which will be in charge of the privatization process. By the end of 2016, we aim to privatize several airports and strategic units. Work is ongoing on a number of expansion and development projects at various airports all over the Kingdom. The completion deadlines for each of these projects, as set in their contracts, may be years away, but the work set to be competed in 2016 is right on schedule. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Satellites Over Saudi]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[satellites-over-saudi]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the significance of the establishment of ARABSAT?</h4><p>ARABSAT was formed by all Arab countries in the 1970s, with the primary purpose of connecting the Arab world through satellite telecommunications technology and linking these countries culturally. Each country initially contributed financially, with 100% of the shareholders represented by governments of the Arab world. Saudi Arabia has the majority, with over 36%, followed by Kuwait with over 14%, and then Libya, Qatar, and the UAE. The rest of the region makes up the remainder of ownership shares, the minimum of which stands at about 0.5%. The first satellite was launched in 1985, and during the 1990s the concept of providing telecoms service has been changed from only providing basic voice calling to broadcasting, and developed into broadband, internet connectivity, and other forms of data and voice telecommunications. Although there are ample fiber optics systems installed in the ground and the sea across the MENA region, there are also other satellite operators serving the Arab world, but we are the only provider who offers all spectrum of services to every Arab country, including broadcast, telecoms, broadband, and point-to-point. </p><h4>How would you describe ARABSAT's commitment to technology?</h4><p>ARABSAT is the major satellite operator in the region and, in order to keep our competitive marketing position, it is continuously developing its resources and capabilities to follow up with all technical trends and developments in the satellite business industry. That is why all our satellites and control stations are designed and built according to up-to-date technical standards and provide our customers within the region with up-to-date services and coverage in different bands so that they can enjoy all flexibilities that our satellites have. We provide added value and support services to let our customers enjoy full options and various alternatives including special and differential levels of engineering and monitored 24/7 services, geo location services to identify any international or unintentional interference or jamming, full back-up capabilities for our TV broadcasting services at 26 E, diverse orbital positions and coverages including Ka band spots, and hosted payloads for high throughput streams.</p><h4>How do you assess the telecoms sector in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The telecoms sector in Saudi Arabia is well developed and is considered as one of our major markets in terms of mobile and basic telephone services and broadband. Saudi Arabia is one of the most advanced countries in terms of telecommunications services, both from satellites and landline perspectives. Most of the populated portion of the country is covered by basic telecoms services. The government is putting a number of programs in place to serve the more remote areas of the Kingdom. We entered the market by contributing to this provision of satellite services. The sector is mature and well regulated by licenses. Investors can get involved in providing value-added services, but not for basic infrastructure.</p><h4>What are your goals for ARABSAT in 2016?</h4><p>The economic situation is difficult this year; however, we have been in a similar situation before, and the satellite business always continues to grow. We expect growth of between 5% and 6%, but our focus will be more on strategic alliances with partners, customers, and service providers. Many partnership agreements have been signed and the design of two of our three new satellites that are currently under manufacturing are based on such partnerships. Our agreements with these customers and partners are to deliver the technology; however, ARABSAT will launch, manage, and operate the satellites. We might have the opportunity to build another one or two satellites with partners going forward, and we believe that this model of sharing projects is advantageous to us because it reduces risk and funding requirements on our part. It also strengthens our relationships with other parties, and gives us more leverage to expand outside the area we are focusing on in 2016. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the reasons behind the establishment of MachinesTalk and what elements make it different from other companies today?</h4><p>As M2M moves closer to the Internet of Things (IoT), the associated business opportunities, which initially focused on cost and operational performance, have now broadened in scope to encompass five areas: optimizing operational costs, generating new revenue streams, enhancing the customer experience, improving operational performance, and ultimately delivering a differentiated service and competitive advantage for the business. Moreover, what emerges as unique to the IoT as compared to M2M is that IoT applications address both core industry operations and services (vertical) and cross-functional business support objectives (horizontal) in an enterprise. Therefore, we established MachinesTalk in 2015, a Saudi based subsidiary company of NOMD group, to cover this wider concept and scope of IoT, as the first specialized in cutting edge-IoT solutions.</p><h4>What other types of companies or industries could benefit from this technology?</h4><p>In the IoT era, there are endless applications to any industries. We can highlight the top five IoT verticals: connected car, connected healthcare, connected industry, connected cities, and connected home. In MachinesTalk, we are more focused on: connected cars, connected industry and connected buildings, part of connected cities, for three reasons: first, from our experience, these three sectors could cover most of the enterprise's IoT needs in our region. Second, according to market analysis, they are the more dominant sectors in term of technology adaptation. Third, according to Saudi Energy Efficiency Program, these sectors represent 90% of energy consumption in the region.</p><h4>What is your view on the new trend to transform Saudi Arabia into a smart society and how can MachinesTalk contribute?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia's vision 2030 draws the future of Saudi Arabia in transforming our country to a smart society and leverage new technologies to meet our people's expectation. MachinesTalk participated in the IoTX conference held in Dubai in March, 2016. We gave a presentation about IoT readiness in Saudi Arabia and the way to contribute to our 2030 vision. The heart of the government's transformation program is focused on two things: efficiency in government spending and operations and increasing productivity by adopting new technologies. One of the main pillars of the transformation plan is the private sector, and IT is exactly what the private sector needs to transform in Saudi Arabia to achieve the government's goals of increased efficiency and productivity. MachinesTalk contributes in smart cities though our BuildingsTalk platform. This platform helps landlords to transform their buildings into environmentally friendly places and improve the security and power consumption. </p><h4>How will the country develop in the medium term?</h4><p>Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, announced recently Saudi Arabia's vision 2030. We, Saudi citizens, believe in this vision and look forward to executing it. However, the 2/4/6 plan to realize Saudi Arabia's full potential by 2030 is not an easy thing to achieve—doubling GDP, investing $4 trillion into the non-oil economy, and finding jobs for six million additional Saudi nationals is not going to be easy. We, in MachinesTalk, believe that IoT technology is one of the best technologies that shall assist our country in executing Vision 2030. Saudi people are good at adapting new technologies, and we enjoy using them.</p><h4>What specific goals do you have for 2016?</h4><p>We want to introduce new products to the market that no other company in Saudi Arabia has. In 1Q2016, at the IoTx Conference in Dubai, we officially launched our three platforms, CarsTalk, BuildingsTalk, and IndustriesTalk. We are set to sign with multiple partners interested in our platforms. Together, we want to establish a unified go-to market plan and serve the market. Also, we are working with local collages to sponsor IoT projects as part of our effort to spread the IoT technologies and concept in Saudi Arabia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most important measures you have taken since becoming CEO two years ago?</h4><p>King Saud University (KSU), the largest and oldest university in Saudi Arabia, had ambitious targets when it was established, and aims to serve the country. In 2009-2013, I was the director of a tech-transfer office, where we developed many excellent initiatives taking the tech-transfer issue seriously, which would eventually lead KSU to establish RVC. I joined RVC in 2013, and we serve as the investment arm of the university. We help the university to materialize its intellectual property as we facilitate access to state-of-the-art technology for the faculty and students through deals signed with high-tech companies. On the other hand, whatever problem or difficulty we face, we can rely on an army of more than 5,000 faculty members and 50,000 students, 10,000 of which are postgraduates ready to provide technical support or consultancy. </p><h4>Does Riyadh Valley Company only invest in companies based in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>When 2010 started, the focus was only on early-stage local start-ups from Riyadh.  In 2013, RVC hired an international consulting firm based in San Francisco, and we revised our investment strategy. RVC signed deals with companies based in Japan, Sweden, and the US, and when we sit on their boards, communicate and exchange ideas, and offer clear and deep insights into the market, they start seriously considering expanding into the GCC and MENA region. Additionally, we defined the areas we want to invest in; not just ICT but also renewable energies and life and health sciences.  By supporting companies to develop technologies related to renewable energy, we help our country to reduce its dependence on oil.  All this is in accordance with the 10th National Development Plan, which has the main objective of moving toward a knowledge-based and diversified economy.  Finally, we generate new jobs for young Saudis while also making profit.</p><h4>How do you choose the companies to invest in?</h4><p>We have a proactive and well-defined investment process here at RVC. Our business development department does an early screening of companies in the pipeline for potential deals. Normally, we invest in Series A of funding and above, as well as in companies that operate in our three areas of interest. If the investment passes the in-house phase, then we outsource it to a third party for due diligence. If the report is satisfactory, then we call for the investment committee of RVC to intervene. We have a committee under the board to examine investments. This is a board from the private sector and includes some faculty members from KSU to provide a technical and scientific background. We have this committee meet the company, and if it is satisfied then the committee will make a recommendation to the board of RVC. For 2016, our goals are to seal at least four deals, which means we will be reviewing approximately 500 contracts in the pipeline.</p><h4>Once a deal is reached, what contributions can RVC make?</h4><p>We know the market. We are here and have a footprint in the region. For a company operating 13,000km away, it might not know much about it. In many deals we do, partners are independent of the market here. We do deals based on their business plan; we do not force them to modify their business plan to come here. We leverage their presence here in the market. It is a promising market here in the GCC, and the overall MENA region. This region is largely forgotten when it comes to venture capital. We signed a partnership recently with a solar company based in Silicon Valley.  We are now helping it construct a testing area for its solar panels for hot and dusty conditions. In this experiment, we are involving faculty members and experts from KSU. For us, we do business and investment; however, when it comes to experience and technical know-how, we have our army from KSU. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[working-with-determination]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Despite the recent adversities Lebanon has faced, the country stands strong. How is the country coping with both regional instability and its own domestic challenges?</h4><p>It is like we have been vaccinated. We adapt with strength to all the challenges we face and prove our resilience as a nation. We have faced obscure moments in previous years with terrorist attacks, threats to our instability, and gargantuan challenges that we surfed with determination, yet we remain the safest country in the region. Our reality has also been altered by the large refugee influx. We currently host nearly two million refugees, a number that not even Europe, being 500 times bigger than Lebanon, could cope with but that we still allocate with no major problems until now. We know that these are not signals of good health, and this reality is distant to the one we want to live, but they show how strong we are as a nation. In Lebanon, life always goes on; we keep walking. Right now in the height of summertime, there are people heading to the streets. We have festivals, artists coming from all over the world, and enthusiasm is in the air. This is the Lebanese spirit: we celebrate life regardless of the circumstances.</p><h4>The International Donors Conference and the UN Secretary General have called attention on the need to further extend assistance to Lebanon to alleviate the effects of the refugee crisis. How will this assistance strengthen the country's stability?</h4><p>The Lebanese model is that of coexistence and tolerance, and it must be preserved to guarantee the stability in the region. Frankly, it is more about the international community being ready to preserve Lebanon's stability rather than the other way around. We believe assistance should increase due to the short availability of resources the country has been left with to counter the refugee crisis and terrorist threats. We also need more physical assistance to overcome these problems. The Lebanese state is carrying a burden of $15 billion to get through the Syrian refugee crisis, and we need this cost to be shared with the international community. We already have enough problems allocating resources for our own population; we have water and electricity shortages and services have already been split with the refugees. We cannot continue on this path unless the international community intervenes with assistance.</p><h4>You have been an advocate of economic diplomacy to attract the millions of Lebanese living abroad. What is the outcome you expect from this strategy?</h4><p>We have around 40 million Lebanese expatriates residing in 167 countries around the world. We have presence in every single corner of the globe, and this represents a golden opportunity for us. What we are trying to do is to reconnect these expatriates through cultural exchanges, monetary interests, and the Lebanese traditions so they can have a positive impact on the economy. This concept has been going on for years, but we are now materializing it into a state policy. After all, the flows of capital coming from the diaspora have maintained the economy standing during adverse times. We receive around $8 billion annually from the diaspora, so we are trying to build bridges to bumper their contributions to the homeland.</p><h4>With the recent appointment of a new Secretary General to the Arab League and your participation in the Arab Foreign Ministers Summit, how would you assess Lebanon's role in the Arab world today?</h4><p>Lebanon is at the heart of the Arab world, and we have always participated actively in regional integration projects. We had the first democracy in the region, and we are a cherished nation among our Arab brothers. Moreover, we have always stayed away from regional tensions, and we have expressed that it is in out interest to serve as a communication channel to find peaceful and long-term solutions to regional disputes. We want to build bridges that go beyond religious or political differences. We also have large communities of expatriates in the Arab world who are active in building networks and tightening bilateral relations with those countries. We will continue working in this line, and the recent appointment of the new Secretary General to the Arab League has injected fresh blood into a regional block that could be doing so much more for the integration of our nations.</p><h4>French President François Hollande recently came to Lebanon. What was the outcome of his visit, and how is France contributing to strengthen the stabilization of Lebanon?</h4><p>In a certain way, France has always been regarded as a mother nation to Lebanon. It represents our first link to the European continent, and we are an open door to the Arab world to the French. Lebanese people feel a huge affection for France, its people, and its culture. We have always had strong relations and the recent visits of President François Hollande and Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault confirm that it is in the interests of France to maintain Lebanon as its gateway to the Middle East. On the other hand, France is also showing deep interest in contributing to the stability of Lebanon. It is mobilizing international donors to focus their attention here to alleviate the effects of the refugee crisis and to strengthen Lebanon's position against terrorist risks. France has also showed its valuable support to solve our internal political crisis, although making it clear that no foreign power should intervene in our domestic policy. France represents one of our major partners in the international community, and this tight relationship will continue going strong.</p><h4>What do you envision for the near future of Lebanon?</h4><p>We want to build up relations based on values rather than interests. We want to preserve our country's stability by preserving our values. History has shown us that the prevalence of power makes us lose, that we need to build up on a chain of values to maintain solid foreign relations and a good domestic situation. We want Lebanon's message of coexistence and tolerance to prevail and to echo all across the region to bring peace to the Middle East. We are a small player in this chessboard, but we can be a significant one if we put our values beforehand and form bridges between regions, between our Arab neighbors and us, and between the Arab world and Europe. I certainly hope that peace in Syria will come soon and that it will balance things again and improve investments and confidence in a region that has long awaited stability. The creativity and entrepreneurship of the Lebanese will, of course, shape the future of our nation. We will keep providing unique services in the hospitality, tourism, arts, and fashion industries. We will also see the advent of good times for our oil and gas sector, a sleeping giant in economic terms. Furthermore, I hope more people will be interested in visiting Lebanon, investing in it, and becoming attached to this nation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What differentiates Tigo from other telecoms firms in Tanzania?</h4><p>Tigo has gone through an interesting transformation in the last four years, going from a voice offering company to a multi-service, nationwide, and well-established company offering voice, data, mobile money, and B2B services. It is a completely different company compared to what it was a few years ago. Over the last two years, Tigo has been the fastest-growing company and is the second-largest company in the market. We focused on digital inclusion and penetration by offering widely available data services and not only being an internet provider, but also giving our subscribers a partnership in content. We made deals with companies like Facebook, Whatsapp, Youtube, and various smartphone suppliers to enhance the customer's digital experience. It has not just been about giving them access to data but about helping them learn what data is for, helping them have access to content and develop partnerships that create habits. Our network has doubled in size in the last four years. We were strong on the coast and have one of the biggest footprints, which has also contributed to growth. We were also the first big operator to roll out 4G services in 2015, and that has given us a lead in the data positioning and in terms of capturing high-value customers in that segment. Tigo has pioneered various products such as cross-border transactions for mobile money, an app for mobile money, the first company to give profit sharing capabilities to customers that held money in their wallets, for example. These have all helped us gain attention and grow in the market.</p><h4>What further opportunities do you see in Tanzania?</h4><p>There are two main areas. Firstly, data continues to be an interesting opportunity as demand for internet is high and penetration is low. The other area is B2B, which remains under exploited and there is a lot to still be done there. We are investing in a top-of-the-line, tier-three data center in Tanzania. It will be one of the only ones in the country and will help satisfy the demand for corporate and government institutions to back up their data. Besides the data centers, we want to focus on data connectivity, SIP trunking, and a variety of other services and fields. We have been investing an average of $100 million a year to expand our network and our capacity to cater for more subscribers and to improve the quality of the network and the customer experience, as well as invest in new services such as B2B, mobile money, content and data, and platforms. Tanzania is the most sophisticated mobile money market in the world, with four players competing successfully in that field. As competition increases, there is a constant drive and race to be better and offer more from all the players. This is only scratching the surface because as you create more options and services for customers to use their wallets, the results become more and more dynamic. The number of transactions in Tanzania is surpassing that of Kenya; therefore, it is great to be here and be a part of these exciting developments in Tanzania.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges to further growth in the sector here?</h4><p>There are several challenges. Access to basic services like electricity is low. To run a network in rural areas requires generators running on fuel, which is expensive to maintain. Another challenge is high taxes in the telecoms sector. The level of taxation on that sector is one of the highest in Africa; hence, for us to invest there needs to be incentives and proper returns. The higher the taxes, the more difficult it is for us to justify investments to our shareholders. We have a responsibility to our shareholders to give them decent returns. There is also the need for a predictable and stable regulatory environment where we know things will remain the same for years to come, in order to be able to plan long-term investment. We have ongoing conversations and meetings with the authorities and I have good hopes that this administration will support the industry on these issues.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Tigo for 2017?</h4><p>We want to be market leaders in 2017, and we will become that as we are almost achieving this already. TCRA figures show that we are moving in this direction. Other than that, this country offers incredible opportunities. I hope the new administration follows its policy of providing ICT access to the entire population and creating an environment in which investors feel confident in continuing to invest, which means a sensible taxation regime and a regulatory environment that is clear and predictable. With that in place, there are great prospects for the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This company was established in 1983, and today plays an integral role in the development of the country. What have been the key elements of its successful growth over the past few decades?</h4><p>ARASCO is a part of the local supply chain, with the strategic role of supporting food security in a sustainable way. In spite of facing major challenges like severe water scarcity, ARASCO has continued to grow in the food sector for more than 30 years. One primary reason behind our success story is the clear vision of the company. From the beginning, ARASCO defined its role as a producer and facilitator of food production, and thus realized where it should be in the agricultural sector with both its animal and vegetable businesses. One additional factor for our success has been that the company never enters into any activity that does not enhance its position and competitiveness in business. The other thing is that ARASCO activities complement each other. We started as wheat handlers and marketers of agricultural inputs, and then moved to grain storage by constructing and managing silos. Then ARASCO stepped into feed manufacturing, and expanded gradually, reaching a production level of 4 million tons per year in 2015, ranking among the top 10 manufacturers worldwide. Over the years, we have developed five more business units, namely poultry, farm inputs, food ingredients, logistics, and food safety and quality, with each one fulfilling key aspects of the country's food supply chain. Thus, ARASCO has developed competencies in a wide range of business areas to deliver products and services that are essential and integral to the Saudi Arabian food supply chain.</p><h4>In which areas do you assess opportunities for partnerships?</h4><p>We concentrate on achieving mutual benefits, and we never hesitate to develop partnerships. We aim to raise the efficiency and competitiveness of our businesses as well as for others. We do not mind entering into new alliances as long as all parties involved are ready to do so, particularly since we are an attentive partner and are well aware of what we add or what we can get from potential partners. For example, we are wholly and extremely satisfied with our partnership with MEFSCO, after developing strong business relations that hold us together. Everyone is keen to foster the success of this alliance. Our separate partnerships with IDAC and Bahari tell a similar story. We believe real and solid alliances will help to maintain our company's role amid changes in the world, and for that reason we deal with an open mind with every alliance or collaboration that may serve our company business and develop it further.</p><h4>How would you describe the challenges in the Saudi agricultural sector?</h4><p>The agricultural sector is subject to so many obstacles; however, the main challenge is how to convert the agricultural sector into a sustainable one given the sharp water shortage. We believe water is the critical challenge, and from here we have started to innovate products that help lower the consumption of water, as well as encourage the employment of techniques that support this approach. From overall local annual water consumption of 18 billion cubic meters, the share of the Saudi agriculture sector is about 16 billion cubic meters or approximately 90%. Green fodder depletes about 6 billion cubic meters, which means that about 40% of the water consumed is by agriculture. Having no natural water resources, our country depends on surface and desalinated water. It spends about 1.7% of its GDP (around SAR 2.7 trillion in 2012) in this regard. After the completion of our feed expansion of up to 4 million tons, including 3 million of compound feed, we are saving 3 billion cubic meters of water, or about 50% of water of consumed for growing green fodder. We hope to overcome all obstacles to have a sustainable agricultural sector to provide for most of our local needs going forward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[renewing-strengthening]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your perspective on the growth and current role of Ostar Grupo Hotelero in Mexico's tourism sector?</h4><p>We have for some years been renewing and strengthening the chain in several respects, from our facilities and staff training to our image, branding, and particularly service. We have taken the same high commitment approach when seeking to be increasingly creative, proactive, and self-critical. This self-criticism reminds us every day that we do not just sell mattresses; we sell an experience. This same revitalization has allowed us to consolidate the already established hotels and grow at a stable pace. In the last five years we have added almost 800 rooms to our hotel offer with the Ramada Gateway in Orlando, Loreto Bay in Baja California, and Yes Inn in Veracruz. In this same period, we have invested more than MXP250 million and have seen favorable and steady growth in our revenue of 22% in 2015 and 16% in the first four months of 2016. These figures give us an optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year, where fortunately we bring a 6% growth in occupancy compared to last year. All of our employees are aware of the importance of tourism in the development of the national economy. All of this obviously brings great economic benefit and job generation, and it is in the context of the nearly 4 million direct jobs related to tourism that we seek to continue actively participating in and strengthening the tourism competitiveness of our country. We are doing our due part through continuous infrastructure investment and employment.</p><h4>What is the history of Hotel Geneve in Mexico City's hospitality sector?</h4><p>Hotel Geneve is special for Ostar as well as Mexico City and its history, as it is the most legendary hotel of this country and has been a pioneer of the national hospitality industry. This same story as we well as its legacy motivated us to undertake a robust research and refurbishment project to restore its place as a flagship hotel and landmark of Mexico City that it held for many years. For the hotel's hundredth anniversary in 2007, we wanted to give it a total renovation connected to its classic style while also integrating a fresh new 'Hotel Museum' concept. This is a first-of-its-kind project in Mexico and has delighted our guests, making their stay an experience wherein every corner, hallway, or column gives a permanent and fascinating exhibition with anecdotes. We wanted to refresh the concept that Hotel Geneve has been a tireless innovator in the tourism industry from its inception. It was the first hotel to receive women traveling alone. It was also the first in the country to offer taxi service, dry cleaning, a haute cuisine restaurant, a travel agency, elevators, tennis courts, hairdressers, and a telephone and a bathroom in each room. With a fledgling tourism industry in our country, it was the most modern and elegant hotel featuring a European hotel management system, which was a novel concept in Mexico that was not known. During the 1960s and 1980s, the hotel was falling behind, but after the restoration it is more beautiful and alive now than ever before and has again become an icon of national tourism as the most legendary hotel in the country. It recently received the 2014 Star Diamond Award from American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, the Three Diamond Award from the American Automobile Association, the Golden Keys concierge to the Hotel Geneve awarded by the Union Internationale des Concierges d'Hotels Les Clef's Ohr (UICH), and several others. We are constantly reinventing ourselves, seeking to leverage our past for the benefit of our future direction by combining the tradition of the hotel's corners with the modernity of its time. </p><h4>How do you see the development of the tourism industry in Mexico?</h4><p>Tourism in Mexico is going well; the goals are much higher but doing better overall. We overtook Russia to reenter the list of the top 10 countries most visited countries in the world. Mexico still ranks 17th in terms of economic benefit; therefore, we can encourage better schemes to seek higher incomes. Tourism in our country is no longer just sunny beaches; the offer has grown exponentially to attract a wide variety of travelers, ranging from cultural, colonial, and adventure tourism to religious, rural, archaeological, and film tourism, as well as romance and cuisine tourism, retirement, medical, and photo tourism, conventions, and sports. After a 20-year absence from Mexico City, Formula One provides almost 18,000 direct jobs each year and will have an economic impact of more than $2 billion over the next five years. In 2015, we received 32 million international visitors, a number that has been increasing in the last few years. Reaching 50 million annual arrivals is not a far-fetched medium-term goal; however, we must focus heavily also on the local economy, accounting for more than 80% of our sector. There are more than 180 million local travelers who travel only once a year on average. Imagine how the economic benefit could change if this figure increases to two trips per year. It is not a secret that tourism is an important source of income for our country, which in 2015 generated about USD17 billion. It is certainly an important development income tool that represents 9% of the GDP, a figure that can still be higher. In countries such as Spain, this figure reaches up to 12-13%; hence, the importance of this industry and of continuing to put all of our efforts into it.</p><h4>What is the importance of the acquisition of the Ramada Gateway Hotel in Orlando within the international expansion of the group?</h4><p>In the last five years, the Ramada Gateway Hotel has had an increase in its occupancy ranging from 7% to 12% annually. Taking into account that it is a hotel with 500 rooms, it significantly contributes to the results of Ostar and has also diversified the offering of the company in the domestic and international markets. Orlando has also reached new records as a tourism destination, receiving 66.1 million visitors in 2015 and consolidating it as the busiest US enclave. It is worth mentioning that the number of tourists doubled in the last 20 years.</p><h4>What is the growth strategy of Ostar Grupo Hotelero for the next few years?</h4><p>We currently have about 2,000 rooms in our different destinations, with more than 1,100 employees and around 900,000 guests a year. Our dynamic growth unfolds through finding attractive investment opportunities, identifying synergies with Grupo Carso, and our expansion, which goes hand in hand with Carso Properties. Carso Properties is a holding to which we belong that performs major mixed-use real estate developments throughout the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Siemens contributed to Mexican economic growth over the past century?</h4><p>We have been in Mexico for 122 years, and we have been a long-term partner to Mexico in its development. Mexico is an important part of Siemens as a whole; we are one of 30 what we call lead countries around the world, and we are one of the few where there is a tremendous focus on the fact that there is so much growth potential. The economy of the world is currently rather tepid in many places; however, Mexico continues to be an attractive area for growth. Most of that is based on all the reforms and how they are helping to shape and grow the economy. Our first project in Mexico was to build power plants to power the lighting on Reforma Avenue, which is an iconic project. We have built many power plants, we had the first tomography here, the first x-ray, and we have had a lot of firsts in the many years that we have been in Mexico. Mexico is important to Siemens, as we really are growing; in 2015, we grew our new orders by 41%, which is a pretty tremendous accomplishment in comparison to other parts of the world. We received a special award in Siemens for being the best region in the world, which was a nice acknowledgement of the importance of the country. There are so many growth opportunities, but because of our portfolio, many are in the general energy sector; primarily things like power generation, transmission, and distribution, and even oil and gas. Even though oil prices are down, there is still much interest in Mexico as an oil producing economy, especially with the opening of the sector to private companies. All of this is of key interest to us and we have seen particular vertical markets such as automotive and food and beverage, particularly beer, as Mexico is the 6th producer of beer in the world. We have particular vertical markets, which are important in Mexico for our type of industrial automation. We also see growing renewables and mobility as areas of interest.</p><h4>How will energy reform affect Siemens in Mexico?</h4><p>The country plans to more than double its power generation. Besides power generation, the authorities are also converting a lot of the older heavy fuel oil plants into gas or renewables. It is important to look at the renewables side of the equation, as there is now a transition law that dictates how much clean energy needs to be a part of the mix of generation in Mexico. All of that is obviously creating a lot of investment opportunities. On top of this, with all of the growth there is also the need for a reduction in prices and an open and free market for generators; therefore, there is a need to enhance the grid so that the best price for power can be delivered where and when it is needed. There is an entire plan called Prodesen, which lays out the plans for the next 15 years and the different investments that are going to be made in the generation and distribution of electricity. For example, there will soon be the first High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) project that will come up for Mexico. This is the super highway of electricity and it creates few losses over long distances. These are the new kinds of technologies and designs Mexico is now bringing into the market, which are a result of the energy reform. This is on the electricity side, which is an active area, not just for CFE but also for private investors, including self-generators as well as people who want to sell into the market. It will take a number of years to develop a strong and larger private sector. Meanwhile CFE is being broken into separate generating companies so the country can create an open market even with a major player. On the oil and gas side, it has been a little more challenging because they want to open up Pemex to private investment, and people have to bid on fields, which has been affected by the falling price of oil; this has been a challenge in terms of speed and momentum of the change. Pemex has many things it needs to work on to develop a strategy, but this presents major opportunities for the country. They had a successful round one, so things are continuing to move forward; however, the amount of investment will be a little slower due to the price of oil, which is only natural. We have seen energy reforms all over the world, and putting into context the speed of the energy reform implementation, it has been a worldwide success story in terms of all of the legislation that had to be changed and approved; we are already seeing projects being achieved and accomplished. This is something worth highlighting internationally.</p><h4>Was the timing was right for the energy reforms during such low oil prices?</h4><p>Mexico is blessed that it has had this reform come now. Without private companies being able to come in and participate with everything from technology to financing, then all of this would be the burden of the government. Instead, there is an ability to expand what is being done in the oil and gas sector because private investors can come in and more companies into the game. Without that, it would be a much more difficult situation.</p><h4>A lot of transportation projects are taking a long time to come to fruition. What is your perception of this situation?</h4><p>There is a lot being done, but more needs to take place. What needs to happen is a more comprehensive plan, especially for Mexico City, around public transportation and particularly intelligent traffic systems that go along with that. This would give the ability to have more capacity in more locations, things such as metros and rapid bus transport. We have installed intelligent traffic systems in many cities, which can increase efficacy by more than 20%. It sounds simple, but it is true. There are many ways to take the existing infrastructure and enhance it, but there needs to be a long range plan on urban development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Safran contributed to the growth and development of the aerospace sector in Mexico over the last 20 years?</h4><p>Our contribution is multifaceted and includes direct investment, training, technology transfer, creating jobs, and ensuring that people working for us have good jobs that challenge and satisfy them. We now have 10 sites with production, MRO, and engineering operations on each. We will open two new sites in February 2017, and we have announced a new facility that we will be building as well. We also make an important contribution in terms of training by contributing to UNAQ in Queretaro, where we provide our CFM56 engine model as well as landing gears. This allows us to attract qualified people to work at plants in Queretaro after graduating. We also have close cooperation with the Lycee Francais in Mexico with a dual program that involves study at the Lycee and also on-site experience at our plants in Queretaro. We work closely with the Education Ministry in Mexico to send people to our plants in France, and when it comes back we welcome it at our facilities. </p><h4>What makes Mexico attractive for foreign investors?</h4><p>The geographic position is a key factor. Mexico is the perfect base for supplying the North American market. One of our main clients is Boeing, which shows how being here is advantageous for business. In Queretaro we produce landing gears, and we also have engine and MRO facilities. Secondly, Mexico has an excellent and skilled workforce with a strong industrial structure and a very big automotive and aerospace base. We also do electrical wiring for many companies around the world, and we have 4,300 people working in our Chihuahua facility alone, which is currently the most important wiring facility in the world. This is a place where companies can create sophisticated high technology products for the aerospace industry at good rates, and it is well positioned to export around the world, especially to the North American market. Our work force is itself part of the innovation process, as innovation should not be limited to just the top tier of engineers and researchers. Another point is the close cooperation we have with the federal and local governments. Whenever we plan to invest somewhere, Mexico enters into competition with other countries like Malaysia or China. One of the factors that enables Mexico to win those investments is the close cooperation with the federal and local authorities, which ensures support for factors like where we can build our facilities, concessions, training people, taxes and tariffs, and utility costs.</p><h4>Which of your three core business segments is most important in Mexico?</h4><p>Our three core business segments are aerospace, defense, and security. We have a strong presence in aerospace and security, and we want to further develop our presence in the defense sector as well. We have plants in Chihuahua and Queretaro, and in Mexico City we also have our Turbomeca helicopter facility, which produces 600 engines each year. In security, our company Morpho has a strong presence in Mexico as well as the region. I see growth possibilities in all of our core businesses.</p><h4>How much of your business in Mexico is focused on Latin America rather than the US?</h4><p>Mexico is also well located to reach the Latin American market. In Chihuahua, we do electrical wiring for many companies, and not just North American companies. We do the wiring for the Boeing 737 and also for the Airbus 380s, but we also do wiring for Embraer and other Latin American companies. At our Safran MBD facilities in Queretaro, we do MRO for Latin American companies as well. We are obviously close to the North American market, but we are also interested and active in developing our links with the Latin American market. Mexico is our third largest operation in terms of employment after France and the US. Considering that we are in 16 countries around the world, Mexico is an important strategic platform for us and I am optimistic about growth here. We are growing fast and today we are number one in terms of employment in the aeronautics industry in Mexico.</p><h4>How important is R&amp;D and innovation for Safran?</h4><p>This is a crucial issue and the most important part of our job. At Safran and other similar aerospace companies, we are building the future in 10 sectors, which requires constant work. We dedicate 12% of our turnover to R&amp;D, which is huge in this industry, but this is what will enable us to be the best in the world in all of the sectors in which we operate. In France, we are the number-two company in terms of patent registrations, and we are considered one of the hundred-most innovative groups in the world in terms of patents. Innovation is at the core of our business and in terms of what our group is able to do, and it is at the core of our vision for the future. This same innovation is happening here and adding know-how and technology to the Mexican industry. In Chihuahua, we have internal services with around 300 engineers and we are working on design and innovation for all possible companies. When we plan to build a facility in Queretaro, it will be the core of the business for us for the coming years. After establishing our partnership with GE in the 1970s, we made the most sought-after engine in the world; a plane with this motor takes off every two seconds worldwide. We are preparing the new generation now called Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion (LEAP). We are fabricating the first models for the 737s, all of which have this motor. Airbus 320s have a choice, but 50% of the airlines take our motors. This motor will also power the new Chinese plane. We have Leap 1, Leap 2, and Leap 3, and these new motors already have 10,400 orders. That is unprecedented in the history of aeronautics, and this puts a lot of pressure on us, which is why we are building a third facility in Queretaro. By 2020, we want to have produced 2,000 motors, and we have already started building the facility. We are bringing new technology into Mexico to face the new challenges that constantly arise in the aeronautics industry. The motor reduces emissions and fuel consumption by 50%, and in addition it is a much quieter engine. This engine will push Mexico to the forefront of aeronautics for the coming 20-30 years.</p><h4>Is Mexico is doing enough to ensure that it has the qualified people to be able to deal with this kind of high technology?</h4><p>We have been working for a year to prepare people to work in our facility, which we have done in close cooperation with the federal and state authorities. We will be prepared once production gets online. This is the only way to continue attracting investors to come to Mexico, especially in a sector like this. With government support and the high skill level of the local workforce, companies and workers will continue wanting to come here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you first start Experiencias Xcaret?</h4><p>I came on a vacation to Cancún and visited Xcaret, which at that time was just a little area in the woods owned by a friend of mine. It was so beautiful that I bought it and decided to build a public park. That was 30 years ago. Of course, no one knew what kind of park it was going to be. I had seen a similar project in Hawaii many years ago, where there was a park on Polynesian culture, and had the idea to do the same with Mexican culture. The difference with this park is that this land has many natural attributes. Here, we are next to the ocean. Underground rivers meet the ocean and it has a jungle, animals, and flowers; it is a complete piece of land. It was easier to develop a concept to show this part of Mexico to the world, this being the capital of tourism in Mexico. Five years later, we built our second park, Xel-Há, and in 2009 we opened Xplor. Three years ago, we opened Xoximilco and our Xenotes tour. Now, we are preparing to open Xenses. All our parks here are natural sites and this will be the first park that is completely different. I am proud to say that I have never seen anything like it anywhere else in the world.</p><h4>Who are your target visitors for Xcaret?</h4><p>Perhaps 20% of the visitors of Xcaret are repeat visitors. From the beginning, I was focused on tourists, foreign and domestic. When we started, we were showing off Mexico through nature. It was a challenge but we were successful. When we added the cultural element, it was a major change in the park, which made it even more successful. With this idea of presenting Mexican culture to the world, we changed our logo to say “Xcaret: Mexico." We were a small embassy of our country in every way. We had Mexican restaurants, Mexican food, and all the traditions of Mexico, especially this part of Mexico. That has been our focus and we have been growing it well. An important element is that we are continuously growing and changing the park. It has been 25 years and still the park is not finished. We always have around 500 employees working on construction. For example, we recently opened a new aviary with around 5,000 birds.</p><h4>Xel-Há is your second oldest park. Why did you decide to expand to multiple parks?</h4><p>After we started Xcaret, we received the concession for Xel-Há. It was the only attraction the state had when Cancún opened. It is an underground river and cave. You can snorkel and see fish in their habitat. Xel-Há was successful and was run by the government. When Xcaret started to grow we did a great job in marketing and took many customers away from Xel-Há. Xel-Há was almost abandoned; it had fallen from around 700,000 visitors per year to around 200,000. We took over the concession and invested a great deal of money and effort into improving it. We realized our real business was to make visitors happy and entertain the tourists who came here. We decided to open our third park, Xplor, on the same space as Xcaret. It was a success because there were many small parks; one had zip lines, one had four-wheelers, one had canoes and kayaks, and we put all these concepts into one park. It was four parks in one ticket. It was successful, mainly because all the distribution through the park is underground. We have beautiful underground caves and rivers. You can zip line into the water and it is an integration of sports with the land, the water, and nature.</p><h4>What role have you played in the economic development of Quintana Roo?</h4><p>Since the beginning, my belief is that if I can make visitors stay one more day, I will be satisfied and proud. Today, studies say 20% of the visitors who come to Quintana Roo come because of our parks. It is mainly to visit Xcaret, as well as some of our other parks. That is the result of our job and we work to make those numbers higher and give people more reasons to visit our state. If you want to visit the whole park, you need two days. Everyone has different interests and we have many things such that there is something for everyone.</p><h4>How can economic development work side-by-side with environmental protection in a place like this?</h4><p>If it is not done at the same time, you will not survive. There are two reasons to protect the environment. This is our future: if you destroy it, you will not have a future. Secondly, we have laws here that need to be enforced. The world knows who are doing this right and who are doing it wrong, and you immediately see the places doing it wrong and they start losing customers. You have to be ahead of everyone in applying conservation, sustainability, and all the rules for our future welfare. In developing the park, we realized that if we had animals, we needed programs to protect the animals. We started a program to protect turtles. We have introduced 10 million turtles to the ocean over the last 30 years. The whole population of macaws in Mexico is about 250 macaws in the wild. In the park, we have around 1,000 of them and after many years of paperwork, we got permits to start introducing them into the wild. In the last two years, we have introduced almost 180. We have already grown the population of macaws here by 55%. We are proud of these things. It is not additional work; it is just noticing what is happening and making a difference. </p><h4>What is the concept of your newest park Xenses?</h4><p>With everything new that we do, we try to make it complementary; we do not sabotage our own customers. We try to do things we have not done before. With Xenses, we try to get people to realize the beauty and power of their minds. One of the activities, for example, is walking through a dark tunnel, barefoot, for 130 yards. You will go through a desert, an ocean, the jungle, a suspended bridge, through a forest, uphill, downhill, into a cave. All of this will involve touching, listening, smelling, and imaging these ecosystems—in the dark. You will understand the power of your mind imagining all these without sight. One of the mottos of this park is: “When was the last time you did something for the first time?" All of the things in this park are things you have not done before. We are playing with things you never imagined doing, and that is the fun part. We want to make visitors smile.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was best day founded?</h4><p>In 1984, the founder of the group Fernando Garcia Zalvidea, after graduating wanted to take a few months off working in Cancun. While working at a marina, he met a tourist couple who wanted a guide to take them to some ruins. He agreed and brought them in his own car with a cooler and some drinks and snorkeling gear. When they came back they said to Fernando that this has been the best day of their stay. After that Fernando started a small private tour operation, which grew into a travel agency.</p><h4>When did you first join the company and how has it grown over the past two decades?</h4><p>I came into the picture as the systems manager when we were applying innovative technology. Very early in 1991, we were the first ones to start touch screen operations in Mexico. We put terminals at the airport so that when people were getting to the destination they could look up a hotel in the same way we look up these things today. That was the first application our group launched, selling services and enabling hotel reservations with technology. In 1994, we heard about the internet and thought we could try to sell hotel nights through the internet. We had to go to the University of California to get a prototype of the software that encrypted the information so the transaction was secure. When we went to the banks, they said we were crazy, but eventually we found a partner and we started reservations over the internet, the first in the world. Since then we have been adding services to our portfolio that are commonly found today on other website operators, but at the time we were pioneers. For example, we were the first to have rates in pesos, we were the first to allow payment in installments, we were the first to incorporate two different ways of payment. In 2010 we purchased Hotel DO; the original name was Hotels Discounts Online so it was reduced to Hotel DO, so we purchased that operation in Argentina and we had already operations in Brazil and Chile and Colombia.</p><h4>What would you say are the biggest things that have changed in the tourism sector since you started Best Day?</h4><p>We have a larger hotel offering and we have more destinations that are positioning themselves in the market. When we started the charter operators were the kings, nowadays with technology everyone has the possibility to make their own plans and do it on a smart phone and last minute and it is completely different. The channels that you are now using to promote your product to the market are completely different. The technology revolution has sharpened the market and I think this is key to the success of Best Day.</p><h4>With the growth in size and technology, has Best Day lost its personal touch and local expertise?</h4><p>No, that is precisely something that we work hard to keep. Alongside the kiosks and the online agency, we have provided the opportunity for people to have an agent that has local knowledge to recommend the best option for the clients face to face and give that quality of service that clients are expecting. We were the first ones to have Mexicans selling products to Mexicans so they know the local holidays, what the economy is like in Mexico, what are mayor issues in this destination, or where the best places are. The same thing happens in Argentina; we have the Argentinians being served by the Argentinians, the same in Brazil, the same in Colombia; therefore, we are trying to keep up in different channels the experience of the personalized service and giving the customer the opportunity to get in touch with a person who will provide that.</p><h4>What portion of the business now is directed toward Mexicans who want to travel within Mexico?</h4><p>In 2015, we took care of close to 4 million people. Out of those 4 million people, 70% were Mexicans and 30% international, including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Dominican Republic, and the rest of Latin America. We have a five year plan, we want that to be the opposite, we want to keep Mexico to be the largest component of our market share but we want 30-35% in the rest of Latin America 65-70%. In 2014, we were 80-20 and now we are 30-70, so we are heading the right way.</p><h4>What are your upcoming expansion plans?</h4><p>We have four different branches of our business so we are multi-country, multi-channel, multi-currencies, “multi-problems" (joking), and what we are really trying to implement in this is a particular strategy on each branch to position each particular branch in the different countries to become a big player in each country and then turn it around with the personal touch I was mentioning. Now we are expanding to the Dominican Republic, Puerto Vallarta, and Los Cabos. For next year, we are planning to open in Cuba and probably Aruba and we have an operation that started in Orlando last year. In Cancun Mayan Riviera in 2015, we took care of close to 900,000 people that we received, transport from the airport to the hotels, and coming back and offering optional activities so plans are to duplicate those numbers by opening all those operations. Then we have BestDay.com in the entire region, which is our B to C channel and it has a large operation in Mexico and grown tremendously in Argentina and it is growing well in Brazil and last year we started with a big investment in Colombia to develop that market. We are also expanding in the Dominican Republic and we have plans for Peru, Chile, and Uruguay in the coming years and those are part of specific goals and through that five year plan to be bigger in those markets and grow ourselves and our market share in those markets to turn around the 30-70 to the other way around. That is the strategy to become the largest B2C online travel agency in the region. The goal is to keep doing what we are doing and become number one provider of Latin American product to the world. In Europe we have a very good opportunity for large tour operators that have an interest in Latin America but do not have the product we have, so we are providing the product to those tour operators so that they can offer a hotel in Latin America, including Mexico. The last area is something that we were pioneers in doing, which is BD Travel Solution, which in turn is our brand that goes from B2B2C, whereby we provide our platform and technology so that companies like hotels, airlines, tourism organizations, or any travel related company can have their own websites with all of our products in combination with their products so that they can create packages that can be offered to the public as the end consumer.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the fluctuating global economy, how is the global sector poised to change, and what countries are you considering as potential new markets?</h4><p>Dr. M. Sani Sener Southeast Asia and Africa will have the highest growing air travel market. According to the IATA forecasts, the Asia-Pacific region will see an extra 1.8 billion annual passengers by 2034. Its annual average growth rate, 4.9%, will be the joint-highest with the Middle East region. Meanwhile, Africa is poised to grow by 4.7%. The North American region will grow by 3.3%, which is higher than Europe. The US will remain the largest air passenger market until around 2030, when it will drop to number two behind China. Currently, the ninth largest market, India, will see a total of 367 million passengers by 2034, an extra 266 million annual passengers compared to today. It will overtake the UK to become the third-largest market around 2031. Indonesia will enter the top 10 around 2020 and attain sixth place by 2029. By 2034, it will be a market of 270 million passengers. The UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia will all enjoy strong growth of 5.6%, 4.8%, and 4.6%, respectively. The Philippines has high potential for us. We are tendering for the privatization of five regional airports in the Philippines and are closely following the Manila NAIA airport project. We also continuously monitor African countries. We believe that Africa has great opportunities in terms of market growth. Morocco, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Tanzania are African countries with significant potential.</p><h4>With more passengers, the profile of the typical air passenger is broadening. What services will airports require in the future and how is TAV preparing itself?</h4><p>Flight information systems will be integrated with mobile devices. At TAV, we have an online intelligent communication platform. Our passengers can track their departure time and gates directly from their smartphones. TAV is one of the pioneers of this technology, spearheading innovation in the field. TAV Information Technologies is one of our most prominent subsidiaries. We invest in R&amp;D and export innovation. Istanbul Atatürk Airport is our hub to test new technologies and, as the third busiest airport in Europe, a great place to evaluate the results. We continuously share our experiences with other operators and airport authorities all over the world. I always say our motto is “connectivity is productivity." In the near future, this concept will be requirement for all airports. With higher numbers of passengers, security systems should be fully automated and enabled for rapid processing, and all should have a biometric security scan. Passport queues may constitute a problem for passengers and operators. In the near future, passengers will be recognized by fingerprints and retina, thus eliminating queues. We have been investing in such new technologies, and as soon as the Interior Ministry of Turkey and security commissions grant permission, we can implement them at our airports immediately. Long-standing hubs and airports often lack flexibility for expansion due to available space as cities grow in the surrounding area. For this reason, runway capacity will become a bottleneck, constraining the capacity and leading to long delays. In the future, with the introduction and implementation of advanced GPS and radar systems, takeoff and landing queues will be reduced significantly, decreasing the distance required between the airplanes while increasing the airport capacity. Due to the prevalence of online shopping, we have to redefine our retail strategies. Much has changed. Many of the standard duty free products can now be purchased online. The important thing is that retail operators should sell attractive and uncommon products at airports. Our creative team conducts surveys among millions of passengers in order to find desirable products. At airports the importance of lounges is increasing every year. Since with lounges, airlines increment their offerings to the passengers; therefore, the lounge services need to be more sophisticated than providing a sofa to rest on. Passengers demand good WiFi connection, decent food and beverage offerings, and soothing and comforting decoration so that they can unwind, making their journey more pleasant. Soon, we will witness fierce competition among the lounge operators to offer the best product.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2016?</h4><p>In 2016, we target the expansion of operations like we did in 2015. Despite the uncertainties in the global economy and geopolitical instabilities in our surrounding geography, TAV Airports achieved an increase in its annual turnover by 10% to ‚¬1.079 billion. In 2016, we expect 7-9% growth in our revenues and 10-12% in our net profit growth. We aim to continue the expansion of our airport portfolio. We are interested in the Philippines, India, Tanzania, Saudi Arabia, and Serbia, among many others. In the long term, our aim is to increase the proportion of non-aeronautical income to total income to 70%. In 2015 it was 54%. Meanwhile, TAV Construction maintained its position of first in the Engineering News Record (ENR) list in the field of airport construction in 2015. We expect to maintain our success in 2016. </p><h4>What is the significance of the Gulf region in TAV Construction's global strategy and what projects has the company been involved with in the region?</h4><p><strong>Ümit Kazak</strong> The GCC region has been the primary venue of TAV Construction's expansion and rapid growth. The value of work undertaken so far has reached $12.5 billion. Before citing numbers, it is important to acknowledge that our goal has been to establish our brand synonymous with airports and to become a preferred contractor for airports. Having significant presence on five airport projects of the six capitals of the GCC, we believe that this is an important endorsement for the quality of our work and we are thankful for all authorities for this trust. The GCC region is really the backbone of our operation. In 2003, we opened our offices in Dubai to monitor airport developments in the region. Following our successful bid to build Terminal Building 3 of the Cairo International Airport, we undertook our first major GCC contract in Qatar, the Passenger Terminal Complex of the New Doha International Airport. This project was a great opportunity to display our capabilities. In 2009, we won the Airside &amp; Landside Infrastructure Works package, referred to as MC-1, of the Muscat International Airport in Oman. The year 2012 was glorious year in which made a great entrance into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's construction market with two awards: the Saudi Airlines' MRO Facility at the Jeddah King Abdulaziz International Airport and the Expansion of the Medina Prince Mohammed International Airport. The region's first full-fledge public-private partnership (PPP) project, the Medina PMIA project, was successfully completed and is now operating. Following this successful entry, we won the design and build project tender for Terminal 5 at the King Khalid International Airport in the capital, Riyadh, where construction is complete and is currently at hand-over stage. At the moment, we have four live sites in the region: the multi-billion Midfield Terminal Complex of the Abu Dhabi International Airport in the UAE, the Saudi Airlines MRO Facility in Jeddah, the Phase 2 of the MC-1 of Muscat International Airport, and the recently won Bahrain International Airport Modernization Program.</p><h4>What impact has the privatization process of national airports had on the sector?</h4><p><strong>Cumhur Kaur</strong> Improving airport infrastructure, handling higher levels of air traffic, responding to expanded international trade, and providing better air traffic control all require efficient management. Thus, it is necessary to provide more capital investment to airports through privatization. The benefits of private-sector involvement are not only limited to investments. The flexible nature of private-operation companies brings the advantage of efficient operations, customer-oriented services improvement, and higher level of services for all stakeholders involved. In Saudi Arabia, TAV Construction was among the team that realized the first public-private partnership (PPP) airport development project in the region, which has been a success story, an exemplary project for future PPP infrastructure projects for the region.</p><h4>What benefits come from being a world leader in airport construction, with a total contract value of $18.3 billion?</h4><p><strong>Ümit Kazak</strong> TAV Construction is an expert in airport construction. Born as the contracting arm of the group, the company has accumulated invaluable experience, having a successful track record in all types of airport construction projects from terminals to runways. This specialization, with the extensive experience gained over the last 19 years, brings the company its competitive edge. The Middle East is set to become one of the fastest-growing markets in the region and it is anticipated by Boeing and Airbus that over 2,000 aircraft will be needed over the next 20 years. Aircraft manufacturers and airlines are capable of sustaining a certain level of supply in the face of growing demand, but airports will be challenged to keep up and expand, reconfigure, and renovate fast enough. In order to assure accurate planning and proper management, airport privatization seems like a feasible alternative.</p><h4>TAV Construction was recently awarded for its Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz Airport Project. What led to this success of this project?</h4><p><strong>Cumhur Kaur</strong> Established through the BTO model, the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz International Airport is the first airport privatization project in Saudi Arabia and the first ever PPP in the Gulf Region in the aviation industry. Medina Airport is also the first LEED Gold certified airport by USGBC in the Middle East and North Africa region and the first LEED Gold terminal building outside US. The airport received the Airport Project of the Year in ENR's 2015 Global Best Projects Awards. We have been awarded this title as a result of fulfilling important criteria, such as international teamwork, occupational health and safety, design functionality and quality, innovation, and contribution to the sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Forsan Ceramics's performance been so far?</h4><p>I have been in the ceramics business all my life. We have invested about $186 million (SAR700 million) in the company, and have a robust management agreement and local Saudi partners. We expect 2016 will be a full production year and we will do well because we are already established in the international market. Forsan Ceramics started operations in 4Q2015. We started construction about two and a half years ago and now operate out of three factories. We have one sanitary ware factory that started operations in January 2015, and we also have a tile factory producing monoporosa tiles that started operating in April 2015 and produces 12 million sqm of tiles per year. We also have a porcelain factory that manufactures polished floor tile technical ceramics, and that produces 8 million sqm each year. In 2016, that factory will be in full operation with production of 20 million sqm, representing 10% of the Saudi market. In the sanitary ware segment we will be producing 1.2 million units, and this represents 10% or more of the domestic market.</p><h4>What are the advantages for Forsan Ceramics of being based in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The first advantage is that we have a large and growing market here. Second, we have natural gas available at a reasonable price. Third, we have access to manpower. The market here is 30 million and the population of Saudi Arabia is increasing by 1-1.2 million people per year. Around 500,000 apartments are being constructed per year just to keep up with that growing demand, and on top of that there is great demand for rebuilding and maintenance work on existing properties. This means Saudi Arabia will continue to be a major importer and consumer of ceramics tiles and sanitary ware. You can see there are many projects planned in the government's budget, and these will have to go ahead as they are needed. In any case, there are numerous public projects currently under way, and added to this are all the private sector projects. There is a demand for housing, and as long as there is construction going on there will be a requirement for ceramic tiles and sanitary ware too.</p><h4>What are the main challenges facing Saudi Arabia's industrial sector, and how are they being addressed?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is trying to implement Saudization and industrialization policies, and it is a young country. It requires time to cope with and digest this strategy, and in order to establish a robust industrial tradition the country has to stabilize. The adoption of Saudization policies will definitely go ahead; however, this will take time. The other challenge is to liberalize the economy more. At the moment, we have excess regulation and state interference in the economy. To be on the safe side, Saudi Arabia is trying to adopt the most stringent standards, for example in terms of safety, security, and equipment. Saudi Arabia wants to be a regional leader in terms of standards, but I believe this is a somewhat complicated matter for industrialists. By comparison, industry in the UAE is not as heavily regulated as it is here. Even Europe is not regulating the ceramic factories as strictly as here. The government is definitely working to attract more industries, however, and to diversify the economy away from reliance solely on oil revenue.</p><h4>Looking at 2016, do you have any specific goals or expectations for Forsan Ceramics?</h4><p>In 2016 our goal is to produce at full capacity and to sell all of our production. We also want to stabilize our staffing and consolidate our CSR program. It is important for us to create a team of people and create a workforce that is loyal, dedicated, and committed to this company. We want to satisfy our clients to create a good base so that they respect us and appreciate our products and services. If this year is as full and profitable year as expected, then we will expand our operations going forward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the advantage for your business that comes from being based in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>First of all, Saudi Arabia is still a young economy and we are confident that we can produce high-quality products that compete on the international market. For me as a manufacturer of corrugated cardboard, I am dealing with many industries—mainly food industries—including plastics and petrochemical factories, and many other sectors have witnessed the growth of other sectors in the county. As a corrugated cardboard manufacturer, I have the advantage that any business that is growing in Saudi Arabia needs to be packed, and that means that we plan to expand even more in the corrugated segment, and our competitors are also expanding and new manufacturers are joining the sector.</p><h4>Competition in the market is growing. How do you ensure that your products are better than the competition?</h4><p>We have fully state-of-the-art machinery, one of the best in the industry, and we are always developing and looking to address the needs and demands of the market and we develop our business accordingly. At the beginning we were only producing regular carton and now we are producing high-quality printed carton of different sizes. And we are also offering a number of different smaller products that other companies in the market may not be able to provide, such as assembled partitions. We have an automated assembly line to do partitions inside boxes, a type of packaging mostly used for storing glass bottles or jars, for example. We are adding more services to be able to offer our clients fully integrated solutions. Another example of additional services is waxing. Finally, printing is customized for each customer. Previously, the carton was viewed as just packaging material; however, now it is viewed as marketing material. For example, when I go to visit other companies, their marketing departments are more involved in the process, because companies are now demanding high-quality printed boxes.</p><h4>How do you assess the opportunities in the Saudi market?</h4><p>We are lucky to be working in this sector in the Saudi market, because we are dealing mostly with food products; therefore, regardless of the overall state of the economy, people need to eat and food manufacturing is always expanding. As suppliers of corrugated cardboard, we supply food factories, which account for a huge percentage of our customers and we are expanding with them. We foresee their needs and work toward that as well. We have significantly increased our annual sales between 10-25% over the past seven years. Of course, our competitors are also expanding, but the market and the demand is expanding as well, and with more people there is more need for food production, which results in the need for more corrugated cardboard packaging. The only challenge for me in regard to the economy of Saudi Arabia is to accommodate the latest technology and meet the needs of my customers, as well as to compete with other manufacturers in the market.</p><h4>What are the main goals and expectations of Gulf Carton for 2016?</h4><p>We have a yearly goal to undertake investments that will give us value added or add new products, and in 2016 we will add a new product. We will move Gulf Carton from focusing on corrugated cardboard to paper products in general. We are aiming to add paper bags to support corrugation, because we supply pizza boxes to restaurants, for example, and they often need additional paper products that are sourced from other paper suppliers, so we aim to be able to offer a total solution. We will be expanding our portfolio. We have made huge changes to our infrastructure, and now we are due to see the results of these changes. We have added a lot of converting machines, as well as new technologies and specialty machines, such as an assembly machine and a waxing machine. Today, we can meet the needs of any client. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This year marks the 15th anniversary of the enactment of Law 360 to foster investments into Lebanon. What is your assessment of the current state of investment in Lebanon?</h4><p>Doing a briefing of what these past 15 years have been for Lebanon since Law 360 was implemented, the first thing that comes up is the country's resilience and ability to continue attracting investments despite the many national, regional and international challenges. When the worldwide financial crisis hit global markets in 2009, Lebanon was hitting growth rate figures of more 10%, and FDI reached all times high of USD4.96 billion. When the region was engulfed in the Arab Spring, Lebanon remained one of the few regional economies to register positive growth in FDI levels. We have managed to maintain FDI levels at around USD3 billion, proving Lebanon's resilience and forcing us to do more as this number does not match our ambitions. Despite drop in FDI figures in 2015 as per the last UNCTAD report, we see positive prospects for the year to come given Lebanon's fundamentals and an increasing momentum by the national government in mobilizing diaspora investments. We are currently working on increasing diaspora direct investments to Lebanon and we have a series of roadshows coming up across the globe to present our country's opportunities, which are many. In addition to that, there is an increase belief in the role that Lebanon can play in serving the regional market specially conflict areas which might be in need of basic commodities in the years to come. We are seeing increase investments in the food and beverage sector with exports increasing at a CAGR of more than 8% and relocation of Syrian firms to Lebanon. In addition, Lebanon is being more and more seen as a destination for business process outsourcing.</p><h4>Amid the complex environment Lebanon has faced in the past year, what have been some of the actions of IDAL to turn these challenges into opportunities?</h4><p>The challenges have been impacting both our foreign and national investments but also exports. With the closure of the Syrian border, half of our trading routes were suddenly cut. With IDAL's main mandate to support in the promotion of Lebanese goods, it has put in place a new program, namely the Maritime Lebanese Export Bridge Program (M.Leb), which basically supports exporters to transport their goods via maritime means to counter for the loss of the land route. This program has had a positive impact on exporters in the agriculture, agro food, and industry sectors with many companies benefiting from government support. The impact on investments and with the recent measures imposed by some Gulf states to forbid their citizens from visiting Lebanon the tourism industry, which has been relying heavily on Gulf spending, has suffered. This was an opportunity for us to tap again into our diaspora before by working in partnership with public and private organizations to identify diaspora members who would either directly invest in Lebanon or support in outsourcing part of their operations to Lebanon. We have a very large diaspora presence in Latin America, Western Africa, and the Gulf, and we plan to use their influence to establish trade ties, sign partnerships with local companies, and in the best cases attract investors to see the potential Lebanon entails. It is also important to note that, despite the many challenges, our main duty as national investment agency has been to continuously promote our sector's competitive advantages. We are just starting a campaign to promote our sectors and remind investors of the many facilities available to them.</p><h4>IDAL has structured different strategies to approach the Lebanese diaspora. What are some of the actions you have taken in this regard?</h4><p>The initiative to approach our diaspora around the world is a unified effort from IDAL, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the private sector. We have been working for several years in cooperation with the international institutions, especially EUROMED MIGRATION, the Med Generation project, and ICMPD to develop a national strategy to attract direct investment from expatriates and increase the effectiveness of the economic link between Lebanon and the diaspora from around the world. The strategic framework we are setting today is based on the identification of the productive sectors of interest to expatriates from the investment side and the promotion of Lebanese products through specialized exhibitions in the prevalence countries. Also, we are working on identifying the major sites that the initiatives should target and recommendation of steps to be taken in order to link IDAL initiatives to expatriate concerns. We organized several workshops along with the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) to map those economic sectors in countries with large Lebanese presence. This allowed us, for instance, to go to Silicon Valley and identify which ICT companies are led by people from Lebanese origins to link them to our local ecosystem here. We also created a database with all the information coming from the countries where the diaspora is spread to link them and let them take a part in this activity. We have taken actions at a PR level with exporters and other business people to connect them through technological applications. Every Lebanese expatriate has the will to reconnect to their country, but many of them do not have the means to do so; IDAL is now creating the means, the opportunities, and the capabilities to bring them back in any form possible.</p><h4>The knowledge economy sector is one of the most promising ones at the moment. How have you channeled your resources to help this sector grow?</h4><p>Three years ago we developed a business process outsourcing strategy given our belief in the potential of the country to serve as outsourcing destination to companies engaged in ICT-related services. We carried out several roadshows to promote our location advantages. This year we partnered with Berytech to promote Lebanon in the Canadian market and we held a presentation and workshop in Paris for Lebanese companies to establish partnerships and business opportunities with French companies. We have tailored tax break incentives and easier licenses issue for the startup ecosystem and we have partnered with many incubators and accelerators to simplify the process for companies to set up their companies. We are currently preparing an ICT sector event in Oman due to that country's increasing interest in our ecosystem.</p><h4>What is IDAL's involvement in the project to create three industrial cities across Lebanese territory?</h4><p>We have carried out different studies for the development of the industrial and economic zones that are taking over the national territory, not only for these three planned cities, but also for the Tripoli Special Economic Zone and other flagship projects in the country. We identified that the demand is in the manufacturing sector here, so we arranged this industry to allocate a series of companies under one single umbrella that would ultimately become the industrial zone. We also identified that there were some underdeveloped regions in the country across the south and the east, so we pushed for the relocation of these industrial cities to those unprivileged areas. Finally, we are working now on setting up the incentive plans that will attract investment to these regions.</p><h4>With the eventual development of the oil and gas sector in Lebanon, have you started approaching potential investors?</h4><p>The studies have been finalized, and now we are preparing to launch the tenders that will serve for international investors to see the potential of this industry in Lebanon. The oil and gas sector is currently supervised by the Lebanese Petroleum Administration (LPA), so we are working in partnership with it to promote the tenders, but we are not directly involved in the attraction of investors. What we are expecting is for peace to settle in Syria so we can manage all the reconstruction efforts from Lebanon, and also for our promising oil and gas industry to finally take off.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-competitive-edge]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for SSCI to date?</h4><p>Since day one, SSCI's objective has been to locally manufacture the desalination chemicals required in Saudi Arabia and the GCC using locally procured raw materials and in-house R&amp;D. Saudi Arabia and all GGC countries rely on desalination for their potable, irrigation, and industrial waters. Desalination requires mechanical equipment and chemicals. These chemicals are essential in the operation of desalination plants to prevent scaling and corrosion. Without them, a plant would be ruined within hours, which is why our objective has always been to provide a local supply of chemicals to support the Saline Water Conversion Corporation (SWCC) and other water producers in Saudi Arabia and GCC countries. We have an excellent relationship with SWCC in the form of a partnership to localize, end to end, the desalination industry. This is extremely important for the safe operation of the plants and as a water security issue for the Kingdom and the GCC. SWCC took the initiative to conduct an annual forum on the localization of this industry because of the importance of water security to the region, and SSCI was honored to sponsor the 2015 forum. SSCI now contributes to Kingdom and GCC water security through the production of three out of the four items necessary to run desalination plants. The fourth product's final approval stage will start soon at SWCC—Shoaibah plant in Saudi Arabia, Sohar plant in Oman, and Hidd plant in Bahrain. Having said that, 85% of the world's desalination plants are in the Gulf region and SSCI has the advantage in capturing a major part of this business because of our geographical proximity and low raw material and manufacturing costs.</p><h4>What share of your overall business comes from mining products?</h4><p>Our mining products business is only three years old, which is why we are focusing on it and marketing ourselves by attending as many regional and international exhibitions and events as we can. Currently, we have a 100% market share for these additives in Jordan, 40% share in Indonesia, and we just started with OCP in Morocco; however, that does not contribute much to the company's revenues. If we include Maaden Phosphate Company (MPC), Maaden Aluminium Company (MAC), Jordan Phosphate Mines Company (JPMC), Indo Jordan Company (IJC), Jordan India Fertilizer Co, (Jifco), Petro Jordan Abadi, and Petrokimia of Indonesia, our fertilizers and mining products make up around 10% of SSCI revenues at the moment. There is huge added potential that will be created by Maaden and OCP expansions. As a result, SSCI's growth strategy will mainly depend on mining and fertilizers additives. Similar to desalination chemicals, the major advantage SSCI has over its competitors lies in the availability of raw materials in local market from Aramco and Sabic. This enable us to sell them at the cheapest price in Saudi Arabia and also provide us with a competitive edge in export to countries that buy mineral oil from Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries. After over three years in the mining sector, SSCI is now expanding quickly. We have a complete team here with a fully equipped, state-of-the-art laboratory and we can develop any product within a few months. By 2020, we anticipate that approximately 60% of SSCI's overall revenues will be from the mining sector. The potential for the company to grow in that particular category of products is greater than in any other sector. Therefore, we will end up with two product categories, rather than the eight we currently have. These are water treatment products on a global scale and mining products. SSCI's business will become 60% mining products, 30% water treatment products, and 10% other products. For now our main source of revenue is water treatment products and concrete additives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the specific industrial opportunities for foreign investors?</h4><p>We, at NICDP, are becoming more proactive as we look for major foreign investors to discuss with them the opportunities in the automotive industry. The facilities and incentives offered by the Saudi government are also a major point of discussion. Presently, we are in the process of negotiations with certain major OEMs. In addition, NICDP seeks to attract investors at the downstream industries level, such as auto parts, specialty plastics, pharmaceuticals, and rubber, for example. NICDP teams then arrange visits to the prospected investors rather than just hosting typical meetings and exhibitions in the Kingdom. Specific proposals and packages are offered. If investors do not view such offers as satisfactory, then the proposals would be reworked to the satisfaction of both the investor and the government. Our aim is to access companies that operate in the aerospace and automotive industries. The NICDP has supported the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources and Ministry of Commerce and Industry in establishing the production of aluminum and titanium complexes. These two materials are important in a number of industries, such as aerospace, automotive, and medical, for example. Now, we are looking into these opportunities and conducting studies about what type of aerospace components we can produce out of these materials. In plastics, NICDP supported the establishment of industries like   specialty chemicals, rubber and carbon black, as well as engineering plastics such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), PolyAcetyle (POM), and PMMA. In addition to its work with foreign companies, NICDP also works with Saudi companies and investors to make these industries a reality. We, at the NICDP, conduct technical and market assessments for Saudi Arabia and the region to help investors carry out their feasibility studies. As part of our metal cluster, we work with Saudi investors to see how they can satisfy local needs in the production of metal parts, for example the Riyadh Metro project.  NICDP is studying the localization of nationally strategic industries for chemicals and equipment/parts in the area of water desalination and power. NICDP represents the business development arm of the government, working to crystalize opportunities. Now, we are initiating mapping of the industries inside Saudi Arabia, which will be available to the public.</p><h4>How would you assess the regulatory framework that is currently in place?</h4><p>HE Dr. Tawfiq Al Rabiah, NICDP Chairman and Minister of Commerce and Industry, is working with us and other industry-related organizations to improve the environment to do business in Saudi Arabia. For example, he also chairs the Saudi Industrial Development Fund and considers what the fund can do to support investors. Regarding the industrial cities, we are moving forward from just providing land to getting buildings ready for the investor. The minister is also considering other government regulations related to local procurement and labor laws to support local industry. He is working with the support from the government with other ministers to create a good package for industry and investors.</p><h4>What are the goals for the NICDP in 2016?</h4><p>In the first place, our emphasis will be on attracting the automotive industry. We have some potential projects now with global OEMs we are working with. In the pharmaceuticals industry we are concerned with the vaccine sector, which is strategic because it relates to the country's national security. We are pushing this area forward to create flexible manufacturing facilities in Saudi Arabia that can produce vaccines of high priority for Saudi nationals. We are also working with higher education institutions to bring scientists together to form a center for developing new vaccines as an enabler to this facility. In metals and minerals, we are focusing on attracting investment in aerospace and industrial components suppliers leveraging the available raw materials in the Kingdom. In the petrochemical area, we will continue the effort to establish value-added downstream industries such as tires, industrial rubber parts, and specialty intermediates to enable the production of finished products. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Record Year]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-record-year]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the performances of Zain in 2015? </h4><p>The year 2015 was an excellent year for Zain Saudi Arabia by all measures. Financially, it proved to be a record year. In a very competitive market, we increased revenues by 9%, reaching SAR6.7 billion (nearly $1.8 billion). We increased our gross margin by 7 full percentage points, up from 52% to 59%. Likewise, EBITDA rose by 48%, reaching SAR1.6 billion. The record I am most proud of is that, for the first time since its inception, the company broke even at an operating level (EBIT) during two quarters of 2015. We ended the year having reduced operating losses by 73%, down from SAR534 million to 141 million. We continue to focus on offering our customers the best possible mobile video streaming experience and friendly service from our ever-expanding network of refreshed retail outlets. Of course, we have continued to improve customer experience, as a result of our recent SAR4.5 billion investment in our network infrastructure. In 2015, we experienced a significant increase in data traffic carried by the network as we expanded both its reach and capacity in urban areas.</p><h4>What other challenges do you see in this country for the sector's development?</h4><p>As the third mobile telecommunications operator in Saudi Arabia, it would be natural for me to call for measures that enable Zain to grow. An independent economist would observe that the telecommunications sector in Saudi Arabia is too concentrated and that regulatory measures are required to correct this situation. We have seen the start of this process with the decision to decrease mobile and fixed termination rates, both in 2015 and again in 2016. Our sector, the ICT sector, is core to Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 objective to create a diversified, knowledge-based economy. Saudi Arabia is a global leader in terms of a digitally connected society, often being cited as the highest per capital consumer of streaming video content and social media usage. Citizens leapfrogged an entire generation of web 1.0 directly to web 2.0, and also leapfrogged the traditional slow, inconvenient fixed-internet connections, choosing to connect with modern fast, convenient mobile internet connections. In fact, during 2015 mobile data connections outnumbered fixed-data connections by more than nine to one. Our industry now faces the challenge of needing additional radio spectrum to keep up with the ever-increasing demands of our customers. Of course, allocating more radio spectrum is good for both the economic and social development of the Kingdom. The Kingdom had the wisdom to include the allocation of more radio spectrum as a strategic objective of Vision 2030. Mobile penetration rates in the Gulf region are as high as 200%, while in Saudi Arabia this figure is 169.3%.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for growth?</h4><p>Mobile data is changing the face of the telecommunications industry across the globe; many of the old-school approaches and old-school indicators are rapidly becoming obsolete. Our industry now connects more people in more ways than ever before, and in many cases each of the device that we use has its own unique connection. Therefore, the old voice paradigm of a ceiling on penetration has been blown away by the emergence of mobile data connectivity and the Internet of Things (IoT). I believe that the customer experience remains a big issue for consumers in Saudi Arabia. Zain's focus, and indeed our entire “Winning through Caring" strategy, aims to address this market opportunity. Of course, we are rapidly digitizing our services, making it more convenient for our customers to connect with our brand. We now see the opportunity to move into other core services that would be beneficial to our customers. Like many other leading telecommunications operators, we see that it may be beneficial to our consumers if we offload some of their traffic onto a fixed network. Fortunately, Zain has many different strategic options to achieve this goal either directly or through business partnerships. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[start-me-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of NTCC today in the local market?</h4><p>Since the Electricity &amp; Co-Generation Regulatory Authority (ECRA) gave us the license to study the building and operation of tri-generation plants throughout the Kingdom, NTCC entered the Saudi trigeneration and cogeneration sector in Saudi Arabia in full force. In compliance with Vision 2030, NTCC is uniquely placed in the center of the plan with its greener and more fuel-efficient trigeneration and district cooling solutions. NTCC has evolved to be among the market leaders in the district cooling and energy sector in the Kingdom.</p><h4>What is the company structure and how do clients benefit from your services?</h4><p>NTCC is joint stock company managed by the CEO, who reports to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. NTCC has three subsidiaries. The first of these is Source Energy, which focuses on build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) businesses including co-generation, tri-generation, and district cooling plants. Intelligent Energy Services (IES) focuses on the sale and rental of generators. Rental services include projects from smaller capacities to larger capacities for short and long term. DTZ-KSA is a JV with an international company focusing on facility management and facility consulting. One of our notable achievements in Saudi Arabia is the Facility Management Design Audit for new buildings like the Kingdom Tower in Jeddah. NTCC seeks out the most professional strategic partners to achieve its targets in each project. NTCC tailors solutions for its clients to become a one-stop shop for all their energy and district cooling solutions in the Kingdom.</p><h4>On what projects are you currently working?</h4><p>Presently, we have six running projects with dedicated cooling that is serving large organizations, such as the National Commercial Bank in Riyadh. Additionally, we have the Al Anood Tower and the Burj Rafal Tower in Riyadh, and the King Road Tower in Jeddah. In addition to our existing projects, we are currently evaluating a good number of big projects under the BOT concept. And, as for the rental business, we have a good number of clients that we are serving, like Emaar, Landmark, Lulu, and others.</p><h4>New technologies and services are key for the economy. What contribution can NTCC provide when it comes to district cooling?</h4><p>As per the statistics, almost 50% of the power for a project goes to cooling, which is a major chunk. When you look at individual buildings with their own chillers compared to multiple buildings fed from a centralized district cooling plant, there is a huge diversity factor that we can build into the district cooling plant design. This cuts down the actual capacity of cooling to be installed completely by around 30%, which reflects on the power capacity to be subscribed and the power consumption. Including thermal storage into the design helps in peak shaving and efficient usage of power. We specialize in district cooling and dedicated power supply.</p><h4>What are your targets for 2016?</h4><p>We believe that in 2016 the awareness about district cooling will help it take its place strongly in line with the direction that the Saudi government is taking in order to streamline energy costs. We are working closely with the market to establish more awareness of the services offered by NTCC, which will eventually result in better opportunities. This has inspired the establishment of a new JV with a giant company in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Binladin Group. This JV will capitalize its efforts on large projects in district cooling. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What potential markets are you considering entering in the future?</h4><p>One potential market is ultrapure water (UPW), which is extremely pure in composition, below 0.1 microsiemens. We have recently begun a project to produce this. For this we teamed up with a group that has invested in the Canadian company Enpar Technologies. The first trial unit was conducted at our plant in the south of Jeddah and we produced water with the purity of about 1 microsiemens, or 0.5 ppm. We are now trying to go even higher in purity and lower in concentration or conductivity, with the hope of servicing extremely niche markets with such water as is used for testing stainless steel pipes in oil refineries. We will be ready to service that market in the next few months. There will always be demand for UPW, and it will always remain a niche market. It is not feasible to build an entire business around UPW, but it can certainly add to an existing and varied portfolio.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the role of the private sector in the water industry now and in the future?</h4><p>Water is a serious business and a matter of national security for Saudi Arabia. The country is huge, its population is young and growing, and it has an active industrial base, yet water resources are limited. There is huge demand and the demand is constantly growing, requiring billions of dollars of investment. In the last eight to 10 years, the private sector played a key role in Independent Water and Power Projects (IWPPs), and these IWPPs were largely done with private sector investments, with perhaps a billion cubic meters of desalinated water being produced through private-sector funding and contribution. That being said, the government is also still actively investing in water projects and infrastructure, be it the production of water, seawater desalination, or brackish water desalination. Small- and medium-size producers like ours contribute about 40,000 cubic meters per day. The government will continue to invest billions of dollars in water infrastructure. The private sector can play two main roles, in IWPPs or like us at a medium-size capacity producing 20,000-100,000 cubic meters per day. Under current conditions, the government will be keen to involve the private sector more in the water industry.</p><h4>What are some of the biggest challenges in the water sector?</h4><p>In a volatile region like the Middle East, challenges come without warning. We try to adapt, but sometimes it is beyond individual private companies' capacity to mitigate all the challenges. Saudi Arabia is still a large country with a healthy economy, despite the challenge of low oil prices. Another challenge is getting paid by contractors and collecting money in specific industries. Also, the process for obtaining permits is difficult and stringent, and sometimes it can take two or three years to get the right permits.</p><h4>What role does the ethics of water distribution play in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Water has a strong ethical dimension. Water is not purely a commercial commodity; of course water is commoditized, but how it is sold, distributed, and consumed must be managed sensitively. Everyone requires water—factories, resorts, hospitals, and residences. Hospitals and schools, of course, also have precedence for all excess capacity, followed by residences, which have precedence over resorts or hotels. People need water, and the ethics of that transcends all commercial concerns. Whenever there is a shortage, we determine where the water is most sorely needed and distribute it accordingly.</p><h4>What kinds of environmental standards does SAWACO maintain in its operations?</h4><p>We undergo strict and regular supervision and reviews by the PME, which checks our plants and whose divers check the quality of the coral near our plants as well as the concentration of the fish where the brine goes into the sea. If we failed these reviews, we would be shut down. These standards will also create more incentive for creating more solar desalination plants. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has UPS' presence in Mexico developed over the past 25 years?</h4><p>The company was established in Mexico in 1991. We started out working with a third-party vendor. This year, we are celebrating our 25th anniversary. When we first start out in a country, our aim is to connect that country to the rest of the world. What we have done over time, which is easy to do in the beginning, is build up the network so we can take advantage of all the available time in our operation. That is when a domestic service comes in. Since we started, we have spent a good amount of time turning agent operations into UPS operations. In addition, we have introduced a countless number of new products along the multiple lines of business we operate in. Everyone knows our brown trucks; however, we do a lot more than that. We operate as a small package deliverer, also doing heavy cargo, air freight, ocean freight, ground freight, and more. That has all happened over time. Since we established here, we have also made some acquisitions that built out our portfolio.</p><h4>What has been your strategy for UPS since you first came to this market?</h4><p>In a nutshell, we seek a balanced approach to the market. We have found that there are opportunities to help companies improve their operations. There are custom models that need to be renewed to streamline processes. The management of multiple providers creates a lot of costs and problems. The fact that we built our portfolio globally and in Mexico to fill out all parts of the business helps us go to the customers and ask how we can help them move their products quickly across the border. We have seen them sit there at the border for seven days and they don't move until they have a full truck. Our focus to go to market is on helping people with solutions that hit all parts of the business so they are not just looking at the domestic part. Hence, in 2014, we established a new group that sits above the border called the Center of Excellence. This group focuses on how we connect our people, networks, and customers on both sides of the border, even up to Canada. Given that 80% of the exports from Mexico go to the US and 50% of the imports into Mexico are from the US; clearly, it is a major trading partner. Therefore, there is a lot of opportunity to help companies run better. That is our focus.</p><h4>What changes have you implemented in Mexico since 2011?</h4><p>When I first got here, we built out our next-day delivery network in a small package. We now cover about 95% of the population with next-day service with our own vehicles and people. We also introduced a standard, guaranteed deferred service within Mexico. We have Express, which covers the whole country and in the other zones we also offer a deferred service that is guaranteed, too. That has been received with positive feedback from the market. In addition to the package network, we also started a campaign to expand our footprint of UPS Express stores. That is to expand our retail presences to help SMEs get better access. We did a big market study to understand their needs. We bought a company called Kiala about five years ago in Europe. In 2015 we also launched an access points network in Mexico, which are local small businesses that we have partnered with, so that clients can pick up their packages when it fits their schedule, knowing that their packages are secure.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges for the growth of international trade for Mexico?</h4><p>Starting with imports and exports, modernizing the existing customs infrastructure for Mexico is really important. It is important to our entire industry and the cargo industry as well because, if fixed, it could change the perception of Mexico on a global scale. Everyone gets either a red light or a green light. We have been working with them, today in fact, to have them adopt a pre-clearance process and a target search process that is being utilized in other markets. We have it in our global hub in Kentucky so that customs can be smarter about looking for suspicious packages or not paying the right amount for duties.</p><h4>What advantages does UPS have over the local players in this market?</h4><p>The largest local companies are dedicated to only one business. We look at two dimensions: size of shipment and the speed it needs to be there. If you don't have a full portfolio, you can't do this.  We've built our portfolio this way because we know that any given day customers are going to have an urgent situation where they need to get something out right away or else they'll get a fine. Not everyone can do that. This is why we put the Center of Excellence in place, to help us better manage this, on both the US and Mexican side. The same issues happen on the US side, so our team connects the US and Mexico. The same problems are happening on both sides. That's why they should pick us—in any given moment, they should be picking the right mode of transportation, emergency or not. For example, in the aerospace and automotive industries there is the idea of “mode optimization." They think everything has to be at the destination right away, but then it gets there and it sits there. When it's sitting there, it has the possibility to get damaged or lost. So, thinking differently about the supply chain requires having someone talk to you about all these different options to save costs and generate more revenue and more profit.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In this period of low oil prices, what opportunities do you see for investors in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is committed to diversifying its economy, seeking value-added industries that can benefit from the raw materials that come from its local petrochemical industry. As a long-term investor in the Kingdom, ExxonMobil is working to support the country in this endeavor, which will contribute toward creating new career opportunities for the increasing number of well-educated Saudis. While the plastics industry is well developed in the Kingdom, the rubber industry is still in its infancy and targeted for growth by the government. Our elastomers plant at KEMYA introduces new raw materials to the Kingdom, creating investment opportunities for Saudi and foreign industrialists seeking to produce closer to their final markets. With expertise acquired through 75 years of leadership in the synthetic rubber industry, ExxonMobil is working with the government to attract investors to manufacturing opportunities in Saudi Arabia. The government is developing incentives to encourage companies, both Saudi and foreign, to invest. In addition, construction of the first new rubber converter in the Kingdom is well under way, and a number of other projects are at final planning stages with MoUs signed with the government. It will take some years to create the full cluster of rubber converters, but ExxonMobil is proud of the role that KEMYA played in pioneering this industry in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What are your expectations and goals for 2016 for ExxonMobil in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Globally, demand for chemicals is expected to rise by 50% over the next 10 years, or about 4% a year on average. Demand for some specialty or differentiated chemicals will grow even faster. What has driven this rise in demand is the fact that plastics and other petrochemical products are integral to modern living standards. Here in the Middle East, the middle class is expected to grow by more than 20 million from 2010 to 2030. The rise of a middle class will create new demands for products made from chemicals—everything from home appliances to homebuilding materials to cars. To get a sense of the scale of how these changes will impact demand for chemicals, consider the following: The average new car is about 50% plastic by volume but only 10% of the weight. And by 2040, there will be 800 million more cars on the world's roads—double what there is today. With this in mind, SABIC and ExxonMobil constructed a new, multi-billion-dollar elastomers plant at KEMYA, which is coming online as we speak. The facilities are integrated with the existing Al-Jubail complex, and the new synthetic rubbers project represents a significant broadening of KEMYA's product portfolio. With a total investment of $3.4 billion, SABIC and ExxonMobil have added a new elastomers plant at KEMYA. The facilities are integrated with the existing Al-Jubail complex, and this new synthetic rubber project represents a significant broadening of KEMYA's product portfolio. The expansion of automotive markets in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions has created strong demand for synthetic rubber products in vehicles and tires. The specialty elastomers also will be used in other industries such as building and construction and appliances in end products such as electrical wire covering and insulation, seals, and belts. The facility employs commercially competitive, high-impact technologies, including proprietary ExxonMobil EPDM, thermoplastic elastomer, and halobutyl rubber technologies. The KEMYA elastomers facility demonstrates ExxonMobil and SABIC's commitment to foster a local rubber industry in Saudi Arabia that supports job creation, develops downstream industries, and helps diversify the national economy. The strategic partnership between SABIC and ExxonMobil provides the strength of industry-leading competitive assets, introduces new specialty products to the Kingdom, and offers global marketing and supply capability of exceptional quality. The new facility can help accelerate the growth and diversification of the Kingdom's industrial sector and provide local manufacturers with the building blocks to successfully compete domestically and internationally in markets for a wide range of products. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>STC registered an excellent performance in 2015. What were the key factors behind this? </h4><p>This performance was a result of STC focusing on enabling a strong ICT platform, investing in a solid ICT infrastructure as well as employing its experience in dealing with the challenging circumstances the telecommunication sector usually faces. The company focused on expanding its broadband services, investing around $8 billion. The performance was also achieved by concentrating on the enterprise sector, especially medium and large companies as they represent a large share of the Kingdom's market and are the fastest-growing segment.</p><h4>What is the social and economic impact of the Internet of Things (IoT) in Saudi Arabia? </h4><p>We cannot, as of yet, assess the impact of the IoT on the Kingdom. The concept remains in its infancy on a global scale. Yet, STC is gearing up for the IoT, knowing Saudi society has an historic record of fast uptake of new technologies. For example, Saudi Arabia has one of the highest, if not the highest, consumption rates of YouTube and other social media platforms. Smart device penetration is also one of the highest globally, and the average monthly data consumption hovers around 43GB. Preparations mean there is an urgent need for higher speed and greater capacity internet services that provide the backbone for IoT. A new generation of internet will allow machine-to-machine (M2M) connectivity and services, thus creating a service leap in people's lives.</p><h4>How can the public and private sectors work together to achieve digitalization across the Kingdom?</h4><p>The government and the private sector have to work together and complement each other. For digitalization to take root, you need to be able to invest, which in turn means these investments must be profitable; otherwise, nobody would invest. That depends on the regulatory environment that the government puts in place, which is a necessary precondition for the private sector to start investing.</p><h4>What role is STC playing in the digitalization process? </h4><p>Our role has three facets: innovation, infrastructure, and enablement platforms. The latter involves deploying platforms such as the cloud and IoT, both of which fuel the digitization engine.</p><h4>What is the significance of digitization for the Kingdom's social and economic development?</h4><p>The important aspect to consider is value. When we talk about $100 trillion over the next nine years in the global economy, the incentives for being more value-conscious are clear. That has to do with value coming to the different industries but also tremendous value coming to society itself. </p><h4>What is your outlook on the sector's development in the medium term and what role will STC play in it?</h4><p>There is no doubt that the pace of growth of the telecommunication sector in Saudi Arabia will become faster, especially given the country's 2030 Vision, which focuses on multiple sectors. In essence, this will mean the development of telecommunications and addressing the growing demand for broadband to achieve goals of the Vision. One of the most important pillars of this vision is the Kingdom's aim to rank among the top-five countries in the world in terms of E-Government Index; STC and the Saudi telecommunications sector in general have the technical and human capacity to support this trend and achieve this important index. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[country-wide-service]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your reach in terms of distribution in the country and what strategies do you implement to provide excellent services?</h4><p>We have a Kingdom-wide network of around 2,400 distributors that are located close to the customers in every city, town, and village in Saudi Arabia. We distribute LPG in small commercial or domestic-sized containers to these distributors, which store the LPG containers on their sites. In turn these distributors serve the customers in their area by delivering containers to them directly when they are visited by domestic customers or by delivering to customers' sites through their retail distribution network. Under the unfilled service, we service large customers in the commercial or industrial sectors directly through our own call center, and we distribute LPG in bulk throughout Saudi Arabia through our seven branches. We have seven refilling locations located strategically across Saudi Arabia to meet our customers' needs. We separate the two major segments of filled and unfilled as part of our strategy to focus on leveraging our resources to serve our customers in an efficient and cost effective manner. We have many initiatives recently implemented in line with our strategy for improving our safety and service toward our esteemed customers throughout the Kingdom. We have implemented state-of-the-art technological solutions to provide better service through better monitoring of our filing and distribution service. We have a call center working 24/7. Leveraging technology, we monitor all of our trucks wherever they are moving in order to ensure safety and security, while optimizing efficiency in operations. Safety is the number-one priority for us; we want to be sure we deliver LPG according to the highest standards of safety. We strive to ensure safety in every phase of our operations. Accordingly, all our distribution trucks have been designed according to European standards. We also train and re-train our drivers continually so that they maintain high level of professionalism and certification in professionally handling and transporting hazardous materials safely.</p><h4>In light of Vision 2030, what is your vision for the sector in the medium term?</h4><p>In Vision 2030, we are talking about industry and clean sources of energy. LPG usage for power generation is a comparatively greener source of energy than traditional sources such as crude oil and diesel, which are used in our country presently. This fits with the vision for 2030, which is about increasing the participation of the industry in overall GDP. This is something that we would try to be a part of. We definitely see a bigger contribution of the company to the national economy by improving safety and service in the supply and distribution of LPG to any user of LPG within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We try to align our strategy and services with the needs of the industrial sector and its needs for LPG as a greener source of power than diesel or crude oil, because this is the sector that Vision 2030 is talking about growing in a big way.</p><h4>As for 2016, do you have specific goals or expectations?</h4><p>We are investing more in developing our human resources capital and especially in improving the safety and security of our staff, operations, and citizens. We strive to provide better service and have purchased more trucks to increase our distribution fleet to provide improved services by delivering LPG to all our customers in the shortest period of time, while striving to ensure that no one faces a shortage at any time anywhere in the Kingdom. Furthermore, we plan to open new locations around the country, in a well-planned and phased manner. We have already approved one location as a distribution center and are in the process of completing it this year. Next year we will re-look at the whole of Saudi Arabia and its needs for LPG to see how to provide better service to our partners and customers by being closer to them, in each city, town, and village. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources creating a more investor-friendly environment in the mining sector?</h4><p>Investors will find a business-friendly and transparent regulatory environment in Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom offers hundreds of locations with great prospects. One of the main pillars of an investor-friendly environment is the Kingdom's Mining Investment Law, which is one of the most advanced mining laws in the world. The law provides transparency to investors and puts all investors on an equal footing, whether local or foreign. It employs the first-come-first-served principle in processing applications, and in order to minimize downtime to investors it stipulates specific time periods for issuing licenses. Unlike other mining jurisdictions, the Kingdom does not require advance payment from investors, nor does it have any profit-sharing requirement. The only financial obligation that an investor has to the government is paying income tax, severance fees, and surface rental, which are among the most competitive in the world. In addition, the ministry encourages investment in the sector by providing incentives for exploration due to the presence of positive indicators and encouraging geologic studies. These incentives are expected to contribute to an increase in mining development, transfer of technology and expertise to local citizens, provide job opportunities to the Saudi cadre, develop remote areas, and promote technical support services.</p><h4>Why is mining an attractive investment prospect in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The most important factor is that the Kingdom offers a free market economy and an attractive mineral potential. Many occurrences and deposits with positive indicators have been found. Geologic studies undertaken by the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources have identified occurrences and deposits rich in gold, silver, copper, zinc, and associated minerals. Additionally Saudi Arabia is under-explored by world standards and therefore the likelihood of finding viable deposits is high. The Kingdom offers economic security as well as security of tenure once an exploration license has been issued. Other economic factors that make the Kingdom an attractive mining country is its competitive labor cost and the availability of energy. Previous investigations have shown huge resources of precious and base metals such as gold, silver, copper, zinc, and lead that exist in over 900 locations deemed promising prospects. All of these resources require detailed exploration work to determine their economic viability. As for industrial minerals, there are over 1,000 prospects that contain silica sand, limestone, ornamental stone, and gypsum. Most of these locations have been set aside by the ministry for the benefit of potential investors. </p><h4>The mining sector is set to become the third pillar of the local economy. What main contribution will this sector offer the country?</h4><p>As the mineral sector undergoes further development its contribution to the Kingdom's GDP will increase. We expect the sector to increase its contribution from 2% of GDP at present to 5% in the next 20 years. Additionally, further development will lead to technology transfer and will create additional employment opportunities for Saudi citizens. In Saudi Arabia, there are many students that graduate annually. The young people in the country are our most important resource, and the mining sector can contribute to their employment. Additionally, as a result of mining development, we expect foreign direct and indirect investment to increase proportionally, and, consequently, imports of mineral commodities should decline and value-added mineral exports should increase. Finally, due to the diverse geology of Saudi Arabia and the location of its potential mineral resources, we anticipate an increase in the development of remote regions in the Kingdom.</p><h4>What are the ministry's most important objectives in developing the mining sector?</h4><p>Some of our most important objectives include the optimum exploitation of minerals and the protection of the environment, the transfer of technology to substitute imports with locally produced minerals, and Saudization and creating job opportunities for Saudi citizens, especially in remote areas. We also focus on exports of value-added commodities and not unprocessed minerals and developing remote areas of the kingdom. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How advanced is the insurance sector in Saudi Arabia in comparison to other countries in the GCC?</h4><p>The market is still in the early stages of development. Other countries in the GCC might have had a head start in terms of the presence of insurance as a major contributor to the economy. However, Saudi Arabia has undergone numerous changes in the development of this sector. The regulator here has done a tremendous job, whereby regulation is in fact more advanced than in other GCC countries in terms of the structure of the industry and where the regulator wants to drive it. There is great potential in the Saudi market with penetration rates being low. If you look at the breakdown of insurance premiums in Saudi Arabia, 75-80% is represented in compulsory lines, such as motor and medical insurance. Soon, people here will start buying insurance in addition to the compulsory medical, motor, and small business insurance policies. They will start insuring their properties and their liabilities. For the foreseeable future you will still see that compulsory lines represent the bulk of the insurance market, but despite the short-term pains of the economy, in the future I believe that great opportunities exist.</p><h4>What would you say are the main challenges that could limit the sector's potential growth?</h4><p>There is no denying that the sector faces many difficulties at this moment. There are 34 players and many of them are facing financial difficulties. There are various challenges that are being faced by the industry as a whole and I think the regulator realizes that and is trying to address it. There is severe competition in the market and it is price driven. And for many companies and many clients this is a pure commodity; if I can buy it cheaper elsewhere, I will. On the limitations of finding and retaining qualified talent, the focus is on attracting and retaining qualified Saudi talent because obviously we have Saudization requirements and a duty to society. The fact that economies of scale are not present for SMEs versus the bigger companies presents a challenge in pricing standard products, which is actuarially driven. If you are a big company you obviously have an advantage in terms of the loading structure and a lower expense average, and accordingly a more competitive price on standard products. That being said, companies will be forced to consolidate in the medium to long term to create economies of scale and efficiency and consolidate talent. Until the industry overcomes this rough period, you will still see challenges affecting the financial results of a number of companies here.</p><h4>Where do you see the company five years from now?</h4><p>In 2015, we recapitalized by increasing capital by SAR200 million, which parallels our theory of strengthening solvency, our balance sheet, and our situation in the market. What we are doing now is refocusing the company to return it to profitability by cleaning up the portfolio and trying to adapt to market conditions whereby we focus on a certain niche rather than just compete on price. We expect that we will be able to succeed in becoming a more niche, service-based company. We expect to continue to grow and consolidate. We expect that our solvency position will continue to improve and our bottom line will be enhanced through a strategy of better risk selection rather than merely obtaining volume. We will be a major service provider in the insurance industry, and we expect to play a big role in the growth of the industry. As for 2016, we are consolidating and restructuring at present. We are focusing on two things, namely better risk selection and enhancing operational efficiency through of expenses and streamlining services in areas ranging from underwriting to claims and operations. These will be optimized and inefficiencies will be contained. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the level of awareness for insurance changing in Saudi Arabia, especially for motor products?</h4><p>Awareness is still picking up as we go because we are a young industry. However, people tend to better understand motor insurance than they do other insurance, as it is compulsory. Awareness is there in terms of the product itself, but we need more time in order to reflect the importance of the relationship. Customers need to understand that the relationship with insurance companies is long term, that they are building a history in the database, and that it is no longer about just having a policy because the premium and claims experience is important. We are still not where we would like to be, but we are progressing. We run communications campaigns from time to time for our customers, and we launched our “TRUST" campaign aimed at raising awareness of motor insurance products. The word trust was actually an important element in the campaign, because it reflects how people perceive Tawuniya. The team undertook research and found that the most important word related to Tawuniya is trust. We were glad to see that we are a trusted company and that people were willing to stay with us. We strive to provide the best services, be competitive and innovative, increase customer satisfaction, and prove our leadership. We try to do our best to ensure that the company is solid and strong enough to perform its duties and commitments to clients and to provide a reasonable return on investment to our shareholders. </p><h4>How do you see the sector evolving and what role will Tawuniya play in the future market?</h4><p>We have a lot of issues because the industry is young; however, the good thing is that there is huge potential for growth. Our insurance penetration rate in Saudi Arabia is low, even compared to other GCC countries, so there is a huge opportunity for growth. If we compare ourselves to the West, there is even more space to grow, which is something good for the industry. Things will change. Right now, there are many companies in the country that are losing and they cannot continue to lose—they will either improve or make the call to exit or merge. This will be the case in the future, where it is not going to be as easy as it was before in terms of increasing capital just to stay in the market. There is more regulation and there will be well-reviewed business plans and commitments made by companies towards their future. The company that will win in the end will be the one that can provide excellent services, profitable margins, and high efficiency. Companies must be different and should not do what others are doing. Long-term strategies and targets make a difference because a company may grow tremendously, then lose money, and then need to exit the market or increase your capital through a merger or acquisition. That is not the right strategy. It needs to be slow and directed at a target. At the moment, we do not see any value added to the company to acquire or merge with another company. If you look at mergers, we are large compared to most companies in the market and, therefore, we have no plans to merge. But to acquire companies would require us to consider what is in it for us. So far, we have not seen any company that would add value to Tawuniya in terms of services or unique products that would help us move forward. Should we see an opportunity that would improve Tawuniya's position, we will seriously consider it. Our goal is to improve our market share in profitable segments. To increase our own market share, we have to improve our efficiency, our claims control, and our management tools, to ensure that we expand at the right time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given the Kingdom's increasing privatization, what role can investment companies play in supporting the private sector?</h4><p>Investment companies play a critical role in the privatization process itself. Foremost, investment companies are able to give a signal to the government of what the market will or will not tolerate, thereby establishing a sort of market test to help governments negotiate the best deal. Secondly, to attract buyers who are willing both to pay a reasonable price for an entity and to invest in improving the efficiency of the entity, governments must make the public enterprises more attractive. This may require steps like balance sheet restructuring, valuation of financial and non-financial assets, introduction of corporate governance processes and several other preliminary works where investment companies can play an advisory and execution role. Finally, the entire IPO process, can be efficiently and effectively executed only through the support of investment companies. For example, this may include advising on the type of securities to be offered and more importantly, underwriting of the offered securities.</p><h4>From which sectors of the economy do you expect positive performances in the short term?</h4><p>Keeping in view the current socio-economic baseline and the regulatory framework, three to four sectors have the potential to reflect a positive performance in the near term. The hospitality sector should benefit from religious tourism, which continues to grow. As envisaged in the Saudi Vision 2030, plans to increase Umrah pilgrims from 8 million a year to 30 million a year, and convert these visas to tourist visas, will have tremendous growth implications for this sector as well as the real estate and cement sectors. The cement sector should also benefit from real estate development given the imposition of fees on undeveloped land. This should excite construction activity. Agriculture, the food sector, and healthcare will benefit from demographic factors. A growing population will ensure consumption growth while lower global commodities prices will keep margins intact for companies despite rising operational costs.</p><h4>What are the most important elements that make Alistithmar Capital different from its competitors? </h4><p>Integrity, sustainable performance, and personalized customer service. ICAP has always ensured its long-term commitment to its clients and assumed an ethical, managed-risk and cognizant approach to investment decisions while managing and handling investors' funds. Our integrity is our USP. This trusted investment approach has also ensured value creation for our clients over the long run. We refrain from getting carried away by short-term, irrational market volatility. Our willingness to serve each and every client with peculiar attention has been the reason behind the long-term associations that we have maintained with our clients. All our HNW and institutional clients have direct access to our senior management, including myself, and we do not refrain from addressing their account services' needs, no matter how elementary.</p><h4>What measures would you like to see implemented to unleash the Saudi stock market's potential?</h4><p>Tadawul has already taken some positive initial steps that will help to increase participation of foreign investors, as the current participation through QFI is too low relative to other emerging markets. Secondly, new promising industries, for example education, energy, and healthcare services, are not appropriately, distinctively presented in the market, hence a re-categorization of sectors to reflect the true economic diversity of Saudi Arabia will prove to be more effective. The listing of other types of securities and investments such as preferred shares, Saudi riyal-denominated bonds and sukuks, REITS, ETFs, and funds units will increase the depth and range of the TADAWUL and the Saudi investment market. The introduction of new indices SMEs is essential as more companies are being listed. The infrastructure and resources that are available in the Saudi stock and financial market is one of the best in world, and, hence, it has a lot of potential to become one of the leading emerging markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[All-around  Growth]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[all-around-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of AIC?</h4><p>AIC was established by Alinma Bank in 2010, two years after the establishment of Alinma Bank. Although new to the Saudi markets, AIC was quick enough to provide quite a number of competitive products to its partners. I joined AIC in September 2014. At that time, the company had all its business licenses in place.  We prepared an ambitious business plan and reached the conclusion that the best strategy and way forward is to integrate with Alinma Bank. The bank has considerable room for growth in real estate financing; therefore, we decided to strengthen locally in that segment. The products we offered were three private real estate funds in 2Q2015.  Following the success, we launched another three real estate funds in 4Q2015.  Our total asset under management in real estate transactions is above SAR12 billion. Also in 3Q2015, we offered an IPO fund, which has been very successful. It started with assets under management of around SAR800 million. </p><h4>What would you say are the most important elements that make Alinma Investment different from other investment companies?</h4><p>We are the youngest investment company (bank spin-off) in Saudi Arabia and have invested in the latest and best available IT systems. This is one of our advantages over other bank affiliates, because many of them invested in their systems in the late 1990s with upgrades and changes costing a lot of money and time. We are also getting exposure to different sectors, because our bank is growing in different segments such as real estate, industrial financing, and semi-government financing. Other banks are only achieving the demographic growth rate, which is around 3-5%, while Alinma bank still registers double-digit growth. Therefore, as its investment company, we have huge opportunity to grow. We grew 180% in 2015 in YoY terms. Assets under management at the end of 2015 were SAR2 billion compared to less than SAR1.1 billion in 2014.</p><h4>How would you describe the health of the finance sector in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We have to take a number of factors into consideration. This is an economy with a young population; however, we face several challenges. The Saudi economy has historically been driven by government spending, which is driven by oil prices. This approach has benefited our GDP for the last 20 years, because growth in oil prices was faster than any other commodity. The government now intends to diversify its sources of income, which represents an excellent position from the point of view of the banking sector, because the government will need financing. Other opportunities for the banking sector will mostly arise from downstream manufacturing in the oil and gas chain, the pharmaceuticals sector, and the automobile industry, where huge diversification and growth is expected in the Kingdom. It is also worth mentioning that Saudi population is demographically young and characterized by a strong consumption-based culture and little propensity to savings. </p><h4>What are AIC's expectations and goals for 2016?</h4><p>We will continue growing in the same areas hopefully maintaining our triple-digit growth rate. When launching any new products, we ensure it has significant impact on our overall performance. Real estate will again be one of the major drivers. There are many government initiatives coming in the residential real estate sector and we hope to contribute. The Ministry of Housing is pushing for partnerships with the private sector instead of developing its own projects. The real estate cycle is long, and its contribution is not visible in the short term. We are working with real estate developers on projects that will increase the supply in the market in next three years' time. We agree with the Ministry of Housing that the issue now is the mismatch between the supply and demand. We are confident, and we expect this is the area to grow. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the health of Saudi's banking sector? </h4><p>The Saudi banking sector, which is the largest segment of the Saudi financial system, is well capitalized, profitable, and liquid. Contrary to expectations, the market did not foresee the precipitous fall in  oil prices in 2015. Saudi Banks have been resilient; however, the continued low oil prices might impact the banking sector indirectly. This can be in the form of banks buying government debts, and, hence, crowding out the private borrowers. Reduced oil prices will also force the government to cut spending and reduce subsidies, which will directly impact the private sector's health, forcing it to look for other costly sources of finance, abandon capital investments, or in the worst case scenario, default on loans. For the private sector, it will be a double hit, first in terms of a shrinking pool of available credit and second from reduced support from the government. During the global financial crisis of 2008, no Saudi bank came close to making a loss; however, the situation is different this time as the government is under pressure due to the huge amount of infrastructure spending currently ongoing, which earlier seemed viable as the country had a large budget surplus due to high oil prices. We expect the banking sector to remain under pressure for the foreseeable future.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for the Saudi banking sector, given the government's commitment to continue with infrastructure projects? </h4><p>Despite reduced prices due to a glut in the oil market, the government is committed to maintaining spending. Indeed, if it decides to run a small deficit, rather than using some of the country's estimated $661 billion reserves, this could lead to some interesting financial opportunities for local banks. Since July, it has started to issue debt for the first time since 2007, with bond sales of $5.3 billion to local banks expected each month into next year. In 2016, there will be many opportunities in infrastructure projects. We can join forces with major players that operate in different industrial and service sectors. The Saudi banking system is a relatively small, concentrated industry, and there are strong barriers to entry including big barriers to getting a license. As such, if the government decides to reduce its reliance on reserves and use banks as the alternate source of finance, then this will be positive for banks especially in an environment where interest rates are expected to go up. </p><h4>Given the drop in oil prices, Saudi Arabia is trying more than ever to diversify its economy. In which sector do you see opportunities for foreign investors?</h4><p>Oil prices fell to a more than six-year low near $42 a barrel recently, and the IMF forecasts the Saudi government will run a budget deficit in 2015 of around 19.5% of GDP. Last year's deficit was 3.4% of GDP and followed six years of high surpluses. Saudi non-oil private sector growth is closely tied to oil markets with the government dependent on crude sales for around 85% of its revenue. As long as oil prices remain low, investors will be cautious and wait at least until energy prices start heading back to their previous levels. The same is the case for foreign investors since most of them are interested in petrochemicals. The recent opening of stock market for QFIs shows the commitment by local authorities to welcome foreign investors; however, the inflow has been low as QFIs only hold 0.03% of the market while the target is 5% according to the CEO of Tadawul in a recent interview with Reuters. Efforts are under way to merge the Saudi stock market in MSCI world index and alter the rules for QFIs to make them more flexible. We expect foreign investor inflows to remain low unless Tadawul is included in the MSCI Index and oil prices rise once again. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How healthy is Saudi Arabia's banking sector?</h4><p>Thanks to supportive government policy and wise and strict regulation, the economy is doing well, despite the challenges brought by low oil prices. Across the sector, Saudi banks have high levels of capital and liquidity, and strong leverage ratios. All banks in the Kingdom are sound and solid, and are in an excellent position to continue supporting the Saudi economy. Finally, Saudi banks' non-performing loans are the lowest in the region, whilst coverage of those NPLs is among the highest in the world. In light of all this, Saudi banks and the banking sector will continue to perform well in the months and years ahead. </p><h4>How would you assess the contribution of your institution to the economic and social development of Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We were the first bank in the Kingdom, established in 1926; hence, we clearly are grounded in, and are an integral part of, the development of the Kingdom. For about 30 years, we were the only bank in Saudi Arabia, and for part of that time we acted as the central bank to the Kingdom. We were also the first Saudi bank to facilitate a transaction with Aramco. Moving to today's day and age, we are an active player in supporting SMEs, the development of which is crucially important to the Saudi economy. The recent announcement of the set-up of a ministerial commission to support the development of SMEs is a clear sign of the importance attached to these companies. Amongst others we support the development of SMEs by being a major player in the Kafala guarantee scheme for SMEs, but we also provide non-financial support to help SMEs in their growth and development. In addition to SMEs, we are also active in supporting Saudi families in owning their home. We were one of the first two banks to work with the Real Estate Development Fund (REDF), with the aim of providing additional financing to Saudi nationals so they can own their homes. We continue to be an active player in that space, working with the REDF and government institutions on a range of initiatives to increase home ownership among Saudi families. Additionally, we support the training and professional development of Saudi nationals. We have a long established and well-regarded training and development program for fresh Saudi graduates through which we integrate them into the bank. As part of our corporate social responsibility agenda, we also, for example, work with Microsoft on developing programming skills in the Kingdom. It has become a significant and successful program, and it is something that we continue to invest in. </p><h4>As the government-funded projects start to slow down, what synergies can develop between the banking and private sectors?</h4><p>Investments will continue, as the government has said many times, and will in my opinion primarily concentrate on energy, water, education, and the medical sector. Major opportunities will arise in privatization and PPPs, which is something that the government has already alluded to. We have already seen PPPs for the water and energy sectors, and it is logical to expect to see it happen in other sectors in the future as well. At that point, synergies would develop between the banking and private sectors, as banks will play a major role in financing those partnerships. The same is true for outright privatizations, where banks will provide financing to the companies providing the privatized services. </p><h4>What are your goals and expectation for 2016 as Saudi Hollandi Bank?</h4><p>As we have done throughout our almost 90-year history, we will continue to focus on meeting our customers' requirements, across retail, small, medium and large corporates. By meeting those requirements, we are confident we will be able to deliver yet another year of strong performance. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The city of Mecca is undergoing a massive process of expansion. What sectors offer major opportunities for local and foreign investors in the city?</h4><p>The Saudi Vision 2030 aims to boost the Kingdom's hospitality industry by more than half and attract 1.5 million tourists by 2020. Therefore, I believe that the sector offering major opportunities is the Haj and Umrah sector and its related logistic support services, such as housing and hospitality, food and beverage, transportation, retail and “Made in Mecca" products. Productive individuals in the city can benefit from the increasing number of pilgrims and visitors. We are also extending our support trying to reduce unemployment in the Mecca region in particular and the Kingdom in general, which is in accordance with the Vision 2030 plan of the government. Our chamber organized a career day, on which graduates of colleges and technical institutes in Mecca signed contracts for 300 jobs. The aim of the career day event was to serve the community in Mecca and this was made possible thanks to the 85 local companies that participated in the event and offered job opportunities to those who had just graduated from their colleges and technical institutes.</p><h4>The Cabinet of Ministries just established the Public Authority for Small and Medium Enterprises. How do you envision the future for SMEs in the Mecca region?</h4><p>The Public Authority for Small and Medium Enterprises is an extremely promising step for young entrepreneurs, especially in the Mecca region, and there are many industrious people aiming to produce Mecca-made products. We are marking the current year as “The Year of Productive Families" to extend support to these families and their handmade products by allocating special sections at various events. Families in Mecca have interesting products that include not only food items but also clothing and handcrafts. In December 2015, the Mecca Chamber of Commerce and Industry launched a webpage on Alibaba.com, which is the largest online commercial platform in the world. The platform will increase commercial activities between various targeted sectors and will move businesses from traditional sales methods to the electronic domain. The platform will open great horizons for businessmen and productive families, cut down on expenses of distribution and promotion, and shorten travel distance from production sites to consumers. Local families can promote the “Made in Mecca" project through the website, giving it a global outlook, and their products international reach. The project is aimed at providing for the needs of pilgrims and visitors for material manufactured in Mecca such as souvenirs to keep as lifelong mementos from the Holy Land.</p><h4>HRH Mohammed bin Salman said recently the Kingdom is experiencing a “more certainly Thatcher revolution." What opportunities will arise for the private sector with this privatization process that the government intends to implement?</h4><p>The private sector will flourish with the inclusion of the private sector to new business opportunities such as transportation infrastructure and the oil industry.</p><h4>What measures will the MCCI implement to support companies in light of the recently announced Vision 2030?</h4><p>We are embracing all commercial and industrial communities to engage in the Vision 2030 workshop and concentrating on the strength of the Islamic background of Mecca.</p><h4>As Secretary General of MCCI, what are your expectations and goals for 2016?</h4><p>My goal is to raise the number of active members in the chamber to 30,000. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Despite the challenges that Saudi Arabia's economy is going through, what are the main elements that bring optimism to the country?</h4><p>Despite the challenges, the economy continues to grow and last year it grew by 3.4%, as both oil GDP and non-oil GDP sectors have generated positive growth even with the sharp fall of oil prices. The government's ability to finance fiscal deficit is met through withdrawal from the its huge official reserves and by tapping into capital markets and issuing debt, as it did last year and more likely will continue to do this year. These factors allowed businesses to maintain a good level of optimism despite the fact that the Kingdom's economy has moderated in comparison with previous quarters or years. The non-oil sector is more affected by government spending and readiness to finance deficits than by oil price changes, and that is why we are seeing the level of optimism still holding, yet lower than previous years. Overall, there is a fair level of optimism at present within the Saudi Arabian economy.</p><h4>In which sectors are you witnessing more optimism?</h4><p>Optimism varies across different sectors. Manufacturing was the least positive given that the manufacturing sector is highly dominated by petrochemicals and plastic, which are mostly affected by falling oil prices. The transportation sector had the highest optimism at 37 points, while manufacturing got 22 points. There are some variations between the different sectors. The real estate sector, for example, showed some level of optimism and this is influenced by the recent policies taken by the government to deal with the challenges facing this industry and by the different programs that were initiated by the Ministry of Housing and various banks to stimulate individual home ownership.</p><h4>What has to be done in the public and private sectors to actualize these opportunities?</h4><p>There are several factors within the government to consider, but there are also other issues that are not necessarily within the government's control. Falling oil prices are something that the government will be subjected to, and it will just have to accept it and deal with its consequences. If the Kingdom were to change its oil policy and defend the price versus market share then that would be another issue, as it would have to be done in collaboration with other producers in OPEC or even outside of OPEC, such as Russia. In the medium term, we are awaiting the launch of the National Transformation Plan. A workshop already took place sometime in January but the plan has not been rolled out yet. Once the plan is implemented the government will move toward more privatization and offloading some of its assets to the private sector and to the appetite of investors. The latter will be encouraged by a public campaign to explain and demonstrate the benefits of this economic transformation to citizens. The plan is intended to reform the Saudi economy and to expand the private sector, lessening the role of the government and making it a more effective regulator. All production had to go to the private sector because it is more efficient and less bureaucratic. Saudis holding some of their wealth outside the Kingdom will start to repatriate some of their net worth, and we will see increasingly large volumes of FDI.</p><h4>Do you think the country has already done everything possible to make the economy more attractive to potential investors?</h4><p>The government has taken some of the necessary steps, but there is surely more to be done. The most urgent of these relate to the legal system, the regulatory framework, and the enforcement of commercial courts. If these things were taking place more regularly, it would provide more comfort to foreign investors. Of course, they would look to the quality of infrastructure and quality of labor force also, and these issues would require important consideration by government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your strategy to support the private sector in light of Vision 2030?</h4><p>Vision 2030 was aimed at weaning the Kingdom off oil, putting the private sector in the driver's seat to play a bigger role in driving industrial growth in the country. The Eastern Province is the most important industrial area of Saudi Arabia, contributing 60% to GDP and representing around 90% of the country's oil and non-oil exports. Asharqia Chamber's first and foremost strategy is to work in line with the ambitious Vision 2030 to enhance the further growth of industries in the region. Vision 2030 focused on the important role of the private sector, which currently contributes around 40% to GDP. The government is set to open up new investment opportunities, facilitate investment, encourage innovation and competition, and remove all obstacles preventing the private sector from playing a greater role in the development of the country's economy. The Saudi leadership has also promised to continue to improve and reform regulations, paving the way for investors and enabling the private sector to undertake the responsibility of providing some key services in a wide range of sectors including healthcare, municipalities, housing, finance, and energy, which are currently provided by the public sector.</p><h4>In 2017, Saudi Aramco is expected to expand and diversify operations. What impact will this have on the Eastern Province, the world's petrochemicals hub?</h4><p>With the planned sale of 5% of Saudi Aramco through IPO, the oil giant is set to break into new areas of financing under Vision 2030. This sweeping reform will be conducive for Aramco to transform itself from an oil and gas firm into a global industrial conglomerate. The national company will now be involved in many sectors and services, using its vast financial resources to create jobs and help diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil. This will have a great impact on increased trade and business in the Eastern Province since the reform agenda includes a plan to set up a restructured public investment fund, worth $2 trillion, by including the proceeds from Saudi Aramco's IPO, other assets of $600 billion, and state-owned real estate and industrial assets estimated at $1 trillion. This huge fund will bode well for enormous new investments in the region's oil, gas, and petrochemical industries. Saudi Aramco has already established a large-scale petrochemical joint venture with Dow Chemical to produce over 3 million tons of petrochemical products in Jubail. With this huge complex and dozens of other new projects in the pipeline, total petrochemical products in the kingdom are expected to reach 115 million tons in the near future.</p><h4>With the new government's plans, many investments are expected to flow into the country. What opportunities does this provide for the private sector?</h4><p>In the wake of Vision 2030, which is focused on a diversified economy away from oil, the private sector is set to play a key role in industrial growth with prospects for huge investments. The government has planned a number of structural reforms, which include stimulating private-sector investments, building a comprehensive database of the country's resources, reviewing licensing procedures, and developing funding methods. The government will also form strategic international partnerships and raise the competitiveness and productivity of national companies. These measures will enhance the private sector's growth, as well as support the localization of knowledge and expertise. The government will further pursue public-private partnerships, continue to facilitate the flow of private investment, and improve competitiveness with a plan to review current regulations with the aim of improving the business environment. The government is to create special zones in exceptional and competitive locations, taking into account the comparative advantages of the Kingdom's different regions, assessing their feasibility for promising sectors such as logistics, tourism, industry, and finance. All these realistic steps will be supportive to the growth of private sector in line with government's plan to move the country's economy from its current position of 19th in the world to 15th by 2030. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the importance of the newly established SME Authority for the future of SMEs?</h4><p>We believe the country needed an organization like the SME Authority. The head of this organization was our partner for the last event that we had here in Jeddah with entrepreneurial leaders. This organization will play an important role in the future, as more than 90% of our members are SMEs. These companies can play a key role in the future economy if we define the right regulations and environment to help them grow. This government authority will add tremendous value to increase the capacity and capability of SMEs.</p><h4>What are the main challenges faced by SMEs and how do you support entrepreneurship?</h4><p>There are many challenges. The first is the regulations; it is important to have clearer rules. The rules and conditions have to be right and easy to understand for entrepreneurs. In terms of personality and know-how, it is not only about deciding to open a business; there are also basics to it. We work with two types of people: those who already have their own establishment and are a member of the chamber, and those who would like to enter the business sector. We try to help the people who are already on board and we assist them to increase their knowledge and understanding of the future, where to go, and how to comply with the conditions and rules of the government. The public sector, especially the Ministry of Trade and Labor, works rapidly. The private sector, especially the SME segment, is slow and faces many challenges. From time to time we have new regulations and business owners are not aware of how to deal with them as they do not have the know-how or capacity. This is why they face problems from time to time and many firms end up closing down.</p><h4>Do you have specific goals or expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We have a plan for four years until 2018 that was approved by the board of the Chamber of Commerce. All our initiatives are related to our members, of which we have more than 80,000. We have witnessed the number of members increasing. People say there is a recession; however, the growing number of businesses astonishes me. This should be studied carefully to understand. There may be some activities and services that we used to import but with a change in mentality we can start to do more ourselves because there is a need to establish businesses locally to attain cheaper prices. There are golden opportunities but we need to work out how to find them. In 2015 we held 1,260 events, and in 2014 it was 850. There is a reaction from our committee and there are activities and events. At the Chamber of Commerce we have initiatives and one of the most important is an online program to help SMEs diagnose their firm online; there are 120 questions and members then receive a complete diagnosis of their firm in terms of human resources, operations, marketing, finance, and law. This was launched last September and is called “Validity Check." This program was first used by the Australian Chamber of Commerce in 2013. We signed a contract agreement with it and implemented it in Saudi Arabia, making us the first chamber in the Arab world to implement it. It will be helpful for those SMEs that want to work with us. The businesses run the report and then fix the required areas free of charge. The other program we opened is a customer service center. This is the first for the chamber as we would like to be customer focused. There are many initiatives coming related to our members. If we increase and empower those firms they will get bigger and contribute further to the economy and society whilst continuing to increase profits. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your strategy to help the private sector participate in the government's Vision 2030?</h4><p>The private sector views Vision 2030 as an ambitious vision that will achieve a significant leap as far as the business sector is concerned, provided it is implemented in accordance with the right mechanisms. The participation of the private sector in planning and implementing the vision is a given. Generally speaking, this development-centered vision will have a positive impact on the private sector, which consists of and works alongside citizens. Moreover, the vision will increase investment opportunities and profitability through the development projects that will be implemented to achieve it. Some tend to think the private sector will not need a strategy to support itself, but the CSC believes that supporting the private sector can be elevated and increased in two ways. The first is through information by highlighting the trade and investment returns expected during the process of implementing the vision. This will require organizing workshops and forums and providing consultation to private sector agencies. The second is assisting on the regulatory side of the private sector's involvement in implementing the vision to enable the private sector to fully integrate with other sectors and within itself, noting that competition is a positive thing and has a positive impact on overall productivity, which is what dominates the business sector in general.</p><h4>How does the council plan to transfer know-how, technology, and capital to boost the petrochemical and defense sectors and help companies seize opportunities?</h4><p>The four factors of production—labor, organization, technology, and capital—are important to us as representatives of the private sector. Transferring know-how, technology, and capital has been a priority for the CSC since its creation, long before Vision 2030. We work to achieve this through organizing forums and meetings that are held occasionally between Saudi businesspeople and their counterparts worldwide either within or outside the Kingdom. Besides the investment guides offered by the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) and other financial and sector institutions within and outside the Kingdom, we rely on face-to-face meetings between Saudi businesspeople and their counterparts, which we consider more effective.</p><h4>What opportunities await the private sector with the privatization process the government intends to implement?</h4><p>All large investments will be implemented by the private sector. The Saudi government does not hinder the private sector's involvement in these projects. There are various opportunities categorized as construction-related opportunities and operations-related opportunities. The tourism sector is a promising services sector in the Kingdom, starting from the contracting process, which entails several tasks from implementing facilities to providing hospitality, living standards, and accompanying services, in addition to transportation, which all require development and more construction. That is where the private sector's importance lies as it provides these services. Moreover, once construction is completed, there will be a need for efficient operation by the private sector, which has expertise in this area.</p><h4>The Cabinet of Ministries just established the Public Authority for Small and Medium Enterprises. What is the future of SMEs in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>SMEs represent over 90% of businesses worldwide. Many countries have revitalized their economies through SMEs as they present a pathway toward commercial and investment success. The Kingdom is keen on the SME sector, as reflected in statistics. SMEs represent around 98% of overall businesses in the kingdom, with a capacity up to 70% of its workforce. Therefore, establishing the Public Authority for Small and Medium Enterprises was a good step, although its impact will be revealed in the near future as to what it will offer and contribute to enhance the future of SMEs. We estimate that there will be plenty of opportunities for SMEs in the future, but that will require some kind of integration among businesses to help them seize these opportunities and, in turn, increase the growth rate of SMEs. The future will be much brighter once significant challenges, such as lack of coordination, cooperation, and integration are overcome. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Visitor figures to Mecca are increasing rapidly. What levels do you predict moving forward?</h4><p>In 2015 we had 6 million overseas visitors for Umrah and about 3 million for the Hajj. We also had about 12 million visitors from within Saudi Arabia, making up around 20-21 million visitors in total. In 2016, the government will introduce a different approach. The number of Umrah visitors will be increased because now most of the infrastructure in Mecca can accommodate up to about 30 million people. This means that from 2016 the real number of visitors from outside the Kingdom will increase by 50%. This is the government's target. The city is ready, but the number of visitors we receive depends on the economic situation in other countries around the Islamic world where our visitors come from. For example, Indonesia is one of the most important origins of pilgrims and is in a good economic situation, but if that changed it would affect visitor numbers.</p><h4>What are the highlights of ongoing large projects in Mecca in the real estate and construction sector?</h4><p>In the real estate sector we have various megaprojects under way to improve the informal settlement areas. There are about 55 such areas in Mecca where sanitation conditions need to be improved. Some of these areas are only 400m from the Holy Mosque and the value of the land there is high. We have started to develop these areas, with the first four projects expected to commence in 2016. Some 10 such areas have been cleared to start a project called King Abdul Aziz Road. This is a 4km stretch of road being built by the private sector. Other opportunities are in the services sector because our visitor numbers are set to double in the next few years. This number may even be tripled or quadrupled in five years, potentially to 25 million visitors. This will require a great deal of services in catering, guides and tours, hotels, and private transportation. All these services will boom and they should be provided 100% by businesses in the private sector. The government should only be involved in granting the required licenses and visas for these activities.</p><h4>What plans and new regulations do you aim to implement to enable Mecca's transition into a smart city?</h4><p>Our vision for Mecca is to become a smart and green environment and one of the most livable cities in the world by 2025. It is a challenging program. We started the process for a project to build the first 400 MW solar energy plant here. We completed the bidding process and the winning contractor was ACWA Power. However, with falling oil prices this project has been postponed. The drive for renewable energy will be re-launched through the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy. Furthermore, Mecca is one of the few cities that could start this process again economically. One of the problems up until now has been with the Saudi Electricity Company because it has not yet introduced smart meters. Between 2016 and 2018 it plans to switch around 3 million houses in Saudi Arabia to smart meters. The benefit is that if energy is generated from solar panels, wind power, or any other home source, this goes into the power network and the household is compensated for it. This will encourage people to use renewable energy sources.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for Mecca in 2016?</h4><p>We are working to complete the road network in Mecca. We started a huge program in 2013 to complete the city's four ring roads. By 2016, 80% of this project will be completed and we will start on a new access road that will take people direct from Jeddah to haram and from Medina to haram. That will commence in 2016. We also hope that the first signs of Mecca's transformation to a smart, green city will be evident by 2020. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the regulatory environment for business in the kingdom?</h4><p>The Kingdom is home to one of the world's most progressive regulatory environments for doing business. All sectors are open except for those related to national security. We allow 100% foreign ownership in most sectors, with no income, sales, or property taxes. Companies can enjoy a competitive corporate tax rate and the full repatriation of profits, capital, and dividends. The government is committed to maintaining this, as well as introducing new initiatives to support the Kingdom's business-friendly environment. Most recently, we announced that retailers and wholesalers will be able to own 100% of their business in Saudi Arabia. With other national programs to make our economy more competitive on the horizon, I anticipate that this trend of increasing the ease of doing business in the Kingdom will continue.</p><h4>What are the sectors that offer the best opportunities for local and global investors?</h4><p>Due to Saudi Arabia's demographics and its unique location on the map, almost all sectors are open for business and have great opportunities for both local and international investors to enjoy. The Kingdom has a population of approximately 31 million with significant purchasing power. It also has a young population, with 70% under the age of 30. In many currently developing sectors, investors have the chance to gain significant domestic market share before their competitors. Using the Kingdom as their launch pad, investors and companies can expand their reach. Riyadh is a two-hour flight from 150 million people and a four-hour flight from a total of 1.5 billion people in some of the world's fastest growing consumer markets. With these facts in mind, there is a clear and lucrative export opportunity for established companies in Saudi Arabia. As part of our economic diversification strategy, however, there are a number of priority sectors in which we focus on to attract investments through leveraging spending. This integrates the value chain and increases the competitiveness of the Kingdom's sectors. Under the National Investment Plan (NIP), we have worked with a number of government ministries to harness their annual spending. With each, we have created, or are creating, investment plans that identify investment opportunities vis-í -vis annual ministerial procurement practices. These opportunities are worth hundreds of billions of dollars. For example, in the transportation and healthcare sectors alone we have investments worth approximately $400 billion for the coming decade. You can also expect to see similar opportunities in industrial spare parts, downstream chemicals, ICT, and much more. To enjoy these opportunities, we invite foreign and local companies to make direct investments in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What are the main guidelines of SAGIA's plan to increase competitiveness in specific sectors?</h4><p>It is important for SAGIA and Saudi Arabia to have a positive reciprocal relationship with our local and international investors. For those investors who want to help us add value to the Saudi economy, we want to help them add value to their business here in the kingdom. As part of the RFP process in government entities for megaprojects, we advocate that companies submit localization plans as part of their proposals. These plans will be taken into close consideration when evaluating the overall strength of each proposal. We believe this approach is the right one and it will be mutually beneficial for all parties involved. For investors in particular, the immediate financial benefit of many investment opportunities is only the beginning. The transportation sector illustrates this. Many of its investment projects are developing a single set of manufacturing standards that will be used henceforth. The Jeddah and Mecca metro projects are an example of where this “common envelope" has been found. These same specifications will be used in all Saudi metro projects moving forward. We are taking this approach for other investment projects where appropriate. The company that decides to invest early on will be the first in line to enjoy a steady stream of business from subsequent projects using the same standards for years to come. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>During your visit to Riyadh, the two governments signed nine cooperation agreements. Which sectors promise higher potential for cooperation?</h4><p>We were looking to find greater opportunities for rapprochement and economic relations in fields such as energy, infrastructure, and trade, fields in which both countries have great potential. There are several sectors in which, derived from our meetings with Saudi business and government sectors, we have identified potential business opportunities. By the nature of both countries and productive vocations, one of the first sectors where we believe we can collaborate is the energy sector. It is worth mentioning that the requirement for local content (it must begin at 25% in 2015 to advance to 35% by 2025) that we have established for the hydrocarbons industry is relatively low, compared with the level of local content established by other countries, such as Brazil, where it can be up to 80%. Other sectors that in recent years have seen significant growth are construction and infrastructure. Mexico and Saudi Arabia are generating a large number of infrastructure projects. The Saudi construction sector is considered the largest in the Middle East due to the expenditure that is done on infrastructure projects, which attracts foreign investors to establish new enterprises or joint ventures with local companies. Both countries are directing their efforts to develop projects that add technology, such as IT, telecoms, and multimedia, and add to the transfer of knowledge, such as education, life sciences, and healthcare. On the other hand, there are opportunities to supply the Saudi market with various consumer products, as they can be furniture home and office, lighting, textiles, and food. In this sense, Mexico is exporting agro industrial products and Saudi Arabia is one of the most important buyers of food in the world. Coffee, fruits, vegetables, and other foods are Mexican products that can participate in the Saudi market. We are considering the halal market as an important potential market. Mexican firms are certifying different products to serve this market, such as hamburger meat, sesame seeds, dehydrated products as egg yolk, tomato, and organic and inorganic chemicals used in small quantities for food and fishery products, among others.</p><h4>What Mexican sectors offer the most investment opportunities to investors in Saudi Arabia?<br></h4><p>We have opened some areas of our economy to private sector participation that were previously closed or were state monopolies. The energy reform undoubtedly enhances the opportunity to exploit our energy resources with private-sector participation and investment from fraternal countries, which also have experience in these fields. Our energy reform opens up the oil, electricity, petrochemicals, gasoline retail trade, and gas distribution sectors for both domestic and foreign investment for the first time in 75 years. Furthermore, the reform expands from 49-100% the participation of foreign investment on the construction of oil pipelines and on oil and gas well drilling. There is plenty of space and facilities to invest and do business in the Mexican energy sector upstream, downstream, and midstream. In telecommunications, up to 100% FDI will be permitted in telecommunications and communication via satellite together with up to 49% in broadcasting, so global IT companies are already investing in Mexico. Particularly, I would like to refer to the investments of the Saudi sovereign fund, which is a major business opportunity. This allows us to implement strategic partnerships to finance productive and infrastructure projects and it can be used in Mexico through the Fibra E, a financial vehicle to attract investment for any company, whether public or private, to develop infrastructure projects in several sectors. Also, it could be feasible to generate new operating companies in the energy sector through a joint venture scheme between Pemex and Aramco. Tourism, infrastructure and real estate development are areas with enormous investment opportunities. Mexico is already among the top-10 tourist destinations in the world; for example, in 2015 more than 5,000 Saudi visitors enjoyed Mexico's beaches and hospitality. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways can Jordan and Saudi Arabia cooperate to mutually benefit the national economies and increase trade?</h4><p>In the long run, Jordan and Saudi Arabia can reach a single market status, where freedom of movement is guaranteed for people, capital, goods and services. Moreover, the two countries should have by that time completed the infrastructures required to bind their economies in a most efficient manner. If we look at the potential of the two countries, we see that each has its comparative advantages. If investments are streamlined, then we can create partnerships on both sides where the imports of one are offset by profits generated for the other. Benefits of cooperation are not only limited to the production of goods, but also in the production of services, such as healthcare, tourism, logistics, transportation, Red Sea naval transport, and technological research. I believe that if we look closer, we will be both intrigued by the plethora of opportunities to enhance exchange between Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and which are still waiting to be tapped. </p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of collaboration between the two kingdoms in terms of ensuring regional security?</h4><p>Let us look at the geopolitical situation of Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Jordan is situated on the borders of the Gulf region and the Saudi Arabian borders are Jordan's longest. Iraq, Syria and historical Palestine are Jordan's neighbors. The Iranians have at this time a sphere of influence which reaches both Syria and Iraq. On the other hand Saudi Arabia faces the same Iranian hegemony in Iraq and Yemen. Both countries also face the potential of new wars unless the Palestinians gain their historical and sovereign rights in the West Bank and Gaza. Terrorism is also a danger lurking behind our direct borders. It also could pose a threat until we uproot its sources, particularly poverty and unemployment. Both countries, and with a close cooperation with the Gulf States, can build a solid political, military, and economic front that can withstand these potential dangers. We both should foster our relations for our future security and prosperity. </p><h4>What are the major short-term goals regarding Jordanian-Saudi bilateral relations? </h4><p>As some may recall, 2016 witnessed a qualitative shift that we, in Jordan, hope will be translated into tangible agreements in our bilateral relations and physical institutional presence, which can further our cooperation. The visit of His Royal Highness Prince Mohammad Ibn Salman to Aqaba and meeting with His Majesty King Abdullah II produced a joint communiqué where both countries agreed to embark on mutual feasible mega-projects. Later, HM King Abdullah II travelled to Saudi Arabia and met with his Brother the Custodian of the two Holy Mosques King Salman Ibn Abdel—Aziz and a MoU was issued, calling for greater cooperation in all areas of human endeavor. In Jordan, we passed a law titled Jordan Investment Fund, where amenities and exemptions are offered to big projects needed in Jordan and leading to the strengthening of mutual relations. The law specifically referred to railroads, and pipelines, electricity connection and others. We have already set in motion the creation of a multi—billion dollar corporation which will be open mainly for Saudi and other Gulf Sovereign Funds, Private banks and institutional investors as well as individuals. All projects will be subject to feasibility tests and will produce profits to investors. The government of Jordan is preparing a number of agreements in the fields of energy, agriculture, transportation, industry, investment, double taxation, and projects to be all discussed by the Coordination Committee headed by HRH Prince Mohammad Ibn Salman and the Prime Minister of Jordan, Dr. Hani Al-Mulki. We look forward to a high level meeting when these agreements are signed, and when the multi—billion cooperation is created in 2016 to start implementing the mega projects needed to put our mutual relations on a wider, longer, and deeper track. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is Saudi Arabia's investment in refining and petrochemicals?</h4><p>For countries with crude oil reserves, it is important to look at ways and means to gain further value beyond just exporting crude oil. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has taken significant steps to diversify its petroleum sector with a major focus on establishing synergies between upstream and downstream businesses and becoming a major supplier of high-quality refined products. This expansion of its refining and petrochemical business is taking place both at home and overseas. For example, there are the start-ups of large refineries in Jubail and Yanbu, the development of a new grassroots refinery in Jazan Industrial City, as well as an expansion at Saudi Aramco's Petro Rabigh complex and the development of a clean fuels project at its Riyadh refinery. These projects will not only help to meet the growing demand for petroleum products in Saudi Arabia, they will also increase the country's export capabilities. Overseas, it has refining and petrochemical joint ventures and interests in countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, and the US. These strategic international business relationships give the country more opportunities for growth and diversification in petrochemicals and refining, as well as other related industry sectors.</p><h4>How important has Saudi Arabia's spare production capacity been and how important will it be in the future?</h4><p>Over the decades, Saudi Arabia has maintained significant levels of spare production capacity as a means to help balance and stabilize the market. On many occasions this—and spare capacity elsewhere—has proven to be important in terms of helping overcome any supply disruptions caused by such issues as weather-related or geopolitical events. OPEC has always looked to ensure that there is ample production and sufficient spare capacity, benefiting producers and consumers alike and enhancing stability. The important role of spare capacity will no doubt continue in the future.</p><h4>How does Saudi Arabia benefit from being part of OPEC and how does the organization benefit from having Saudi Arabia among its members? </h4><p>All our member countries benefit from being part of OPEC. The organization helps with coordination and cooperation among all of its members. It provides data, information, and analysis on the oil market outlook and other key industry issues. It also helps to ensure the stabilization of oil markets in order to secure an efficient, economic, and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers, and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry. Saudi Arabia is a founding member of OPEC, has hosted a number of OPEC ministerial conferences, has held the OPEC Conference Presidency on several occasions, and afforded the organization a secretary-general in the 1960s. It also hosted the Third Summit of OPEC Heads of State and Government in 2007. It has contributed much to the organization. We respect and appreciate its support and input. And this goes for all member countries, each of which has a voice and whose views are important to the organization's present and future.</p><h4>How do you see the oil market outlook for 2016? </h4><p>We expect to see a more balanced market in 2016. We anticipate stronger economic growth next year, including oil demand growth of well above the 1 million barrels a day (bpd) level, a contraction in non-OPEC supply growth, and much stronger demand for OPEC's crude. We need to remain aware of challenges, including potential developments in the global economy and the overhang of stocks, which at the end of 2015 were well above the five-year average. It will also be important for all stakeholders to continue to work toward a more balanced market: producers and consumers, OPEC and non-OPEC suppliers, national oil companies, and international oil companies. This is essential for our industry's future and for all those consumers around the world who rely on hydrocarbon resources for their everyday needs. It will be vital to the future of those currently without access to modern energy services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The world economy is growing at a low pace though below potential. Only Saudi Arabia and Turkey have managed to deliver the commitment that G20 countries made in terms of achieving two percentage points higher growth by 2018. I am impressed by the improvement in the investment climate in Saudi Arabia and that is reflected in the kingdom's strong performance.</p><p>More recently, emerging markets have come under pressure. The Chinese economic slowdown is the single biggest threat and the slowdown is meaningful. That slowdown leads to significantly lower commodity prices and commodities exporters tend to suffer. Therefore, diversification becomes important and Saudi Arabia's work in diversifying its economy from hydrocarbons is extremely relevant.</p><p>As for Turkey, we have done well in the last decade. If you compare Turkey to other emerging markets (excluding China and India), Turkish GDP over the last decade has doubled in every single sense. We have created almost 7 million jobs and we have reduced poverty. Inflation is still high but in single digits. We have achieved a balanced budget last year at a year when we had two elections, which is quite a success. Finally, debt to GDP ratio is only 32% whereas in the EU is over 90% and 110% for OECD countries.</p><p>We have a comprehensive reform program and I think strong focus on structural reforms is the only way out for emerging markets. We have identified 25 transformation programs and are currently implementing them. We consider joining the European Union a positive step but it will not make a difference in our development plan if the joining did not take place. We are working on enhancing rights in Turkey and we aim to be the second strongest economy in Europe in the coming years particularly because we have a diversified economy.</p><p>We are working on enhancing the investment climate in Turkey. Saudis are now investing $15 billion in our country and they seek to double this amount in the near future. There are close to 800 Saudi companies investing in various economic sectors in Turkey. The major investment sectors are power, telecommunications, and real estate, with the former adding up to $6 billion investment. They are willing and ready to enhance and develop these investments. Saudi investors are welcome to approach Turkey instead of investing in Western countries. Also, Turkey can greatly contribute to Saudi Arabia's economic development. Saudi Arabia is today facing housing shortages. We were able to build 650,000 units in Turkey within six years. Turkey could provide up to 800,000 housing units in the kingdom within 10 years, if asked to participate in Saudi projects. We prefer to make agreements on government level to apply risk management. Turkey is willing to increase the level of investment in the kingdom, which currently stands at $30 billion.</p><p>Economic relations, trade, and investments between the two countries are improving but there is so much potential. Saudi Arabia is a great success story and so is Turkey. We are open for business and all we can do at the political level is to facilitate good business relations between the two nations but ultimately it is the business community that will make the difference.</p><p>In our part of the world, geopolitical risks are fairly significant. We were ignored previously in the region, but now we are working on enhancing our shared values, history, religion, and culture. There is pain in our region and we have clear policies that aim at ensuring stability in the region, part of which is not to intervene in the affairs of our neighboring countries. Our region is unfortunately going through tough period. Our geography is our destiny. We need to look decades ahead. However, it is noteworthy that today's EU, which is one of the most prosperous regions of the world, was built after World War II. So there is hope. We just need to work together; Saudi Arabia and Turkey have an excellent political relationship. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Mexico a growth market for Deloitte, and what is its potential?</h4><p>We are still an emerging economy, which is why we are considered a growth market. Our proximity to the US economy means that Mexico is going along. Macroeconomic conditions have been stable, inflation has been controlled for a long period of time, and our international reserves are meaningful. The US dollar has strengthened recently; however, Mexico does not hold much in US dollar deposits compared to other countries in Latin America. We shifted from being a country dependent on raw materials to manufacturing. Not long ago, 60% of Mexico's economy relied on oil exports, but that has now been reduced to 15%. Even in Chile, which has an important and stable economy, more than 50% of exports consist of primary goods rather than manufacturing. </p><h4>What are the biggest challenges for doing business in Mexico right now?</h4><p>Our core business is helping our clients. This does not necessarily mean solving problems, as we can also help tackle new challenges that may not necessarily be a problem; helping clients grow and evolve is a challenge; however, not a problem. Every quarter, we do a survey in Mexico of the major companies and executives, and one of the topics that we discuss is what the major challenges are. The top challenges for the top executives within the country are corruption and insecurity. These are not economic challenges, but rather social issues. The economy is doing well in spite of this, but these are the major concerns that our executives and entrepreneurs have. We have clients who are going overseas, and the economy is evolving so we need to cater to these new needs. We have been opening digital service lines so that retailers can interact with their customers following a multiple channel strategy. We are evolving technologically as a society, and Deloitte helps in this regard. We need to be much more aware of climate change issues; for such we have sustainability services whereby we help our clients reconcile their normal company strategy with one that assists the community and society all together. </p><h4>Is the level of corruption that people perceive in Mexico accurate?</h4><p>In our survey, when asked how they saw themselves a year ago compared to now, 50% of executives say they are doing better, and 71% say they foresee themselves better off a year from now. We are doing well, and even though corruption is a cancer in Mexico's economy, it is unfortunately everywhere in the world and is an issue that we need to tackle. The government is trying to address this now following high pressure from society that has resulted in steps being taken to address the problem. In 2015, we sponsored an economic event in Paris, and participants wanted to support and promote the Mexican economy. There was an international CEO of a Mexican subsidiary who said there may be corruption in Mexico, but we can do business without being corrupt. We have to bear in mind whenever we talk about corruption that there are two sides; the one being corrupted and the corrupting agent. </p><h4>Will the energy reform positively or negatively affect the international interest in Mexico?</h4><p>This reform would be much better if it came some years ago. That being said, it is still going to be good for Mexico. The dramatic decline in the price of oil impacts it, but these reforms go beyond the short term, and, in that regard, it will be beneficial. We expect more important investments in Mexico. There are companies interested, and it is going to ultimately be a welcome change. We need the same reforms to help us in having low prices for commodities such as gas, as that has also been helping our economy and curbing our inflation. It could have been better, but it is still a good move and will help our economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Dolphin Discovery grown to become the world's biggest dolphin company?</h4><p>The company was set up in 1994, and the people behind the company were Americans and not familiar with how things work in Mexico. I was their business advisor until 1998, when I joined fully. At the time, Cancún did not have the tourist industry that it has now; it was selective and it mostly catered to the US market before the arrival of the European and Spanish chains along the Mayan Riviera. When I joined the company, we prioritized expanding the experience that we provided to other places beyond Cancún, taking this holiday-highlight experience to the people instead of waiting for people to come to us.</p><h4>What were the challenges of expanding the swimming-with-dolphins concept into a larger business model?</h4><p>The main challenge is how to grow the business while safeguarding the wellbeing of the dolphins and never compromising on the care that we give them. That has always been our top priority and we have invested heavily in developing better ways to care for them, nurture them, and breed them. We now have the biggest breeding program in the world, and our dedication to R&amp;D has paid off, as the usual success rate in breeding dolphins is 50%; however, our success rate is 70%.</p><h4>What is unique about Dolphin Discovery's breeding program?</h4><p>First, breeding is a natural process for the animals. Instead of just letting them breed naturally, we decided to utilize a more sophisticated process where we select the dolphins we want to breed; we choose the season and the time of breeding to create families. We are able to control the process in a scientific and organized manner. When you breed your own dolphins you can plan your expansion better, as you know what is needed and what capacity you have.</p><h4>What percentage of your business is in the Quintana Roo region and what percentage is international?</h4><p>By the end of 2016, 50% of our business will be in Mexico while the rest will be overseas. Of that 50% in Mexico, 80% is in Quintana Roo. This is where we started, after all. One of my goals has always been to have at least as much business outside Mexico as inside Mexico.  There are all sorts of factors here, such as hurricanes and other natural disasters, climatic factors, and so on that can disrupt the business. Therefore, by diversifying and expanding to other places, we have been able to reduce the risks associated with relying on one single area, city, or region, which is why we opened our first park outside of Mexico in the British Virgin Islands.</p><h4>As Grupo Dolphin Discovery has expanded, have you kept the initial partners or have other partners come in to support the expansion?</h4><p>We just have the initial investors; no additional investors have come in over the years. This may change in the future, of course. We are open to anything. At the end of the day, the most important thing is the company and the business, which is why we have decided to invest in the US and European markets over the last year, having already become dominant in Mexico and the Caribbean.  </p><h4>What are your plans and goals for the next few years and what is your vision for the company in five years' time?</h4><p>If you had asked me five years ago where we would be today, I could not have imagined that we would be where we are today. However, what I would like to see in five years is further expansion in the leisure industry around the world into parks that are not necessarily dolphin parks. We would like to be present in major aquariums and other family entertainment centers and complexes. What I can say with confidence is that we will be one of the most important players in the industry in the coming years—I am sure of that. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the motivation to write a book about Mexico's UNESCO World Heritage sites?</h4><p>Mexico has many beautiful places to offer to visitors, many of them UNESCO World Heritage sites. My book was launched in November 2015. I started my personal trip by enjoying the magic of the celebrations of the Day of the Dead in November 2014 and the Monarch butterflies migration, mainly because these two events happen at a specific time of the year. I later drew up a plan to visit the rest of the geographical points in order to set up the tone of the book, which is written in a similar way to which we traveled: we follow a geographic trip from area to area. This way, the reader can feel as if they were traveling along. When traveling, I enjoyed many surprises and pleasures. You can read about these places, but I recommend visiting them. They are unique experiences in life; touching the whales, feeling them close enough to realize of their magnitude, seeing eagle nests close enough to see their babies. It is also important to highlight the investment made by UNESCO in these sites in order to train locals to become, for example, guides and technicians. They invest in protecting the areas and make them sustainable. </p><h4>What is your favorite UNESCO World Heritage site from Mexico?</h4><p>It is extremely difficult to choose one because we have the whales and butterflies experiences that have a natural component. In the book, for example, I describe all the particularities of the Monarch butterflies; how they exercise prior to their migration, how they train, how many kilometers they fly and its Matusalem generation. It is wonderful to get to know how they orientate themselves despite their short life. The wonders of nature are incredible. I mention the arabesque fountains and architecture of Chiapas de Corzo, an amazing city. I talk about the Parachicos, traditional dancers from Chiapas who dance on the streets of the town during the Great Feast festivity, which takes place from January 15 to 23 every year. The festivity takes place in honor of the local patron saints Our Lord of Esquipulas, Saint Anthony Abbot, and Saint Sebastian. It is claimed locally, as are many of the Catholic festivals in Latin America, to have its roots in the much older indigenous culture. Therefore, it has developed into a hybrid of old indigenous culture and newer Catholic and Spanish cultures. The church where the festival concludes is home to an old tree, which is claimed locally to predate the church, suggesting that this site was used for ceremonies before the arrival of Catholicism. The Historic Center of Oaxaca and the Archaeological Site of Monte Albán, the first urban center in America, are other great heritage sites. This is in fact one of the strongest points of all Mexico's UNESCO World Heritage sites: they hide plenty of history and anecdotes of how they come to be built and kept over the time. We have as many as 10 cities that have been declared UNESCO World Heritage sites, being the country with the third highest number of cities in the UNESCO list. The history of Puebla is also interesting, for the city was developed when the Mexican crown wanted to develop a kind of small town (Puebla) between Mexico City and Veracruz. The real name of the city was going to be Ángeles but the people insisted on maintaining the Puebla order of the Queen as part of the name. San Miguel de Allende enjoys a unique architectonical style made of the combination of the traditional local style with a sub-gothic style. On top of that, Mexico offers a unique level of service to its guests, and we are an extremely friendly country; service here is marvelous and people always want to make you feel unique. That is another reason why Mexico has a unique potential within the tourism industry and we need to work together to meet this potential. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company transitioned from Dolphinaris to Ventura Entertainment?</h4><p>In the late 1990s I began working on a project to build a water park in Cancún. The project included a swim-with-dolphins facility among other attractions; we started with Dolphinaris. Two years later, we decided to do the same at Riviera Maya, which has the most spectacular swim-with-dolphins experience in the world by far. After this success story we decided to come up with a business model for smaller satellite facilities that would operate inside bigger resorts. We built one at Bahia Principe Resort, which today is a 3,100-room hotel, and another in Barcelo Riviera Maya, as in 2013 a group called Ventura, a private equity fund, acquired a controlling interest in Dolphinaris with the idea of using it as platform to kick off its plan.</p><h4>What is the vision that you have together with Ventura?</h4><p>We wanted to be the number-one entertainment and amusement company in Mexico, and to use Dolphinaris as a platform to make that come true. Within a short period of time, we put Dolphinaris and another brands under the umbrella of Ventura Entertainment. The expansion did not stop there; after the first year, we acquired La Feria in Mexico City, then Selva Magica in Guadalajara, and Selvatica in Riviera Maya, which is a zipline in the middle of the jungle that has been ranked as the best outdoor activity by Trip Advisor in Mexico. We want to become the number one entertainment group in Mexico. We are a balanced and diversified company, both financially as well as when it comes to the kind of attractions and facilities we offer to our visitors. The attractions that we offer range from dolphin facilities to ziplines in the middle of the jungle, an incredible water park, and virtual reality worlds for the whole family.</p><h4>What is your strategy to become the number-one entertainment group in Mexico?</h4><p>We decided to make major investments in attractions and facilities, but we also understand that our expertise and the combined knowledge of the people we have is necessary for providing an excellent experience and service to our visitors. The people that used to work in the parks before the merger with Ventura Entertainment continue working with us. What we want is to have strong staff in the area of amusement parks such as La Feria, and to build multi-parks, as we did with Ventura Park. We are going to add attractions and expand our businesses in the largest Mexican cities and a number of locations in the US. Today, we have yearly 2.1 million visitors, but within 12 months we want to grow to over 3 million.</p><h4>Why did you decide to develop Ventura Park?</h4><p>In our experience, wave pool water parks are not enough; they do not deliver the same results as theme parks. We wanted to create a robust product good enough for the whole family. After some research, we came up with the idea of Ventura Park, a water park and dolphin swimming facility improved with ziplines and go karts on the Caribbean shore, and a family entertainment center with virtual reality and a beach club. We have had a good response from our visitors, considering tourists and the local market. People are happy, because we have changed the cement and steel look associated with old water parks and revitalized it.</p><h4>What are your plans for expansion to the US?</h4><p>We are doing two things. We are developing a dolphin facility in Arizona like the other Dolphinaris that we have in Mexico. We are also working on an aquarium called Odysea in the desert, which we want to become the best in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>It is my pleasure to present Saudi Arabia's Vision for the future. It is an ambitious yet achievable blueprint, which expresses our long-term goals and expectations and reflects our country's strengths and capabilities.</p><p>All success stories start with a vision, and successful visions are based on strong pillars.<br>The first pillar of our vision is our status as the heart of the Arab and Islamic worlds. We recognize that Allah the Almighty has bestowed on our lands a gift more precious than oil. Our Kingdom is the Land of the Two Holy Mosques, the most sacred sites on earth, and the direction of the Kaaba (Qibla) to which more than a billion Muslims turn at prayer.</p><p>The second pillar of our vision is our determination to become a global investment powerhouse. Our nation holds strong investment capabilities, which we will harness to stimulate our economy and diversify our revenues.</p><p>The third pillar is transforming our unique strategic location into a global hub connecting three continents, Asia, Europe and Africa. Our geographic position between key global waterways makes the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia an epicenter of trade and the gateway to the world.</p><p>Our country is rich in its natural resources. We are not dependent solely on oil for our energy needs. Gold, phosphate, uranium, and many other valuable minerals are found beneath our lands. But our real wealth lies in the ambition of our people and the potential of our younger generation. They are our nation's pride and the architects of our future. We will never forget how, under tougher circumstances than today, our nation was forged by collective determination when the late King Abdulaziz Al-Saud, may Allah bless his soul, united the Kingdom. Our people will amaze the world again.</p><p>We are confident about the Kingdom's future. With all the blessings Allah has bestowed on our nation, we cannot help but be optimistic about the decades ahead. We ponder what lies over the horizon rather than worrying about what could be lost.</p><p>The future of the Kingdom is one of huge promise and great potential, God willing. Our precious country deserves the best. Therefore, we will expand and further develop our talents and capacity. We will do our utmost to ensure that Muslims from around the world can visit the Holy Sites.</p><p>We are determined to reinforce and diversify the capabilities of our economy, turning our key strengths into enabling tools for a fully diversified future. As such, we will transform Aramco from an oil producing company into a global industrial conglomerate. We will transform the Public Investment Fund into the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. We will encourage our major corporations to expand across borders and take their rightful place in global markets. As we continue to give our army the best possible machinery and equipment, we plan to manufacture half of our military needs within the Kingdom to create more job opportunities for citizens and keep more resources in our country.</p><p>We will expand the variety of digital services to reduce delays and cut tedious bureaucracy. We will immediately adopt wide-ranging transparency and accountability reforms and, through the body set up to measure the performance of government agencies, hold them accountable for any shortcomings. We will be transparent and open about our failures as well as our successes and will welcome ideas on how to improve.</p><p>All this comes from the directive of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, may Allah protect him, who ordered us to plan for a future that fulfills our ambitions and your aspirations. In line with his instructions, we will work tirelessly from today to build a better tomorrow for everyone, their children, and their children's children.</p><p>Our ambition is for the long term. It goes beyond replenishing sources of income that have weakened or preserving what we have already achieved. We are determined to build a thriving country in which all citizens can fulfill their dreams, hopes and ambitions. Therefore, we will not rest until our nation is a leader in providing opportunities for all through education and training, and high-quality services such as employment initiatives, health, housing, and entertainment.</p><p>We commit ourselves to providing world-class government services that effectively and efficiently meet the needs of our citizens. Together we will continue building a better country, fulfilling our dream of prosperity and unlocking the talent, potential, and dedication of our young men and women. We will not allow our country ever to be at the mercy of a commodity price volatility or external markets. We have all the means to achieve our dreams and ambitions. There are no excuses for us to stand still or move backward. </p><p>Our Vision is a strong, thriving, and stable Saudi Arabia that provides opportunity for all. Our Vision is a tolerant country with Islam as its constitution and moderation as its method. We will welcome qualified individuals from all over the world and will respect those who have come to join our journey and our success.<br>We intend to provide better opportunities for partnerships with the private sector through the three pillars: our position as the heart of the Arab and Islamic worlds, our leading investment capabilities, and our strategic geographical position. We will improve the business environment so that our economy grows and flourishes, driving healthier employment opportunities for citizens and long-term prosperity for all. This promise is built on cooperation and on mutual responsibility.</p><p>This is our “Saudi Arabia's Vision for 2030." We will begin immediately delivering the overarching plans and programs we have set out. Together, with the help of Allah, we can strengthen the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's position as a great nation in which we should all feel an immense pride. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you develop a brand specifically targeting business travellers?</h4><p>There was an opportunity to develop a new hotel brand because the existing brands were just above the price point, leaving a market underserved. The GDP contribution from the tourism industry was about MXN1.2 billion ($84 billion), of which 17% was by foreigners, while the remaining 83% came from domestic Mexican consumption. The mission with City Express was to create a chain for the business traveller. We were also disruptive in terms of design. City Express hotels are modern, bright, practical, and efficient. The result was a product that resembles a high-end property but at a lower price than the competition. We introduced free extras that were not available at that time, such as free internet in the rooms, light colors, and sustainability later affirmed by a certification from the US building council. What we created at that price point was aspirational. The aspiration was not to have French chandeliers or marble at the core, but rather a youthful, good design with excellent service and great value. We established new standards for properties at this price. We had many things that people did not know and started to learn as we grew and created a brand image. We named it City Express, as it had to be a brand not tied to one place of origin. It was not clearly Mexican or American, but it could communicate well in both languages.</p><h4>To what do you attribute your rapid expansion over the past 14 years?</h4><p>We built an initial team that was strong and had more than 80 years' experience between five people. We knew exactly what had to be done and we were able to implement and deploy the resources that we raised at that time. We started in 2002 and our first property opened in 2003. We now have 106 hotels, with close to 12,000 rooms. We are normally 18 months ahead of what is going to happen. When we have the capital and do our own development, we can identify our land, do our designs, and control our destiny. </p><h4>Have agreements like the Pacific Alliance and TPP played a role in defining your expansion plans?</h4><p>Our expansion started before that, but we foresaw that it would happen and that interregional trade with Mexico would be important with a lot of crossover investments. There are many Chilean and Colombian companies coming to Mexico and investing, while there are many Mexican brands circulating in those countries. This reinforced that we were building the correct strategy. The TPP further reinforces the strategy even though the global economy has become increasingly volatile, with China not growing as expected and Latin American exports being mostly commodities, but Mexico's exports are 80% manufactured goods sent to the US and Europe. With the growth of the auto industry, companies are looking at Mexico as a manufacturing hub that can reach certain markets such as Europe and the US more efficiently; therefore, we predict that we will keep on growing at the same pace for the next few years whilst remaining cautious and selective regarding where to invest. There may be a cloud over the international scenario, but Mexico is well positioned with the structural reforms that have taken place. Some of them will not provide returns in the short term but will definitely change the face of society in Mexico, while others have begun to provide some material investment in terms of their impact. We are present throughout 29 states—soon to be 30 in more than 61 different cities, so we can sense what is happening across the different regions. We are present in the remote areas where there is important industrial infrastructure as well as in the major cities and locations in the country. We are an economy chain that can be present in the best of locations and in some places with specific markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you see as your biggest achievements so far as Secretary of Tourism?</h4><p>One year may seem like a short time in terms of policy; however, not only have we managed to maintain the good results of the three previous years, growth in the Mexican tourism sector actually accelerated in 2015. We had a record number of international visitors and a record amount of receipts from these visitors. Such a good performance took us from 10th to ninth place in the UNWTO global ranking in visitors, and from 22nd to 17th in terms of receipts. This dynamic allowed the tourism sector's contribution to GDP to grow by 3.8% in 2015, which is 52% faster than the Mexican economy as a whole. We have also launched important and specific initiatives, most importantly the Viajemos Todos por México program (Let's all travel through Mexico), which has an objective to promote growth through the better utilization of the installed capacity in the hotel and transportation sectors. Another initiative worth mentioning is Mejora tu Hotel (Improve Your Hotel), an innovative program to finance small and medium-sized hospitality companies, with loans backed by the Mexican Eximbank, BANCOMEXT, which will allow them to make the necessary investments to stay competitive in today's highly demanding tourism markets. </p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of the tourism sector for economic growth and poverty reduction?</h4><p>There is no doubt that tourism is, and should increasingly be, one of the driving forces of economic growth in Mexico. Right now, tourism accounts for around 8.5% of GDP, a larger share than sectors such as construction, primary activities, mining, financial services, and many others. In terms of employment, its role is even more important; as a labor-intensive sector it generates close to 4 million direct jobs, and the UNWTO estimates an additional 5.6 million indirect job positions. In the last decade alone, touristic activities created 1.2 million direct jobs, more than the dynamic automotive sector and more than all primary activities combined. Tourism is also a powerful tool for poverty reduction; it demands a high degree of labor from some of the population's most vulnerable sectors. It is the most important employer of young workers, with 20% of the total, it has the second highest proportion of female workers, with 56.8%, and it is the third largest employer in the southwest of the country, with 24.8% of the labor force. In some states with a high degree of marginalization, tourism contributes a higher share of GDP and gives its communities a greater chance of social improvement, a clear example of which is Guerrero, where the tourism sector represents 36% of GDP.</p><h4>What are your major plans and goals for Mexico's tourism sector for the next three years?</h4><p>Our main goal is increasing the role of tourism as one of the main transformational forces to achieve social development and improvement throughout Mexico. Through sound policies and innovative initiatives we can aspire to regain in a fairly short period of time the 9.3% share of GDP that the tourism sector had back in 2005. For that to happen, the sector must annually grow by one percentage point above the total GDP between 2015 and 2025, something that seems reasonable based on recent performance. A more ambitious but still achievable objective is to reach a contribution to GDP of 12%, like that of countries such as Spain. We are focused on challenges like increasing internal tourism flows through Viajemos Todos por México, also increasing the average spending of our international visitors, developing emerging niches in the industry such as medical, religious, LGBT, adventure tourism, and other segments. We also ensure that some of our destinations can reach their full potential and develop new ones. All of these are part of a coordinated effort to fulfill the mandate of President Enrique Peña Nieto of ensuring the benefits of tourism in terms of social and economic development reach more people in Mexico every year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the origins of UNLA?</h4><p>UNLA was founded in 1991 to create a new option for a different type of education than the ones that existed at the time. Our goal was to create a university with an inclusive approach, open to diversity in our people and their points of view. We wanted to have a local impact in the state of Michoacán first and then take our project further to other parts of Mexico and the world. Our model is based on a diversified education with a vast range of inspirations and points of view. We pursue internationalization and an interdisciplinary emphasis in our university; we want our students to learn other languages, develop a holistic vision, and embrace their profession. </p><h4>How has access to higher education changed in Michoacán since UNLA was founded? </h4><p>Before 1991, local students had to go to other parts of Mexico to study, causing a brain drain for our state. Now, we attract not only local students from Morelia, but from various other places, and this has greatly contributed to the development of Michoacán over the last 25 years. </p><h4>How do you integrate interdisciplinary studies into the day-to-day education experience of your students?</h4><p>Our students have the possibility to look at their reality through a lot of experiences and knowledge in many fields. To carry out this approach, we count on teachers trained in different disciplines to provide our students with a holistic view that incorporates the complexities of the world from every field possible, from law to economics and psychology, for example. We also promote a form of learning outside the classroom through activities that give our students the possibility to interact with others, involving them in different thinking, disciplines and methods of study. </p><h4>What is the importance of internationalization for UNLA?</h4><p>We have established relationships with different countries around the world. We have academic mobility with many countries in South America, the US, Canada, France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Iceland, Senegal, South Korea, and India. We send and receive students and teachers to and from other parts of the world. As expensive as it is, we want to propel academic mobility and bring students of other countries to UNLA to share their experiences with our students. Our global vision is one of our main assets since we do not focus on preparing our students for in-field work just in Morelia or Mexico, but for all around the globe.</p><h4>How many students take advantage of those opportunities to go abroad?</h4><p>Only around 5% of our students take advantage of these opportunities to study abroad. However, in order to make the rest of our students benefit from that feature of our academic model, we have implemented a “home internationalization program" in which we receive foreign students and teachers, through our strategic relationships with universities from around the world. </p><h4>What are the challenges related to establishing links with foreign universities?</h4><p>The main difficulties are the political and security problems Michoacán has experienced in the past eight years, so foreign education centers tend to have doubts before signing agreements with universities here. It is only after foreign universities have seen that Morelia is a beautiful and safe city, and that UNLA has academic and institutional accreditations, a good campus, a high level of academic programs, a robust pedagogic model, and the whole infrastructure that they agree to establish partnerships. </p><h4>What are your goals, and where do you want to see the university in five years?</h4><p>We will celebrate our 30th anniversary in five years, and we want to create new academic programs. We also want to develop more relations with other universities, and want to continue transforming society by collaborating with the public, private, academic, cultural and social institutions, not only in Morelia, but also throughout the entire region. We want a better scenario for Michoacán and are aiming at becoming a fundamental part of constructing that scenario. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the process of setting up the distillery?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CELIA VILLANUEVA MAESTRI </strong>We had to be here almost full-time; we were living in the office. It has been an adventure. We had to transform the distillery from the bottom to the top, which took almost five years. It was a good experience. We said that if we were going to do this, we were going to do this right and in the traditional way. Quality was our focus and we would never deviate from that, as it is quality that has made the company successful. Now, we have more than 100 brands in the market. </p><h4>Why did the process of setting up the distillery take so long?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MICHAEL MAESTRI: </strong>Our goal was not to reinvent the wheel, but to roll back time and make tequila the way it was traditionally made. We tried to purchase every machine from Mexico so that all of our products would be 100% Mexican. All of our employees are from Mexico except for myself, which proved to be a key to our success. There are ways to make tequila that are less expensive; however, we do it the traditional way. We cook the agave for 50 hours, whereas our competition might not cook it at all, but rather use a diffuser system. It is a different process that is much more efficient and gets more sugar out of it, but the flavor is different. It is not bad or wrong; it is just not the traditional way.</p><h4>What is involved in the process of developing a tequila brand for a private client?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JOSÉ VILLANUEVA</strong> The first thing to do is register the brand with the country's trademark office. Then, we determine what a client wants, how many bottles per case, and what alcohol content the client wants. Our engineers can make their flavor profile so that we do not have to ship samples back and forth. If they have a bottle and package in mind, they deliver it to us and we bottle it. Many times, though, customers do not have the time to purchase all of these materials and send it to us, so we do it for them. We present them bottles and caps and they choose and we price it all together. If they do not know what they want, we guide them. It is like a one-stop shop; we do as much or as little as the client wants.</p><h4>How important is the Asian market for you?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CVM </strong>We entered the Asian market around four years ago, and we have been growing in China and Japan over the past two years. There is a great deal of potential there; however, it is taking a little longer. Interestingly, though, it is the women in places like Hong Kong or other Asian countries that tend to enjoy tequila more than the men.</p><p><span></span><strong>MM</strong> The Philippines also has great growth potential because it has a Hispanic background. We are working with a group that has a small restaurant with the goal of teaching the local Philippine people about Mexican culture. We are selling a traditional spirit, but we are also selling the Mexican culture. </p><h4>What are the next steps for Casa Maestri?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MM</strong> We want to enter the Mexican market. The first place we will try to sell will be in the tourist areas. We feel we have an opportunity there. It will probably be to hotels, bars, and restaurants first, while at the same time we will try to get into chain stores. We have a few open-ended invitations. As far as general distribution, I am not sure if we will ever do that. We are more of a production company, so distribution is not our expertise. We are confident that the Mexican people will start to recognize our products over the next few years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has AGRANA played in the development of the berry industry in Michoacan? </h4><p>When we started operations in Zamora 30 years ago, this was a potato-growing region. We have spent 30 years building knowledge here. We have had support from the government and also a lot of local support from the former AGRANA companies. This area turned into a strawberry region. We have only one site in Mexico, but we work with several co-packers. Over the past 30 years, most of these have started as small facilities that worked for us, and many have grown to become full-fledged competitors. 30 years ago, only AGRANA was doing fruit preparations, whereas there are now more than 10 companies, between six and eight of which are local companies or companies that were sold later to other international companies. AGRANA helped them develop business models not only in the region of  Zamora in the state of Michoacan, but also in the state of Jalisco. </p><h4>How do you integrate eco-friendliness and sustainability into your operations and what impact does this have on the surrounding community? </h4><p>We work under different policies and systems. One is the sustainable production, which is obtained when we confirm with an external auditor or system that we are doing it the right way. Many of our farms are sustainable, and we implemented the same green-oriented production systems we have in Europe here in Mexico, saving energy and fuel. We are sustainable from the fruit in the field through operation, services, and social responsibility initiatives. Since beginning here, I have always told my staff that we are here to make more money for AGRANA, so AGRANA invests more money in Mexico to create more jobs in the Zamora-Jacona region. We represent a large part of the strawberry production in the Zamora-Jacona area and some neighboring cities where we also developed farmers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has your location played in the expansion of the company?</h4><p>In 1957, we began exporting tequila to the US, where the popularity of it and the margarita cocktail were growing. By this time, we were exporting tequila in wooden barrels sent by trucks, and it was an important volume for us. In 1968, I moved to Guadalajara, from where I started traveling extensively to call on all of our customers in the US in order to forge relationships with them and promote our tequila. Our aim has always been to make the best quality product that we can, and we put considerable effort into doing that. By 1973, we were the second largest bulk exporter of tequila to the US, after the Cuervo brand. We later broke through to the European market via Spain and Germany to expand our markets, where we had to educate the consumers because tequila was a new drink for Europe. Tequilas del Señor then began working on the South American, east European, and Asian markets teaching consumers the different ways of enjoying this elixir and the couture that is behind it. </p><h4>What is the process for branding your products?</h4><p>Each of our brands has its own history. Some started with the distillery, while others have been created or acquired over the years. We changed the name of the company from Rio de Plata to Tequilas del Patrón later to Tequilas del Señor, though the name of our distillery remained Rio de Plata. To help promote Reserva del Patrón, we personalized the labels, which was the first tequila for which we did that. The Sombrero Negro label has a Mexican Charro and Mariachi hat on it and is instantly recognized worldwide, as the emblem is excellent for representing both Mexico and tequila. It is also the brand that we sell most of in different markets around the world. I also sold the rights to the name Patrón to Patrón Spirits, and we then began using the name Tequilas del Señor instead.</p><h4>What challenges have you faced entering the Asian market?</h4><p>We are one of around 11 Mexican companies that have established their products in China. We started with Casa del Tequila, which we are part of, but we had our merchandise available before many others did. The challenge is to give the Chinese people a quality product and tastes that they are happy with, as well as to teach them how to drink it—tequila is drunk sip by sip, rather than drinking a large glass in one go and then not drinking any more. It is a different culture and, therefore, we have to work to make our brand stand out in this market. The Sombrero Negro brand sells well in China and the Philippines. We also have additional brands in China for different sectors, and we even created new labels for China. We use Mexican images but adapted to a Chinese style to suit the market there.</p><h4>What do you think makes the Tequilas del Señor brands different from larger international brands on the market today?</h4><p>We do not deliver the same volume as larger brands, and this gives us a different position in the markets we reach. We only produce between 2 million to 3 million liters each year, while the larger brands distribute 30 million or 40 million liters per year. We aim to produce the best product that we can and maintain quality. Our competitors have good quality and good products, but we try to be better than them while attending to all the parts of the production and sales process with passion and care. This is why we are in a different position in the global market. It is crucial that we maintain strong communication with our customers. Behind our customer there is another customer, and we are interested in how our product is received by that final consumer. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the agricultural sector for the economy?</h4><p>The agricultural sector in Mexico is a fairly large sector in terms of the amount of employment and also in terms of contribution to GDP. However, you have to look at the agricultural sector as a value chain. You have the primary activity, but you also have the transformation and also the commercialization and trading of those goods. The primary sector represents a little more than 3% of GDP. If you add the industrialization part, you reach more than 8.5% of GDP and if you add the trading part, you get closer to 20% of GDP. In terms of employment, the primary sector represents around 12% of the employment force. The agricultural sector in Mexico has been going through a strong structural transformation after the trade agreement with the US and Canada, NAFTA. Since then, Mexico has opened up and we have been going through a sharp change in the composition of our output. That is reflected in a strong and continuous growth in exports not only to the US and Canada, but to the world. Since NAFTA, we have been able to diversify our trading partners and that means Mexico has broadened and strengthened its production. </p><h4>What challenges face producers in this sector?</h4><p>We have challenges from the structure of our agricultural and rural sector and also challenges from the financial markets. Before the revolution, in the beginning of the 20th century there was a major change in the holding of land and it was concentrated in a few hands that were mostly idle. After the revolution, there was a sharing of those lands to small producers, which helps explain the high growth of 6% per year during the 20th century. Today, structuring land in small holdings has been a factor in limiting the economics of scale that agribusiness needs. Therefore, we have been working with what we have to generate those economies of scale, either by working with producers in cooperatives or associating them with larger industries that know the market and work and compete in the international markets. That is the way of being able to get these small producers the economies of scales they need to compete.</p><h4>Mexico is the third-largest berry producer in the world. What is behind the growth of that sector over the last 20 years?</h4><p>We have a tradition of producing berries, especially in Michoacán. We knew this product could be grown successfully in Mexico. When we opened to the world market, in the case of berries, consumers wanted fresh berries and the largest market for berries is the US. Large trading companies recognized the potential in Mexico and began coming here, financing some producers, to set up production. We are now reaching a different stage. The lands that were initially identified as ideal for activities were in Michoacán and parts of Jalisco are getting expensive. Most of these international trading companies are reaching the lending limit for producers, which is where FIRA enters. We can help finance producers so they can set up plantations with a contract of buying from a trading company and a contract of retention so that they retain payments to the financial intermediaries. I have seen some financial intermediaries getting into these activities after recognizing the potential of vegetables and livestock in Mexico, and the amount of lending to the agricultural value chain is starting to come from the largest banks in Mexico. The medium-sized banks started after the crisis; however, large banks have been participating in this sector only in the last three years. Some banks have set up special units for the agricultural sector. We are seeing the dawn of a strong increase in financing for the agricultural sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Mainland Farms play in the economy of Michoacán?</h4><p><strong>Alejandro Sahagún</strong> Mainland Farms and every other agricultural enterprise is a centerpiece of the economy in the state of Michoacán. In contrast to other states that have automotive or aerospace industries, there is no other relative economic activity in the areas we operate; this is the reason that makes Mainland Farms so relevant and every other agricultural industry with a presence in the area. As Mainland Farms, we now have the second largest strawberry export program in Mexico. We grant market access to many farmers at a higher level than they could previously attain. Among most of our competitors, we are always the first company to start a season and the last to end it. </p><p><span></span><strong>Jesús Valdés Aguirre</strong> We are a dynamic company and are always discussing how to improve the efficiency of our operation and how to make a better deal for our growers. In the end, the money that we generate through our sales stays here in Michoacán and reaches thousands of field-working families through our more than 400 growers. </p><h4>What are the main destinations for your exports?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AS </strong>The US and Canada make up 100% of our business, and we serve every major retail chain in both countries. We try to be the most efficient link between the fields in Mexico and the final consumer in North America in order to maximize both the freshness from our products and the profits for our producers in the region. When we first started, things were different, as most global companies only came here to take advantage of the production during wintertime and then leave. However, we wanted to develop a company for the mainland growers of Mexico, to work closely to their needs, and to provide them with sufficient resources to widen their market. We provide them with technical support; we assist them with all their employee food safety training and good agricultural practices required certifications and we also provide financing.</p><h4>What have been the biggest challenges encountered through this model?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AS</strong> There is a huge cultural barrier to efficiency and innovation oriented to productivity, quality, and food safety, as every grower is different, and we interact with growers of different crops throughout the different regions of Michoacán. However, we treat large-scale and small-scale growers in the same manner and provide them with equal opportunities, but also have the same expectations from each of them, and we push them all in equal terms. Major corporations did not tend to do so, as they usually prioritized their larger-scale producers. As we were entirely new for the growers when we started, credibility was a big challenge for us as well. We had to work hard to earn the trust of farmers and customers, gain access to the markets that would pay a better price than wholesale markets alone, and carve out our own space in a market dominated by large multinationals.</p><h4>What are the complications you see due to the cultural differences between Mexico and the US? </h4><p><span></span><strong>JVA </strong>This was much more of a challenge in the beginning, but after working with these companies, they now understand the Mexican supply and the cultural barrier is no longer an issue. They understand how Mexican growers think and what they expect from us as partners.</p><p><span></span><strong>AS</strong> It has not been an easy process, but the fact that we handle the Mexican side while our partners handle the American side makes it easier. Also, our own background has made things simpler for us and for both sides to work with each other as both Jesús and I have studied and lived abroad in the past. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the role of IDRO in the development of the industrial sector?</h4><p>IDRO was established in 1967 after the country began to industrialize. It is an organization with a long history and a true philosophy, which has played a major role in improving and promoting industry in Iran. This organization started to work 50 years ago when there was no industry in Iran, but now we can see how this sector has grown. We have conducted a lot of projects that can be divided into two parts: industrial development and the expansion of organizations. At IDRO, we support the private sector and take part in a maximum of 20% of its projects or activities, so the companies stay completely private. We help in their relation with the government in terms of permissions, financing, and so on. We have 50 projects of this kind that will be announced soon. Secondly, as the government has been supporting knowledge-based companies, we are focusing on technological companies that need money, do not know the market, or have management problems. At the moment we are developing 40 projects with these types of companies. The third thing we do is training and education for managers through the Industrial Management Institute (IMI), one of our subsidiaries. IMI is responsible of educating world-class managers and is negotiating with five world-recognized business scholars and universities. Finally, we also do company renovations, mostly for medium and small businesses with liquidity and management problems. Based on the laws of the country, the government takes control of the company and gives it to IDRO, and we have a responsibility to go and help them.</p><h4>What are the main sectors where you focus your activities?</h4><p>Based on my experience as Deputy Minister of Petroleum, one of IDRO's biggest priorities is the oil and gas sector. We have got many good negotiations with foreign companies to cooperate with us at the same level. We don't want foreign companies to just sell their products in Iran. For example, we negotiated with Citroí«n to sign a joint venture with Saipa. Citroí«n would bring hard currency, and Saipa the location, heavy equipment, and human resources. According to this joint venture, Saipa will produce a new model of Citroí«n to be sold in the local market and export 40% of the production. In the petrochemicals sector, we negotiated with German companies to sign an agreement and establish huge complexes. According to our policies in all sectors, foreign companies cannot bring finished products, and they have to cooperate with local companies to produce in Iran.</p><h4>What is your involvement in national projects?</h4><p>In the past IDRO built many factories and delivered them to other companies. Now we are following this policy again, but in other sectors like nanotechnology. We give guidelines to the private sector and cooperate with foreign companies that want to work in Iran because we have many young people who need jobs. We have the responsibility of making megaprojects and giving them to the private sector. In this sense, Chabahar Port is one of our interests. It is a good place for foreign investment because of the gas resources and the facilities there. We are in talks with Indian companies researching all scenarios and options. I am very optimistic that we can sign a good contract with a solid investor for the port.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the growth of industry in the post-sanctions era?</h4><p>After the sanctions, there is a good chance for Iran to grow. We are trying to look forward and not think about the past anymore. I am optimistic and am sure European countries will encourage their companies to come to Iran. Less than five months after the signature of the JCPOA, many foreign companies decided to invest in Iran, and some of them have signed important agreements. In one year, we will solve many problems, as the fear of European banks to invest and trade with Iran and Europe is the most interesting and biggest market for our country. They have to understand the abilities of our country, with deep cultural values and a young and well-educated society. Iran is completely different from the nearby countries in the Middle East.</p><h4>What are your expectations for this year?</h4><p>We have enough time until the end of the Iranian year to achieve our goals. We will continue focusing on the oil and gas market, including railway and shipping line transportation. We have one of the biggest companies for ship manufacturing in the Middle East, called Iran Shipbuilding &amp; Offshore Industries Complex Co (ISOICO). We signed an agreement with our users, the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), to establish a joint venture company to send tankers to foreign countries, mainly India and Europe. We are also negotiating with European shipping lines for ship manufacturing. Moreover, IDRO has a good chance for participating in IPC contracts with foreign companies to develop Iranian reserves. We also have four tire and rubber companies with a capacity of 50,000 tons per annum, and we are now investing $5.6 million in its expansion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did your family get into the real estate business? </h4><p><span></span><strong>Isaac Steiner </strong>Our father had a background in building social housing in the early 1970s. In 1978, after spending a year in Miami and seeing the high-quality condominiums available there, with amenities and green spaces, he decided to bring that same concept of residential development to Mexico, our first project of this kind. Frondoso started construction in 1979.</p><p><span></span><strong>Elias Steiner</strong> At that time in Mexico, there were many nice apartments and condominiums, though none of them had generous green areas, gymnasiums, or nice common facilities. It was rare to see a development with many trees in Mexico City.</p><h4>How important is architectural style in your developments?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Rubén Steiner</strong> It is important to have a great architectural project, because at the end of the day people will spend plenty of time there and they have to have the spaces well designed. Since the beginning, we have tried to ensure that all of our architectural designs are timeless. We do not focus on trends; we want our buildings to look beautiful now and in another 30 years. For example, we stay away from modern trends that will look outdated in a few years' time, like some buildings you might see from the 1990s.</p><p><span></span><strong>I</strong><strong>S </strong>When we took over the business from our father we decided not to have an architect in-house; however, we opted to subcontract each project to the best architect. If you always have one architect doing your projects you are chained to the same style or views and it lacks innovation. Depending on the project, we find the best architect to design it.</p><h4>What do you do to stay ahead of your competition?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RS </strong>One of our main challenges now is that everyone is replicating our model, or doing smaller projects with fewer amenities. There are also many high-quality projects being constructed, although they might not have as much green space as we do, which is something that we focus on; they prefer to fill the space with as many apartments as they can. Our competition is getting better and the challenge now is for us to innovate. Our goal now is service and that is the direction that we want to focus more on, because the rest can be easily copied; service, however, takes a long time to copy.</p><h4>Geographically, you have focused mostly on Mexico City and the surrounding area. Do you see growth potential in other smaller cities?</h4><p><span></span><strong>IS</strong> Mexico City has been our main focus. We have developed projects in a few other cities like Cancún, Acapulco, and Tijuana. We are now exploring the possibility of expanding into the Bají­o with projects in Irapuato, León, Aguascalientes and Querétaro. There is definitely plenty of opportunities outside of Mexico City. The availability of land is becoming restricted in Mexico City. We visited León recently and were astonished by how much the city had changed. There is a great deal of potential there and it has become strategic because of the automotive industry. Cities like these are growing, and while they were developing housing with some amenities, they are not innovative and we think we can bring something new into those places. Vertical living is still new to many Mexicans; however, it is becoming a trend, such as in Monterrey, after Mexico City. In cities such as Salamanca and León, it is starting though there are still few apartment buildings.</p><h4>What makes Frondoso a great destination for investors looking for exposure to the Mexican real estate sector?</h4><p><span></span>IS We have been in the market for more than 40 years. We have survived all of the ups and downs in the market and we continue to bounce back, we know the market. We have worked with international funds, particularly from the US; we know what they want, we know how they operate, and we are well organized and ready to receive funds from the US, or any other country. Our monthly reports are clear; we are an institutionalized family business and have a vision for what Mexicans want. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Who are the main investors in your developments?</h4><p>We have mainly Mexican families and businesses as our primary investors. We have established trust with people who know us, and they respect our reputation. We have a few international investors, and we are now in talks for a long-term investment with a European family office, which is an interesting project for Venit Investments. We have been working with American investors as well, but that started just last year. We also try to invest our own money in most of the projects we develop. This reassures investors that we have a personal stake in the outcome. </p><h4>What made you decide to focus on medium-sized cities across the country, rather than on one geographical region in particular? </h4><p>There are 50 or 60 players in the Monterrey market that are currently developing, or planning to develop, mixed-use projects. If you go to other cities, however, you begin to see that there are maybe only 10. It makes more business sense to invest in a place where you have fewer competitors. You have more potential in a growing city. Monterrey still has a substantial growth potential. We have investments here and new projects coming up, but we try to stay away from the main focus in the market. </p><h4>How have demographic changes in Mexico driven your business model?</h4><p>Urbanization started a long time ago in Mexico. Around 80% of the people here live in cities with a population greater than 15,000 people. At the end of the last century, everything was concentrated on three or four cities; Monterrey, Mexico City, Guadalajara and in a lesser way Puebla. What has changed is an increase in foreign investment, which created job opportunities and potential growth in other medium-sized cities. That is creating opportunities for people to experience the big cities but on a smaller scale. Querétaro is an interesting example, as it is a medium-sized city that has several of the most important business hubs and commercial centers. There is also now increased mobility in Mexico. Until a few decades ago, the country was traditional in that people were born, lived, and died in one place</p><h4>How would you characterize Mexico's progress in terms of green or environmentally friendly construction?</h4><p>We do not have a government agency that enforces anything beyond the basic requirements in Mexico. You have a few places that are trying to enforce green initiatives, but there is not enforcement like in Europe, such as the Carbon Fund. The second issue is the lack of demand. Building a certified LEED building is expensive, and to build a green building you need an investor who is willing to pay the extra cost—in Mexico there are few businessmen who are willing to invest at this level. Consequently, there are people interested in building those type of products, but they do not have the target market. One thing that we have been doing as a business is to try to find a work around: we do not certify our buildings, but that does not mean that we cannot apply some of the same technology and regulations. We based our construction models on a few of the LEED and European green certifications, and we analyze what can be applied to the project, and if the market is going to willingly accept and pay.</p><h4>What are your goals for the next several years?</h4><p>We are starting two large projects in Bajio; therefore, our top priority is to see them through to completion. One of them is a 10-year project, which is a good amount of time. We will start the first of seven buildings on that project, hopefully during next year. My priority is to consolidate those projects, as they are our largest yet and are important for us. We are also starting an interesting condo project in three different cities. </p>]]></richbody0content>
