		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major achievements at Qazaq Air over the past 12 months?</h4><p>From an operational perspective, we increased the number of routes to 15, with six of those either not served by other airlines or underserved. Proving that these routes are economically viable has been great, as we have also successfully increased our passenger numbers by 54%. Our revenues increased by a similar amount, which has exceeded the expectations of the management and our shareholders. We are pleased with the performance, though pricing power remains weak as ticket prices did not increase in 2017. This is great news for passengers, though as a low-cost carrier it makes it harder for us to differentiate ourselves from the other airlines that have relatively low ticket prices. Ticket prices remained flat in 2017, and our tickets were in fact 3% less expensive than in 2016. The economy is recovering and we have seen increased load factors on our aircraft to about 70%, which is great for an overall season. We have also changed our networks and stopped serving some of the longer routes. We have six flights that originate from Astana and have managed to develop strong hubs in the capital, as well as Almaty and Atyrau.</p><h4>What have been some of the key operational developments at the airline?</h4><p>We are taking advantage of new technologies in matters of distribution. Currently, 100% of all sales go through an online platform, though more than half are direct online ticket sales on our website. This is likely the highest of any business in Kazakhstan. We have also added additional revenue generators, such as reserving seats or purchasing a meal. We seek to follow many aspects of a typical low-cost model. This allows us to profit by delivering services that passengers want to pay for. In terms of our fleet, we have just three aircraft managing our entire route, and this is the significance of operating new aircraft as they are extremely reliable. We do need more aircraft and have ordered two new aircraft that will be delivered in March and April 2019. This will enable us to increase the frequency of our existing routes and also offer some new routes. Another major development is making progress on our plans to get our IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA). We have done the audit and will receive our certificate in 1Q2018, allowing us to fly internationally. We launched our first international flight in 2017, where we had a regular summer charter flight to Kyrgyzstan.</p><h4>How are privatization plans progressing at Qazaq Air?</h4><p>We are on the list for privatization and, if there are interested investors, they are welcome to talk to our shareholders about that at any time. Part of being a proper commercial business is being profitable and an attractive business to future investors in the company. This is an ongoing process and we expect to be a profitable business by 2020. In 2017, we had over 50% revenue growth, which indicates a strong performance trend that will make us an attractive proposition. We are taking steps to prepare for profitability, which includes having proper audited accounts and the best corporate governance of any company in Kazakhstan. We have a board of independent directors and all of the tools for excellent corporate governance and risk management compliance that one would expect to see in a much bigger airline.</p><h4>How do you see the aviation sector evolving in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>There are four domestically active airlines in Kazakhstan, which is a fairly large number. This competitive sector is to the benefit of the Kazakhstani travelling public. Travelers receive great value in terms of ticket prices with us; they are served by a young fleet of two and a half years that will be further boosted by our new aircraft. There is no other player in the domestic aviation market with more than a 50% market share. The picture three year ago was extremely different. Overall, traffic in Kazakhstan picked up by 28% in 2017 and we plan to put on new routes and frequencies to benefit people from the regions.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>We will not be able to deliver the same growth that we delivered in 2017. 2016 was our real first start-up year and 2017 was when we showed what it is like to run an efficient company. In 2018 we will not have new aircraft arriving and will thus not benefit from increased capacity. We are increasing our load factor and the efficiency of our route network planning, and sales ancillary revenues are anticipated to increase as we have only just started serving food and additional services on the aircraft. Overall, we are optimistic about 2018 and look forward to the years ahead. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is behind Cisco's strategic partnership with the government's Digital Kazakhstan program?</h4><p>This partnership dates back to a visionary initiative by Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev in preparation for Expo 2017. As we began working with the government to support this, we quickly realized there was a strong will to not only demonstrate our “green" digital capabilities, but also leverage the exhibition to make new strides in the digitalization of Kazakhstan. Realizing this potential, President Nazarbayev met with John Chambers, Cisco's Executive Chairman, in New York in 2015 to outline potential areas where Cisco's technology and experience could contribute to the modernization of the country. The following year, the government began developing the “Digital Kazakhstan" program led by the Minister of Information and Communication. Cisco also played an important role in its development, advising which relevant digital initiatives could be applied to Kazakhstan. Cisco's broad set of digital solutions and over 30 years of IT leadership were clear synergies between our capabilities and ambitions. As such, we took the strategic decision to include Kazakhstan in our Country Digitization Acceleration (CDA) program, which was implemented in 16 countries worldwide. As the only country in Central Asia to do so, we were delighted to see Kazakhstan in this privileged group, a great testament to the country's determination to digitize its economy in a comprehensive, efficient, and visionary way.</p><h4>What are some of the key areas under the CDA initiative in which you will support Kazakhstan's digitization efforts?</h4><p>There are a number of focus areas for Kazakhstan in our CDA strategy. These include digital access to government services, cybersecurity, smart cities, digital mining, and education. A significant proportion of citizens, particularly in rural areas, have limited access to several basic government and financial services such as applying for identification documents or getting a loan consultation.  Therefore, we started with a remote government services project, connecting the national network of the 'Government for Citizens' service provider. The next step is a collaboration with KazPost, which has one of the broadest networks across the country, to install remote service terminals for citizens. Another crucial segment relates to digital mining, where we are working with some of the biggest local players such as KazAtomProm and Kazakhmys with the intention of applying some of our innovative security solutions and industrial automation controls. By creating a unified platform, we help enable local mining companies improve their decision-making and reduce their operating costs. Furthermore, leveraging our vast experience in developing smart cities (Cisco Kinetic for Cities) across the world, we are partnering with the government and local authorities to modernize transport connectivity and energy efficiency in cities across Kazakhstan. We have already initiated a pilot project with the municipal government of Astana on a system to support smart lighting, traffic, and environmental monitoring. After only six months, we are already working on expanding the pilots to other cities such as Almaty or Shymkent. These are just a few examples of the scope of work under the Cisco CDA partnership here. Kazakhstan has a clear goal of becoming one of the top 30 global economies by 2050 by implementing an ambitious digital agenda.</p><h4>How would you describe your engagement with the private sector and your commitment to build lasting ties with the growing IT industry in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We have a network of more than 300 registered partners in Kazakhstan. Working with them, we have been able to significantly widen and deepen our business with the local private sector. From network infrastructure to videoconference technologies, data center analytics, and cybersecurity, we provide a broad range of solutions, as well as design and implementation services. One of the key factors to successful digitization is the availability of a digitally skilled workforce. To close this skills gap, we are expanding the Cisco Networking Academy program in Kazakhstan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[digitization-dialogs]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of your major objectives when you first entered the market in 2015?</h4><p>We set our agenda around three areas. The first was in regard to new business, especially business services. The second area was about the quality of the network, while the final aspect was about the overall customer experience and how they should interact with us. In regard to the first, we heavily focused on B2B, as well as building business solutions in the realm of mobile financial services. We thought a lot about digital services that make up a large part of our business. At that time, we did not have 4G, and the data quality was not as good as it is today. Though many aspects of the sector have evolved, our agenda has remained relatively focused on these three priorities. Over the past six months, in response to the several challenges we faced in the country, such as the devaluation, we have started to focus on other areas as well. These include using the most efficient infrastructure, as well as sharing it. We also focused on the digitization of essentially everything we do.</p><h4>Are you witnessing the desired results given the infrastructure investments you have made in 2017?</h4><p>Today, we have around half of the population covered with 4G, while around 77% of the population is covered by 3G. For us, in regard to investments, we want to ensure we have the best data quality in the areas where there is a high demand for it. Coverage is not our only primary concern; we are heavily focused on capacity as well. We want to make sure that when customers use our services, they can get the highest quality. In Almaty and Astana, we made tremendous efforts to identify where the quality was less then satisfactory for our customers. As a result we invested quite heavily in new towers in those areas. Also in 2017, we further developed our digital customer services through automation software. We have integrated this digitization through the entire process, including on the back end. We have half a million customers actively using our digital services—something unimaginable three years ago.</p><h4>How has the market in Kazakhstan changed over the years?</h4><p>There has been a professional dialog between the cabinet minsters and business leaders in several different forms, through AmCham and Eurobank, for example. The president chairs the Foreign Investments Council, which is also fairly unique, gathering world business leaders here. The biggest change I have noticed is that the critical topics raised by business leaders are actually being solved at the government level now. This dialog is healthy for the country in many aspects. In Western countries, open dialog does not happen; therefore, we are delighted to make the most of it here.</p><h4>What do you make of Digital Kazakhstan and how can Kcell contribute to its objectives?</h4><p>We can contribute in a number of ways. It is vital to have infrastructure in place for every digitization process, and thus far this is missing. We are taking the lead on internal process digitization and changing the way we operate. One area that needs more of a push is the digital identity, which is not used only in Kazakhstan; banks have their own identities, we have our own digital identities. The identity aspect, even though almost everyone has an ID card, is missing. These are areas we can improve, with businesses working together toward a common understanding of the goals. For our B2B operations, we have some major projects going on related to the Internet of Things. We are able to bring real value to some process, making a real difference in processes as diverse as production and mining. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the creation of the Ministry of Information and Communication in 2016?</h4><p>Almost two years ago, a vital decision was taken by the President to form the Ministry of Information and Communications. In tandem with the rising priority of cybersecurity around the world, the need to improve the competitiveness of domestic media has become fundamental. We have been tasked to restore the population's trust in the local media by increasing its competitiveness. We have managed to systematize explanatory work in the media space, launch new projects, and start implementing modern products that meet contemporary demands. Several studies were conducted, including with the participation of international consulting agencies that revealed further growth of the economy was not possible without digitalization of key sectors such as industry, agriculture, and transport. Moreover, at the time, many countries had already started to draft digitalization programs. Despite the seemingly obviousness of the prospects of this sphere, there was no one state body responsible for coordinating the entire process. The establishment of the Ministry of Information and Communications has solved the problem. There was also strong demand on behalf of society to improve the quality of public services that is largely related to their automation. In light of all this, it seems logical that one state body is in charge of these issues.</p><h4>What have been some of the early achievements of the Digital Kazakhstan reforms, and what role is the ministry playing in its implementation?</h4><p>2018 will be decisive for implementation of the Digital Kazakhstan program. In particular, we will set the pace and vector of upcoming work. In short, the program is planned to run until 2020 and includes five directions, 17 initiatives, and 120 events. As targets, we plan to improve our position in the World Economic Forum's ranking on the ability to innovate indicator, as well as to increase the volume of the investments in start-ups up to KZT67 billion by 2022. At the same time, during the initial stage of program implementation, the Ministry of Information and Communication is tasked with clarifying its main points and strategic importance. The further success of all transformations depends on this. Currently, the entire and detailed regulatory base has been prepared. Now, the main role of the ministry is the overall coordination of activities of all state bodies in each of the five directions of the program.</p><h4>What are will be your key objectives and expectations for 2018?</h4><p>In 2018, the ministry begins to implement a project to provide settlements with high-speed internet. This project will be implemented by 2020 and will cover more than 1,200 rural settlements. This is one of the most socially significant undertakings of the ministry. On top of that, the project is personally supervised by the Head of State. The project effect is enormous: the basis for agriculture digitization, broadening public services coverage, and improvement of the quality of education and health in rural areas. Also, we will continue to incentivize the start-up ecosystem. At the beginning of the year, an accelerated program was launched on the basis of Astana HUB. This project will become a kind of Kazakhstan Silicon Valley, where unique IT products are developed. The government provides free offices and educational functions and legislatively stimulates demand for the new technologies from the real sector. In terms of the improvement of public services, the “digital by default" principle will continue to be implemented supposing the planning and provision of further public services exclusively electronically. Also, the paper-free project will be implemented this year, meaning there will be no need to request for certificates from one state body to receive the services from another state body. As for the media, we will continue to work on further modernization of public resources, release domestic products, as well as introduce modern mechanisms for the media market operation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does AED Portugal provide a platform facilitating networking between the strategic industries of aeronautics, aerospace, and defense?</h4><p>JOSÉ CORDEIRO: One of the most important factors was being a founding member of the European Aerospace Cluster Partnership (EACP). We also signed MoUs with other European clusters in Hamburg, Bavaria, Seville, Galicia, Toulouse, among others related to aeronautics. It is also essential for us to attend main events around Europe.</p><p>JOíƒO ROMANA: We set out together with the local clusters to support our networking efforts. Recently at ILA Berlin event, we have planned B2B meetings beforehand, and planned a networking agenda among the Portuguese and German clusters. Such efforts applies to aeronautics, space, and defense. By joining the European Space Agency, back in 2000, a fast gateway was set up for space industry in Portugal. Back in 2000 there was less than 10 active companies in space, but in the last 10 years things have totally changed. The national investments in science for the last 20 years are now paying off. In defense, Portugal has also a long tradition of building capability in cooperation with NATO. In the scope of the European Research and Innovation Programmes (FP6, FP7, H2020) Portugal shows a record of significant achievements, in the fields of aeronautics (Clean Sky), space and ICT. As a consequence we now have companies that are world leaders in satellite ground control systems, providing most of the control systems for the geostationary satellite market, worldwide. It has been a remarkable progress. In aeronautics a similar progress took place, only faster and with a stronger economic impact. In fact, in 10 years Portugal has grown from a young MRO player to a mature medium size supplier of most of the existent OEMs in the world market. The key push factor for aeronautics boom was the decision of Embraer to install two facilities in the south of Portugal back in 2006. Everything has changed in the last 10 years with many international aeronautic companies moving to Évora, coming from Brazil, France, Spain, UK, and other countries. This exponential growth has left behind many gaps and needs, we are currently mapping and diagnosing. Training, certification of SMEs, better supply chain structure and need for clustering industry for sizeable contracts, are some of the needs and gaps found.</p><h4>What more would you like to see in terms of value addition to accelerate the process going forward?</h4><p>JR: Presently the number of highly educated PhD students working in industry is residual (less 5%). This tells us there is still a long way to go in terms of innovation and knowledge transfer to industry. We are also in the early stages of the process of bringing players together for increasing critical mass and addressing larger contracts. Technologically, the potential is high with Research Centers and industry developing beyond state of the art. Such centers are interesting enough to attract a wave of young professionals to this field and hope best for the future.</p><p>JC: Facts speak clearly, there are over 26,000 PhD students in our university and only 700 of them work in industry; we still have a long way to go.</p><h4>What have been the most successful initiatives to raise the overall visibility of Portugal's aerospace sector and promote its internationalization?</h4><p>JR: We have recently raised funds up to 2020 from national and European programmes to develop a strategy for 2022, build the respective action plan and fund internationalization activities allo over the world. Such project's funds add to Cluster's membership fees. As a result of this combined funding we can now address Europe as well as Canada and the USA. Such activities are keeping us extremely busy and drives a positive momentum.</p><p>JC: We also have also set up strategic objectives for the next seven years. The first is to double the present share of the Portuguese GDP and bring it up to 3%. Another is to promote Portugal as a innovative destination and become a main player in these areas. This means we must participate in large events around the world and broadcast the competitiveness of Portugal among companies that seek to invest.</p><h4>To what extent does the AED cluster have positive spillover effects in other high-tech sectors and how does this contribute to the overall competitiveness of Portugal's economy?</h4><p>JR: That is definitely happening. we see more mature industries, such as the automotive cluster, increasingly interested in joining the aeronautic and aerospace sectors. We receive many IT, metallurgic and automotive companies looking for opportunities in aerospace. The Portuguese metallurgical industry has a contribution of about 30% to our GDP, meaning there is huge potential out there, especially for hard metals machining and tooling. The qualifications and certification are a huge barrier to new comers, given other sectors are less stringent than aeronautics. This is something that needs to be further paved in the future. Trying to address and measure the spillover factor of aerospace, several studies were conducted. Such studies show a factor varying from two up to four, the real value to be determined. Overlapping technologies show large potential, being the case of 3D visualization for controlling machines, and importing to aerospace Industry 4.0 developments developed for wine industry. This is corroborated as we have been able to attract other players to the AED Cluster, mostly companies from IT and engineering. We still have a long way to go before we become part of the supply chain, this being the tricky part.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the performance of the AED cluster? </h4><p>JC: Our goal is to reach 3% of Portugal GDP in seven years. To reach this goal, and given most of the Portuguese companies are SMEs, we have to improve the national supply chain and enlace SME to grow around large OEM, Tier one and Tier two companies.</p><p>JR: We need to attract more foreign investment in these sectors. This will require improving Professional vocational training, and supporting foreign companies in their move to Portugal. The national training institute (IEFP) has been a key factor in training over 2,000 new aeronautic technicians for the last 10 years. This IEFP training is free for companies, who report highly pleased with the human resources provided by IEFP. IEFP has been able to fill that gaps identified by the aerospace industry. One of the major gaps we have identified is international promotion and we need to address it. Given we do not have much financial support, we have gathered the main Portuguese stakeholders including the prime minister office, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Science and the Agency for promotion of the Alentejo region, under the flag “Portugal Looks Up.“ We just created this brand-and have already been in India, Canada, and soon Berlin and the USA. It will be a global effort to promote Portugal under the same flag initiative.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give us some background into the Wind Renewable Energy Resources Area Project (YEKA)?</h4><p>YEKA is the new investment model being employed in the Turkish wind energy sector. Currently, there are two main models of financing wind projects: one for small-scale and one for mid-sized ones. For the former, an investor needs to apply to a distribution company for a project of up to 1MW, seeking permissions from the distribution company and the construction company. For mid-sized projects of up to 100MW or more, investors have to measure the land for a year and apply to Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA). The Ministry of Energy currently supports renewable energy projects using local equipment. In line with this, it established a third model for large-sized projects in which one applies directly to the Ministry of Energy and the General Directorate of Renewable Energy. The first wind YEKA projects are being developed for five regions across the country, with the Ministry of Energy defining a 1,700MW wind capacity overall. For this type of project, applications should be submitted to the General Directorate of Renewable Energy, and the ministry will then allocate projects according to priority. The requirements for these projects are to be developed using 65% equipment manufactured in Turkey and for companies to open R&amp;D centers of engineers, at least 80% of who must be Turkish nationals. The wind turbine factory must be completed and operational within 21 months. At the end of the day, investors in YEKA should be able to produce a 1,000MW project.</p><h4>How has the YEKA project been progressing in recent months?</h4><p>Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, Kalyon Construction, and Türkerler Energy have formed a tripartite consortium for the YEKA project. Siemens is working hard on the turbine factory, while Türkerler is working on the project development side. Like other consortium companies, these companies applied to the General Directorate of Renewable Energy for this project and evaluated it to ensure they were able to produce 1,000MW according to the priorities laid out by the ministry. Currently, the companies are doing research on the most appropriate region where the factory will be built, and it is expected that Izmir will be chosen.</p><h4>What is the Turkish Wind Energy Association's involvement in such projects? How do you work with the government and private sector to attract the right investment?</h4><p>Given that our main aim is to promote renewable energy and especially wind in Turkey, we are extremely active in the sector in both the government and private sector side. We are working to bridge the government and the private sector, enabling discussion of problems and brainstorming solutions together. We organize workshops, congresses, and technical site visits, as well as organize delegation participation from the government to various conferences. We have estimated that our wind potential is 38GW onshore and 10GW offshore, according to the General Directorate's 2006 measurements. However, these calculations and the technology used are already outdated. If we account for the current advancements in wind energy, our potential is more along the lines of 70GW for both onshore and offshore combined. This means that in the coming years, the wind energy sector will rapidly develop. In 2017 there was a significant milestone achieved in Turkey, in regards to YEKA. In total, 4,000MW of capacity allocated to projects were awarded in 2017, amounting to USD5 billion invested in wind energy projects. However, making these projects in reality will take time. The project owners are currently working hard on securing their pre-licenses. After those are acquired, they will begin receiving construction licenses, which will take two to three years. These projects will be realized completely by 2020.</p><h4>What are the main obstacles to investing the wind energy, and renewables more generally in Turkey?</h4><p>In 2005, Turkey's installed wind capacity was only 20MW. After the enactment of the Renewable Energy Law in 2005 the wind energy sector began to grow rapidly. A second set of regulations came after to develop sector and investment started to increase. Turkey also had economic conditions internationally that affected the sector. However, in the past seven years, the sector has been growing by approximately 25-30% a year. In 2016, Turkey broke the 1GW barrier for the first time, installing 1,387MW of new wind energy. In 2017 by adding 766MW into the system, Turkey was ranked fourth in the European market and eighth worldwide in annual wind capacity.</p><h4>What are the main factors that differentiate the local energy market from its neighbors, and what opportunities are there for international collaboration?</h4><p>Looking at the Turkish experience in wind energy, our companies tackle increasingly challenging opportunities. The MENA region has considerable potential in renewable energy and many opportunities to be found. We also see a great deal of potential in Turkic countries and partner closely with those countries. Turkish companies are also looking at South Africa as a potential market. Turkish construction companies have already been extremely active all over the world. In fact, they are second only to China in terms international activity and the number of foreign partners. Therefore, Turkish companies already have a great deal of experience abroad, and that trickles down to some companies in the renewable energy sector.</p><h4>Will the YEKA initiative have a lasting impact on the energy sector at large?</h4><p>YEKA is an excellent project to develop the wind industry. However, through mid-sized wind projects and legislative improvements Turkey has already begun to develop its wind industry so the sector has to operate not only according to YEKA, but also EMRA. YEKA projects are all large-sized projects, and we need to make sure investors are encouraged to invest in medium and small projects as well. If we can keep both investment models in parallel, the energy market will be significantly improved in Turkey. That would make a more sustainable market. One way that the industry aims to do this is by supporting local companies in their medium-scale ventures, as opposed to focusing solely on international ones.</p><h4>What are your priorities for the year 2018?</h4><p>Our priorities for 2018 are to develop more projects in Turkey. On the wind side, we have more than 70GW of potential here. On the other hand, we have excellent potential in solar, perhaps the same or more than in wind. As well, we have hydropower potential, with three sides of Turkey bordered by the sea and many rivers. There is also excellent potential in geothermal and biofuel. When we look at both together, renewable energy presents great opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the origin behind establishing this center?</h4><p>In 1993 there was a presidential decree that stipulating the creation of such centers in priority fields of the economy: the atomic sector, biotechnology, space research, and mining and metallurgy—all research centers. When the Soviet Union collapsed, government officials decided that science and production had to interact effectively, so these were set up to bridge the gap between science and the manufacturing sector so that all the scientific discoveries could be applied directly to production and the wider economy. Within this particular organization, we are doing a tremendous job in bridging the gap and are making sure there is demand for scientific developments from the industrial sector. For a long time Kazakhstan's population has believed local science practices are not effective and public funds could be better spent; this is why there is not enough money being invested in science. In turn, the government and private sector often relied on foreign research, and many companies in Kazakhstan were in fact transferred to foreign corporations to develop and modernize their enterprises by completely relying on foreign technology.</p><h4>What is the core responsibility and input of the center for the country?</h4><p>Kazakh science is alive and doing groundbreaking work. Most of the foreign mining corporations, who previously only used foreign technology, now mainly rely on developments from this center. 80% of the technological solutions that they use come from here, primarily because no one knows the resources of this country and how to mine and process them better than the local scientists here. Our main task for large Kazakhstani companies that have existed since the Soviet era is to update their technology to adapt to changing raw materials. For example, when they run out of ore deposits and have to input material from a new source, which needs to be processed in a different way, the technology needs to be tweaked and updated to current conditions. There are also new enterprises being built from scratch only using the technologies developed here. Over the past 20 years, USD3.5 billion was invested worldwide in constructing new factories and smelting plants using our in-house technologies. More than half of these new plants that were built using these technologies are outside of Kazakhstan, and extend to almost every continent. There are several such plants in Canada, Italy, China, Bolivia, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Nonetheless, the center is developing with tough competition from foreign research organizations, so while I cannot say we are the best in all fields, there are certain areas where this center is a world leader.</p><h4>What are some examples of innovations and technologies that have had a large impact on industry around the world?</h4><p>One-tenth of the world's lead that is produced directly from ore—and not recycling materials—is made using technologies developed here. In addition, we lead the world in technologies related to complex ferrous alloys. There are many recent developments in this field that were made here. To date, the plants using technologies developed at our center produce USD3 billion in sales per year. For the first time ever, we have developed an alloy of iron, aluminum, and silica. The necessity of such an alloy has been discussed globally for around 70 years, as this alloy increases the efficiency of steel production. There were efforts to produce this by mixing ferrosilicon alloys with metallic aluminum; however, that process turned out to be expensive, and now we have developed a way to produce this alloy from the waste from coal mines and not the coal itself, which is cheaper. Now, there are production tests of this ferrous silica aluminum alloy around the world. This alloy was tested in steel production at the facilities of some of the largest steel companies in the world in Japan, Turkey, South Korea, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Brazil and has seen excellent results everywhere. It is also cheaper in production than ferrosilicon alloys or aluminum. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of Shell's success story in the country since it first arrived? </h4><p>Kazakhstan is a unique country. It is not only by the immensity of the country but also by its economic power and geopolitical influence. Kazakhstan has made an eminent journey of remarkable development and has now become the leading country in Central Asia. The country now heads the region in terms of its business environment and has shown the world what can be achieved. It is this dynamism and bright sense of future that attracted Shell to establish itself here since Kazakhstan's independence. Historically, we have long roots in the region, as Shell's presence in the Caspian region stretches over 100 years and here in Kazakhstan dates back to the early 1990s. Our company was one of the first foreign investors to acknowledge the great potential this newly sovereign nation offered and have followed this path of partnership with Kazakhstan ever since. We have invested billions of dollars in oil and gas projects, both onshore and offshore. The combination with BG Group last year enlarged Shell's operations further, and we are and intend to remain one of the largest foreign investors in the country. This year is the 25th anniversary of our presence in country. Shell has achieved a great deal over the past years as a result of our efficient and true cooperation with our joint ventures' partners and the government of Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What have been the key operational developments at Shell in Kazakhstan over the past year?</h4><p>In country, we are involved in several major projects. In 2016 we resumed production at the offshore Kashagan field. This was an enormous milestone in our journey to bringing Kashagan safely and reliably into production. NCOC NV, the operator, has shown great resilience in overcoming multiple difficulties over the years. At the moment Kashagan ramp-up is ongoing and production exceeded expectation despite some teething problems usually associated with the start of such a giant project. In 2017, it delivered successful growth reaching an average production of over 220,000boe/d. Our top priority for Kashagan is to provide maximum support for NCOC NV to ensure safe operations. Another major Asset is jointly operated by Shell and Eni: the Karachaganak project, one of the world's largest gas condensate fields. Karachaganak has delivered the highest production ever, reaching 92% in availability. The record production in 2017 was an average of 390,000boe/d for the year. Karachaganak also achieved high standards of safety, reliability, and environmental performance. The current performance of Karachaganak is world class and credit goes to all those involved in our day-to-day operations. However, we must never be complacent and constantly focus our efforts on delivering safe and reliable production.</p><h4>What significance does Kazakhstan play for the company's global operation?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is a very important country and one of the building blocks of the Royal Dutch Shell portfolio. We are in the top-five of Shell's upstream segment, making a tremendous contribution to the company's cash flow. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the company and the oil and gas sector in Kazakhstan in 2018?</h4><p>Our primary focus is to ensure safe and sustainable operations at all our assets in the country with a focus on local content development. The mid to long-term development of Karachaganak beyond the above period is to maintain liquids offtake at current rates.  A series of medium-scale projects are planned to drill more wells and upgrade the gas handling and disposal capacity of the existing field facilities. We are working together with KPO and the JV partners to land an economic concept of further field development. At Kashagan we focus on safe ramp-up targeting to the capacity produce 370,000bpd as soon as possible. We have been in Kazakhstan for 25 years now and we are committed and ready to help the country unlock its vast energy potential in a sustainable way for the benefit of the government and people of Kazakhstan for decades to come. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Eni's remarkable journey in Kazakhstan since the company first established in the local market in 1992?</h4><p>The past 25-plus years in Kazakhstan have been an incredibly exciting for Eni, and we are very proud to have been engaged in two world-class projects—Karachaganak and Kashagan—since their inception. Strong commitment has shown how effective foreign investors, such as Eni and the government, can collaborate to address important challenges. Eni is the only foreign company to have participated in both projects (Karachaganak and Kashagan) from the very beginning. It should be noted that economic relations between Kazakhstan and Italy were established in a unique way. Representatives of the Italian business communities visited Kazakhstan multiple times, and His Excellency President Nazarbayev personally received them. He also sought touch points and common interests on which our two countries could collaborate. Diplomatic relations between Italy and Kazakhstan were officially established in 1992, and in early 1993, President Nazarbayev declared during a speech at the Davos WEF that Eni had an exclusive right to hold negotiations for the development of the giant gas and condensate Karachaganak field under a production sharing agreement. Later that same year, another crucial event occurred: the signing of the agreement that established a consortium of international oil companies to carry out exploration activities in the Kazakh sector of the Caspian Sea. We are proud to have been—and continue to be—part of the unique Kashagan project. Today, Karachaganak is among the three largest upstream operations in the country, successfully co-operated by Eni and Shell. The Karachaganak Petroleum Operating Company is one of the first companies in Kazakhstan to successfully introduce the Local Content Development Program and achieve positive results in implementing the Nationalization Plant, where local employees make up about 95% of the total staff.</p><h4>What have been the key operational achievements at Eni's main sites in Kazakhstan over the last year?</h4><p>The Kashagan plant began production in September 2016 and has been working very well since the beginning, producing a full range of products—oil, gas, and sulfur—just 48 hours after its opening. The production ramp up progressed well, and plant availability improved month by month. Oil production, before gas re-injection, has been above 200,000bpd—15% above the expected rate. In August 2017, the raw gas injection (RGI) process began when two compressors were successfully and commissioned. The oil production has already reached 300 kbbl/d (with associated gas, for 385 kboepd). We continue testing the systems and are gradually increasing the amount of gas we re-inject so that more oil can be produced. This is a world-class resource with a production life of decades, and the production facilities are performing well, with reliability at or exceeding our expectations.  NCOC is fully dedicated to reaching design capacity of 370,000bpd as soon as possible. We expect the NCOC in 2018 to fully accomplish this capacity, and we will explore options to accelerate this timing. Overall, production reliability has exceeded expectations. In Karachaganak we are very pleased with the consistent KPO safety and production performances that we have achieved, with new production records in 2017 after 20 years of field operations, along with top-class safety and environmental indicators, with a gas utilization factor above 99.5% for the first time in several years.</p><h4>What level of support have you seen from the authorities and what do you expect in terms of regulations going forward?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is one of the most important countries in Central Asia due to its natural resources. Over the last 20 years, there has been amazing growth in the oil and gas sector, particularly in production, implanting new technologies, and the involvement of the worldwide major IOC in the energy arena. This has been possible thanks to the vision of the president and the full commitment and support from all authorities. Further improvements are being discussed, but major steps forward have been implemented. We believe that it is also in the country's best interests to introduce further reforms to the laws and regulatory framework related to gas flaring, and more closely align these with international standards—particularly the standards adopted in OECD countries that would improve the country's investment climate. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind your decision to launch Freedom Finance in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We saw an opportunity to match our expertise with the growing interest in Kazakhstan in domestic and foreign financial markets, and the desire of many of our clients to manage their wealth in part through market investments. Since we began doing business in Kazakhstan five years ago we have been the foremost player in this business sector. Most other players have in fact reduced their participation in financial investments in the brokerage industry, which positioned us to take advantage of opportunities here. We also saw the economic risks of the current situation and falling prices, as well as the sanctions in Russia. The primary reason why the brokerage industry collapsed in early 2010 in Kazakhstan was due to the reforming of institutional investors here. Most brokers in the sector were focused on servicing institutional investors, private customers, pension funds, and banks, which were involved in the reselling of all their assets. Kazakhstan has not yet developed a retail brokerage industry, and when most of the players realized that institutional business was declining, the Russian brokers in particular left Kazakhstan, along with most of the international players, which in turn led local players to cut their expenses as much as possible to minimize losses. They effectively lost the ability to earn anything on the market. At the time, the total turnover of the stock exchange was small; it was just a few million dollars a month. Freedom Finance is not just a successful company in Kazakhstan or Russia, but thinks on a regional scale within Central Asia, where Kazakhstan—as well as Russia—are staging areas for active expansion into its key economies, succeeding in more than mineral resources. We see how many well-to-do people in Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and other regions are increasingly thinking about how to save and increase their savings, but are limited in the choice of investment instruments. The growth of income, as well as the increase in financial awareness, along with the globalization of markets and the media industry, creates the demand for such instruments, and Freedom Finance is ready to provide freedom of choice of investment instruments in every promising market in Central Asia.</p><h4>How have you been able to attract clients to investment opportunities in global markets?</h4><p>One of the most efficient and profitable parts of our business is providing access to international markets, such as the US markets and stock exchange. Interest in international investments has been high, as people are interested in diversifying their investments and allocating their risks between US securities markets and local opportunities. In fact, 2017 was the first year that we started to see renewed interest in the domestic market. Because of devaluation risks, most people prefer to keep their money in dollars, though the rates are extremely low. People seeking a higher yield in dollars can have access to the US stock market, which has a great growth outlook. We have organized the participation of our customers to give them access to some of the best offerings over the past five years, including Twitter, Facebook, and Hilton.  All these offerings are high-growth industries, and we have found eager buyers here. Our research and trading efforts have been rewarded with strong interest and support among our rapidly growing client base in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What are your plans with regards to listing Freedom Finance on the NYSE or another market?<br></h4><p>Pursuing a listing on the NYSE or NASDAQ is a natural step for us to take at the appropriate time in the near future. Currently, we are completing the consolidation of our international group of operating companies under the umbrella of Freedom Holding, Inc., which is traded in the US on the OTC Pink Market. It is a great time to approach a listing in the US market given our track record and current prospects. We expect to meet all of the listing requirements. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Al Hilal Bank select Kazakhstan as the hub to branch out into?</h4><p>Al Hilal Bank's decision was very much a product of the growing ties between the UAE and Kazakhstan. There was an interest on the part of the Kazakhstani president and government to foster Islamic finance in the country, and in 2009, an intergovernmental agreement was signed regarding establishing an Islamic bank in Kazakhstan. As a result, Kazakhstan became Al Hilal's first foreign market outside of the UAE. We were established, licensed, and registered here fairly quickly after that, and started our operations in early 2010. Cooperation and support on the legal and regulatory framework from the Kazakhstani government has continued ever since. Most recently, the Astana International Finance Centre emphasized its focus on Islamic finance as one of its key pillars. For the last five years, we have been profitable with our corporate business here. We have an established client base, and we have continued to build the business, though on a careful basis and risk-conservative approach</p><h4>In 2017, Al Hilal took the step to establish its retail business in Kazakhstan. Why now?</h4><p>Retail banking has been part of the strategy for the bank for a while. We ran a pilot program in 2016 to attract retail deposits from individual customers. We had conservative targets and far exceeded those within weeks. People see that we are 100% government-owned in Abu Dhabi, which speaks to our credit-worthiness. We decided to launch our flagship retail branch in Almaty and the timing was fortuitous. With other developments in the local banking market, we have been able to present Al Hilal Bank as a strong partner for people seeking a safe and secure place to deposit their money.</p><h4>How would you describe Al Hilal Bank's typical client base, particularly in the retail segments?<br></h4><p>We are focused on quality rather than seeking to grab a large market share of the retail segment; we will acquire new retail customers by applying a careful and considered approach and paying due attention to their credit-worthiness. We started with accounts and deposit products, partly to build the funding base we need to provide retail financing products. We aim to launch these products publicly in 2Q2018.</p><h4>How educated is the market today in Kazakhstan about Islamic financing products?</h4><p>Awareness and education about Islamic finance and some of the differences between it and conventional banking products are issues we have to deal with here in Kazakhstan. For example, there are some differences in the way Islamic banking products are treated from an accounting and tax perspective. We are mindful that there is a lack of awareness in the local market, and education is a big part of improving this. Nonetheless, this vision is also being supported and fostered from the very top. President Nazarbayev announced in September 2017 at the Global Islamic Finance Awards that Kazakhstan would issue a USD300-million sukuk in 2018. We see this as a potential investment opportunity both here and in the UAE.</p><h4>What are your key objectives and expectations for 2018?</h4><p>We are not seeking to roll out a large number of physical branches across the country. But we will look to expand our offering beyond the three cities where we have branches now—Shymkent, Almaty, and Astana—and potentially open another branch in one of the other regions at some point. Our expansion will be very much focused on digital and online offerings. We have an internet banking platform that we will roll out shortly. We have been doing this in steps on the retail side. We will seek to roll out a digital mobile app in the near future to offer remote banking services. In 2018, as we launch our financing products, we will start to build revenues from the retail business and will see more significant growth beyond 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of Expo 2017 in Astana?</h4><p>Expo 2017 was a significant event not only in Kazakhstan, but also across the world. The first such high-level event in the history of modern Kazakhstan, the theme of Expo 2017 was “Future Energy." Considering large-scale problems such as global warming, climate change, energy shortages, pollution, and so on, Expo 2017 managed to fully and objectively describe the global situation and stimulate the necessary interest in this field. Having a multiplicative effect, the event ensured the qualitative promotion of “Future Energy" in general and clean energy sources in particular. Great work has been done, and Kazakhstan has proven its ability to host such high-profile events. During the event, 105 projects were allocated to the 23 pavilions representing various countries. For this purpose we created an expert working group composed of representatives of domestic companies, experts in various industries, as well as representatives of the ministry. In the course of monitoring areas such as electricity, atomic energy, the environment, and oil and gas, the working group concluded that Kazakhstan has sufficient technological and commercial potential to implement such projects.</p><h4>What were some of its outcomes?</h4><p>The private sector as well as regional akimats (districts) are working intensively on selecting particular projects and establishing connections to realize them. Second, it was a truly historic event for the Kazakhstani science and energy spheres and a big step in the development of the former in particular. Under the auspices of Expo 2017 we had the unique opportunity to consolidate the work of more than 1,000 prominent scientists and engineers representing 51 countries. Thirdly, the Ministry of Energy conducted a study, “Foresight-2050," which was the most credible of its kind in the field of energy in 2017. It includes the description of trends that affect the structure of the world's power consumption and the emergence of new energy sources and consumers. One of the important objectives of the study is not only to determine the direction of these qualitative changes, but also to estimate their size and contribute to the implementation of the chosen strategy. The research suggests a change in the role of traditional energy, which indicates that alternative sources will play a significant role in providing for growing demand. Finally, all exhibitions are a platform for bilateral and multilateral negotiations and concluding related contracts. In this sense, the Expo witnessed the signing of a number of agreements that today enable the financing of renewable energy projects. These include an MoU between the Ministry of Energy and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) on cooperation and support for renewable energy development in Kazakhstan under which the EBRD plans to invest up to EUR200 million in renewable projects and attract private investment from other international financial institutions of up to EUR480 million; an MoU to implement renewable energy projects between the Ministry of Energy and companies such as Eni international and General Electric that will encourage international technologies to create wind power stations with a capacity of 50MW; and an agreement of intent between the Development Bank of Kazakhstan (DBK), CAPEC Green Energy, and a subsidiary of DBK, DBK-Leasing, on provisions to finance the first complex of a wind farm construction project with a capacity of 100MW.</p><h4>How important is Kazakhstan's growing role in the energy sector?</h4><p>In December 2016 Kazakhstan joined the OPEC+ agreement on the reduction of oil extraction. We pledged to cut production by 20,000bpd from 1.7 million bpd to 1.68 million bpd. The signing of this agreement was timely and significantly influenced the growth of oil prices and allowed it to reach USD60 per barrel, which positively impacted the economies of oil-exporting countries, including Kazakhstan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of the decisions leading up to the joint venture of Samruk-Kazyna Invest Green LLP and the construction of a 50-MW solar farm?</h4><p>In 2013, our colleagues from Samruk-Kazyna Invest went to London to meet United Green Group to explore opportunities for a partnership to develop the solar industry in Kazakhstan. Considering it was early days for the renewables sector here, this was a new market that required a new regulatory approach. As a sovereign fund with vast experience in international partnerships and responsible for the majority of the country's GDP, Samruk-Kazyna was the perfect partner for such venture, and United Green had a great deal of experience and knowledge in the solar industry; thus, it was a great merger. We also saw great support from the Ministry of Energy, which had established a new department for renewables at the time. The local akimat also joined with a USD4-million investment in our landmark project, Burnoye Solar-1. We started construction in 2014 with support from our shareholders, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Clean Technology Fund.</p><h4>How has this project increased confidence in a more sizeable solar and renewables sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Kazakhstan today finds itself in a bit of a trap. Our energy is amongst the cheapest in the world, second to last according to some estimates. As well as having a growing oil and gas industry, we have one of the largest coal reserves in the world. We have power plants that were installed 40-50 years ago; therefore, they are only paying for OPEX and incredibly cheap raw materials. That said, if we build more renewable energy plants, the cost of electricity would go up. Since everything depends on the low cost of energy, that would create a ripple effect in which the cost of everything will go up. Nonetheless, Kazakhstan has the potential to develop renewables to significant levels. From a political point of view, we have made many commitments. For example, our energy matrix is 1% renewables now, though our goal is to reach 3% by 2030 and 50% by 2050. We are constantly on the lookout and reforming ourselves in order to attract foreign investors to invest in renewables. As one of the major investors in this market, the main issue is the availability of long-term financing in our national currency. Auctions indicate growing competition and help us receive more attractive bids, though foreign entities typically require debt financing. We meet many investors every day who want to invest in Kazakhstan. Our prices are in tenge, and this confuses things as our currency fluctuates and has seen fairly drastic devaluation.</p><h4>During Expo 2017, you secured a USD44.5 million finance package from EBRD for the Burnoye Solar-2 project. What are your objectives and how is the development progressing?</h4><p>Construction has started, and we have completed about 20% of the work. We will finish construction and start electricity production in early summer 2018. We made our decision to keep investing and there are a few drivers for that, the key one being our strong partners. Burnoye Solar-1 was commissioned on time and is a successful project, producing far more than we expected. We have excellent financial settlements as well that are paid monthly without delays. The system and the laws are working; the feed-in tariff is also there and is not affected by the currency fluctuation. All of the government's commitments are being delivered. The market conditions have also become favorable for us in terms of equipment, as the solar industry is becoming more affordable. As the pioneers in this industry, this project and all future developments play a role that is far bigger than just business and contribute to the overall wellbeing of the nation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the vision behind setting up KB Enterprises in Kazakhstan, and how has the company evolved over the years?</h4><p>KB Enterprises was established in 2013 for the purpose of establishing a solar power plant in Kazakhstan. We started to develop our project with Siemens and had a combined team from Turkey, France, and Germany. Over time, however, Siemens pulled out of the solar industry as a full engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) company, since it only wanted to focus on providing equipment. We needed bankability in terms of EPC and, thus, had a tender process. We signed an EPC contract with Sumec Hardware from Nanjing, China, in June 2017. The solar power plant will have a capacity of 120MW and is located in Kabanbay Batyr village in the Tselinogorad region of Akmola Province. In terms of cost, the project is expected to be around USD165 million and financing will be handled within a consortium of several financial institutions.</p><h4>What is the timeline for the project?</h4><p>In May 2016, we had a groundbreaking ceremony together with the Dutch ambassador to Kazakhstan as well as the regional and provincial governors for the official project launch. The paperwork was fairly extensive, and the power purchase agreement (PPA) was completed in September 2016 and the contract finalized in October. Following the signing of the EPC agreement with Sumec in June 2017, we signed an agreement with Hill International Inc. as our project management company in the same month. Immediately after that, we started designing our solar power plant in coordination with Almaty Proekt Energo Story, Hill International, and Sumec Hardware. We got state approval in December 2017; thus, construction will be pushed to spring 2018. I am confident we are on course to finalize the project by March 2019.</p><h4>How important is Kazakhstan for KB Enterprise's global operations?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is our landmark project. And, we would like to create a sustainable economy through solar energy by integrating our projects into green houses and conventional agriculture in Kazakhstan. We are working closely with universities in the Netherlands on these initiatives. In addition, together with the Ministry of Economy of the Netherlands and Kazakhstani Embassy to the Netherlands, we are working on bringing state-of-the-art technologies to Kazakhstan by educating Kazakhstani students to train others in Kazakhstan. We are closely monitoring technological trends and applying our own experiences to remain up to date with our solutions. For example, on the R&amp;D side of solar energy, batteries are more important than panel technology, and this is our main focus and that of the industry overall. Likewise, one of our partners is producing dual-sided panels that capture light on both sides, which is another demonstration of our commitment to bringing innovation to the Kazakhstani market.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>I have great hopes for the solar and other renewable energies here, and this is absolutely reflected in our investment strategy here. The Expo 2017 focus on future energy helped raise general awareness of the government's priorities to develop renewable energy locally. And we are proud that we were the only company under the Dutch Pavilion at Expo 2017 to represent the renewable industry in Kazakhstan to the world. We are pioneers in this huge market. Kazakhstan measures 2.5 million sqkm and solar is one of the only solutions for our immediate needs. We have three solar projects that we will launch in 2018. We are also exploring opportunities in wind, biomass, geothermal, and hydroelectric energy. The projects we are working on for biomass in Zhambyl and Shymkent are huge and could require about 20,000ha of land. We look forward to completing our landmark solar project and are looking ahead to brighter opportunities in Kazakhstan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The ministry has been leading Kazakhstan's efforts to climb up the ease of doing business ranking in recent years. What have been your key objectives and achievements in this respect, and which initiatives can we expect to further ease investment?</h4><p><span></span>A new national strategy was developed to stimulate the inflow of investments, and work on its implementation has already begun. The experts of the World Bank and other international experts took part in the development. The government also drafted and submitted to parliament a draft of the new tax code with the aim of protecting the interests of the taxpayers. In addition, a new code on subsurface and subsoil use has been developed, in which an international system for calculating reserves will be introduced and free access to geological information will be ensured. In addition, a new customs code has been prepared, designed to give a significant incentive to develop business. A draft has been developed that improves the regulation of free economic and industrial zones.</p><h4><span></span>In your view, which sectors of economy will emerge as prime investment opportunities in 2018, and how is the ministry helping to attract investors in these industries?</h4><p>A number of sectors have been emphasized, and these are the sectors that are the most profitable and most likely to attract new investments aimed at improving efficiency. In general, two groups of industries are selected for proactive attraction of investments that realize the export potential of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Group I is “industries with existing potential:“ the food industry, deep processing of oil, gas and minerals (metallurgy, chemistry, and petro-chemistry), as well as engineering. Group I consists of industries in which it is possible to promote FDI focused on improving efficiency in the short or medium term. These industries represent sources of competitive advantages of Kazakhstan and will attract FDI, ultimately using Kazakhstan as a production base for exports. Information work will be proactively targeted at these industries, as well as increasing the quantity and quality of local suppliers. Group II is “promising sectors:“ ICT, tourism, and finance. This group consists of industries in which investors should be interested in the long term. These industries demonstrate good potential for attracting investment and increasing exports. For example, in tourism this means increasing the number of incoming tourists. For the financial sector, the successful functioning of the Astana International Financial Center is the first focus. For ICT, we are emphasizing the creation of a critical mass of specialists in this field in the country. In addition, these industries show a steady global demand for new investments and can potentially provide high profits for the country. On the part of the state, a number of activities will be carried out to improve the investment climate. These activities include creating favorable conditions for attracting investments; improving the protection of investors' rights; improving trade logistics and developing supply-side relations between foreign investors and local companies; implementing effective operational measures and development of new approaches to attract investment, improving institutional mechanisms for attracting, maintaining, and supporting investors; and developing proactive approaches to attracting and retaining investments. We are also focusing on PPPs and compliance with the privatization plan and PPP mechanisms with a particular priority on attracting foreign investments and ensuring the participation of foreign investors in the privatization process and PPP projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[factors-to-consider]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of your major achievements in 2017?</h4><p>There were two major achievements throughout 2017; one was the launch of Talan Towers, including the Ritz-Carlton, Astana hotel, while the second involved developments at RG Gold, a gold mining plant that was originally proposed five years ago. Over that five-year period, we conducted exploration, and in 2017, we completed the first phase for development, exploration, and production increase. We have quadrupled our resources and reserves, and doubled our production. Currently, we are considering the second phase of the RG Gold project, which is the development of primary ore, and will need to build a new plant for that. The second phase is large and capital intensive, and a significant project for us.</p><h4>Verny Capital is present in a variety of sectors. What have been some of the key performances across your portfolio of companies?</h4><p>In hospitality, we built and launched the Ritz-Carlton, Astana, taking advantage of the 2017 Expo. We hosted distinguished guests in the city during the event, as it is an exquisite hotel in a prime location. In banking, we completed a restructuring phase of Fortebank after the acquisition of Temirbank and Alliance Bank. We are ready for the new phase of development in the banking sector. In mining, we have increased production, resources, and reserves. In education, it has been three years since we started reforming the education process at Narxoz University, and we have achieved excellent results. We have significantly changed nearly all of the programs and added a series of new programs as well. We have also invited new teachers, changed many of the academic staff, and appointed a new rector. In 2018, we will start a new 10-year phase for the further development of the university. In telecommunications, the global industry experience is stabilizing and, at the same time, transforming. All telecom companies are becoming more or less infrastructure based. We will implement new products in the digital sphere. We hope to launch a new product in 2018 and have an entire program to submit to our clients. We have also identified new, bright investment opportunities. We are focused on expanding and improving our current assets and new investments will be announced upon proper analysis and decision making in 2018.</p><h4>2017 was a strong year for the country as Astana grew its international profile and the economy grew by around 4%. What is your overview of the economy?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is working in a tough economic environment. Low oil prices and an underdeveloped industrial sector are two factors that affect this. The 2017 Expo helps cities such as Astana attract more tourists. Kazakhstan should continue to develop industries such as logistics, transportation infrastructure, and agriculture. These are sectors where we see a great deal of potential for the country. The government should lead infrastructure projects with the involvements of the private sector. We do business in infrastructure; for example we own and manage a cargo airport. It is performing better due to our management and strategic view. There is great potential in transportation given the geographical positioning of the country.</p><h4>Looking ahead, what can we expect from Verny Capital in 2018?</h4><p>2018 promises more than previous years. However, our business cycles are moving faster than ever, making it more difficult to plan. Technology is developing rapidly and we are facing what I call a “certain uncertainty." Big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning—not to mention blockchain—are all factors to consider. I am all about new digital technologies, new digital realities, and a new digital philosophy. This is a challenge, and no one knows what will happen. We cannot predict how and to what level AI, big data, machine learning, and even blockchain will be developed and implemented. The technology has already entered our lives; it is a reality and we should embrace it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[new-ties-that-bind]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the successful journey of ZHERSU from its inception in 1992 to becoming one of the leading industrial holding companies in Kazakhstan today?</h4><p>When we were just starting, we did not have much knowledge about how the market economy functions. It was not easy to start a business in 1991-1992 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when the legal framework was not established yet and the economy was in crisis. As the former ties with the republics were lost there was a need to find new partners to provide new equipment and technologies for the country. Gradually, we came to realize that we could produce the same equipment and goods that we were bringing from abroad here in Kazakhstan much cheaper, faster, and of higher quality. We started developing in various directions such as construction, energy, agriculture, and IT.</p><h4>What are some of your upcoming plans in the agriculture industry?</h4><p>Most of our companies are developing successfully, but I would say the major focus that we have had for the last two years is in the agricultural sector. Here we have new projects that will support our production—gas and water purifying and water desalination plants. In the future, the agricultural sector is going to be the key for Kazakhstan. Therefore, we are planning to develop our brand in meat and honey production. The countries most interested in importing these goods are Russia, China, Japan, and Australia. We are hoping to finish a new horse farm and two farms for the breeding of cattle at end of the summer or in early autumn 2018, totaling thousands of new livestock. One of our major goals right now is to make our product competitive in foreign markets. Farming has great potential here.</p><h4>How active are you today internationally, and how important is it for the business today?</h4><p>Of course, we are always keeping an eye on international markets and opportunities, mostly because the local market is quite limited in size. We work with various countries depending on their expertise. For example, in energy, our major partners are China, Japan, Germany, France, the US, Italy, and Spain. In agriculture, we have close ties within Eurasian Union but also cooperate with some other European countries. So, based on the sphere of economy, we partner with the companies in specific markets that possess the technology necessary for us to develop further. At the same time, we are trying to develop the technology here as we are seeing great improvements in local manufacturing. Economic conditions in Kazakhstan will gradually improve in the years ahead, so we want to be well positioned with a sustainable and diversified local portfolio.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018 specifically?</h4><p>In 2018, we are planning to start the water purifying and desalination project as it addresses a serious problem throughout Kazakhstan today. If the project turns out to be a success, we will implement it in different regions of the country. We are preparing a number of energy stations projects to be built in 2019 based on anticipated legislation. In 2018, we will finish the longest electricity cable line project (1,800km) in the northeast region of Kazakhstan. Also, the gas purifying plant is an interesting and significant project for the country because oil extraction is growing and gas recycling negatively effects the ecological situation. We are quite optimistic about the year ahead, specifically about our current and upcoming projects in various spheres, such as in agricultural. These projects will have significant importance for the country in terms of its international image and branding. At the same time, at the local level these projects will also have a positive effect by creating new work places and bringing true value to the local consumer. </p>]]></richbody0content>

CNN was particularly good in its coverage of the Expo, the historical Silk Road, and Kazakhstan today. Kazakhstan's enormous commitment of time and financial resources was well spent, and the Expo “Future Energy" theme underscored the country's vision for the future, a vision that is shared by all of the world's developed countries. AmCham also produced a magazine devoted to Expo and its theme that showcased our members' efforts across all sectors to contribute to the development of energy today and in the future, expanding the theme to include the broader green economy. We were pleased to be able to show AmCham member companies fully participating in building this future for Kazakhstan.</p><h4>With higher than 3% GDP expected for 2017, which specific sectors have potential to continually grow the economy?</h4><p>There are many opportunities available, though there still are some issues that the government needs to address. Agriculture could be enormously important for Kazakhstan; however, land reform needs to be addressed for the country's agricultural potential to be fully realized. Mining is also a priority sector, but the new Mining Code that has been developed needs to be enacted. Major mining companies are anxious to begin large-scale exploratory operations, but first they need the assurances that will be entailed by the new code, which is based on the Australian Mining Code. Mining and agriculture could both be true growth industries for Kazakhstan if the fundamentals necessary for their development are supported by the government. The government is also keen to develop innovative technology aiming to create a technology hub in Kazakhstan. With the development of the New Silk Road project, logistics is another priority sector with a promising future. Kazakhstan's proximity to China, Russia, and Europe are key to the future of logistics.</p><h4>What are some of the major issues being brought forward to the government by the business community?</h4><p>AmCham is fortunate to have established a productive advocacy platform with the government, which actively seeks out AmCham advice and recommendations on the most crucial investment issues. Eight years ago, the prime minister created the Council to Improve the Investment Climate, a monthly forum for AmCham and its members to meet with cabinet ministers responsible for the country's economy and which is actively chaired by the current Prime Minister, Bakhytzhan Sagintayev. Prime Minister Sagintayev is proactive and truly wants to see the reforms that will enable Kazakhstan to fully realize its economic potential. Issues raised at the council this past year have been privatization, deregulation, currency controls, intellectual property protection, tax reform, judicial reform, and environmental regulatory change, the last issue following on Expo's future energy theme. These are all vital issues that require a systemic approach with both immediate and long-term objectives. Privatization is a current priority as the government seeks to return to the private sector companies that were taken under the government's wing during and after the 2008 financial crisis. Some public sector institutions will also be privatized, namely the state railway system. This is not an easy process and is one that has proven difficult even for highly developed European countries. Currency controls are a thorny topic at present: the National Bank is keen to introduce more stringent currency controls under its de-dollarization initiative, which worries the investment community. We have pointed out that this may have a negative impact on the investment environment, and the government has listened carefully to our views. The council has proven a very productive forum to bring the government into direct contact with investors and to make the investment community's voice heard. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the recent key projects you have been involved in?</h4><p>This year has been an exciting year for EBRD thanks largely to the big green economy projects we have financed. Our headline project was the USD50-million investments in the 50-MW Burnoye Solar-2 project, which is an exciting development in green economy investment and commercial scale renewables. Just before the opening of Expo, we signed a framework agreement with the Ministry of Energy for USD200 million. This is a project support agreement that allows us to invest this amount in the future. We expect more projects will follow throughout 2018 and 2019. It is important to understand that these projects are commercial in scale and highly bankable. Other sectors are also proving interesting for us, such as transport infrastructure. We are looking at everything from municipal infrastructure to irrigation systems. We want to help create a proper ecosystem for small- and medium-sized businesses to operate in some of the more remote regions of the country. I also want to highlight the banking and financial sectors; we have a successful program for SMEs and another program that supports female entrepreneurs through commercial banks in the country.</p><h4>As you reach your lending limit with Kazakhstan's sovereign wealth fund, how will this impact your overall strategy going forward?</h4><p>Our overall strategy remains to focus on the key opportunities across the country. We recently approved our strategy for the next four years in the country, and we will focus on developing and modernizing the state sector and helping to move onto more market-based activities. We will also focus on the financial sector and capital market development, and invest heavily in developing infrastructure and connectivity both domestically and internationally. As mentioned, we will continue to focus on green investment in a broad sense, looking at renewable energies and energy efficiency. The strategy is in place, and it is very much a continuation of what we did before. The fact that we will have to reduce our investment in the sovereign wealth fund may impact the types of investments we do in the country, but it does not have a fundamental impact on our overall strategy. We concentrate on finding project opportunities across these strategic themes. There are exciting projects, and there are some attractive investment areas. We expect to see much larger projects with international sponsors across the country. Kazakhstan is one of the most energy inefficient countries in the world, so we see this area as being ripe for major improvement and ourselves as a key catalyst for investment in these areas.</p><h4>Which factors have led to your assessment of the Kazakhstani economy's potential for 2017?</h4><p>Kazakhstan has weathered the recent slump in oil prices well. A lot of state funds were used to support the economy, and the results were good. We have projected this year's growth in the Kazakh economy at 3.8%. This is reasonable, and it provides a good base moving forward. The real question is how to go from 3.8% growth to 5-6% growth. In order for the country to emerge as a more developed market, it needs to find a way to grow around these levels. We also have to consider the quality of growth and which sectors are growing and how the growth is distributed across the various regions of the country. On the macro level we still need to refer back to the traditional sectors. There is no getting away from the fact that the backbone of the economy will remain oil and other extractive resources. What is important, however, is that there are a lot of improvements in competitiveness and governance within these sectors, so improving efficiencies in traditional sectors has to be a priority. The digitalization revolution alone can bring huge benefits to the traditional sectors in Kazakhstan, and the state apparatus itself. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the key operational achievements at Efes Kazakhstan over the last year?</h4><p>2017 was not an easy year for Efes Kazakhstan and the beer industry in general. We still suffer from the devaluation of the local currency and, as a consequence, the increased prices of imported materials, which affected our financials. The tax burden is increasing every year, including an excise jump this year of 50%. Competition is very strong and not always fair. However, despite these unfortunate circumstances, we managed to keep our leadership position with a more-than 52% market share. We increased our sales in can and keg formats by 22 and 18%, respectively. Our total sales increased by incredible 15%—a level of performance we have not been experiencing over recent years. We work hard to improve our brands portfolio. For instance, we launched very successful brands, including Slavna Pivnice, produced by authentic Czech traditions of brewing, and Stary Melnik Iz Bochonka, which is one of the most consumed local beers in Russia. They are growing MoM, and in less than nine months Slavna Pivnice reached a 1.5% market share. We achieved these impressive results by increasing the efficiency of our production. For example, our water consumption decreased by 12% per liter of beer, which makes us one of the best companies in the world in terms of water consumption and brings us to the highest international standards. We do this to preserve nature in accordance with our sustainability strategy.</p><h4>Leading global breweries AB InBev and Anadolu Efes Group have merged their businesses in Russia and Ukraine. What impact, if any, could this have on operations in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The merger of AB InBev and SABMiller—the number one and two brewing companies in the world—was a huge transaction. Since Anadolu Efes Group and SABMiller were in partnership, after the merger AB InBev acquired a 24% equity stake. It was then decided that both companies would merge their business in Russia and Ukraine 50-50. We believe that this decision will strengthen our positions in both countries with the potential for further growth. There is no decision on Kazakhstan operations yet. However, we expect the global merger will make our portfolio stronger and more diverse with wider range of beers for consumers.</p><h4>How would you describe the current trends in Kazakhstan's F&amp;B sector and what opportunities do you foresee in the near future?</h4><p>I can say that despite the difficulties, the beer market is growing because of the low base level we were at in 2016. We hope this trend will continue in the coming years with the support of the government's policy to decrease consumption of alcohol per capita by switching consumers from hard liquors to soft alcohol drinks, which corresponds with the best international practice. We have ambitious plans for the years to come, which includes further improvements of our portfolio and route-to-market, innovations in products and trade marketing, and the launch of new brands and propositions. Moreover, we will be focusing on maintaining an excellent quality of products with 100% natural ingredients. We want the freshest beer for our consumers, investments in our personnel, and an increase in our corporate social responsibility. We are sure that in the future we will be able to fortify our leadership positions in all segments of the market, improve our financial results, and make our organization stronger than ever before. All this will be possible thanks to the wide audience of our consumers, and we are very proud to bring them the best beers in Kazakhstan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does Kazakhstan stand today in terms of how 2017 progressed and which macroeconomic factors have contributed to this positive outlook?</h4><p>We saw growth of 4% in the first 10 months of 2017, which is excellent. One contributing factor was the rise in oil prices. The improved price for oil and commodities in general was a gain, as was the increased production from the Kashagan oil field. In mining, we see huge additional excavation works going on, likely directly attributable to the increased commodity prices. Oil and gas and mining together are growing at about 8-10%. In addition, we are also seeing a significantly big increase in manufacturing, which has grown over 7%. The pharmaceuticals industry is in fact a champion of the economy and is growing at about 37%. Another great contributor to Kazakhstan's GDP growth is trade. External trade has picked up tremendously, growing by about 35%, and we see our trade balance improving greatly from 2016. There has also been an increase in investment, with a relatively stable growth of about 5%. We are tracking not only investment overall, but also those in the private sector, and the economy is growing not only on the back of state-run and sponsored programs. FDI is a great contributor as well, and total FDI stood at about USD12 billion for six months</p><h4>The Ministry of the National Economy's Strategy 2025 targets GDP growth of no less than 4.5% within eight years. What are the main drivers and keys to achieving this goal?</h4><p>We want the private sector to play a more active role in the economy than it is currently. Privatization will undeniably improve the quality and volume of growth. Hopefully by 2025, we will have fully privatized to the level that we want to, including KazMunayGas (KMG) and other Samruk Kazyna assets, and we will not have any non-core assets at the regional and municipal levels. Another driver is moving from a centralized economy, where all the decisions are made in Astana, to a more decentralized model. We would like to give our regions more economic freedom and, with that, the means of achieving their goals. The way to do it is to give them greater taxation authorities, though we have yet to finalize these mechanisms. This change will not only provide additional tax revenues and mechanisms for the local authorities, but also incentivize them to work closely with taxpayers and investors. We also want to focus more on exports, particularly non-natural resource exports.</p><h4>What opportunities will reforms to the PPP laws bring in the long run for private-sector involvement in the economy?</h4><p>Many countries have been trying to implement and harness PPPs. It is tough, especially for countries with a Soviet background where everything has to be controlled and repeatedly checked for accountability. We thus have to change the mentality and the law, and the way we operate our models is new as well. It is tough and somewhat subjective to define a fair return for private sector investors; it is not written in the budget code or government resolution. This is holding back significant PPP implementation in Kazakhstan. Hopefully, potential investors will see our dedication toward reform as a positive sign. We see a large increase in PPPs on a local and regional level, for example for kindergartens, small sports centers, and waste management plants. We are introducing many changes to our budget code and laws on PPPs; for example, we have cut back on the time and procedures required and introduced a more efficient sharing of risk. We have also shared our responsibility with the regions; obligations up to about USD20 million can be taken at the local level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the vision behind the creation of KIPIC in 2016?</h4><p>The downstream sector is an important part of the 2030 strategy of maximizing the value of hydrocarbons in Kuwait. The Al Zour Refinery has been approved and is now under execution, and an LNG import terminal (LNGI) was part of the 2030 strategy for supply of clean energy to Kuwait' industrial &amp; power sector. After a study, KIPIC was established in late 2016 as an integrated company to manage the integration between refining and petrochemical activities to gain synergies and maximize the value of hydrocarbons. KIPIC was initially mandated to construct and operate three mega-sized projects at Al Zour: the Al Zour Refinery, LNGI, and downstream petrochemical production facilities. Ensuring that these three megaprojects are as integrated as possible is the essence of this company despite the fact that these projects were approved and being implemented on different time schedules.</p><h4>How has the organization evolved since it was founded over a year ago?</h4><p>After the plan to create KIPIC was formed in late 2016 and the legwork was done, the process of establishing the legal entity was finalized in November 2016. We have come a long way from forming the articles of association and objectives of the company and receiving approval from Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), the Kuwait Supreme Petroleum Council, and several ministries. Considering the size of the company, the time it took to finalize all the necessary legal steps was short and commendable. Once the legal entity was established, we needed to determine the organization structure of the company and its vision. This was approved in November 2016, along with the appointment of the board and the management. We had to be absolutely sure we were ready to assume responsibility; because the last thing we wanted was to hinder the progress of the ongoing projects during the transition of these projects to KIPIC. We developed a detailed plan that ensured a smooth transfer of responsibilities without interruption. This plan saw to it that by May 2017 the foundation and systems would be in place to have everything transferred to KIPIC, and it is heartening to note that all went according to plan. Before the establishment of KIPIC, the progress of Al Zour Refinery was around 15%, and now it is around 42%. LNGI progressed from 12 to 20%. Things are also moving forward at the petrochemical Project.  The company faces many challenges in terms of the resources to be brought in and the right systems to be established. Things are now moving according to plan and I hope that by 2018 that many of the well detailed systems that are needed to equip the company will be in place.</p><h4>What are the advantages of integrating refining and petrochemical activities?</h4><p>The ultimate goal is to maximize the value of Kuwait's hydrocarbon assets. We enhance the margin of crude oil by refining it. These refined products can be used as feedstock to produce petrochemical products such as Poly propylene, p Xylene, benzene etc., to increase the margins even more. The integration of refining and petrochemical activities leads to important synergies. It ensures that we do not seek for profit maximization in isolation, but rather, look for the approach for maximized profit across the value chain and help us achieve the greatest margins. By having everything under one umbrella, we will save on investment and reduce our operating costs.</p><h4>How do you assess the growth potential of downstream industries in Kuwait?</h4><p>There is a great deal of potential in the petrochemical and refining industries. Today Kuwait is producing 3 million bpd crude oil majority of which is exported: Less than a third is refined within Kuwait. Our 2030 strategy is coming into play as well and we are increasing hydrocarbon production to 4.75 million bpd. A large portion of this crude will be refined here; our refining capacity is set to increase to 1.4 million bpd. It is better to maximize the value of the petrochemical industry than to just refine more crude.</p><h4>How do you see KIPIC contributing to the future of Kuwait and generating employment opportunities?</h4><p>Our growth programs will tap into Kuwait's many strategic goals. Maximizing the value chain of crude will be a great resource for the economy of Kuwait, and the investments in the three megaprojects will create a positive environment for many industries and raw materials. Moreover, it will create 2,700 direct employment opportunities, as well as the jobs that are available for contractors and maintenance. The investments will provide an avenue for the private sector to be involved in the downstream industry. In addition, we will supply the country with clean and high-quality fuel that will help reduce the impact on the environment. Together, these points make up KIPIC's contribution to the future of Kuwait.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will focus on the future to ensure the progress of the project within our time and budget limits, and that things move according to plan. According to our schedule the refinery should be completed by 2019. We need to ensure that our readiness plan for commissioning, operating, and maintaining the refinery is ready, and are working hard on this. To obtain the synergies and capital efficiency we are seeking, it is important that the different megaprojects do not experience delays. In this way, we will have the benefits of integration right away.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[lic-alcibiades-vasquez-velasquez-minister-of-social-development]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the Ministry's work during your mandate?</h4><p>If I had to evaluate it first at a general level and then at the level of the Ministry of Social Development, the government of President Varela will go down in history as one that has been dedicated to addressing an unprecedented social agenda in the country and taking care of sectors that for decades had not been given a response in housing matters. Under him alone, some 80,000 new housing units have been added. It is also the first time a government has dared to implement decentralization, and we are satisfied with a government that opted for dialogue rather than force. Granted, it has been four difficult and intense years, but when we reach the end of our term, we can point out that we have many things to present to the country. The partnership with the private sector has allowed us to promote productive inclusion, and we are training many women who are heads of families through banks and universities. Of course, I can not leave out the population with a disability: today we have more than 20,000 people with severe disabilities whose needs are met through financial resources and follow up through institutions and programs. The rich can defend themselves, but the poor require the attention of others.</p><h4>The ministry's budget is around USD280 million. How do you distribute it? </h4><p>The budget in 2017 was about USD280 million, and it did not change much for 2018. As for its distribution, USD225 million is destined for investment in human capital and conditional economic transfers, though this is still insufficient. We have had the fortune of having sustained economic growth of 5-6%, which is great, but it is not enough. We must work on these public policies foreseeing the sustainability of the programs because it is useless to do this for two years if the economy recedes. I regret that we have been left too short in terms of infrastructure and would like to improve the service centers, but the infrastructure budget for MIDES is insufficient. However, the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank have given MIDES a seven-year loan to equip the centers for infant care technology.</p><h4>What is your strategy to cooperate with other ministries in social issues?</h4><p>From my own experience, I have fluid communication and friendship with the vast majority of the cabinet, especially those within the social branch such as the Ministry of Health, Education, Labor and Social Welfare, Environment, and Housing. In the same way, we maintain a good relationship with all other ministries.</p><h4>What are the challenges for the next minister?</h4><p>He or she will have several, but I hope they continue with each project as well as I did for previous administrations' projects. The first challenge is that it will not be easy to dismantle the public policy issues that have been approved for the poorest sectors: the political game is played through social programs, and the population has benefited from these programs, so whoever arrives will have to continue betting on equity and the distribution of wealth. The next minister has to understand that working as a team brings success. Finally, he or she cannot ignore civil society, international organizations, or the private sector; these are our allies for meeting our sustainable development objectives. Panama is showing that the agenda 2030 can be fulfilled even by 2025.</p><h4>What does it mean for you that MIDES is the most beloved public institution in the country? What would you like to achieve before leaving?</h4><p>For us, it is with great pride that we see the public opinion polls, especially since the ministry was in poor condition when we took over. I have experienced the difficulties of poverty in my own life, which is why I know that social mobility is possible. In terms of objectives, I would like to see our most vulnerable population go down and to eradicate extreme poverty. Another objective is to be able to integrate the development of Panama with our native people. These things are not done overnight but we hope that the next government will have the same vocation as ours.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[World of Fashion]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[hh-princess-noura-bint-faisal-al-saud-founder-saudi-fashion-community]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your journey in fashion been so far?</h4><p>My vision for Saudi Arabia was to create a platform for Saudi designers to give them the exposure they deserve. When the Arab Fashion Council approached me and wanted to collaborate, I saw this as an opportunity to fulfill this objective and to empower the talent that our country has to offer. The fashion week we organized in April was the first of its kind and the kickoff of a journey much larger. That said, we have decided now to take a new path by rebranding the event as the Saudi Fashion Week, while I am working on a more comprehensive approach toward our domestic fashion industry via the establishment of the Saudi Fashion Community as a new concept. Here, the goal is to encourage Saudi designers to get out there and bring their work up to international standards. As a Saudi woman myself, I understand them more than anyone, and with my background and international experience, I have the connections—in Japan, France, and the US—to provide them with the right support and to truly build a fashion community in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How did the first fashion week ever in Saudi Arabia come around?</h4><p>There were many challenges to organize this event, and we faced many obstacles and resistance in what we wanted to establish. We always believed it was possible, and with the generous support of the General Entertainment Authority (GEA), we made our ambitions reality. Organizing a first-time event with international standards was not easy; however, with our determination we made it work. The result was a successful event with a broad range of renowned designers and great international media coverage. The first fashion week that took place in April was only the starting point, and we are poised to organize more events on different scales. Aside from events, we will focus on many different approaches to develop our Saudi fashion community, including educational and cultural projects to support and encourage local designers. In addition to design, we want to introduce manufacturing to the market. We should be able to have the manufacturing localized and up to international standards.</p><h4>How do you envision approaching this from an educational perspective?</h4><p>There are already institutes for fashion design; the task for us is to take them to the next level. By creating the Saudi Fashion Community, we want to further professionalize the way of teaching, align it with international practice, and encourage local talent. We want our designers to be fully recognized internationally. The talent is there, though it is not always guided in the right direction. To compete in the international arena, we should nurture our students and show the pathway to make this a professional career for them. This is our main focus right now.</p><h4>With the opening up of the entertainment sector and the activities coordinated by GEA, how do you envision alignment for your events?</h4><p>The GEA is a crucial authority for all of these events to happen. Organizing such events is unchartered territory in the Kingdom, so with its support and development of regulation, it becomes much smoother. As it represents the government, it makes the event more accepted by society. GEA has an experienced and dedicated team and understands how to allocate its budget to support fashion, F&amp;B, music, theater, and many other events. With the current transformation of Saudi Arabia, it plays a key role, and we are grateful for its support in organizing the first fashion week in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How do you see fashion in the context of sports?</h4><p>The sports industry is booming in the country, and the General Sports Authority (GSA) is doing an excellent job in encouraging top sports and promoting mass participation. There are many new sport events happening, and I look forward to exploring more collaboration with its organizers. Fashion design is often related to sport, with many top brands having sports lines. Also, there are special Arabic interpretations, like the collaboration by GSA with Nike to develop the first sport hijab. This is just one example, and I envision significantly more overlap and collaboration between Saudi designers and different disciplines of sports. Once the Saudi Fashion Community is more established, we strive to develop a partnership program with GSA to promote sport and fashion design.</p><h4>How do you envision bringing Saudi fashion designers into the international market?</h4><p>As part of our mandate at the Saudi Fashion Community, we want to make Saudi designers more aware of international opportunities and encourage them to develop themselves up to these international standards. That is the first priority: fully unlocking their talents. Second, we will arrange for them to participate in local and international events to showcase their designs. The platform we want to create is not just focused on promoting local design, but also becoming a contact point for international designers that want to come into the market and establish themselves here with design boutiques and tailor shops. In this way, we will create a two-way street with mutual benefits for all the parties involved. It would be fantastic if we could get our Saudi designers recognized internationally for their talents in this way.</p><h4>As a young female leader of the new generation Saudis, what is your message to aspiring graduates that want to fulfill their ambitions?</h4><p>My message to every Saudi woman is to never give up on anything. If you have found your passion and outlined your ambition, do it and believe that you can do it. No one and nothing should be able to stop one from fulfilling their dreams. A year ago, no one would have believed it if we had told them about our plans to organize a multi-day fashion show in Riyadh, and yet we did. Never give up on your ambitions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Right Trajectory]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-right-trajectory]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In 2017, Kazakhstan became a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. We also became the first state among the countries of the CIS and Eastern Europe to be chosen by the world community to host Expo 2017. A successfully functioning model of a market economy has been built in Kazakhstan. In 2017, the country, having overcome the negative consequences of the global crisis, returned to the trajectory of strong growth. At the end of the year, GDP growth was 4%, and industrial production grew by more than 7%. In addition, the processing sector exceeded 40% in the total volume of industry. Kazakhstan's successful development has allowed the formation of a middle class.</p><p>The era of “oil abundance" is almost coming to an end. The country needs a new quality of development. Global trends show that it should be based primarily on the broad implementation of Fourth Industrial Revolution  (Industry 4.0) elements. This brings both challenges and opportunities. I am confident that Kazakhstan has all the necessary attributes to join the ranks of leaders in this new world. Industrialization should become the flagship of the introduction of new technologies. Its results became one of the main stabilizing factors in the crisis years of 2014-2015, when oil prices fell sharply. Therefore, the focus on the processing sector with high labor productivity remains unchanged. At the same time, industrialization should become more innovative, taking advantage of Industry 4.0. It is necessary to develop and test new instruments aimed at modernizing and digitizing our enterprises with a focus on exporting products. They should primarily stimulate the transfer of technology. A pilot project on the digitization of several of Kazakhstan's industrial enterprises should be implemented, and then this experience should be widely expanded. The most important issue is the development of our own ecosystem of developers of digital and other innovative solutions. It should take shape around innovation centers, such as the Nazarbayev University, the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC), and the International Technology Park of IT Startups. The main factors for the success of the innovative ecosystem are stimulation of the demand for new technologies by the real sector and the functioning of the private venture financing market. In addition, the development of IT and engineering services is of particular importance. It is necessary to adapt education, communication, and standardization systems to the needs of the new industrialization. In 2018, it is necessary to begin the development of the third five-year industrialization period devoted to the emergence of digital-age industry.<br><br>The world of the 21st century still needs natural resources, which will have a special place in the development of the global economy and the economy of our country in the future. It is necessary, however, to critically rethink the organization of commodity industries and approaches to the management of natural resources. It is necessary to actively implement integrated information and technology platforms. Expo 2017, held in Astana, showed rapid progress in the sphere of alternative and clean energy. Today, renewable energy sources (RES) account for a quarter of the world's electricity production. According to forecasts, by 2050 this figure will reach 80%. We have set the goal of increasing the share of alternative energy in Kazakhstan to 30% by 2030. Today, we already have 55 renewable energy facilities with a total capacity of 336MW, which generated about 1.1 billion kWh of green energy in 2017. It is important to stimulate business and to invest in green technologies. Regional governors should take measures on the modern disposal and recycling of solid domestic waste with the broad involvement of small- and medium-sized enterprises. These and other measures will require the updating of legislation, including the Environmental Code.<br><br>Smart technologies are a chance for a breakthrough in the development of the agricultural industry. The agrarian policy should be aimed at a radical increase in labor productivity and growth in exports of processed agricultural products.<br><br>It is necessary to ensure the processing of raw materials and enter world markets with high-quality end products. The development of agrarian science is a priority and requires significant attention. It should focus primarily on the transfer of new technologies and their adaptation to domestic conditions. The state, together with the private sector, should find strategic niches in international markets and promote domestic production in these areas. Intensification of agriculture should take place in line with the preservation of quality and mindful of the ecological compatibility of products. This will create and promote a brand of natural food products. “Made in Kazakhstan" should become recognizable across the world. It is necessary to overhaul ineffective subsidies to reduce the cost of bank loans for agribusiness entities. I therefore gave the order to ensure the increase of labor productivity in the agro-industrial sector and the increase of the export of processed agricultural products by at least 2.5 times within the next five years.<br><br>Today, several transcontinental corridors pass through Kazakhstan. In general, the transit of goods through Kazakhstan in 2017 increased by 17% and amounted to almost 17 million tons. The task is to bring annual revenues from transit in 2020 to USD5 billion. This will make it possible to return the funds spent by the state on infrastructure within the shortest possible timeframe. It is necessary to ensure the large-scale introduction of digital technologies, such as blockchain, to track the movement of goods online and to ensure their unhindered transit, as well as to simplify customs operations. Modern solutions allow us to organize the interactions of all links of the logistics chain. The use of big data will help provide high-quality analytics, identify areas of growth, and reduce excess costs. To achieve this, it is necessary to introduce an intelligent transport system. This will allow us to effectively manage transport flows and determine the requirement for further infrastructure development. To improve intra-regional mobility, it is important to increase funding for the repair and reconstruction of the local road networks. The total budget allocated annually for this should be increased to KZT150 billion in the medium term. It is necessary to ensure the active participation of all regional governments in this work.<br></p><p>2018 is the 20th anniversary of our capital, Astana. Its formation as one of the most important centers of Eurasia's development is a source of common pride. Modern technologies provide effective solutions to the problems of a fast-growing metropolis. It is necessary to introduce comprehensive management of the urban environment based on the smart city concept and the development of competences of those people moving to the city. The world has come to an understanding that it is cities that compete for investors. Therefore, based on the experience of Astana, it is necessary to form a benchmark standard for a smart city and start expanding best practices and an exchange of experiences between the cities of Kazakhstan. Smart cities will be the engines of regional development, spreading innovations and improvement to quality of life throughout the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

And we are honored, truly honored, to have been the first country to recognize Kazakhstani independence on Christmas Day 1991. That is a long time ago, but not that long. Kazakhstan has made incredible strides.</p><p>Since that time, the US and Kazakhstan have worked together to advance peace and security in the region and far beyond.<br>Together, we dismantled Kazakhstan's nuclear weapons infrastructure and ensured a safer and healthier future for the children of Kazakhstan and for the world at large. We have pursued opportunities to increase investment in Kazakhstan, and the energy sector in particular.<br><br>And today, our strategic partnership with Kazakhstan has advanced my South Asia strategy, which is working—and working far more rapidly than anybody would understand—and providing crucial support for our forces in Afghanistan and denying safe haven for terrorists.<br><br>This cooperation has grown even stronger this month during Kazakhstan's presidency of the United Nations Security Council. And I will say, that is a great honor.<br><br>President Nazarbayev and I had a series of discussions on how our relationship can further the safety, prosperity, and wellbeing of our people. Kazakhstan is a valued partner in our efforts to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons. Together, we are determined to prevent the North Korean regime from threatening the world with nuclear devastation.<br><br>I also want to thank the President for his full support for our South Asia strategy, including our efforts in Afghanistan. I greatly appreciate the President's personal assurances that Kazakhstan will continue to provide critical logistical support and access for our troops fighting ISIS and the Taliban, where we have made tremendous strides.<br><br>We also appreciate Kazakhstan's work to train and educate Afghan civilian specialists, and I am grateful for the President's pledge of additional support to bolster Afghan security. The US seeks partners who are strong, prosperous, respectful of their neighbors, and in control of their own destinies.<br><br>I am pleased that the President has shared his plan for Kazakhstan to become a top-30 global economy by 2050, and he is on his way—very rapidly. He is also working to improve Kazakhstan's business environment, which will create new opportunities for American companies who are over there, and lots of jobs are being provided to both countries.<br><br>American businesses are currently among the largest investors in Kazakhstan. President Nazarbayev will attend a roundtable with American business executives at the US Chamber of Commerce to further advance our commercial ties.<br>We also agree that fair and reciprocal—such an important word, “reciprocal"—trade benefits both of our countries.<br><br>I greatly appreciate Kazakhstan's participation in our Central Asia Trade Forum and in our Central Asia Trade and Investment Framework Agreement. The President and I are working together to bring high-quality US products and services to the Kazakhstani people—so important.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Riyadh's most significant assets as it seeks to become a global economic center?</h4><p>Riyadh is the vibrant capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which is the largest economy in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Riyadh's strategic location at the heart of Saudi Arabia offers it considerable advantage and access to markets across MENA, Europe, and rapidly developing Africa and Asia. Riyadh today has a population of 6.5 million people. Most are young people, with 35% of the total aged under 15 years. Our new generation are among the most educated and technologically savvy people in the region. Riyadh has a vision to be among the best 100 cities in the world by 2030. The vision is ongoing through many planning and strategic initiatives across all sectors. This includes an ambitious strategy for the redevelopment of the historic core of the city (1,500ha) in partnership with the Kingdom's Public Investment Fund (PIF). Furthermore, we are developing major parks and environmental projects such as the prize-winning Wadi Hanifah restoration and the restoration of Historic Addiriyah—a UNESCO World Heritage Site—that will help make Riyadh a liveable city that celebrates its rich heritage and history as it confidently projects itself onto the world stage. To enhance our infrastructure, we are working on the King Abdulaziz Public Transport Project, which involves a 176-km metro system with six lines and 85 stations supported by an extensive new bus network. King Khalid International Airport is renewed and expanded, where the new domestic terminal is already in operation and terminals 3 and 4 are being refurbished and upgraded. To link Riyadh with the region and nation, we launched new national railway projects with Riyadh as the hub. This includes the new Saudi Land Bridge project that will provide a rail link between Jeddah and Riyadh and onward to the Arabian Gulf coast using the existing freight and passenger railway lines. Recently, we inaugurated the 2,750-km railroad linking the capital to Majma'a, Qassim, Hail, Aljawf, and Qurayyat. Riyadh is the headquarter of the country's commercial banks, Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), the Capital Markets Authority (CMA), and PIF. PIF, with assets approaching USD300 billion, is undergoing rapid growth and seeking to make bigger investments both at home and abroad. It is focusing on projects linked to the ambitious Saudi Vision 2030 economic transformation plan. Riyadh encompasses King Abdullah Financial Centre, which will house the headquarters of CMA; financial corporations and banks; offices of legal accountants, lawyers and financial advisory services; as well as the Classification Authorities and providers of technological services. Also, the capital academy for financial specializations and courses will be established here. Riyadh is also being transformed under an ambitious project to build digital connectivity with ITC infrastructure, creating Smart Riyadh. We are now a technology cluster, with leading institutes specialising in nanotechnology and energy—including nuclear and renewable energy—as well as the Riyadh Techno-Valley project and the Information and Telecommunications Technology Complex (IITC). There are two industrial cities in Riyadh and a third under construction, with outlying industrial cities being developed elsewhere in Riyadh Province. Education and health services are leading parts of Riyadh's assets, where excellent services are available for the city's population and for visitors, making Riyadh a hub for such services in the region. A key goal of Vision 2030 for the Kingdom is creating private sector jobs and reducing the economy's dependency on oil through diversification. Riyadh's sophisticated and modern infrastructure, available investment capital, strategic location, and human resources propel investment and industrial growth in these new directions. However, Riyadh's major asset remains its people: well-educated, well-traveled internationally, welcoming, family-oriented, and willing to accept and embrace change and modernization in all aspects of life.</p><h4>How do you envision the future of Riyadh city?</h4><p>The core elements that make up the aspirations and 21st century vision for Riyadh are that it is a contemporary oasis in harmony with its desert environment and a city of prosperity by nature of its competitive advantages and through attracting domestic and foreign investment. The vision is also for Riyadh to be a global centre of innovation in scientific research and development and a leader in energy, desert environment technologies, health sciences, and education. A driving principle of Riyadh's vision is to “achieve sustainability in the future planning of the city within Islamic principles,“ which include the obligation of citizens to help create a city not just for its current citizens also for its future generations. The Metropolitan Development Strategy for Arriyadh (MEDSTAR) provides the necessary strategic framework for this to happen. Riyadh's bold aspirations align with Saudi Vision 2030 for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its capital Riyadh to be “the heart of the Arab and Islamic worlds, an investment powerhouse, and a hub connecting three continents“—a vision built upon themes of a vibrant society, a thriving economy, and an ambitious nation. The High Commission for the Development of Arriyadh drives the development of the city with a clear vision and sound and practical strategies, programs, and projects. In 2018, MEDSTAR II will update the city's strategic plan to adapt to economic, social, and environmental changes occurring all around us, locally and globally, and to provide a creative new vision for the city over the next 30 years. With major land and urban transportation projects, we also envision Riyadh and the wider region becoming a centre of excellence in many economic sectors such as tourism, entertainment, ITC, financial services, health and education, and renewable energy technologies. Stimulated by Vision 2030 and with the benefit of comprehensive urban development strategies and a clear vision for the growth of the capital, Riyadh and Riyadh Region are set to continue to grow and diversify as a prosperous, world-class metropolis with a leading role in the Middle East.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[hamad-buamim-president-ceo-of-dubai-chamber-commerce-industry]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Dubai Chamber further built and strengthened its international presence in the past year?</h4><p>As part of our strategy of exploring promising markets around the world and providing our members with access to new growth opportunities abroad, Dubai Chamber has scaled up its international presence by opening representative offices in various emerging markets across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Commonwealth of Independent States. Over the last year, we opened new representative offices in Brazil, Panama, India, and Argentina which have complemented our global network and greatly support our efforts to strengthen our relationships with key stakeholders in these markets. In addition, the Chamber organizes several high-level events and trade missions throughout the year which support its strategy of promoting Dubai as a preferred investment destination. Many of these events are hosted as part of the Chamber's successful Global Business Forum series which focuses on strengthening Dubai's economic cooperation with emerging markets. All of these efforts support the objectives of Dubai Plan 2021, as well as Dubai's economic diversification plans.</p><h4>What are key sectors in which UAE businesses can provide their expertise abroad? </h4><p>UAE companies have vast expertise and capabilities in logistics, aviation, tourism, retail and hospitality, in addition to a strong appetite for investment and expanding their global footprint. In fact, many of the UAE's leading companies have already established their presence in key markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and we expect this trend to gain momentum as more businesses look abroad for new growth opportunities. At the same time, the UAE's business community has been quick to adapt to new trends and develop capabilities in emerging sectors and fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, 3D printing, and smart city solutions in line with the objectives of the Dubai Plan 2021.</p><h4>How does Dubai Chamber encourage cooperation between the public and private sectors to enhance competitiveness and ease barriers to trade?  </h4><p>As a bridge between business and government, Dubai Chamber plays a key role in facilitating fruitful cooperation and partnerships between Dubai's public and private sectors. Such efforts have helped accelerate Dubai's economic growth and development over the years and position the emirate as a leading example of what great things can be accomplished if various segments of society align their efforts and work together towards a common vision.</p><h4>Dubai Chamber recently announced some initiatives to support Dubai's new economic stimulus plans. What do these initiatives entail and how will they further strengthen Dubai's position as a global business hub? </h4><p>Under the new initiatives, the Chamber is coordinating with other government entities to review services and fees with the aim of reducing the cost of doing business in the emirate, while it is also working with a newly formed advisory board to boost the contribution of global companies in shaping the regulatory landscape. The council, represented by selected multinational corporations and Fortune 500 companies, represents business interests, strengthens investor confidence, and plays a key role in developing the local economy. I am confident that these unique initiatives will support the growth of Dubai's economy, address challenges facing businesses in the emirate and significantly boost investor confidence in the market. At the same time, they will help elevate the emirate's status as a global business hub and greatly support Dubai Chamber's mission of protecting the interests of business community in Dubai.</p><h4>Dubai is acting at the forefront of implementing smart and disruptive technologies. How do you assess the potential for Dubai to become a leading global Fintech hub? </h4><p>Dubai is well on its way to becoming one of the world's smartest cities, and it is investing a great deal in new technologies and innovative solutions. The adoption of blockchain technology across government entities is a key focus of the Dubai Smart City vision and it signals a shift away from traditional administration and towards the digitalization of services. Public and private sector players have been quick to adopt measures to support the growth of the fintech sector in Dubai and the region's first fintech accelerator was launched in the emirate, which will provide an opportunity for firms operating in this space to set up and conduct business in the emirate. Dubai is eyeing USD1 billion in FinTech investments through to 2022, however, this still only represents a fraction of the USD150 billion worth of investments the global industry is expected to achieve in the next three to five years, so there is clearly more room for growth in this market.</p><h4>What are your expectations around the impact of Expo 2020, and its long-term effects on Dubai? </h4><p>Expo 2020 will be a game changer for Dubai as it is serving as a catalyst for economic growth and transforming the city in many ways. More than USD9 billion worth of major infrastructure projects earmarked for the event and we have already seen major developments come to fruition over the last year. Looking ahead, the emirate's tourism, hospitality, logistics, aviation and retail sectors are expected to benefit the most from the high number of visitors who will attend the mega event. As the first World Expo to be hosted in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia, Expo 2020 Dubai will serve as an ideal platform to facilitate global cooperation on important matters and showcase Dubai's potential as global innovation and knowledge hub connecting minds to create a brighter future. The event will provide an ideal opportunity for local and foreign companies to showcase their solutions, boost their global profile and showcase their capabilities and solutions to 25 million international visitors who will attend the six-month mega event.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Construction: 7% of GDP]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[rita-moura-president-plataforma-tecnologica-portuguesa-da-construcao-cluster-aec-head-rd-teixeira-duarte-engenharia-construcoes]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the ways PTPC &amp; Cluster AEC maximizes innovation and boosts the overall competitiveness of Portugal's construction industry?</h4><p>In Portugal, people have excellent ICT skills and they must be brought into the construction sphere. PTPC is in talks with other partners in the ICT field to add value to construction. We not only think about the physical part of construction, but also the information one can gain that is connected with infrastructure. We intent to are work with companies in ICT and communications systems and entering into the field of smart structures. It's possible to place sensors to monitor and measure functions and generate information. AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) are extremely relevant in this context. Build environment can collect a great amount of information, and such value addition is crucial to the construction industry. We are doing everything we can to extract the appropriate profit and contribute to society through the use of technology.</p><h4>How do you work to ensure the best possible synergies between associations, technical institutes, and private players in the construction and infrastructure sector?</h4><p>We have all of them in our association. PTPC's starting point was major construction companies, though we also rapidly bring in designers, consultants, universities, start-ups, SMEs, and various associations. We look beyond the construction industry and create relationships with companies from other sectors such as ICT companies and their cluster in Portugal. We work with many players also outside the construction sector and many associations and public entities.</p><h4>How do you boost sustainability in the construction industry to minimize the impact on the environment?</h4><p>Sustainability is a crucial issue for the construction sector. Our industry is the number-one consumer of natural resources from the outset of any building project, and we are directly or indirectly responsible for around 40% of CO2 emissions because building work and buildings produce a significant amount of CO2. If we do not build in the right way, we will produce even more. We also promote the development of excellent recycling practices because of all the waste created by construction work. Sustainability is not something new for the construction industry; it is part of our DNA. If we want to be competitive, it is essential to make excellent use of natural resources, recycle, minimize waste, and use less energy in construction. We have to be sustainable; this is the number-one issue for the construction industry.</p><h4>What does the construction sector represent for the national economy in terms of contribution to GDP and employment generation?</h4><p>It represents about 7% for both GDP and employment; it is extremely important. Although there has been a slowdown in the construction sector in Portugal in the last few years, companies in this sector also work abroad. We have a great deal of internationalization so we can maintain the level of performance of those companies. Now, it appears we are encouraged by the investments we will see in the country in the coming years. Real estate is always an activity promoted by the private sector and private investment, though the construction industry can also develop a great deal of the infrastructure that is needed to support such activities. For example, we will need a new airport to support our tourism industry in the coming years. Furthermore, this is not the only project planned. We need a great deal more of infrastructure, not only to support the tourism sector, but also all economic activities. Many transport mobility issues need to be developed in Portugal; plenty of work must be done in that area as well.</p><h4>What are the objectives behind PTPC proposed think tank?</h4><p>We are in the process of developing the idea and are producing a proposal to discuss with the government. Infrastructure development is vital for the country and should be prioritized up to 2030, in some cases beyond that date. We are involving many experts from PTPC &amp; Cluster AEC and the proposal is becoming interesting, including information for potential investors about the value and feasibility of possible projects. We have received a great deal of contributions also from the tourism sector and other sectors, and companies working with us. We will have a summary of our report ready in 2Q2018.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the performance of Portugal's economy in 2018-2019?</h4><p>In regard to long-term investments, the infrastructure sector is promising. We have infrastructure needs that perhaps that could be interesting projects for long-term private investment in Portugal. We have a great deal of activity in the real estate sector and prices are booming, mainly in Lisbon and Porto. However, there is also significant potential in tourism in other parts of the country, and we must expand the investment in real estate beyond Lisbon and Porto. The government rightly wants to increase investment in industry in general and such investments are essential because we do not want to have an economy based solely on tourism, but rather a sustainable country that also has industry. Portugal is ready to receive more investment in industry now because we have an excellent transportation network and digital connectivity. Therefore, we should work to attract investments in industry to the country to create a great balance and diversity throughout our economy. The country is prepared for this.</p><h4>What are some of your top priorities for PTPC in the coming years to continue to support the construction industry's development?</h4><p>We need to work more with architects because PTPC as managing entity of Cluster AEC leads with  architecture, engineering, and construction. We do not have as many architectural companies in PTPC compared to the other disciplines, and we have to work more with them because we have excellent Portuguese architects. Another focus is being up to date in digital technology and having a digital attitude. We need flexible companies that can respond to their clients' needs. This means we have to work with start-ups in a different way to help our companies during this digital transformation. This disruption is both a challenge and an opportunity for our industry and we have to open it up. We are focused on Industry 4.0 and on the circular economy and have to apply all our expertise to this. Universities are working closely with PTPC, which we are also pleased with. We have all the conditions to succeed, including a great country with excellent potential, and are extremely ambitious with our plans.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Upstream energy reform success]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ivan-sandrea-director-general-ceo-sierra-oil-gas]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the implementation of the 2014 energy reforms?</h4><p>For upstream, it is going well, which was expected and the results speak for themselves. There are over 60 companies, close to 100 licenses have been signed, many wells have been committed, and there is several billion dollars of immediate activity by the private sector. In midstream, there have been certain issues. There has been progress in terms of opening the market and many companies have been opening new petrol stations, though access to infrastructure and permitting, particularly with ports, has progressed slower than expected. Still, the intentions are good and everyone is working hard to solve the bottlenecks. From the start, Sierra believed in the reforms and in the capacity of Mexican regulators to carry them out; therefore, we had first-mover advantage there. We have done more than just participate and won bids; we have made discoveries and have actively been investing in the last three and a half years. The government has the right incentives in place, and with contracts and interests aligned, the opportunities are good, and the reforms can truly be successful.</p><h4>How would you assess the investment climate in Mexico, particularly in relation to other countries competing for capital?</h4><p>When the reforms started, the macro oil and gas system was collapsing, companies were cutting capital expenditures, and many in traditional oil and gas regions such as the Middle East, Russia, Africa, and Brazil were facing trouble. And at the end of the day, Mexico has to compete with everyone. Mexico is a top-tier destination—in terms of risk and reward, it ranks in the top quartile. I have worked in many places around the world, and Mexico competes extremely well—it is modern and has many strong institutions, bilateral agreements, and large, close markets. In terms of Latin America, it is the most exciting place to operate, and from an exploration perspective, the most exciting place in the world.</p><h4>What challenges are you facing in the sector?</h4><p>For entrepreneurial and growing companies, challenges are opportunities. One can find solutions after analyzing the challenges; however, if we cannot find a solution after many attempts, then the challenge becomes a problem. Through that perspective, we have few problems, if any. In the midstream sector, it has been a slower environment compared to upstream to execute projects, especially where we are participating; however, that comes naturally as part of specific land and ports, which is true anywhere in the world. Midstream has been a challenge because we have wanted to achieve more and we intend to do more. However, overall, for my people, my staff, and myself, every time we perceive a challenge, we start early, we work through the issues, and we solve it.</p><h4>What is the significance of your discoveries in Zama-1 for Sierra Oil &amp; Gas and the overall sector?</h4><p>Chiefly, it was the first exploration well and the first discovery after the energy reform. From that headline point of view, it is material. Second, the size and quality of the discovery was bigger and better than expected, and we are now working with a great challenge. Third, it is the largest offshore discovery in the Tertiary reservoirs, which is exactly what the government wanted when opening up the market to private risk and investors. Pemex has done a great job in developing carbonate-level exploration in the Campeche zone, where there are billions of barrels still to be produced. However, the Tertiary reservoirs, which are on the subsalt level and require complex structures and higher risk, is where private investors will put their money, technologies, and capabilities. The Zama discovery has had a huge impact on investment, which was evident in the last round of bidding when many competitors bid on the areas surrounding our zone. It confirms to the entire industry—not just Mexico—that the newly opened zones are attractive. Finally, for us and our partners, it will allow us to make a quantum leap in terms of reserves, production, and hopefully cash flow.</p><h4>What is the long-term strategy for growing your portfolio?</h4><p>First, we want to test the portfolio we have and continue to meet the minimum work obligations set by the government. We have a few wells coming up as well as the appraisal of Zama, since we have completed the obligations. Our strategy is as any other company: we just do it faster and with lower cost. Our intention is to complete the minimum work obligations and if they are successful, there is then appraisal and steps to move forward.</p><h4>How do midstream investments play into your strategy?</h4><p>I am very excited about our midstream investments. We have an outstanding team and some brilliant ideas, which we are drawing on in, for example, the storage and transportation infrastructure that we are working on in Tuxpan Port. It is an import facility with four docking stations. It has connectivity to the local pipelines, trucking, and shipping to other ports in Mexico. It has the potential to be the largest facility built in Mexico in the last few decades. Looking to the future, we have interested shippers lined up and we are prepared, as we have been working on it for almost three years.</p><h4>Do you see an IPO in the future for Sierra?</h4><p>We are not in a rush as we have three strong investors. We will develop the business and will decide if and when it is ready to be put into another capital structure. However, we are currently content, as our investors want us to continue to operate as we have been and we have a great deal of capital, a small portion of which has been invested.</p><h4>What are your short-term goals for 2018?</h4><p>We want to move forward on the appraisal of Zama, get ready to drill blocks 5, 4, and 2, and make the final investment decision on the Caoba project in Tuxpan.</p><h4>What is your general outlook regarding Mexico's hydrocarbon sector?</h4><p>It looks extremely promising. Three years ago, we were one of the only fish in the sea as the first license holder. Today, there are many companies bidding on new zones, and the entire Sureste Basin has been taken. The sector has to speed up and begin drilling more, proof testing, and developing. We are all looking forward to regulatory continuity. The regulators have done outstanding work thus far in the face of great pressure, both positive and negative. However, they have managed to pull off an amazing feat. We believe in Mexican institutions and outlook for progress. There is always uncertainty when there is presidential change; however, we maintain a positive outlook on the sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[bernardo-correia-country-manager-google]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about the evolution of Google's presence in Portugal, and what does the European market represent for your company?</h4><p>Google has been present in Portugal for almost 15 years. Google's presence over the years has traditionally reflected the size of the Portuguese economy and the available opportunities. We are proud of expanding significantly in the recent past. Two important milestones in Google's journey in Portugal was the acquisition of Digisfer, a Portuguese startup incorporated through Google Street View, in 2015 and the launch of Atelier Digital, Google's digital skills training program that has now trained over 35,000 people living in Portugal. The company's next milestone for summer 2018, an international service center in Oeiras was announced by the Portuguese Prime Minister. Google looks at Portugal not just through the lens of the domestic market; but primarily as an international hub for talent and a service distribution center for Europe, Middle East, and Africa. Some of our best brains in the hot field of artificial intelligence (AI) originate from Portugal. Moreover, there is huge potential for international business expansion to be based out of Portugal.</p><h4>What are some of your top priorities regarding business development alongside Portuguese companies, agencies, advertisers, and your strategic development plans? </h4><p>I arrived in Portugal a little less than two years ago after spending 11 years in the UK, and I was impressed by how much the Portuguese economy had pivoted toward exports and internationalization. The country had been going through a terrible crisis but Portuguese people proved themselves as incredible entrepreneurs. One of the pillars of Google's plan in Portugal it has been to help the Portuguese tourist industry accelerate and compete internationally in attracting international tourists. Tourism is an incredibly successful story here in Portugal and we are extremely proud of having been part of that journey, working alongside the leading hotel chains, and the Portuguese Tourism Board; one of the most innovative in the world in terms of how they lure in tourists. In the other hand, Portugal now boasts fantastic businesses generating an ecosystem of Portuguese startups, and for the first time in generations, a new batch of Portuguese international brands, for example, Indiecampers, Uniplaces, and Prozis. It is incredible the size of international business opportunities for companies here.  Part of our business plan is to help incubate and support the opportunities for international businesses in Portugal. We do that through several training programs and partnerships with startup incubators such as Startup Lisbon and in collaboration with the Portuguese government. We want to support the entrepreneurship environment in Portugal because it is an incredible growth driver for us. Another great opportunity lies in the digital transformation of traditional Portuguese businesses; it is vital for Portuguese companies to increase the speed of their digital transformation. Our launch of the Google Cloud team in Portugal aims to facilitate the booming industry of Cloud computing and AI. The advertising business in Portugal is largely manual; hence, we launched Double Click, an important component of the advertising industry's digital transformation. Retail is at the heart of digital transformation in any market, but the Portuguese e-commerce market is not mature enough; Portugal conducts less than 3% of transactions online in comparison to around 20% in the UK. Therefore, we are focused on helping Portuguese retailers, especially those with an international footprint to better compete in the e-commerce market. A huge opportunity lies here and Portuguese retailers should get ahead before other competitors penetrates the market. Portugal conducts 81% of e-commerce transactions through foreign websites, proving that there are rampant supply issues. Google helps local businesses modernize their infrastructure and create great user experiences on their websites by using the latest mobile technologies such as progressive web apps.</p><h4>To what extent do you believe that the presence of Google here can help accelerate the sector's development given its IT training expertise?</h4><p>Early on, it was easy to identify digital skills as a problem due to lack of professionals in the ecosystem. However, at present, there are various solutions such as Atelier Digital and GEN10S program, where Google has joined hands with the Ministry of Education to train 5,000 kids in programming languages every year. Of our generation of internet companies, Google is proud to invest the most in Portugal for over 15 years.</p><h4>What impact do you think Industry 4.0 will have in terms of transforming innovation and education in Portugal?</h4><p>The message regarding the digital transformation of the Portuguese economy is that for the first time, Portugal is not at a disadvantage. High transportation costs and being on the fringes of Europe has played a negative role for Portugal for many years, but thanks to the digital space that is no longer the reality; a service can be sold globally with the help of companies such as Google. For the first time ever, if you digitize your business in Portugal, you can reach a potential market of 2 billion people instead of a domestic market of 2 million.</p><h4>How do you expect the ICT sector to perform now that the Portuguese economic recovery is consolidating?</h4><p>For a country like Portugal, because of the scale of the domestic market and the nature of opportunities in digital transformation, it is incredibly important to make well-informed decisions.  Investors and Portuguese startups are aware of present structural problems and the need to bring greater liquidity into the tech sector. However, these problems are being addressed by private investors and the government; therefore we expect the ICT sector to experience explosive growth over the next few years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give us some background into the Wind Renewable Energy Resources Area Project (YEKA)?</h4><p>YEKA is the new investment model being employed in the Turkish wind energy sector. Currently, there are two main models of financing wind projects: one for small-scale and one for mid-sized ones. For the former, an investor needs to apply to a distribution company for a project of up to 1MW, seeking permissions from the distribution company and the construction company. For mid-sized projects of up to 100MW or more, investors have to measure the land for a year and apply to Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA). The Ministry of Energy currently supports renewable energy projects using local equipment. In line with this, it established a third model for large-sized projects in which one applies directly to the Ministry of Energy and the General Directorate of Renewable Energy. The first wind YEKA projects are being developed for five regions across the country, with the Ministry of Energy defining a 1,700MW wind capacity overall. For this type of project, applications should be submitted to the General Directorate of Renewable Energy, and the ministry will then allocate projects according to priority. The requirements for these projects are to be developed using 65% equipment manufactured in Turkey and for companies to open R&amp;D centers of engineers, at least 80% of who must be Turkish nationals. The wind turbine factory must be completed and operational within 21 months. At the end of the day, investors in YEKA should be able to produce a 1,000MW project.</p><h4>How has the YEKA project been progressing in recent months?</h4><p>Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, Kalyon Construction, and Türkerler Energy have formed a tripartite consortium for the YEKA project. Siemens is working hard on the turbine factory, while Türkerler is working on the project development side. Like other consortium companies, these companies applied to the General Directorate of Renewable Energy for this project and evaluated it to ensure they were able to produce 1,000MW according to the priorities laid out by the ministry. Currently, the companies are doing research on the most appropriate region where the factory will be built, and it is expected that Izmir will be chosen.</p><h4>What is the Turkish Wind Energy Association's involvement in such projects? How do you work with the government and private sector to attract the right investment?</h4><p>Given that our main aim is to promote renewable energy and especially wind in Turkey, we are extremely active in the sector in both the government and private sector side. We are working to bridge the government and the private sector, enabling discussion of problems and brainstorming solutions together. We organize workshops, congresses, and technical site visits, as well as organize delegation participation from the government to various conferences. We have estimated that our wind potential is 38GW onshore and 10GW offshore, according to the General Directorate's 2006 measurements. However, these calculations and the technology used are already outdated. If we account for the current advancements in wind energy, our potential is more along the lines of 70GW for both onshore and offshore combined. This means that in the coming years, the wind energy sector will rapidly develop. In 2017 there was a significant milestone achieved in Turkey, in regards to YEKA. In total, 4,000MW of capacity allocated to projects were awarded in 2017, amounting to USD5 billion invested in wind energy projects. However, making these projects in reality will take time. The project owners are currently working hard on securing their pre-licenses. After those are acquired, they will begin receiving construction licenses, which will take two to three years. These projects will be realized completely by 2020.</p><h4>What are the main obstacles to investing the wind energy, and renewables more generally in Turkey?</h4><p>In 2005, Turkey's installed wind capacity was only 20MW. After the enactment of the Renewable Energy Law in 2005 the wind energy sector began to grow rapidly. A second set of regulations came after to develop sector and investment started to increase. Turkey also had economic conditions internationally that affected the sector. However, in the past seven years, the sector has been growing by approximately 25-30% a year. In 2016, Turkey broke the 1GW barrier for the first time, installing 1,387MW of new wind energy. In 2017 by adding 766MW into the system, Turkey was ranked fourth in the European market and eighth worldwide in annual wind capacity.</p><h4>What are the main factors that differentiate the local energy market from its neighbors, and what opportunities are there for international collaboration?</h4><p>Looking at the Turkish experience in wind energy, our companies tackle increasingly challenging opportunities. The MENA region has considerable potential in renewable energy and many opportunities to be found. We also see a great deal of potential in Turkic countries and partner closely with those countries. Turkish companies are also looking at South Africa as a potential market. Turkish construction companies have already been extremely active all over the world. In fact, they are second only to China in terms international activity and the number of foreign partners. Therefore, Turkish companies already have a great deal of experience abroad, and that trickles down to some companies in the renewable energy sector.</p><h4>Will the YEKA initiative have a lasting impact on the energy sector at large?</h4><p>YEKA is an excellent project to develop the wind industry. However, through mid-sized wind projects and legislative improvements Turkey has already begun to develop its wind industry so the sector has to operate not only according to YEKA, but also EMRA. YEKA projects are all large-sized projects, and we need to make sure investors are encouraged to invest in medium and small projects as well. If we can keep both investment models in parallel, the energy market will be significantly improved in Turkey. That would make a more sustainable market. One way that the industry aims to do this is by supporting local companies in their medium-scale ventures, as opposed to focusing solely on international ones.</p><h4>What are your priorities for the year 2018?</h4><p>Our priorities for 2018 are to develop more projects in Turkey. On the wind side, we have more than 70GW of potential here. On the other hand, we have excellent potential in solar, perhaps the same or more than in wind. As well, we have hydropower potential, with three sides of Turkey bordered by the sea and many rivers. There is also excellent potential in geothermal and biofuel. When we look at both together, renewable energy presents great opportunities</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Focused on mature, onshore fields]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[javier-zambrano-ceo-jaguar-exploracion-produccion]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the reasons behind the company's recent success in the second round of public auctions conducted by the National Hydrocarbon Commission (CNH)?</h4><p>Jaguar E&amp;P, since our incorporation, has had a clear vision: to become one of the leading companies in exploration and production (E&amp;P) in Mexico. We are focused on mature, onshore fields. There is a huge opportunity due to Mexico's circumstances, particularly related to Pemex's financial constraints, which have left many fields under-developed. Jaguar was awarded several fields in the Burgos Basin and in Veracruz State and three fields in Tabasco. We have opened regional offices in these areas to operate the businesses with the support of local service companies.</p><h4>Why did Jaguar Exploración y Producción decide to focus on mature, onshore fields?</h4><p>From the outset, we were sure we wanted to become operators. This immediately ruled out the more expensive shallow and deepwater projects; targeting onshore mature fields made sense because there is less capital and less uncertainty involved. These (mature) fields, typically have existing seismic, well logs, and geological information which allow companies to make better estimates of resources and production curves. Second, the investments required are less capital intensive. Starting with fields with more information and easier access was the obvious route for us to become operators.</p><h4>Is Jaguar Exploración y Producción looking to diversify its investors during this growth phase?</h4><p>We are open to new investors. Currently we are grading the assets, proving some reserves, and ramping up production as quickly as we can. We want to get some cash flow from our operations and also prove to the market that our team is capable of running the operations efficiently. Our recently announced deal with Vista Oil and Gas brings many complementary advantages. Vista's management has a solid track record operating complex fields efficiently. Such capabilities significantly complement´s Jaguar´s subsurface competencies, enhancing the potential for the development of the assets. We are thrilled start working side by side Vista after CNH approves the transaction.</p><h4>Why did Jaguar Exploración y Producción decide to enter an agreement with Sun God Energí­a de México, and why has this partnership been so successful?</h4><p>We have a great relationship with Sun God. We faced the same issue wherein the royalties other companies were bidding in Round 1.3 for were too high. Our teams met up to discuss the opportunities in Mexico, Canada, the US, and Colombia; we have a great fit technically and on a personal level. When Round 2.2 came about, Sun God was willing to step into Mexico strategically and decided we were the right partner. We have the know-how of doing business in Mexico while Sun God has solid technical expertise. We hope to develop a bigger partnership going forward. Sun God has excellent Canadian operators and extensive knowledge on heavy oil, as well as secondary recovery through steam injection. These are skills we can use in other fields in future rounds, and we look forward to developing the partnership further.</p><h4>What lessons have you learned from the auctions so far, and how will you adjust your strategy for future public bids?</h4><p>We now have a solid and diversified platform. We have achieved diversification in three senses, the first of which is regional. Secondly, we have both oil and gas within our portfolio, and lastly, we have diversification in terms of the maturity of the fields. Some of our fields are already producing while others are in the exploration phase. All these mean we are in an extremely comfortable position that we can grow from. One of the main lessons learned was that the information from the data pack and the CNH has significant gaps. The more a company can learn about the geology of a field and how to operate on it, the better evaluation and bids it can do. The best lesson we have learned is that information is key to this business. In the following rounds we will have a more concise approach to what we like and how to assess the potential of each field.</p><h4>What are the pillars of your innovation strategy?</h4><p>Most of the fields we were awarded have never been developed with the proper use of technology. For example, the seismic data for some of the blocks is fairly old, and we can use new technology to upgrade and reprocess this, which will lower the exploration risk. There are also new completion techniques we can use in these fields to optimize flow and production. We can use lateral drilling to control the water in some of the reservoirs we have. There is a great deal we can do with these old fields, even with the basic technology that is out there.</p><h4>Should Mexico invest in constructing new oil refineries and upgrading the existing ones or are there other priorities at the moment?</h4><p>Refineries could be strategic part of Mexico's economy and a country needs some control over refined products. However, the best economic solution is probably not new state-built and run refineries. There must be an economic equation that allows private investors to re-build and efficiently operate refineries. Another option is the idea of buying refineries (or refining capacity) in the US where there is access to better infrastructure. It is always a balancing act for countries between supply, cost, and energy security issues. It is the same issue with gas. Currently, Mexico imports around 80% of gas consumed nationally, which is not necessarily ideal for a country.</p><h4>What are your short-term goals for 2018?</h4><p>We want to ramp up production. This is important not just because of the cash flow it will generate, but also to prove to the industry that we can get results and that we have a solid team behind us. This is important for our investors because in a few years we will likely continue to look for capital and strategic partners. A second major focus is to comply with all the regulations and have zero incidents in environmental, safety, or security terms. We are currently implementing several systems that will allow us to manage production better and comply more efficiently and automatically so we can focus our resources on what matters. We have to submit 11 exploration plans and seven development plans, which are fairly complex and comprehensive. Hopefully, we will finish proving up our reserves in early 2019, though most of that work is taking place now.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[francisco-ramirez-country-manager-mexico-central-america-caribbean-axis-communications]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is the Mexican market for Axis' global sales strategy? </h4><p>For Axis, the Americas account for more than half of yearly revenue. Based on that you can understand that Mexico as an emerging market is important for the company. In 2017, we had the honor to be named one of the most important emerging market countries for the organization, and it has been aggressively growing in the last years, so we have great expectations for the coming years. Our growth has been between 10-20% a year over the last five years based on our three strategic pillars: global leadership, long-term relationships, and innovation. We talk about creating innovative solutions for the industry; not only for small businesses but for medium and large enterprises as well.</p><h4>What is the profile of your clients in Mexico?</h4><p>There is no specific profile because we are in a very basic needs market, in the sense that everyone needs security. We have several verticals in which we are growing, and one of them is retail, a main market in Mexico and the region. We have critical infrastructure and in that sector, you can find all the power and electricity companies, gas stations, train stations, and transportation hubs, not to mention all government institutions—including smart cities. All these require surveillance. Another sector that is growing is the industrial sector. Video has evolved from deterrents to prevention since the Twin Tower attacks. This is why you have analytics and different security tools that you can take advantage of. You do not need thousands of people watching TV monitors to see if there is something going on. We have access to solutions that include audio, analytics, software, storage, and many different components for creative and efficient solutions based on customers' needs.</p><h4>To what extent is video surveillance and Axis helping to fight crime in Mexico?</h4><p>Deterrents continue to be needed to some extent. However the adoption of Internet Protocol (IP)  technology gets higher all the time, and deterrents are not a factor to avoiding crimes. Nowadays, you have a lot of crime recorded not only on cameras but also cell phones, none of which is stopping crime. However, some tools such as analytics can help prevent crime, such as loitering analytics. If you see someone passing several times you can assume they are trying to understand what is going on. This is actionable intel. Or if a particular car's license plate can be read passing a house many times, then you also know something is wrong. Or facial recognition. Eventually innovation creates a barrier for many criminals, while a mix of technology and human resources can prevent crime in public areas.</p><h4>What is your priority in terms of innovation, and what new products are you bringing to the market?</h4><p>There are several industry trends, one of which that is several years old is the adoption of  IP technology. Mexico is one of the most developed countries in terms of IP solutions, and around 70% of new systems are IP-based. The other area is multi-megapixel cameras, which compiles more information in very small pieces. Another trend is intelligent codecs, which helps you transport more information in a very small bandwidth. Analytics, of course, are also important in reducing costs.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2018?</h4><p>To continue developing our value-added services for our partners since we have an indirect sales model. We have to create more value for our partners and end-users as well. We are also looking to strengthen our ecosystem. As for social responsibility, we as a company are very committed to our community. We donate products, help certain associations, and participate in many others through industry platform development. We are part of Alas, ASIS, and part of the intelligent building association, and many others that are trying to create value for and professionalize the industry.</p><h4>How do you work to promote best practices in the case of data privacy?</h4><p>As soon as you step in there is a sign that says you are under video surveillance because we have 95 cameras here. There is the general data protection regulation, which we take very seriously. With the GDPR, all our employees, including sales guys, go out to the market and share information with our partners and end users. We are also part of the ten principles of the UN Global Compact and business ethics initiatives, which have helped sustain the company for many years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Tourism: 12.5% of GDP]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[luis-araujo-president-turismo-de-portugal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is tourism as a strategic activity for the Portuguese economy in supporting GDP growth, service exports, and direct and indirect job creation?</h4><p>Tourism has been making a contribution to the economy in several ways. Today, it represents 12.5% of the total GDP, more than 50% of service exports, and almost 20% of goods and service exports, and it has been growing steadily for the last three years. In 2017, we registered growth of 9% in terms of tourism arrivals, breaking the mark of 20 million tourists, and a 19.5% increase in revenue, following a rate of 15% in 2016. Tourism is certainly expanding, and we see that expansion especially during low season and to more undiscovered regions such as Algarve, Lisbon, and Madeira. The highest growth rates were recorded in the regions of Alentejo, the central zone of Portugal, and the Azores. We know that the future is challenging; however, the sector looks extremely promising at the moment. Many Portuguese companies are investing in tourism and diversifying their activities; in addition, many external agents see Portugal as a country with an attractive tourism sector for investments.</p><h4>What are some of the most important institutional capacity-building mechanisms that you take locally to promote the dynamism of Portugal's tourism industry?</h4><p>Turismo de Portugal is the leading organization in the tourist sector in our country. We follow specific values within our organization and employ about 600 people. We support the Portuguese tourism private sector with, for example, specific funding projects, training with a country network of 12 educational institutions, from which around 3,000 students graduate every year. The unemployment rate in Portugal is currently lower than 8%, and tourism created 55,000 jobs in 2017 alone, so there are now 350,000 workers in this sector. We also have a department that advises investors in Portugal and takes care of all tourism-related statistics. Additionally, we focus on developing tourism products so that they can be even more attractive. We work closely with all regions, city councils, and trade associations to help them develop their products either by investing in specific marketing actions or by working directly with them to attract tour operators, travel agents, or newspapers.</p><h4>How do you allocate your budget to prioritize areas that bring the most benefit and do you work closely with regional tourism promotional entities?</h4><p>We are one of the main players funding tourism promotion and we work with them especially in three areas. The first one has to do with accessibility, so tour operators, travel agents, and airlines can get to know our infrastructure. The second has to do with international marketing with actions such as familiarization and press trips. For example, in 2017 we had around 33,000 international news articles on Portugal. The third part has to do with structuring the product, which is a basic part of a destination-selling strategy. Our focus is to develop joint strategies of branding through international fairs, workshops, and roadshows in the 21 tourism outbound markets where Turismo de Portugal has a representation. Our 21 offices are our “armed forces“ abroad. They lead the internationalization of the Portuguese tourism sector and are responsible for our international operations.</p><h4>What have been some of the crucial differentiating factors behind Portugal's record tourism arrival numbers in 2017 and 2018?</h4><p>There is a set of factors, and the first has to do with connectivity. The investment that has been made in terms of attracting airlines and tour operators and promoting the country as a whole is delivering results. The second has to do with the positioning of Portugal with well-informed actions. In this regard, the attraction of large events has been extremely effective. For example, we will host the Eurovision Song Contest in Lisbon with 40,000 people and the third annual edition of Web Summit, with 70,000 visitors. We will also have 60,000 people from all over the world gathering in Lisbon for the Aga Khan Foundation as it is moving its office to Portugal. In 2017, we have supported around 66 conferences and congresses focused on diverse fields. Portugal is already on the top 10 International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) event organizers in the world, and Lisbon is 12th. All this has given the country huge visibility and has helped attract visitors from many countries. The US is our biggest growth market. We have also seen a 40% increase in visitors from China and Brazil. Our strategy is also based on diversifying markets without forgetting that our biggest source markets, such as the UK, lie in Europe.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the new strategy to increase sustainability and your priorities, especially regarding the housing market?</h4><p>The government launched a new strategy for the coming 10 years and started by gathering information from both national and international stakeholders. The most recurring topics were sustainability and people, which were at the end the foundation for our strategy. We want to grow and have room to grow. The goal is to reach EUR26 billion in revenue and EUR80 million overnight stays in 2027 in a sustainable way by diversifying the regions and travel periods. That also means sustainability in terms of society and environment. There are government bodies at different levels working to find the right balance of citizens, tourism workers, and tourists, and currently 90% of the companies that work in tourism have efficient measures regarding waste management, efficiency, and water. There is increased interest and better connectivity. That is why it is easier for someone from the US, for instance, to come to Lisbon. That leads to both national and foreign investors to consider Portugal. However, fiscal and incentive measures are being taken to tackle negative impacts on locals. It is a matter of working together, understanding the problems, and preventing problems in the long term rather than in the short term.</p><h4>What would be your final personal message to encourage people to come and discover Portugal?</h4><p>You cannot skip Portugal. We do not only say this because of the landscapes, gastronomy, and beautiful heritage buildings and number of UNESCO sites in our country. Visiting Portugal is a 360-degree full experience. There are things that set us apart from other countries. We are the third-safest country in the world and have the second-largest and best road system in Europe; furthermore, 60% of our population speaks a second language. People who come either as a visitor, investor, or student fall in love with the country, especially with the people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Baytak Dala was set up in 2009, which was a difficult time for the global markets. What opportunities did the company's founders see in the retail construction sector at that time?</h4><p>Baytak Dala's founders were working on construction projects in Aristan EPC in 2009. For various reasons they decided to leave Aristan and open their own company in the same field of construction and fitting out retail stores and malls. The initial years were difficult because of the global economic crisis and the fact that we only had a few malls. Mega Mall was a pioneer in Kazakhstan. Our founders realized this is the future for retail and the sector would continue to grow for another 10 or 20 years. They therefore decided to grow in this direction given they already had experience in terms of the specifications, requirements, and rules in the construction field.</p><h4>How has the business evolved and expanded its line of work?</h4><p>We focused on stores because we did not want to work in every area of construction. By specializing in this niche area, we have been able to build up our experience, qualifications, and reputation with an emphasis on quality. By providing a quality service, we satisfy our clients and that ensures they will continue to work with us and, more importantly, recommend us to new clients. This is how we have built up our client base over time and captured bigger clients as the market changes. Baytak Dala has completed around 250 projects across 16 cities in Kazakhstan. To begin with, we only worked on two stores when we started construction work in 2010. We started working with the Almeo Group on two stores in the Mega Mall for the Cortefiel and Springfield brands. Our founders were working in Kazakhstan so they knew the Mega administration and the client who decided to work with us. They gave us two stores to start with on the understanding that if we did the work well, they would continue their relationship with us and give us other shops to fit out. Mega Mall saw that our work was of a high standard and recommended us to new stores. Our relationship with Mega is excellent in terms of our construction, engineering, and our work with clients, and it continues to recommend our work. Baytak Dala is not a low-price company; our work is expensive because providing quality requires money. For example, we do not hire people just for one project like certain players in our industry.</p><h4>How can Baytak Dala access more clients across different lines of work?</h4><p>Our growth was mainly through word of mouth; in fact, we did not advertise our services for years and only in the last two years we have started to advertise our work through magazines. In terms of growth, we are always seeking bigger clients and larger challenges; for example, we recently held discussions with H&amp;M because it had heard of our work and liked it. In 2018 we intend to open a company in Russia to work with our existing Turkish clients there, such as Koton, FLO, and perhaps DeFacto as well. Those three are our main clients that want to grow in the Russian market. Looking at the local retail market, it has the potential to grow and this will then lead to more retail brands coming here. Geographically speaking, the biggest potential in the future will be in west Kazakhstan, for example in Atyrau or Aktau. They do not have large malls in that region yet. There is only one small mall in each of those centers and the other retailers are street retailers; the potential is there.</p><h4>What projects does Baytak Dala have in the pipeline for 2018 and what are your main objectives for the coming year?</h4><p>For the next year we will develop our business in Russia and start our relationship with H&amp;M. H&amp;M has a plan for two new stores in 2018 and is happy to engage us as its main constructor. H&amp;M is new to Kazakhstan; it only has three stores here to date, including in Mega Silk Way in Astana, Mega Mall, and Mega Park in Almaty. We have also been to Istanbul to meet with Collezione, another established brand in Turkey, though it only has two stores in Kazakhstan. It has a new concept that we looked at in Istanbul with a view to doing it in Kazakhstan. We have submitted our proposal and hope to start working with it as it has two more stores planned for 2017 and another four or five planned for 2018 in different cities around Kazakhstan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Nigeria has over 200 gas flares]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dikko-atanu-ceo-neoleum]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an introduction to the history of Neoleum?</h4><p>I was previously the business development manager and head of gas business at Afren, which had a peak market capitalization of USD3 billion, in which I was involved in all its divestments and acquisitions over a five-year period. I decided to pursue my passion for gas by launching Neoleum Energy, to fill the gap in small-scale gas development projects that utilize gas flares rampant in the Niger Delta. I went into partnership with a US-based midstream infrastructure company and the aim was to develop small scale LNG and LPG facilities that could monetize gas flares via conversion to LNG for transportation to markets away from the pipeline grid. My aim is to use the LNG for power generation via an integrated fast track end-to-end approach. Having an integrated supply of gas and power plants that use gas flares will be one of the ways forward in monetizing stranded gas in Nigeria. Apart from that we also have an indirect interest in a gas rich asset, and our aim is to monetize the gas there. In the long run, we hope to  secure a direct interest in a gas field via Farm-Out, to ensure our source of gas is at the best possible pricing, as opposed to engaging other third-party producing companies. In  securing our own asset, the gas resources will leverage our concept of end-to-end gas monetization from inception with zero gas flares. We also have a strong team, which includes a former Special Advisor to the governor of Lagos State who oversaw the execution from inception of 4 out of the 5 existing captive power plant projects in Lagos.</p><h4>What legislative framework is necessary to unleash the potential of the gas sector in Nigeria?</h4><p>There are multiple legislative frameworks required, but will center on gas flares framework. In  December 2016, at the Nigeria Gas Competence Seminar, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources unveiled a framework and process; to monetize all the gas flares in Nigeria within two years called the National Gas Flare Commercialization Program (NGFCP).  The NGFCP framework pushes for oil companies currently flaring gas to allow third party solution providers, investors or development companies, to access existing gas flares at reduced pricing, and monetize the gas via CNG, LNG or any other solution in two years. A mitigating factor faced by many groups is in securing gas even whilst flared at a reasonable price. In my opinion such a framework that encourages small and midsized companies, to have access to stranded/flared gas at a reduced price will spur further development in the gas sector, and ensuring the projects are commercially viable. In exchange for the gas flares at a revised and fair pricing scheme, the NGFCP framework will see the government earn a royalty, the owners of the gas flares will be paid an agreed offtake tariff and handling fees, and the country benefits from the proliferation of small scale gas projects.  The passing of such a legislative framework will have significant economic and social benefits such as increased use of LPG, elimination of millions of tons of carbon emissions, and the ability to generate 2.5GW of power for new and existing power plants. In our case the legislative framework needs a revised pricing framework that caters to third-party companies that want to monetize gas far away from the grid, and to use it for integrated power projects. The current USD2.5 gas price and USD0.80 transportation tariff could work if a company is close to a pipeline but not for companies seeking to transport the gas to locations far removed from the pipeline grid. If a company like ours has to use virtual pipelines that incur greater cost, then the government needs to have a framework that has a gas price that is either USD1 or almost free to incentivize downstream gas companies. Nigeria is one of the largest emitters of flared gas and currently has over 200 gas flares, though not all of them can be commercialized via conventional technology or are centralized to ensure they can be conveniently developed. At Neoleum we seek to capitalize on unutilized flared gas and the NGFCP framework if approved, to monetize the smaller gas flares that cannot be tied into large-scale gas projects or Central Processing Facilities. If the gas is rich in liquids, the LPG can be stripped for local consumption and the residual gas liquefied as LNG, to serve as feedstock for small-scale power plants away from the gas pipeline grid.</p><h4>How significant is the role of the banking sector to the gas sector?</h4><p>The banking sector has gone through tough times recently due to low oil prices and its exposure to many oil, gas and power transactions. The last five years saw one of the largest transfers of ownership of oil and power assets in Africa's history to indigenous Nigerian firms; however, most of the financial exposure was with indigenous banks. Resultantly, the banks are limited to their exposure to new projects unless they can see that it can quickly bring in rapid cash flow. The gas sector being capital intensive and in many cases having a long development period, requires a robust banking sector with realistic terms for it to grow. In gas projects, most of the costs are dollar denominated whilst the revenues of gas sales are in the local currency resulting in FX risk exposure. The gas sector requires the support of the banking sector in securing longer moratorium periods on its loans, and FX instruments to provide hedges against adverse dollar exchange rates.  Our planned gas projects being modular and fast track, are small enough to tap the local banking sector, and we also work closely with a local private equity group in Nigeria and international investors. Our project cost for each 25-50MW integrated LNG to Power facility costs around USD50 million but can reap returns in the multiples depending on the cost of gas, the richness of the gas feedstock and the ability to displace diesel use with a competitive pricing structure. The project can be commercial in two years from Final Investment Decision, and most banks like to see such gas projects with quick implementation periods and strong cash flows.</p><h4>What are your expectations and objectives for the year ahead?</h4><p>We intend to be actively involved in the upcoming marginal field bid process with a focus on monetizing gas resources. Our aspiration is to secure via a Farm-Out, a direct interest in a marginal field with sizeable gas resources, which we intend to develop via a fast track approach. In the upcoming year, we also hope to embark on a feasibility study which includes the preparations of technical studies and reports to determine the energy production, grid connection and right of way requirements, to deploy our first anchor facility in Abuja, which will be a 25-50MW power plant with an end-to-end integrated LNG infrastructure, to cater to third parties. We also hope that in that one-year period, the NERC would have a tariff in place that accurately reflects the cost of gas far away from the existing gas pipeline grid, and factors the revised exchange rate of the dollar in Nigeria. Finally, our expectations are that the Ministry of Power, Works &amp; Housing, continues to put in place constructive policies, that are harmonized with other government entities, and resultantly ensure groups like ours are much more enabled, to support the growth of the midstream sector in Nigeria.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Leading women’s empowerment from the front]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[aseel-al-hamad-board-member-saudi-arabian-motor-federation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you come to found IDEGREE DESIGN, and how has your style and vision on interior design developed?</h4><p>My story in the interior design business was rather unintentional. After graduating in 2009, I was approached to design the office of a family member. That project led to more projects as I continued to receive positive references and new assignments. Based on my experience, I subsequently established a complete interior design team in 2012. We focus on customization and strive to create a custom-made environment that suits our clients' styles. Our goal is to be an integrated design services company, providing end-to-end solutions including design, material supplies, and execution. We source the materials for interior finishing from top European brands, mostly from France and Italy. Our team has the expertise to design spaces to fit the Saudi lifestyle. Our team of designers is young, and we represent the new generation of Saudis that is aware of trends around the world.</p><h4>Where does your affinity with the automotive industry come from and what are your responsibilities within SAMF since you were appointed board member in December 2017?</h4><p>I have always been captivated by cars and while growing up, I enthusiastically followed the latest car models. It was not only the designs that I was interested in, but also the mechanical engineering. My passion grew from cars to motor sports before I became an active follower of motorsports news and a regular at racing events. Later, I took courses to learn how to drive on racetracks. So far, the most exciting experience was the Corso Pilota at the Ferrari Factory, which is held at the Fiorano Circuit in Italy—my first true experience of racing on a circuit. I continued to participate in open track events across the GCC, often organized under the umbrella of car dealers. Ever since King Salman's decree in September allowed women to drive in the Kingdom, I have received many offers to participate in domestic circuits. As this is largely unchartered territory for Saudi women and given my unique experience, I was glad to accept the offer to become a SAMF board member. The board of SAMF is responsible for everything related to its mission and vision, along with preparing the future strategy to develop and further professionalize the federation in Saudi Arabia. As part of the Crown Prince's Vision 2030, there will be more room for motorsport— and entertainment in general—and we are tasked to develop this. One of my contributions to the board is to support Princess Nourah University with its safety campaigns for driving. SAMF is supported by FIA, the international automobile federation, and many SAMF members are also member of FIA committees. We collaborated on an Action for Road Safety campaign, working with a network of Saudi and global influencers to raise awareness of road safety. I represent Saudi Arabia at the FIA Committee for Women in Motorsports, under the presidency of French rally driver, Michele Mouton. This committee aims to facilitate and value the participation of women in all aspects of motorsports, in not only racing, but also mechanical engineering, directors, PRs, and many others.</p><h4>What are your expectations for motorsports to flourish in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The motorsports sector is growing rapidly here. Today, we are witnessing sport-related events on a weekly basis, ranging from drift races to all sorts of competitions. A new track will open in Jeddah soon, with global standards for both racetrack and facilities. Thus, we will be able to host international events here. The General Entertainment Authority and the General Sports Authority were established to drive both entertainment and sports, and under Vision 2030, our expectations for motorsports to develop are high. Vision 2030 not only strives to support professional athletes, but also to encourage mass participation in sports. There are numerous events happening across the country. The General Entertainment Authority recently sponsored the Race of the Champions at the King Fahd National Stadium in Riyadh. This race allows international champions in various sports disciplines to compete against each other on an equal scale, seeing the true capabilities and skills of the drivers rather than their vehicles. It was a great experience and I was extremely proud to watch Saudi professional racers competing against world champions. We look forward to similar activities in the future.</p><h4>How will the recent decree on female drivers further empower them in the workplace and country?</h4><p>Allowing women to drive is a much welcome and needed change in Saudi Arabia. It represents a significant milestone in our history. I see it as the start of emancipation of Saudi women. Also, I would like to highlight something important about women's empowerment. People who see us from the outside do not in fact live with us. Not everyone understands the inherit traditions of how women are treated here. Men show the women in their families great respect and appreciation. They also treat their wives with love and respect. Allowing women to drive is one step to show the world our true compassion, mercifulness, and respect present in our habits, customs, and traditions. The royal decree to allow women to drive falls under the plan for supporting Saudi women, empowering them to do more. It is possible for Saudi women to count more on themselves for their daily routines. This will lead to higher female participation in the labor market, which will further boost Saudi Arabia's economy.</p><h4>As a young leader of the new generation, what are your ambitions for the coming years?</h4><p>I have many ideas that I would love to convert into reality for the love of my country and the sake of the new, young generation who deserve to dream big and achieve their goals. The new generation deserves to dream and continue to develop their achievements. Today, we are in the middle of a transformation and we need to lead this change in the right direction. Our country needs us more than ever. It has invested so much in our education and everything that has made us the way we are today, and it is time for this generation to lift the country with us. The new generation is talented and full of new business ideas—it is their time to shine now.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Catering to growing cement demand]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[andres-jimenez-general-manager-cemex-panama]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has CEMEX evolved in Panama setting up operations in the country?</h4><p>CEMEX has been in Panama for 24 years and is nowadays   the leading and point of reference company in the cement and construction business here. We have grown with the country. Panama experienced significative changes when it took over control of the Panama Canal in the year 2000. Importantly, in 2005 we expected the country to continue its growth path, and therefore CEMEX made an investment of USD300 million on our operations here. CEMEX is the only clinker producer in Panama, which is the main raw material for the cement industry in the country. We are very proud to participate as suppliers in some of the largest and most emblematic infrastructure projects in the history of the nation: the Panama Canal Expansion project, the Panama Subway Line No.1, and three other large projects that will have a positive effect on the development of the country and the quality of life of its people:  the Panama Subway Line No. 2, the City of Colón Urban Renewal, and the first liquified natural gas electric generation plant in Central America, which is being constructed in Colón Province.</p><h4>CEMEX is present in many countries in Latin America. How important is Panama to the company?</h4><p>Panama is one of the most important countries for CEMEX worldwide in terms of business, volume, growth and for its geographical position. We have invested in various business lines in Panama. We are the only clinker producer and are in the cement, concrete, ready-mix, and aggregate fields. In 2017 we also started in the cement additive—admixtures—business. In the last 24 years, CEMEX has invested around USD600 million in the country.</p><h4>How has the last year been for CEMEX's new additives plant in Panama Pací­fico?</h4><p>CEMEX works to align itself with the country´s economic development vision and plans when it comes to our own business plan. Panama's Ministry of Commerce and Industry has been looking at how the country can export more products, and our new admixtures business can be an export hub for Central America and the Caribbean. We currently export our admixtures to our Caribbean and Central American operations from Panama. We are extremely proud of this because it has allowed CEMEX to contribute to Panama´s exporting of non-traditional products. . . We also export admixtures for third-party customers in Central America and the Caribbean. CEMEX has another admixtures plant in Colombia that just produces for the Colombian domestic market.</p><h4>CEMEX Panama will build 40,000sqm of sidewalks in Panama North and East. What are the main highlights of this project?</h4><p>We have built half a million sqm in the last five years, as part of our innovation strategy, we have a business line called Growing the Pipe. This involves putting all our efforts into finding new ways to grow our cement business, for example, identifying new ways builders and public entities can use cement products, such as using concrete instead of asphalt to construct paths and roads. In countries with high rainfall, asphalt has to be replaced every two or three years, while concrete roads last for 20 years. This saves on maintenance costs. Concrete is also better for fuel consumption as well as driver comfort and safety. We also have special colored, shaped, and stamped sidewalks that can be used to beautify cities and are more comfortable to use. In the long run the cost of using concrete 25% cheaper than using asphalt. Our innovation department has designed innovative concrete solutions that make it cheaper and of higher quality. We also use specialized machines to create concrete roads that provide better comfort for drivers.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on CEMEX's initiatives to be environmentally friendly in Panama?</h4><p>We have a sustainability committee that meets once a month and is responsible for developing and guaranteeing the effectiveness of our programs and initiatives. We have several sustainability initiatives in progress here in Panama. First, we are part of the Million Hectares Alliance and are making a major effort to reforest more than 50ha of woods in ten years. In addition to being part of this initiative, we are working extremely hard with the government and other private companies to help create a cleaner city by contributing to overcoming challenges such as waste management. We have the know-how to process and recover energy through our kilns from alternative fuels in a responsible way, such as municipal solid waste, tires, and biomass residues. In addition, we are making changes in our ready-mix plants to reuse water in different parts of our processes. We are also taking steps to rehabilitate our quarries once we finish using them. CEMEX shares best practices across all the countries the company works in. These projects are part of CEMEX's global green initiatives to reduce our CO2 footprint by 25% in the next three years.</p><h4>What are the main challenges for the cement sector in Panama and what needs to be changed in this market?</h4><p>Our biggest challenge is maintaining the growth we have had in the last 10 years. The economic model of the country is changing, and this is a challenge for both the government and the private sector. The way people used to build is also changing and this will affect our industry. For example, 3D printing is significantly changing design and construction. CEMEX has been preparing for the challenges ahead, and one key initiative is CEMEX Go, which is a best-in-class digital platform aimed at providing a superior customer experience.  Fundamentally, customers expect more of us. With the rise of seamless experiences like Uber and Netflix, customers expect instant and easy access to information, products and services. As a result, speed, transparency and responsiveness are more important than ever. CEMEX Go allows us to meet customers' needs in ways our competitors cannot, and sets the foundation for us to add new value to our customer relationships in the future. CEMEX Go is a multi-device offering that provides a seamless experience for order placement, live tracking of shipments, and managing invoices and payments for CEMEX's main products, including bagged and bulk cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, and multi-products. It delivers real-time, detailed information that customers need to get more done in less time, enabling them to have more control over their businesses and increase value to their stakeholders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[40% sports participation by 2030]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[abdulaziz-turki-alfaisal-al-saud-vice-chairman-general-sports-authority]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision to provide both the entertainment element and public health element of sport?</h4><p>When I started in the GSA, I asked two main questions: How usable and functional are our sport facilities and how accessible are they to the public? It turns out, we have 40-year-old facilities that are in mint condition, as they were hardly used. In 2015, we conducted a survey to study sports participation and found that only 13% of male Saudis over the age of 15 practice sports more than half an hour per week, which is considerably low. Saudi Arabia has one of the highest per capita figures in the world for obesity and Stage II diabetes, and the latter is directly correlated with activity. We targeted increasing the sports participation ratio to 20% by 2020 and 40% by 2030. The weather in Saudi does not help, and a large part of the journey is raising awareness and educating people about the risks and benefits at an early age. We developed a national strategy for sports based on three pillars. The first is mass participation and entails getting everyone in Saudi involved in our activities and familiar with our facilities. This means sports at all levels, from amateur up to elite top sport, which brings us to the second pillar of building a feeding ground and a talent development system for sports clubs to nurture future champions. Our Olympic Committee will then be able to select a national team from the top players of our clubs. The third pillar is, therefore, the sports economy. Within the sports economy, we should focus on making things easier for the private sector to come in. Today, around 80-90% of the contributions to the sports sector come from the government, which is not sustainable. Top sports in particular need continuity to achieve results. To move our objectives forward, we now have the Mass Participation Federation, headed by Princess Reema. Secondly, we reconstructed our Olympic committee in line with the requirements of the International Olympic Committee. Finally, we have doubled the number of national sports federations from 32 to 64 to help athletes get accredited.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the Quality of Life program and the role of GSA?</h4><p>The program has four pillars: culture, entertainment, and two in sports, meaning GSA owns 50% of the initiative. The first program again focuses on increasing mass participation, with the objective of reaching 40% by 2030, while the second program focuses on better positioning the Kingdom in the international sports arena. Instead of gauging our performance by medals, we will measure the number of athletes competing internationally and follow the improvements in ranking of Saudi teams throughout the year. We should have a system in place to have at least the minimum number of athletes representing the country in each sport. To develop this as a continuous system, we need more private sector participation, for example with sponsorship deals for teams or with revenue models. Olympics are held only once every four years, so the athletes need to be able to compete elsewhere. In the Quality of Life program, we look at how the sports economy can affect the GDP, how to build this conducive ecosystem, and how to create jobs out of it. We benchmarked ourselves against Canada, a country with similar demographics, economic characteristics, and climate challenges—as we both rely on indoor sports during its cold winters and our hot summers. With a similar population, we have around 12,500 people working directly in the sport sector, while it has around 300,000 employees. We can bridge this gap by creating tangible investment opportunities and by developing career paths and educational programs. Currently, sports education does not exist, and the share in the total GDP is not even measured. From our numbers, it is around 0.07%, compared to around 1% in Canada. We have the resources and should thus rethink how we utilize them. The Quality of Life program has 21 initiatives structured around our three main pillars. Within mass participation, two key initiatives are Active Cities and Active People. For this, we collaborate directly with municipalities and development authorities. It is essential to think about sport infrastructure in public spaces, for example, having safe running facilities on the streets or on the Corniche. Currently, we work directly with His Royal Highness the Governor of Jeddah to transform the city into an active city. The Active People programs strive to engage people to come out and participate in public sports events. When we had a two-day event in Riyadh in November, 11,000 people showed up, indicating there is definitely a platform for this. King Abdullah Sport City in Jeddah now opens every Tuesday for various sporting activities, including for families and females. In general, we work to make our facilities more accessible and enjoyable for families. Sports do not have controversies or religious or cultural divisions and thus play a unifying role. According to our survey, 80% of participants are convinced that sports makes their lives better. Our job is to get them started and educate them on the possibilities. With 70% of our population under the age of 30, this will catch on quickly.</p><h4>How do you envision pulling in or encouraging the private sector to participate in certain elements of sport?</h4><p>If we increase demand for sports, this will automatically make it more attractive. We need to do the fundamentals to make sports accessible and we need to make it visible. Potential sponsors want exposure and want to put their budget into something that positively reflects on them. Each year, we have around 3,000 sporting events, which is a great starting point. We want to support our sport federation to have more accessibility at the facilities and to promote their sports to the wider public. Also, we should think about how to cover this in the media. Most of our sports journalists are football journalists, so there is room for growth there. If demand and visibility of the sports increases, the private sector will automatically come in. When we organized the first Riyadh Marathon in a short timeframe, we had 35,000 registered participants and many sponsors that were eager to join in. The involvement of GSA helps to give it more credibility. The private sector wants sustainability and trust, and with our plans we can deliver on these expectations.</p><h4>What is your expectation of the impact of Saudi's participation in the FIFA World Cup in Russia?</h4><p>When we qualified, the general vibe and positivity was overwhelming. Everyone rallied around the Saudi team and it created a truly positive atmosphere within the Kingdom. The World Cup is tough, and if we want to compete, our players have to play in the best football leagues, ideally in Europe. In order to prepare our team, we need to have a proper four-year plan in place. We are determined to create the best top sport climate for our team and give it maximum support. For now, it is great exposure and I am sure our players will perform at their best. We have been in talks with the NBA, NFL, NHL, and Nike to see how we can capitalize on our development of our leagues in the future. One of our athletes was part of the development team of the sports hijab for Nike, and we supported that. The World Cup is great way to demonstrate our commitment to the development of a serious and focused sports industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Over the last decade, we revolutionized the bakery industry by setting new standards and upgrading our products range and services by offering more and delivering better. The first Wooden Bakery retail outlet opened at a prime location in Lebanon on Zalka highway in 1999. In May 2015, Bou Habib Holding opened Woodbees, a house of sandwiches that combines the simplicity of the fast food, along with the finesse of the casual dining. Our motto is to provide healthy, tasty food that is a combination between eastern and western cultures. There are currently many competitors in the bakery market, and we use that to always strive to be better. We continuously research new and healthier trends, improve our packaging, and seek higher-quality products .

Our motto is to provide healthy, tasty food that is a combination between eastern and western cultures. With over 30 sandwiches ranging from Lebanese grills to fusion, we use the best and freshest ingredients and a hands-free grilling machine. We offer many kinds of freshly baked bread, including gluten free.</p><h4>How many franchises do you plan to have by the end of this year?</h4><p>We opened the first and currently the only Woodbees franchise at the end of 2017. We are fine-tuning this concept in Lebanon and plan to move the concept to Europe and North America. Our food safety standards align well with Western requirements. For example, in many Lebanese shawarma restaurants, there is a huge spindle of meat open to the elements standing out all-day long. However, our idea is to develop special skewers enclosed in individual vacuum pack, and they are grilled to order. We prefer to enter the UK and Europe as a franchise. We successfully opened Wooden Bakery through franchising in Qatar and Dubai; however, the minimum investment required   is negotiable and depends on the feasibility study done in each country because to start we need a minimum of three outlets and a central factory kitchen that produces for those locations. Only a certain number of people can afford such an investment. In contrast, we created Woodbees as a lower-cost investment. We can open a new business for a much lower investment capital , and it is more accessible and easier to expand and grow the brand. Franchising allowed Wooden Bakery brand to expand faster into the market. Over the years, we have gained experience in choosing the right locations, dealing with the best suppliers, minimizing risks, and gaining as much control on the operation in order to maintain consistency between the branches.</p><h4>What are your international expansion plans?</h4><p>We are ready to expand internationally. Wooden Bakery launched the first franchised operation in 2002 and expanded to 52 outlets spread across Lebanon. We were named the “Fastest-growing company in Lebanon" in 2011. We have been present in Saudi Arabia since 2009 with six outlets and are currently expanding our factory there. Operations in Qatar will begin in six months, with five outlets opening in the first two years. In 2018, we created a joint ventured in Dubai as well and a plant is under development. The board is currently conducting a feasibility study to develop a new plant in Chekka to supply the northern region. We also purchased the land near our plant in Antelias for future expansion plans as well. As for Woodbees, the flagship outlet is on Zalka Highway, and we opened our first franchise in Gemmayze end of 2017.</p><h4>How many Woodbees outlets would you like to see by the end of 2018?</h4><p>I do not expect too many outlets in Lebanon because the economy here is bad and investors cannot be easily found as everybody is having problems. Another challenge is the high price of real estate in the Beirut region limiting the opportunities for franchising in that area. We expect to go overseas and are currently fielding interest from Dubai.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[50% export increase since 2009]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[antonio-braz-costa-general-manager-portuguese-technological-centre-textile-clothing-industries]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the Portuguese textile sector currently represent for the economy?</h4><p>The textile sector is of crucial importance; it represents 10% of total industrial exports from Portugal and more than 15% of employment in the manufacturing industry. The most important thing, however, is that the textile sector is in a counter cycle in relation to other first-world countries. From 2008-2009, GDP shrank by about 20%. However, since 2009 we have increased exports by 50% and increased employee efficiency also by 50%. These figures are extremely important because we are not operating in a protected market. We grew significantly outside of the EU in the first 10 years after the crisis. We went to Russia, South America, Asia, and the GCC, etc. as a result of reaction to the consumption fall in Europe in 2009. We have a gap of about EUR200 million between production and turnover. Basically, we produce all the products we sell, and it is necessary to have the most efficient processes and generate more value per article square meter. This is now the situation of the sector in Portugal.</p><h4>How has the sector worked to set itself apart from its competitors around the world?</h4><p>First of all, Portugal has a flourishing textile and fashion culture and a strong and consolidated industrial experience, demonstrated by the way we preserved the T&amp;C industry in the last two decades. Secondly, we have a strong scientific and technological system within the T&amp;C industry. Well-known textile institutions and companies from around Europe now send people to study here. Finally, we have completely changed the way we do business with textiles, related to management systems and practices. Many Portuguese companies offer lead-time of two weeks currently, which is amazing for any sector. We also invested in product development and innovation as a current component. In 2005 Portugal basically used to sell “minutes“ of industrial transformation (machine time, energy, and labor), nowadays almost all the companies develop the products they sell. Now, we offer fashion solutions, and customers understand that we can play a part in developing their collections. This is a completely new approach. We have also focused a great deal on technical development and created new applications for the automotive, defense, health sectors, among others. This movement was very important to run way from emergent economies direct competition, where labor costs are low or extremely low. Ultimately, the industry grew strongly because we evolved from being a commodity producer to a solutions and high-end services provider.</p><h4>Which areas of the sector have potential in the coming years?</h4><p>There are certain other subsectors that are extremely important for us. Automotive, sport, and protective equipment applications are on top, a clear nexus between technology and design. Sports clothing or protective equipment is also fashionable clothing, and materials must improve performance. The link between technical materials and fashion is vital. We are extremely involved in the development of technical fabrics acting as advanced devices and sensors.</p><h4>How do you work to ensure the best possible synergies between the stakeholders in the textile industry?</h4><p>CITEVE is an initiative of 650 companies; 70% of the center is owned by private firms and the remainder by the government. The idea is to spur competitiveness among Portuguese companies. We stand to find the right way to support companies. We created quality control systems to understand the specific issues companies were facing and to provide new ideas to rectify the situation. At the same time, we created teams for technical assistance and helped companies to optimize their production. By the end of the 1990s, Portugal was one of the very best in the world, concerning strictly manufacturing as corollary of strong need of change in the industry, the bet in the CITEVE's creation and the Ministry of Industry program to support companies to invest in cutting-edge machinery. However, we were only the best in terms of production, and we had no capacity in terms of design or technological development. CITEVE decided to extend the range of activities supporting companies as they adopted new IT solutions, changed their production, and improved the way they formed and maintained relationships with customers. More recently, following the evolution, CITEVE is strongly involved in the technological development of advanced solutions.</p><h4>Which subsectors of Portugal's textile industry are likely to attract the most foreign investment and development in the near future?</h4><p>At the moment, most textile companies in the country are owned and operated by the Portuguese. Portugal has a strong textile community, and we have many people capable of driving new companies and partnerships. If we have the right financing for companies, then we are well positioned. Our past experience with international companies was not successful, because they came mainly to exploit differences in labor costs and would leave at the first sign of difficulty. Had the textile sector belonged to foreign banks or investment partnerships during the 2008-2009 crisis, the industry would have definitely closed down. Fortunately, the industry is in the hands of Portuguese families, and they have a different mindset about the companies. Portuguese industrialists are more willing to invest in the sector when times get tough. Family ownership was the secret to Portugal's success during the difficult years. Recently several foreign companies came to Portugal to invest in the sector, now motivated by the excellency our country offers.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your initiatives as CEO of the CeNTI - Centre of Nanotechnology and Smart Materials?</h4><p>Though university programs focused on textile engineering were in decline, the technological sector for textiles and clothing is currently extremely strong. CeNTI collaborates with the best consortia in Europe and have some areas of exclusivity. No one in Europe is able to produce three component fibers except CeNTI, a complex technology in terms of materials processing and we lead Europe using this technology. Additionally, we have been working hard to integrate electronics into textile products, I mean, developed solutions where textile materials, structures and products are itself electronic devices: sensors, actuators, etc. Since 2003 we are convinced that nanotechnology will be the base of advanced textiles.</p><h4>What are your top priorities over the coming years to support the continued growth of the textile industry?</h4><p>The textile sector in Portugal must be at the cutting edge of the digitalization of manufacturing processes. The sector does not have any chance to be worse than Chinese or German manufacturers. If it will be possible to develop completely digitized plants, using robots to make textile goods, then we must be there. We must make sure that Portugal will remain competitive to produce textiles, even in Portugal. People are working to develop this area, and we are currently investing strongly to create a factory that endows companies with the knowledge needed to understand the future of the textile industry. We are developing platforms that enable us to develop applications for this. It is a great opportunity for us, because we have an excellent knowledge base regarding textiles. Furthermore, we have enough IT and internal logistics firms to facilitate a rapid development and keep us on the cutting edge. We need to create and maintain competencies that ensure our textile sector can remain at the forefront. Another priority is to emphasize sustainability and the “circular economy.“ In fact the starting point is yet very well positioned when compared with the rest of the textile world. As Europe has a strong legal framework related to environment, nowadays in Portugal, it is easy for companies to be certified according to sustainability standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[revolution-in-industry]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the major opportunities for diversification in the Ghanaian economy?</h4><p>There are several opportunities in Ghana, including in our sector. The global trend is shifting toward electrification and other options; however, electric vehicles are the near future and the trends of the last few years have determined the speed at which we will evolve. Countries like China have decided that, in the medium term, a large percentage of their cars will be electric, securing many exports. India is following suit because of pollution, while Europe has already started. Before, manufacturers were somewhat reluctant about this; however, if we do not follow the decisions of large governments such as China, India, the US, and Europe, we will find ourselves trailing behind. There is a significant opportunity for manufacturers of spare parts to enter our area because of the new business facilities and industrial parks that the government wants to construct here with the One District, One Factory incentive.</p><h4>What measures do you expect from the government to boost the car industry in Ghana?</h4><p>We are moving rapidly and will see a great revolution in the car industry. This will have a large impact on us, though our speed will depend on government decisions. If the Ghanaian government decides to lift duties and VAT on electric cars, then many people can start buying electric cars. That is a step forward. The new technology cars are powerful and can reach a higher horsepower. The battery life and length of time to recharge is being rapidly developed. In the southern hemisphere, we will be a few years behind depending on the government's decisions. There are many facilities that the government is willing to give out for investors. Electricity is an issue, though this is being solved in terms of the cost. We pay USD0.27 per kW and the target is USD0.10, and we will have to see how that can be reached. To create a successful industry, we need to create excellent and cost-effective infrastructure.</p><h4>What is the impact of the banking system on trade in Ghana?</h4><p>We look into bringing in a new product that is affordable and has a warranty. We are still studying how best to introduce that into the market and, to do so, we need the proper financing through banks and interest rates. To solve this issue, the government has reduced the interest on treasury bills. Secondly, the banking system with the new capitalization will make people understand that we have to wake up and start practicing retail banking. All our neighbors such as Togo, Mali, and Ivory Coast have much lower interest rates. If the same was applied in Ghana, we would be many times larger; therefore, this is a major problem.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the Accad Group and the Ghanaian economy in 2018?</h4><p>For the Accad Group, the whole system has to move quickly. Unfortunately, the biggest issue for us in 2017 was the government's decision not to purchase vehicles for governmental institutions. There were some ongoing tenders, though nothing has materialized yet. The largest customer has always been the government followed by construction companies, and those two institutions did nothing in 2017. This is a major issue and we need things to start moving immediately to be able to continue. There is a great deal of interest in investment, though. The more delays there are, the more we will be affected; hence, there has to be a different approach to banking for the car industry. The government has to put a stop to gray imports to protect companies. We are working with Nissan, Volkswagen, and Porsche and are spending large sums of money on training, communication, and marketing. Second-hand sales have to be reduced as well, as the fuel bills are higher and cars are not roadworthy, causing more accidents on the roads and pollution. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Innovating Insurance]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[innovating-insurance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your priorities as the commissioner of the NIC?</h4><p>The first priority is to get the commission to be more proactive. We want to protect the interests of policyholders and ensure we have a level playing field for all industry players. We also want to help build insurance penetration, because it is currently below 2%. There is a great deal of leakage in our system. For example, only 36% of Ghanaians have some form of insurance, while 30% of vehicles on the roads are not insured. We also look to promote microinsurance as the majority of people belong to the low-income sector and agro-insurance as the majority of Ghanaians are in that sector. We want to speak with the government on many issues. First, it should purchase some percentage of insurance to boost the penetration level. Second, we want to convince it to make work-compensation insurance available for a set group of people. We also want to provide life insurance for a particular class of workers, with an eye on unemployment insurance. Finally, we want to create associations with certain levels of autonomy to deal with some issues to remove some of the burden on NIC.</p><h4>What products does Ghana's insurance industry need?</h4><p>We lack levels of research, which is something we want to spearhead. We want to truly understand why people do not buy insurance products. One of the challenges is that its products are solely created from the head office. They then go to rural areas and tell them about their offerings; it should be the other way around. We need feedback from those people in the countryside before we design and try to market a product.</p><h4>What is your vision for the development of microinsurance in Ghana?</h4><p>A large part of the population is from the low-income sector, which is the target for microinsurance products. The challenges include education, accessibility, and managing the product, including how to sell the product, how to collect premiums, and how to settle claims. With microinsurance, there are small premiums so a company has to find an effective way of doing it to become a lucrative business. The best way to drive and improve microinsurance in our market is to, in fact, use technology.</p><h4>What prospects do you see with the international standardization of regulations within re-insurance?</h4><p>In our market, before we send any business out, we have to be sure that the local capacity is taken care of. Because we have this requirement, it slows down the arrangements. If it takes a long time to complete re-insurance arrangements, anything could happen. I want to sit down with the industry and come up with a prudent way to tackle this. The best approach is to have a formula.</p><h4>Where do you see the major opportunities for Ghana's life and non-life insurance market?</h4><p>When it comes to life education and confidence in insurance, it has to come from the regulator. Everyone should want to buy a life insurance plan, and it should be something that will be easy to sell since everyone will die. People do not have trust in insurance because they think insurance companies are quick to collect premiums, but slow to pay claims. We look to have a toll-free number at the commission where people can call in, and we will address their issues and direct them to the appropriate areas. If we are able to convince banks to have life insurance policies for every person who comes in for a loan, that alone is a big business. That way at least when there is a loss, we will pay their starting balances. It is all about innovation. We need to look into designing products that are affordable, especially with microinsurance; at the same time I want an insurance industry that can also assist society. Clients have to be confident in a system that works. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have operations grown in the last few years for SAS?</h4><p>We have recorded significant growth in several of our businesses since 2015. In the fixed income area, in particular, we have added market share in both the primary and secondary markets. In asset management, our AUM has grown significantly over the last one and a half years. In equities, we are a licensed brokerage company that has listed more companies on the Ghana Stock Exchange than any other Ghanaian investment bank over the past two decades. However, in the last few years, the brokerage industry as a whole has not done much business, as high interest rates and the stock market decline between 2014 and 2016 drew investors away from equities. Between 2016 and 2017, there have only been two public offerings. One of our core businesses is in principal investing, where we invest some of our own capital in partnership with strategic and financial investors from abroad in landmark projects in telecommunications, healthcare, information technology, power, and green energy. There have been some major successes in this area. </p><h4>What is your strategy for partnering with foreign institutions for principal investments?</h4><p>We seek partners who are naturally interested in coming to invest in Africa. International investors will not find perfect opportunities and deals in our markets; they have to be willing to work with projects and the opportunities they come across and identify and mitigate risks away. That is why the Chinese are winning more project concessions and contracts across Africa than Western investors. They are willing to work on basic opportunities to structure projects and partnerships that would work for all stakeholders. Secondly, we want to partner with investors who are well capitalized or have the credibility to be able to attract project financing. These are two critically important factors. Third, we need patient investors with a medium- to long-term vision who are prepared to go through longer project life cycles than in other markets.</p><h4>What expertise can SAS Finance Group bring to these investors?</h4><p>Our principals have significant experience in international business, with training from top business schools such as Yale and Harvard. We are, therefore, able to interface well with partners from all over the world and support them with unparalleled local business and economic access and a strong understanding of the local market and industries. Local knowledge plays a strong part. We add value through our understanding of what the competitive forces in every industry are, such as the raw materials, how assured and risky resources are, what the markets are for the industry, and who the major players are. Competitiveness lies in helping a new entrant to be successful and partnering an investor from a position of knowledge. For portfolio investors, our research offerings provide valuable insights on Ghana and the capital markets, promote investors' awareness, and support investment decision-making and liquidity in shares and fixed income securities. </p><h4>What is the key to unlocking the potential of the equity market?</h4><p>The Ghanaian public stock market is significantly undersized relative to some other African country markets, but this is artificial. Multinationals here such as MTN Ghana, Vodafone Ghana, and Nestlé Ghana, some of the largest corporates in the country, are not listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange. The local subsidiaries of Nigerian banks here, such GT Bank, UBA, Zenith Bank, some of the largest banks on the continent, are not listed in Ghana but these banks are listed in Nigeria. If we were to add all these relatively large companies that are currently off the market, there would be more investment securities, possibly even listed corporate bonds issued by these companies, and the market would be even more exciting for domestic and international portfolio investors. We need to see either government incentives or mandates that motivate all the multinational companies operating in Ghana to list. Securities firms also need to do a better job of marketing listed securities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>It was in the square of independence in 1961 that the late President Kwame Nkrumah, father of the independence of Ghana and pioneer of pan-Africanism, lit for the first time the eternal flame, sending to the Ghanaian people and Africa a message of hope for a united Africa, master of its own destiny.</p><p>I would like to seize this opportunity to reiterate to both President Nana Akufo-Addo and Vice-President Bawumia my warmest congratulations for their brilliant victory in the presidential elections of December 7, 2016. The people of Ghana have expressed their trust and confidence in them and shown their support for their vision and ambition for Ghana. Their well-known leadership, political commitment, and love for Ghana and Africa will enable them to successfully meet the legitimate aspirations of the people of Ghana. I am very pleased to acknowledge the very good collaboration we have had with the previous President and which has enabled us to make significant progress in strengthening the economic and socio-cultural cooperation between our two countries. I am particularly pleased for the work achieved together toward the consolidation of peace, security, and integration in our sub-region.<br>The transparent and peaceful elections, as well as the smooth transitions of power we are witnessing today, demonstrate that Ghana has definitely opted for democracy and peace. This election is undoubtedly contributing to reinforcing the image of West Africa and Africa to the world. I humbly exhort the people of Ghana to preserve political maturity, the sense of discipline, and the love of peace. These important ideas are the foundations of sustainable economic development. Indeed, without democracy there is no peace, and without peace there is no sustainable economic progress. Ghana, just like Cí´te d'Ivoire, aspires to economic emergence in the very near future. To meet this challenge and achieve this goal, Ghana needs a climate of peace and social cohesion. Over the years, Ghana has shown solidarity with Cí´te d'Ivoire on many occasions. Indeed, Ghana has welcomed, for many years, thousands of refugees from Cí´te d'Ivoire. In addition, Ghana has contributed a large contingence of troops to UN operations in Cí´te d'Ivoire. I would like once again to thank the political leaders of Ghana for their support, assistance, and solidarity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the government and people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria I was honored by the special invitation extended to me by His Excellency, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, on the auspicious occasion of the celebration of the 61st Independence Anniversary of the Republic of Ghana. I was delighted at the warm reception accorded to me and my entourage since our arrival in the beautiful city of Accra. I would like to pay special tribute to all leaders of the Republic right from the era of the late first President, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, to date. We must acknowledge their various contributions.</p><p>In the words of Kwame Nkrumah, “those who would judge us merely by the heights we have achieved would do well to remember the depths from which we started." No words can sum it up better, as we are all familiar with our colonial era journey and its ups and downs. My tribute also goes to all those who have paid the supreme sacrifices in the cause of nation building.<br>May I extend my personal congratulations to President Akufo-Addo on his successful one year in office with special note on the strides recorded by his administration within a space of just 365 days.<br>From Nigeria, I have watched Ghana's achievements closely, ranging from its ingenious approach to creating jobs for the teeming youths through various initiatives, including the repositioning of agriculture for modern farming, “Farming for Jobs and Food;" Senior High School (SHS) free education; the One District, One Factory and One Village, One Dam projects; as well as the improvement being recorded in the republic's macroeconomic indicators. All these efforts, I am aware, have helped Ghana become an excellent destination for FDI just like Nigeria. <br>My tributes to the president and people of Ghana would not be complete without acknowledging efforts at tackling corruption, which has eaten into the fabrics of our societies. I congratulate both the government and the parliament for the quick passage of the Office of the Special Prosecutor Act and its signing into law. Ghana can be assured that it has a good partner in me as I look forward to any form of collaboration between Nigeria and Ghana in tackling the menace of endemic corruption. Given all these public policies, it becomes reassuring that with the right leadership, Africa's drives to eradicate poverty and to entrench democracy is on course.<br>Nigeria and Ghana share close cultural and historic ties, which have continued to shape our bilateral relations. Once again, I note with pride that our common colonial experience, as well as parallel socio-economic and political development and the patriotic vision of our leaders have helped greatly in shaping this unique relationship not only in West Africa sub-region but in our collaborative actions internationally. It is therefore my strong desire that we owe it as a duty to ensure that our good peoples continue to live in each other's countries unhindered. Our newly rejuvenated Permanent Joint Commission for Cooperation has already provided us with a great platform in resolving any differences while focusing on our main developmental objectives.<br>Permit me to put on record Ghana's untiring efforts in brokering peace in Togo, by bringing all the warring parties to the negotiation table. I am appealing to the opposing parties in Togo to please come together and resolve their differences so that Togo will move forward. In the same vein, I wish Nigeria and Ghana to continue to provide the impetus in realizing the objectives and ideals of the founding fathers of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), to ensure security, peace, and development in our region.<br>On behalf of the government and people of Nigeria, I join other well-wishers in congratulating the government and the good people of Ghana. Long live the Republic of Ghana; long live the Federal Republic of Nigeria. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[leaps-and-bounds]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have operations evolved in the last year since your appointment?</h4><p>Zenith Bank, one of Nigeria's largest banks by tier-1 capital, had been operating for nearly two decades before it entered the Ghanaian market 12 years ago. In the last two to three years, we have experienced consistent and remarkable growth in terms of the major performance indicators. Our bottom line has been growing and the balance sheet has almost doubled. Today, we have become one of the leading banks in Ghana in terms of brand, culture as well as service delivery and product offerings. In terms of capital size, we are one of the top-three largest banks in Ghana. Our financial performance indicators for 2017 grew in leaps and bounds relative to the previous year. We have consolidated our position as one of the top-10 banks in the industry, and are part of a select group of banks that have sufficient capital to meet the Bank of Ghana's new capital requirement of GHS400 million even before the stipulated deadline of December 31, 2018.</p><h4>What gives you a competitive advantage in Ghana?</h4><p>Our competitive advantage in Ghana is essentially the hospitality of the people of Ghana; Ghanaians have been receptive of the Zenith brand and have lent great support to the bank's operations. Like many other businesses, we have benefitted and continue to benefit from the government of Ghana's commitment to putting in place the right measures, including the formulation of laws, to create an enabling business environment that will attract FDI and ensure they thrive. The relatively stable power supply has also contributed immensely to a lot of businesses coming into a profit-making position. In addition to expanding our physical presence, Zenith Bank uses a robust technological platform to provide quintessential service delivery to all its customers; we are penetrating the market by using digitization to make it more convenient for our customers to carry out their banking transactions. In this light, we have collaborated with MasterCard, Visa, and other electronic platforms to provide unrivalled products and services to the banking populace in Ghana. We also have a well-integrated mobile money platform and are one of the few banks in Ghana that have bank-to-wallet capabilities on the mobile money platform. Ghana is largely unbanked and the opportunities to attract the unbanked population into the banking sector are massive.</p><h4>How do you project your corporate client base to evolve in the future and how do you seek to adjust?</h4><p>Zenith has a strategic purpose in Ghana's corporate environment, where we channel 80% of our energy toward initiatives that give us 80% of our revenues. In the corporate world, we seek solutions to improve confidence, especially for multinationals to increase their market share in Ghana. Ghana is an attractive economy for FDI, and we need to identify new players coming in and provide them with the necessary benefits through our brand and efficient marketing staff.</p><h4>What is the solution to solve the high rate of non-performing loans (NPL) affecting the industry?</h4><p>An enhanced corporate governance system and improved risk management practices are requisite for a sound and thriving financial sector. If NPLs are an issue for one bank, this directly or indirectly becomes an issue for the entire system, as we all belong to the same market and have the same customers. We have, unfortunately, not been able to create a system where all customers are identifiable and defaulters punished. There is no platform that makes consumer information readily available. This makes government's efforts to introduce the national ID card system an excellent one. For corporates, everyone needs to find a way to improve their internal control systems. The government has so far made commendable efforts, for example, by raising the energy sector levy accounts to create cash flows, which were on the back of the bonds that were issued. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Wilkins Engineering will celebrate 25 years in 2018. What have the major highlights since you started the company?</h4><p>Wilkins Engineering is one of the pioneers of solar energy in Ghana. We first started talking to the government about solar in 1988, and at that time it did not make sense to anyone because it was too expensive, at around GHS0.12 (USD0.03) per watt. However, the government somehow agreed and we did a small solar project for about 2,000 homes. That scheme was fantastic and it opened politicians' eyes to the potential of solar. We are proud to say that our involvement in solar energy has brought a great deal of awareness to renewable energy in Ghana.</p><h4>How does Wilkins Engineering seek to maintain its growth and what does it expect from the government?</h4><p>For the first 10 years, it was difficult working in solar energy and we had to find ways to diversify and do more work in conventional energy. That is how we have been able to get to our current point now; the company would not have survived on solar alone. Without effort and commitment from the government and industry, there is no way to scale up the solar power industry because even today solar is expensive. This support and assistance has not been there until recently. Capital costs have come down, though we still have some serious problems in terms of government policies in our sector. It is difficult because I was a former President of the Association of Ghana Solar Industries and we contributed to Ghana's Renewable Energy Act 2011. Under that act, the government committed to have 10% of the country's energy mix comes from renewables. Today, renewables still only make up less than 1%. For the last five years, we have had some support from the German National Chamber of Commerce and have managed to get an Energy Commission. Then, the effort moves from government and the next step comes down to individuals such as Wilkins Engineering with great renewable energy models.</p><h4>What are some of the reasons why solar power has not become a popular solution here?</h4><p>Although rooftop solar products have particular problems, the potential is still there today. If we take a group of 50 houses and install solar on all their roofs, we can network the system and install centralized storage capacity that can deliver electricity to that group of houses even at night. However, developers see solar as too expensive and it also competes with other power options. We approach developers with a financial package where the builders leave the electrical part of the build to us. This is what we look at and it is viable because electricity is extremely expensive, and if we can provide reliable renewable energy that has a reasonable rate this is optimal. Therefore, one of our focuses now is to resemble an electricity player, but concentrate on renewable energy.</p><h4>What will be the greatest opportunities in the energy sector in Ghana overall?</h4><p>The Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG), which is the major energy distribution company here, runs at about 25% losses, and there is technology today to reduce these losses to about 10%. Every 1% loss is worth about GHS100 million (USD22.1 million); therefore, it could save a significant amount. Unfortunately, ECG is government owned and it gets paid whether it works or not. This is, therefore, something we need to change; we need to correct its inefficiencies as one would with any commercial entity, though this will take a great deal of investment. Once that is done, electricity tariffs will come down. One of the areas we are developing is micro-grids; however, when we go to meet the people who can afford these alternative systems, their roofs are not big enough for the generation capacity they require. </p>]]></richbody0content>

	How do you describe Newmont Ghana and its operations?
</h4><p>
	Newmont has two gold mining operations in Ghana, the Ahafo Mine in the Brong-Ahafo region and the Akyem Mine near New Abirem. In 2002, Newmont secured an operating position in Ghana for USD500 million that has grown to a total investment of USD3.4 billion today. We account for 32% of Ghana's gold production. The Ahafo operation began production in August 2006 and Akyem in 2013. The two operations have produced more than 7 million ounces of gold, and the region still remains highly prospective. We have also established two development foundations for our host communities funded with USD1 per ounce of gold produced and 1% of net profit from each mine. These foundations are led by the community and funded wholly by Newmont. We have invested about USD37 million into these over the last decade, from which various community and infrastructure development projects have been completed and handed over to the host communities. Over the same period, we have also paid more than USD1.1 billion in taxes. In 2017, our Akyem operation was named the best company in Ghana by the Ghana Investment Promotion Center for the second consecutive year.</p><h4>What is Newmont's current growth strategy in Ghana?</h4><p>
	We currently have two growth projects in Ghana, the Subika Underground and the Ahafo Mill Expansion. Subika Underground started production with the first ounce of gold produced in June 2017, and commercial production is slated for September 2018. The Ahafo Mill Expansion will start commercial operations in 2H2019. These projects will generate between 225,000 and 300,000 ounces of combined gold per year. We have conducted various studies to further advance underground potential in the region. Our next growth project, Ahafo North, will come up for a full funding decision in 2019. If approved, the project will consist of nine deposits over a 14km strike length and is located about 30km north of our current Ahafo operations. Overall, we have a total of 12.8 million gold ounces in reserves and an additional 6.8 million gold ounces in resources in Ghana.</p><h4>Are you considering regional expansion as well?</h4><p>
	Currently, our expansion efforts are focused mainly on Ghana. Though, we see many opportunities to grow in the region and are conducting exploration in Ethiopia, where we have been conducting preparatory work for a number of years and have recently started to see encouraging results. However, it is still too early to make any firm predictions at this point. While expanding beyond Ghana is important, we look at a number of different factors before we make a decision to develop a gold mining operation in a new country. We look beyond technical feasibility to issues of safety, political stability, contractual certainty, infrastructure, accessibility, and workforce availability to help guide our investment decisions. Our growth investments rely on our country, social, infrastructure, environmental, and economic risk analyses to help assess our prospects.</p><h4>What is your strategy with regards to contractors?</h4><p>
	We perform our core business activities ourselves and use contractors as business partners to supplement where needed, particularly in the development of new projects. We evaluate contractors based on a number of criteria: safety track record, quality of service, service delivery, and their alignment with our values of integrity, responsibility, and sustainability. We do not treat contractors differently; we see them as business partners, and it is extremely important that they align with Newmont's purpose and values.</p><h4>What measures and policies would you like to see from the government to enhance operators like Newmont in Ghana?</h4><p>
	We recognize that the government is committed to fostering a business-friendly environment to spur investment, job creation, and economic development. However, most importantly for us as a mining business with potential to grow, we seek a predictable regulatory framework and a permitting process that will encourage increased capital investment. It is important for us to be able to convince our shareholders of the long-term sustainability of business here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[adjust-accordingly]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your priorities for Dizengoff Ghana?</h4><p>One of our top priorities is to put Dizengoff back on the business map. Our key focus is to ensure that we are visible in the marketplace and that people are aware of what Dizengoff offers. We are not just a product-based business but also a solution-based one. We are constantly looking at new innovative products that would be suitable for the Ghanaian market. The business landscape has changed considerably. There is substantial competition in the market place, and many products similar to ours have been imported into Ghana from the east at a competitive price point but with varying degrees of efficacy. Dizengoff decided to take a different stance, entering the market with quality, long-lasting, and effective products. We also have a diversified portfolio: in our electromechanical division, we are revitalizing our product set and introducing a wider range. Our ICT portfolio has mainly centered on the Motorola product set, and we also have more homeland security products around this division that we will be driving forward.</p><h4>What does Dizengoff look for in a partner?</h4><p>In partnership, there must be exclusivity in Ghana, as the market is not large enough to have multiple suppliers of the same goods. We look for partners that strive for innovation in order to move business forward. Since our partnership requires us to constantly engage with customers, communicate with staff, and network with larger groups to find out what is needed, we would provide our partner with market feedback. In this way, we can adapt the product set of the supplier to the marketplace. Our business centers around how we can maintain, service, and continue to grow the product locally. We have been investigating partnerships in South Africa because of the low lead and shipping times. We also wish to drive partnerships in North and South America forward. It is important to deal with countries that are able to offer us products of high quality with better supply times.</p><h4>What is Dizengoff's commitment to grow local capacity?</h4><p>At one stage, we had as many as 10 expats in the company; now, we have only four because we developed local expertise to replace them. Developing local capability is a core activity within our group, not just within Ghana. Our EMD division is currently successfully run by a Ghanaian, which has been a hugely positive step for us. We have been in business for over 60 years in Ghana and have learned the importance of running a locally supportive and maintained business.</p><h4>How do you expect demand for your products to evolve, and how will you adjust?</h4><p>We strive to listen to our customers and make constant adjustments. Within our ICT division, we are investigating security products such as intruder detection. For corporate ICT, we are looking into CCTV and all the physical security products. We also have a cybersecurity division that many multinational companies and banks would benefit from enormously, in addition to a building maintenance program centered on construction. Within our communications division, Motorola has been our key focus; however, we also supply the hardware and software for fiber, and customers can now monitor and throttle their input for data. We are moving quite steadily ahead with regards to Tigo, MTN, and Vodafone. Our agri-division offers turnkey solutions for everything from mechanized farming to seeds and fertilizers. We were the first business to introduce greenhouses into the market five years ago and significantly revised our product to cater for the heat in Ghana.</p><h4>Where do you hope to gain a stronger foothold or expand into?</h4><p>The northern region at the moment is untapped because of logistical issues. We have also concentrated on supporting neighboring countries, despite linguistic and logistic challenges. We plan to supply distributors within Ivory Coast, Togo, and Benin, as they are all growing markets. Eventually, we will need to set up our own satellite offices within those countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Gateway to Africa]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[gateway-to-africa]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures is your government taking to further improve its investment climate?</h4><p>Mauritius has been diversifying its economy since the 1990s, and one of the areas we have identified is the financial sector. We positioned Mauritius squarely as a gateway for Africa into Asia investment. There is a great deal of potential in the African continent and we aim to seamlessly move into the African market. We have signed several FTAs and both the government and the private sector are investing massively in West, East, and Southern Africa. Our strategy is to look more into Africa, also bearing in mind that Mauritius can also become the gateway for Asia to come into Africa.</p><h4>Will tourism play a strong part in diversifying Mauritius' economy?</h4><p>Tourism is one of the pillars on which our economy is firing, though surprisingly tourism does not exceed 10% of Mauritius' economy. In fact, other services play a much more important role. Tourism is a product that we have to diversify and make as interesting as possible because the average tourist wants more than the sun and sea. We are going for aqua, green, and cultural tourism; we are diversifying the product. Through this, we hope to increase the number of tourists we currently receive.</p><h4>What are some possible ways to stop the brain drain from Africa?</h4><p>Mobility and migration have been ongoing since time immemorial. We have to see how we can promote brain circulation and, better still, brain gain. To do this, we must provide an ecosystem where bright Africans can come and work, and this ecosystem has to be better than the one they are used to. The challenge is on us to ensure we create ecosystems so we can retain them. However, as long as there is brain circulation we will be satisfied.</p><h4>How can the youth bulge that Africa faces be a threat to countries in the region?</h4><p>The youth bulge can be a boon; however, it can also be a bane if we do not channel this energy into the appropriate sectors where we create jobs. We have 11 million graduates joining the job market every year and Africa will need to produce enough jobs for them. This threat can be turned around provided we start thinking about it now. Our education system can prepare our youths for jobs necessary for the future. We need to be prepared so that the potential of our younger generations can be realized and used to transform the continent.</p><h4>What can other African countries learn from Mauritius to help them open up to business and the world?</h4><p>We should not be prescriptive, but lead by example. For any economy, there is no Mauritian miracle. We provide a social security net and free healthcare for people. However, more importantly, we guarantee full education. This has been a key ingredient. Around 30% of Mauritius' GDP goes to these three categories. This is not an expense, but an investment because if we do not safeguard the interests of the people by educating them and providing them with healthcare, then we will not get a performing population. We also have elections every five years and the population demands ever-greater accountability. Governance issues come to the fore and corruption has to be tackled. The business community, investors, and tourists who come here have to feel safe.</p><h4>What is your top priority for Mauritius in 2018?</h4><p>One initiative we have taken over the course of 2017 is to build up the country's education ecosystem. We are working to improve the indicators so that we become an intelligent island that is innovative and agile in the way we take decisions. If we get bogged down in a great deal of bureaucracy, things will not work. It is about changing mindsets and continuing to ensure that girls receive the best education. We have to keep on building on the things we have started. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Foundations for the Future of Tech]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[foundations-for-the-future-of-tech]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have operations evolved since you first entered Ghana, and what was the significance of entering the market?</h4><p>Oracle has been in this market for two years, although we have been present on the African continent for 30 years or so, with a strong customer base in Ghana via our partner network. We established a physical presence here at the right time. The entire industry and economic environment is undergoing transformational change. We have seen customers struggling to deal with the impact of digital disruption and have helped them with our innovative solutions to deal with the changes that are happening in the wider marketplace. The global IT industry is going through a paradigm shift with cloud adoption and the market in Ghana is no different. We have a unique cloud offering, which puts us in a good position to address our customers' needs. Cloud solutions are a key component of the digital transformation that is sweeping across the industry.</p><h4>What is Oracle's strategy with regards to establishing partnerships in Ghana?</h4><p>Partnerships are extremely important for us; we have a thriving global partner network that is seen as an extension of the Oracle family, and in a market like Ghana, historically we have depended significantly on partners, especially before we entered the market with a physical office. We look at ways to build capacity within the economy in Ghana and also to foster strong relationships with the tech community, looking for ways to partner with these entrepreneurs in a form of innovation hubs. We are also looking at ways to help these innovation hubs understand some of the emerging technologies like cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, chatbots, blockchain, and others. We also try to find ways to empower entrepreneurs and businesses to increase their capacity to understand trends and build upon their skillsets to play a role in the global economy as far as innovation is concerned.</p><h4>What is the key to speeding up public sector acceptance of cloud, and what measures would you like to see?</h4><p>The key elements here are an open economy built on strong foundations of competitiveness, thus allowing ease of doing business. Anything in that direction is what we truly welcome. The future is bright—International Development Company (IDC) predicted ICT spending in the Middle East, Turkey, and Africa region to reach USD243 billion in 2017. From all indications, Africa is expected to see a rise in IT spending through investments in cloud, big data, social, and mobile. Emerging technologies and trends such as IoT, robotics, cognitive systems, virtual reality, 3D printing, and new generation security will be key drivers. Another key element is the need for many skillsets. We also welcome any effort that is aimed at building the capacity of Ghana's youth as we can only succeed with a skilled workforce. We support the government in this direction with our own education initiative designed to support education establishments, universities, and tertiary institutions in building their IT capacity. At the moment, we have about 13 universities that are on board with this initiative.</p><h4>What major challenges and risks do you face operating in the Ghanaian market?</h4><p>For us, the biggest challenge in driving this cloud agenda is the initial pushback that is mainly founded around concerns of security and data residency. Some organizations are not comfortable with parting with their data; however, these fears have been proven to be unfounded, and companies are warming up to cloud. We, as a vendor, have some of the most sophisticated security infrastructure, and there are few organizations that can match this level of security infrastructure within their own data centers. Another challenge that we have also encountered is the level of skills, and we are active in helping the government to bridge that gap, as we need an abundance of skills locally to be able to succeed. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your newspaper evolved in recent years?</h4><p>B&amp;FT has evolved from a small boutique newspaper into a large one. We came into an environment where there were only a few national papers. Penetrating the market was challenging and advantageous at the same time. We provide accurate, relevant, and credible information to the business community, which needs information to make decisions, and students. It is our objective to provide adequate information for all sectors, allowing people to assess that information and be well informed when coming to the country. There is more to be done by employing technology in this age to ensure we provide the necessary information and package it in a way that is accessible to the public. We also offer other products, some of them with continental reach like the B&amp;FT magazine, a monthly publication. We recently added Energy Today, a quarterly that is still growing since we have been introduced to energy and oil and gas. Finally, we host our own events like the Ghana Economic Forum and give out awards, organize roundtable discussions, and have a TV program called Business Times TV. </p><h4>How do you see technology playing a role in the future of B&amp;FT?</h4><p>If we want to provide necessary information and products, we have to do it through an online platform. This will meet the needs of our readers. We use and continue to improve our online platforms, through which it is easier to sell our products to the whole world. Older people want the feel of a newspaper; however, the new generation are used to their phones. We are still exploring opportunities to partner with technological players. For example, we were unsatisfied with the app we had launched and are currently working on it every day, hoping to launch it on both the Android and iOS market. These are the models we are looking at.</p><h4>Do you expect any particular changes in regulations from government to facilitate the media industry?</h4><p>The Ghana Economic Forum is an advocacy platform that engages the public and private sectors to discuss economic and business issues, such as reducing poverty and corruption and increasing growth and employment. We partner with some of these institutions that buy into the idea of getting the public sector involved, so that the platform becomes a channel for informing policy direction. Both the government and private sector should be able to support the media within Ghana to reach international standards. If we compare what is happening here to developed countries in terms of capacity, the media is not there. The media should be seen as a serious sector and receive immediate support. The media can play the role it is supposed to play, to advocate and keep people on their toes, and educate and inform.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges a company like B&amp;FT faces today, and how do you tackle them?</h4><p>Our first challenge is the cost of running the business, which is high and has implications on profits and margins. If we want to build capacity to expand, it is extremely difficult in this climate. My main aim is to expand and penetrate further into Africa and perhaps the rest of the world. The market and potential are huge; however, we need the right framework and support. Other international publications have been in existence for years, and most of them will get bigger. With the right infrastructure and setup, they are able to expand; that is the kind of support we need. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As you take the helm of DDP Outdoor, what are your priorities?</h4><p>Our major priority is to grow both locally and internationally. We want to expand into new countries, starting with West Africa. Right now, to do something spectacular, we have to go outside of Ghana. Our approach is to seek partners in each country, so we can rely on their local expertise when running the business. </p><h4>What does your upcoming 45th anniversary in Ghana and more than 50% market share mean for the company and country?</h4><p>It is a proud moment for Ghana to have a local company that is both large and sustainable. As a company, we are proud to be a leader despite the vast influx of new companies. Our motto is to always focus on offering the highest quality services; hence, our competitors and customers recognize us as a perennial market leader. We are constantly looking at new and innovative types of media not yet present in the country. We pioneered various types of advertising in the country, which allow us to maintain a dominant position. We have many opportunities in the digital space and are trying to capture this opportunity by offering the country something unique. </p><h4>What role does technology play for DDP Outdoor?</h4><p>Technology is changing everything so rapidly. From where we started five years ago, a vast amount has entered the country. We have been constantly shifting and adapting, and right now we are focused on migrating to digital platforms. There is a great deal of progression in this space. Of course, our progress may not be quite as fast as Europe or America; however, it is impressive for Ghana. We are trying to ensure that we introduce technologies at an optimum time for the market and for us, and have to balance the investment required with the expected potential upside. There is a lot of transformation occurring, and in the next two years we will see a lot more digital technology entering the market. We will use technology to increase quality in our local markets, expand our client base, and effectively manage the back-office processes. We deal with almost every type of advertising medium. Integrating new technologies will allow us to serve our customers in a more holistic fashion, improving their satisfaction and business, as well as our bottom line. </p><h4>How has your client base evolved over the last two years, and how do you project demand to develop?</h4><p>Our client base has been consistent. Telecoms have declined a bit, but their position is now improving and will bounce back in the near future. The beverage industry and finance sector have been improving, and compared to two years ago, there has been an increase of more than 200%. We have seen a general positivity in the market, and when our clients are positive about the broader economy, they are more willing to spend on advertising. The belief that the economy is going to grow is widespread these days, which positively impacts everyone. </p><h4>Are there any policies from the government that could enhance the advertising industry?</h4><p>It is a difficult to discuss limitations or opportunities for advertising in terms of government policy because advertising is often regulated at the municipal level. Obviously, we would like a situation where there is a reduction in the billboard clutter, because this gives value both to the client and to us. However, when clutter is allowed to continue, it diminishes the value we get from the media we offer. It also impacts our ability to invest. If the assemblies or municipalities can control the clutter, then the industry will improve. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the driver behind the merger that brought together Airtel and Tigo?</h4>
<p>The current telecoms market is among the 10% highest fragmented markets in Africa, and its structure has become a barrier to further development, undermining the economic sustainability of most players. Over the years, there have been calls by many stakeholders, including the government, for operators to consolidate in the market. The merger between Airtel and Tigo will help us provide business sustainability and utilize assets, thereby securing future investments in Ghana. The consolidation brings many benefits to all stakeholders: consumers, industry, and government. Certainly, the Ghanaian economy will gain from the more efficient use of scarce resources such as spectrum, and from higher levels of profitability among market players. Additionally, the industry dynamics will change, and the combined business will avoid the duplication of investment and will also be able to diversify investments into more innovative and advanced technology. Ultimately, Ghanaian consumers will enjoy superior coverage, quality of service, and mobile financial services, which is the core of our strategy. We seek to pursue growth through network coverage, quality of service, business solutions, and mobile financial services, among others. Through an efficient delivery of superior customer experience, high-speed data, innovative product mix, and wider geographic focus, the new combined business will be able to effectively compete in the market, thereby improving the competitive dynamics of the telecoms sector and, in the long term, strengthen the financial ecosystem.</p>
<h4>What is your assessment of the ICT market in Ghana and where do you see the major opportunities and challenges?</h4>
<p>Backed by extensive infrastructure investment, with an expansion of fiber providing a solid backbone to extend reach to communities, there has been strong growth in the ICT sector over the years, which ensured that Ghana develops and matures economically. Looking at the current climate, one of the major opportunities is powering, through the ICT sector, SME growth in the country. Within the digital economy, there is ample opportunity to transform and modernize many industries simply by improving productivity, sustainability, and competitiveness. Secondly, education has the potential to harness technology. To some extent, I have seen some initiatives in this area; however, they are in schools in major cities. There should be a collaborative effort between technology service providers and the government to enhance education in rural communities. The children in rural communities need to experience online learning&mdash;that is where the real magic happens for our future generations to become competitive. Third, there are millions of young people in Ghana who are digital users. Technology can offer new possibilities for them to become amazing influencers to promote the country and develop solutions to meet community's needs. Finally, there must be a more strategic partnership between the private and public sector to use ICT and tap into the enormous opportunities in the areas of agriculture, healthcare, tourism, and beyond. ICT presents massive opportunities for Ghana, but we must work together to take advantage of the opportunities. Despite the opportunities, there are challenges. There is a need to revise some of the sector's regulation to make it easier for mobile operators to grow the ICT sector. For example, we need technology neutrality in all spectrum bands to enable operators to provide high-quality internet. There is a lack of effective education to equip citizens with the basic knowledge to use and benefit from IT tools.</p>
<h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4>
<p>Our primary focus now is understanding our combined customers; their needs and expectations, ensuring a simple and hassle-free process. We have started a deep dive into this to create a strong emotional bond with customers. High-speed data consumption is increasingly on the rise. Mobile financial services will also become a key complement to traditional banking in expanding access to financial services in the country. We will actively pursue collaboration with the government and international development organizations to develop a range of mobile-based solutions to address a variety of social challenges facing Ghana. Policymakers play a pivotal role in defining the affordability of mobile services; in this regard, we want to see a flexible and fair regulatory environment, where customers will enjoy many more benefits from mobile operators. Regulatory frameworks also need to be designed to encourage, rather than curtail, investment. If mobile operators are unable to make a return on their investments, they will not be able to reinvest to build the infrastructure Ghana needs to create a vibrant digital economy. This is where tech neutrality is critical; we see that across the world and Ghana is unfortunately late to the table.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Wealth of Discovery]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-wealth-of-discovery]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the major recent highlights for Kosmos Energy?</h4><p>Kosmos created an industry for the country. Since it came in and discovered oil in 2007, the industry has gone from just a few hundred people to employing more than 7,000 today. The first discovery was Mahogany, which led to the partnership with Tullow, Anadarko, and Sabre Oil, whose interest was later acquired by Petro SA. With the support of Ghana National Petroleum Company and the Ghanaian government, the partnership developed the Jubilee Field, which produced first oil in 2010, followed by the Tweneboa, Enyenra, and Ntomme (TEN) field, which first produced oil in August 2016. At Kosmos, our core competency is exploration. Since our initial discovery offshore Ghana in 2007, we have expanded into several other countries along the Atlantic Margin. We have also made significant gas discoveries in both Senegal and Mauritania. With our development partner, BP, we are pursuing the Tortue LNG project, which will develop a world-class resource in both countries. We are expecting a final investment decision in 2018, with first gas expected in 2021.  We continue to explore offshore in Mauritania and Senegal, with plans to drill additional wells in both countries.  We also have a presence in Sío Tomé and carried out one of Kosmos' largest 3D seismic surveys in Sío Tomé in 2017. Our asset portfolio grew most recently through an agreement with Trident Energy to acquire an interest in three exploration licenses, as well as Hess Corporation's interest in the adjacent Ceiba and Okume oil fields offshore in Equatorial Guinea. All in all, Kosmos is in a great position and continues to expand its portfolio. </p><h4>What measures would you like to see from the Ghanaian government?</h4><p>We are grateful for the quick approval of the Greater Jubilee Full Field Development Plan, which will enable us to invest in the asset and eventually increase production for the benefit of Ghana. There remains considerable follow-on exploration potential offshore and our company, among others, would like to play a role in the next series of major oil and gas discoveries. For this next wave of exploration to take place in Ghana, for the next Jubilee field to be found, the industry and government will need to work together to negotiate mutually beneficial contracts that reflect the broader industrial context. This is the third straight year of lower oil prices, and a full recovery is still likely some time off.  Every project in the industry must compete for investment.</p><h4>What are the implications of the TEN field ruling on the upstream sector?</h4><p>They are quite significant. We had only drilled 11 wells out of a planned 24 in the TEN field. Everything was put on hold pending a final decision, and it was not good for the industry or the country. With the maritime boundary dispute between Ghana and Ivory Coast finally resolved and the approval of the Greater Jubilee Full Field Development Plan, we expect to re-start drilling in Ghana in early 2018, which will help us increase production at both fields.</p><h4>What lessons have you learned from the turret issue?</h4><p>We continue to emphasize the need to operate and maintain the floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) unit in accordance with international industry maintenance and integrity standards.  Our focus on preventive maintenance and monitoring critical components is essential to ensuring the long-term integrity of our facilities and systems. Finally, the FPSO is a complex facility and, like many similar production and storage units, there is a need to plan and ensure there is a robust and comprehensive insurance program in place. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>2018 will be a busy and exciting year. It will be busy because there is plenty to be done with the Greater Jubilee Full Field Development Plan now approved. We expect to complete the remediation of the turret and plan to drill wells at the TEN and Jubilee fields.  Kosmos and its partners plan to invest approximately USD1.5 billion in 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have operations evolved in the last few years?</h4><p>We are a 100% indigenous company that started from scratch. We have expanded from 15 employees to 280 currently. In 2016, we looked into expanding into the heavy lifts business, which we have done with the acquisition of equipment. Our hauler trailer, which was the first of its kind for a Ghanaian company, has been extremely successful for us. It came at a time when it was much needed, especially with the Eni 200-MW power generation plant, which required many heavy items. For this project, we work in collaboration with Fagioli, the forwarders and equipment handlers in Italy. It assessed our capabilities, and we have been working hand-in-hand with its expertise and our equipment. Our collaboration with Fagioli is an added incentive for us in heavy lifting, as clients understand we have something to offer.</p><h4>What is your strategy in terms of geographical expansion?</h4><p>Our goal is to expand into the West African region, and I hope 1Q2018 will see us fully stationed in Ivory Coast, where we have registered a company. Most of the clients that we serve locally also have projects in Ivory Coast, and we are doing a great deal of movement of equipment. We have started to make an impact with trucking. The next step, therefore, is to have an office. In 2018, we want to go into Burkina Faso. We are taking it one step at a time to have our presence felt in West Africa with the exception of Nigeria.</p><h4>What are the implications on your business of the Tema Port expansion?</h4><p>Every expansion means more cargo, and we will definitely have a piece of the action. The expansion will increase business by offering more capacity for storage. For a company like us, it is a win-win situation as competition in the region is stiff. Togo wants some of the cargo, and with this expansion, it will be attractive. The benefits will be enormous, and for Baj Freight, the expansion is welcome. We are the leaders in our country and we seek more business. We belong to a worldwide network and are members of BFN; once we are part of a network we are known around the world. We will receive direct contact from our network partners that ship items into Ghana for us to take the Ghana leg. We are extremely well positioned as we do significant oil and gas logistics with heavy lifts and power generation. To a large extent, we are selling ourselves and want to continue to grow our brand and raise exposure.</p><h4>Where are the largest opportunities in terms of the transport and logistics sector in Ghana?</h4><p>A few years ago we had issues with oil prices and the border dispute between Ghana and Ivory Coast, which slowed down many things. Now, with the border dispute resolved, we have all won because we resolved it through legitimate means. That opens the gates for more business. We had a client, Hess, which made a great find on the border and had to hold onto this asset until this time. It will come back now knowing that it has more work to do. The government has always said it wants to build up rail, which will allow us to move more products. We always have a shortage of trucks and staff, so there are positive things happening that bring more business to the company.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>We have a positive outlook for 2018 now that the border dispute is over. I see a great deal of activity starting from 2018, and we are starting to benefit from it. The economy has not picked up the way we expected; there was a great deal of talk before the elections, though things have been slow. However, there are great intentions from the government, and it should be able to do more for Ghana. The prospects are great. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Minister’s Mandates]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ministers-mandates]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your key priorities for the road transport service sector?</h4><p>The government has placed a heavy emphasis on improving the transportation system in the country. Our president wants Ghana to become the transportation hub of West Africa. He has a clear vision for the ministry, and we are doing our best to achieve that vision. As the Minister of Transport, I oversee two essential areas: overland transportation services and marine and waterway services. We are working hard to ensure that our maritime sector works extremely well. The president is also concerned by the rate of road accident deaths in the country, and we have been working with two other ministries on a new bill that aims to improve safety. Through this bill, the Ghana National Road Safety Commission will have the authority to enforce traffic laws that can support safe transport. We have also introduced the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, reducing congestion in our cities so that our mass transit systems can operate efficiently. We plan on rolling out the BRT system in certain cities by the end of 2017, working hand in hand with the local authorities.</p><h4>How would you characterize the developments made so far in the Tema Port development, and what do you seek to achieve through this major project?</h4><p>The marine industry is improving rapidly. More ships are docking at our ports, and there is a great deal of upward potential in terms of expansion. The government has allotted USD1.5 billion for the expansion of the port and is looking forward to seeing even more improvements in efficiency and volume. This project is being conducted in partnership with the private sector, and we are thrilled with what we have achieved thus far. By the end of 2019 or early 2020, we seek to be fully operational. Current statistics indicate that the turnaround time to claim goods from customs is around 104 hours, which is not something that we are proud of. Improving turnaround time is vital, because it will lower the cost of doing business and improve the profits of the entire sector. Our entire port infrastructure system is being considered for redevelopment, and such a comprehensive project could have vast positive implications for the sector. We believe strongly in including Ghanaian companies in this process; we cannot build the country without including Ghanaian know-how. We want to ensure our own people can take advantage of the changes and progress going on in the country.</p><h4>What the opportunities do you foresee through the One District, One Factory policy?</h4><p>We have a great many companies interested in coming to Ghana to help us achieve this policy. There are many factories being put up along the water systems in Ghana because these systems offer one of the most efficient means of transporting goods in the country. However, the transport sector and the broader economy require the strengthening of the automotive transport capabilities of the country. In addition, if we were to create an effective ferry system, this would improve transportation immensely, aiding in the success of the One District, One Factory policy. There are a number of Korean and Chinese companies that are prepared to invest these factories as well. They see agricultural processing facilities as being particularly valuable. Other companies, including some from Russia, are interested in operating in the automotive sector, and we have been in talks with them about developing assembly plants.</p><h4>What are the lines of cooperation between private companies and the government to boost the transport sector?</h4><p>Development in the transportation sector and the economy as a whole can best be achieved through partnerships with the private sector. It is the government's duty to develop regulations and policies that will allow the private sector to create important and valuable changes. The government is prepared to respect corporate rights and to create a system that supports business and growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Fixing the Fundamentals]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[fixing-the-fundamentals]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does AGI support the growth of industries in Ghana? </h4><p>AGI was established in 1958 as the Manufacturers Association of Ghana with just 10 enterprises. It grew quickly and, by 1984, had changed its scope and expanded to other industries. Today, AGI covers 22 different sectors in the Ghanaian economy, but core manufacturing activities are still the main one. Apart from our head office in Accra, we have six other offices in Tema, Takoradi, Kumasi, Sunyani, Tamale, and Ho. The key service of the association is evidence-based policy advocacy. Through our policy communications department, we collate sector views and concerns to then incorporate the findings into our proposition papers for government and policy makers. We also have some standard services such as the AGI business barometer survey through which we assess the mood of 500 companies on the business environment each quarter. </p><h4>How do you solve the situation of import dependency? <br></h4><p>If you want to solve the problem of imports you first have to fix the macroeconomic environment, stabilize the exchange rate, and adjust inflation to allow long-term business survival. The issue of finance is a major challenge since we are borrowing at a high cost; however, the treasury bills have been going down, which means the government will borrow less and banks have more choice to lend to the private sector, lowering interest rates. Second, the government also needs to reduce the cost of doing business to gain competitiveness and prevent foreign products from taking over local market share. The third step is focusing on SMEs, which are the bulk of our economy, to improve production to supply the market. In this sense, we offer business development services and have a department that provides services and links for SMEs to financial institutions and do export promotion. Once we do all this, then the idea is that the private sector should lead the effort to produce the goods the country needs and then encourage people to purchase them. </p><h4>What is your assessment of the One District, One Factory policy?</h4><p>It is a brilliant initiative since it encourages industrialization at a district level to help solve the problem of unemployment and reduce urban migration. We believe every district has the potential to do something. AGI can play a key role in encouraging its members to take the lead and establish the actual factories in the way the government expects them to. Through the agencies that work under the district assemblies, the government can identify the type of opportunities in the districts and the ways it can support businesses that want to build factories. That includes access to electricity, land, raw materials, and management. Since the initiative is not exclusive to local investors, at AGI we support and encourage foreign partnerships with local companies. On the one hand, foreign investors bring new technologies, expertise, and access to longer term cheap finance. On the other, indigenous companies know the local conditions, have a local network, and achieve the objectives much faster, so it works either way. </p><h4>How should regional trade be incentivized? </h4><p>Regional trade is key and is currently too low. Although ECOWAS conditions are much easier to satisfy than Europe, on average about 12-13% of our trade is regional, which is too low. Part of the problem is the nature of traded items, as local markets already have traditional raw materials such as gold and minerals. The potential is definitely there, but ECOWAS still needs to improve. In 2016, we had the introduction of a common external tariff, which is gradually taking shape. Some barriers need to be taken away, so we signed protocols to that effect. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What legacy would you like to leave as governor of the Bank of Ghana?</h4><p>I want to improve professionalism at the bank. This will drive the process of transforming the Central Bank into an excellent, world-class institution that is able to deliver its mandate of price stability. Without those conditions, we will not see Ghana reaching the high middle-income objectives. The Central Bank's role in that vision is critical. Our current framework of inflation targeting indirectly steers the economy to a low price regime by anchoring inflation expectations. In trying to make a monetary policy decision, we look at the execution of the government's budget and adherence to the fiscal consolidation process, the balance of payments, and the country's ability to build reserves and create buffers that drive exchange rate stability. All these feed into the decision of where to place the policy rate. In 2017, we lowered the monetary policy rate by cumulative 550 basis points to 20%, while lending rates declined by some 150 basis points. We expect banks to further lower lending rates as inflation continues to decline and bank balance sheets are cleaned up to provide added impetus to growth conditions.</p><h4>How do you seek to maintain the positive trajectory of considerable increases in the capital and financial accounts?</h4><p>The external payments position has shown resilience and improvements in the trade and current accounts balances in the first three quarters of 2017. We have seen the trade deficit turn around from USD1.82 billion in 2016 to a surplus of USD708 million in 2017. That was driven by significant improvements in export revenues from cocoa, gold, and oil. There was also a slight slowdown in imports. On net basis, the capital and financial accounts recorded positive inflows from FDI and portfolio inflows, which offset the current account balance, resulting in a balance of payment surplus of 0.8% of GDP. Moving forward, we expect oil production to increase in 2018. One can only expect it to positively impact our trade balance.</p><h4>What was the main driver of economic growth in Ghana in 2017?</h4><p>The issue of confidence is front and center. We started 2017 with a change of government and high expectations. There was a new economic policy package that boosted investor confidence both locally and foreign. A great deal of the growth we have seen thus far has been driven mainly by increased crude oil production. Non-oil growth has not been as high as anticipated, though once we resolve some of the issues in the banking sector and see an improvement in private sector credit, alongside implementation of government policy initiatives to boost manufacturing and agriculture, there will be a pick-up in non-oil growth as well. Growth and stability are not only important for investors internally, but external investors as well who might need to repatriate their interest and profits.</p><h4>What was the long-term strategy behind the new capital requirements for mergers and financial transactions?</h4><p>There was a constraint set by low levels of capitalization and the high inflation rate in the country for banks that are not able to finance any large transactions without a waiver from the Central Bank due to single exposure. The capitalization of banks has been quickly eroded by years of macroeconomic instability. If a business entity is not well capitalized, it is not attractive and things are riskier, even for banks. Strengthening a bank's capital makes it more attractive to other investors, especially those institutions that provide banks lines of credit. Going forward, if we are able to get these banks to have minimum capital of GHS400 million (USD90.7 million) by the end of 2018, they will be able to undertake transactions for activity in the oil, construction, and mining sectors without approaching the Central Bank for waivers. We want banks to be able to finance growth-enhancing infrastructure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major highlights of Nestlé's operations in the country?</h4><p>Nestlé started in the Central and West African Region through Ghana in October 1957. Nestlé Ghana, which is also responsible for Liberia and Sierra Leone, started in a trading capacity initially and evolved into the building of our factory in Tema in 1970 for evaporated milk and MILO®, to infant cereals and milk powder in 2010. Nestlé is the leading nutrition, health, and wellness company, so our customers are at the heart of everything we do. This is why we produce the lowest affordable sizes of different products. About 85% of what we produce in our factory in Tema is for local consumption, while 15% is exported to surrounding countries, such as evaporated milk to Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Cameroon, and MILO® to numerous countries. We also produce infant cereal, such as CERELAC® maize, rice, millet, and wheat, not only for Ghana but also for the rest of Central and West Africa with the exception of Nigeria. Maize and rice are sourced locally, while wheat and millet are imported. We also import less than 20% of what we sell locally. These are primarily items such as NESCAFE® and MAGGI® from Ivory Coast and infant formula, though the rest of our products are manufactured locally.</p><h4>What are some of the distribution challenges in Ghana?</h4><p>Today, we can only transport our products to our distributors across the country by road, as the railway network in Ghana is not developed. At times, it can take a transporter two to three days to deliver goods from the factory to Tamale. As safety and quality are non-negotiable priorities for us at Nestlé, we always ensure that the whole value chain in Ghana and across the region adheres to best distribution practices. We believe there is a need to develop an efficient railway network, which will be extremely beneficial to distribution for the manufacturing sector.</p><h4>What achievements are you most proud of?</h4><p>I am proud of Nestlé's contribution to the nutrition, health, and wellness of the people of Ghana for 60 years and counting. Today, through our brands, Nestlé's presence is significantly felt throughout each day in the life of a person. Additionally, through the company's Creating Shared Value (CSV) concept, Nestlé is fulfilling its purpose of “Enhancing Quality of life and Contributing to a Healthier Future" by supporting key stakeholders along its value chain in the areas of nutrition, water, and rural development. Through our CSV concept, when we started producing CERELAC® for instance, we had a 55-60% rejection rate of locally sourced maize due to high contamination of aflatoxin. We launched the Nestlé Cereal Plan in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture through a World Bank project called Northern Rural Growth Program (NRGP). We helped build capacity of farmers through extensive training in best agricultural practices. Currently working with the USAID-ADVANCE, through the Nestlé Cereal Plan, we have trained over 55,000 farmers and aggregators on agro-economic, post-harvest protocols, and good storage practices. Today, we have reduced rejection rate from almost 60% to less than 5%.</p><h4>Where do you see the greatest opportunities in the agribusiness sector in Ghana?</h4><p>The first thing is moving toward mechanical farming. Subsistence farming makes it difficult for manufacturing, yield forecasting, and quality control. Technology will allow farms to have the scale and mechanized farming that we see in countries like South Africa. We also need to make agri-business attractive to the youth through capacity building and transfer of knowledge. Another aspect is irrigation, as we tend to rely almost completely on natural rain patterns for farming, making the entire process more expensive due to lower production. The last one is the logistics of harvesting and bringing the crops to be processed for sale. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have operations evolved since 2015, and what are your plans for the near future?</h4><p>We continue to improve, and we are still on track to meet our goals. We have a large marketing strategy that will be executed in the next three to eight years. Our plan is to expand, be more focused on export processes, and consolidate our share of the market using the best technology in flour milling. We seek to increase our flour mill's capacity and expand our market both through exports and new warehouses as soon as we get approval from shareholders. We cannot limit ourselves to merely reacting to what happens around us, especially now that the market is not as quick as it was before, and there is a great deal of payment delay and lack of credit return. To remain proactive, a company has to expand and look beyond the country.</p><h4>What are the main challenges facing players in today's market?</h4><p>There needs to be stronger communications between the government and the private sector in order to address major issues. Moreover, an investor needs to know where to allocate funds and what the risks are. They need data to make the best decisions. To do so, they need to invest in technology and people, and not just machinery and cars.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the agri-business market in Ghana, and what opportunities do you see for investors?</h4><p>It is a saturated market, with perhaps five companies competing for business, though this is a positive aspect. There are four active flour mills in Ghana, and there are those that import flour from outside. However, we need data to assess how much all companies contribute to the economy, both in terms of taxes and employment. We should not look at things on a small scale and should be more ambitious. Ghana lacks nothing. Many investors come here because they love the country and the opportunities that are available. But these investors need data, because without data how can the economy move? We have to talk about action and the best way to measure if a company is doing well or not is a standardized objective measurement.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>The vision of the government is excellent, and it wants to see light at the end of the tunnel. I have confidence; however, it needs to have committed people on the ground to implement its vision. It needs to open communication channels. If we build capacity and build people, I expect good things for 2018, for example with the streamlining of operations in the harbor. The Ghana Revenue Authority should do an excellent job with more revenue to be generated, and the private sector will try as much as possible to support, not burden, the financial sector. If we want to help, we have to generate our own money as well from our export proceedings. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major highlights in the past couple of years?</h4><p>The major achievement for the university campus in Accra has been graduating our first class of graduates in September 2017. We are rapidly becoming the university of choice for international students coming to Ghana with a substantial number of students from all over West Africa. Additionally, we are rapidly establishing a profile as a leading research university in Ghana. A joint bid from Lancaster UK and Lancaster Ghana won a multimillion-pound grant from the Global Challenge Research Fund (GCRF). This is built around managing water resources and developing local capacity in West Africa. We are also developing the research profile of our Ghana-based staff. Lancaster University in Ghana is a partnership between Transnational Academic Group (TAG) and Lancaster University, UK. The partnership is a core part of Lancaster University's international strategy but also meets its strategy for teaching and research excellence as well as engagement. In the 2018 Sunday Times ranking, Lancaster University moved from ninth to sixth place in the rankings and also won the coveted award for University of the Year 2018.</p><h4>What measures do you expect from the Ghanaian government?<br></h4><p>The Ghanaian government has been supportive of our campus in Accra and sees the value of campus development as it reaffirms its commitment to make Ghana an education hub. We hope to see support from the government regarding taxation and infrastructure support in the future as well as working together with the private sector to meet the burgeoning population of students who will graduate from high school in the years to come as well as work together on delivering more STEM courses in the market. One of the problems with traditional universities is that they are slow to respond to shifts in the market. Ghana has a traditional university sector that is desperately under funded. Public universities in Ghana turn away as many as 25,000 highly qualified candidates because of a lack of capacity. Funding remains a persistent difficulty for all public institutions and private institutions in Ghana. Apart from some regionally targeted funds, the bulk is allocated to primary and secondary schools. Interestingly, Ghana has moved to fully fund secondary education in Ghana. In three years, that means a further surge in demand for university places. There is a huge demand for infrastructural investment in education but the question is how do we go about securing it? The Ghanaian government will need to be innovative in how it develops a high-quality university sector. There is a large number of students enrolled in private universities in Ghana. The partnership between TAG and Lancaster University is an innovative approach for the private sector to participate and support the need for high-quality private providers in Ghana.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>We expect the economy in Ghana and Nigeria to be more robust compared to 2017. There are strong GDP numbers being projected for the region. We will outlay significant capital for our new campus project that will allow us to expand our course offering. We are currently sitting at around 550 students and hope to grow north of 700 students by year end and then proceed to getting closer to 1,000 students for the new campus. We are continuing to push our recruitment beyond Ghana to include Nigeria, Ivory Coast, and Senegal. The new government's commitments to the education sector should hopefully be passed as well. We are optimistic for the campus development in Ghana, hence the investment being committed by our shareholders. We will also commence marketing and recruiting for new degree offerings whose first-year intake will be in 2018 and 2019. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your effort to reduce communicable diseases progressed in the past two years?</h4><p>When I took office in 2015, the country had already made considerable progress in dealing with communicable diseases, especially neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. For example, there had been a gradual increase in the number of people with HIV put on treatment. Malaria cases have gone down considerably across all age groups. Progress continues against TB as well. We have to continue making progress in responding to these diseases if we are to attain the associated Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets. If we take HIV, for example, we hope that by 2020 to have put 90% of HIV patients in the country on treatment to ensure we remain on course for ending the HIV epidemic by 2030. As of 2016, we were at 34%. This means we still have a long way to go and, thus, must intensify our efforts to address communicable diseases. These goals can only be achieved with the collaboration of all stakeholders including governments, the private sector, NGOs, civil society, and development partners.</p><h4>Which WHO guidelines are improving healthcare for mental disorders in Ghana?</h4><p>Over the years, the global focus on health in low to medium-income countries has been on communicable diseases, and in many instances rightly so. However, our estimates indicate that by 2030 non-communicable diseases including mental health disorders will exceed communicable diseases in terms of burden of disease. WHO has developed guidelines on improving mental health, including the Global Mental Health Action Plan for 2013-2020. This has clear objectives and actions for member states to implement. In addition to that, WHO has developed a mental health gap action program to address the gap between the magnitude of mental health disorders and the capacities of health systems. One of the major issues is the lack of specialized psychiatric care at the district and community levels.</p><h4>What is the best strategy to ensure health insurance gains?</h4><p>One of the major priorities of WHO is universal health coverage (UHC), ensuring that all people have access to high-quality health services they need without facing financial hardship. Defining the services and health needs of people should be done, but this should come with financing mechanisms that ensure people receive the care they need. Proper strategies for financing health would allow us to do this, and national health insurance schemes like the one that has been designed for Ghana is one of the best mechanisms for ensuring that this happens. I have visited a number of districts and regions and learned that the national health insurance scheme (NHIS) is critical to health service delivery in Ghana. The government's current efforts to improve the scheme are extremely valuable and totally necessary in order to maximize the benefits. If we improve health service delivery, then we can improve health outcomes all across the country. Digital technology in health will also be extremely critical in the attainment of universal health coverage. Telemedicine, for example, would allow highly qualified specialists to provide advice and guidance for the care of patients across the country. Digital technology in health is something that we must pursue to attain UHC.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>The government is finalizing the national medium-term development plan for health, the UN is finalizing its Sustainable Development Program for Ghana, and we are developing our country cooperation strategy for health that defines our priorities moving forward. 2018 will be a critical year to implement this strategy in order to firmly position ourselves on the road toward achieving our health goals in relation to SDGs. Additionally, 2018 will be critical for strengthening our capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to public health emergencies in a timely manner. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dr-ibukun-jegede-group-ceo-aniibol-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to the formation of Aniibol Group?</h4><p>Aniibol Group started in 2012 after I finished my master's degree in the UK. I did a consultancy projects for Samsung during my MSc degree which I obtained a first-class/distinction. At that time, I was a successful model in the UK with over 64 international awards, but I wanted to switch careers after spending 10 years in the industry. I started a consultancy business in the UK, which is now Aniibol Group UK. From there, I came to Nigeria because I am a proud Nigerian and I knew there was a gap in the market from my visits on multiple occasions. There are some operational activities in the country that I do like, however, on the other hand, customer service was very poor. That is what prompted me to come to Nigeria and work on filling that gap. I thought that I could also help the Nigerian government by also reducing unemployment rate in the country. I came to Nigeria to start up a branch here, which has now been running for five years. Having been in the UK for several years, coming to Nigeria was a huge change and I found it hard to adapt but with God's grace, I am standing strong today. I did not receive any support from the government. This is in contrast with what happens in the UK, where the government, or perhaps even your university, supports you fully.</p><h4>What does the company offer its clients today?</h4><p>We started off by offering management consulting, for example, if a company is experiencing an internal and external issues, we analyze that and critically determined what the problem is. Then we come up with a suitable recommendation which will be beneficial to them on a long run. We help businesses grow and we always say the truth to our clients. We are bold enough to tell our client why their current strategy is not working and what they could do to re-strategize and improve their services or reach their goals. However, in 2014, we had to re-strategize. We realized there were other services we needed to offer to complement the economy and please our customers. From consulting, we started corporate and professional training. We also set up an agricultural firm. In addition, we offer IT solutions such as installation of hardware, mobile apps and websites development. We diversified into real estate as well.</p><h4>How do you compete with other companies in Nigeria that offer similar consulting services, such as KPMG?</h4><p>KMPG started the same way we did. It started small and worked hard to get to where it is today. I try as much as possible to focus on our lane and work as hard as possible to get to where some of the larger companies already are. Everybody can't afford the bills of larger companies, that is why we are in operation to give the same quality of service with a lower cost. Our customer services are one of our strength. Our slogan in our company is “Our Clients are our Priority," which means that without our clients, we would not function. We make sure that any client who comes in, with a doubt, leaves with a smiling face.</p><h4>Have you set any targets for 2018?</h4><p>We are looking at expanding our businesses in other developing countries. We have been deeply involved in doing research in 2017, looking toward diversification. By late 2018, we hope to dive into and begin operating in a new country, possibly the US.</p><h4>How would you assess the business environment in Nigeria?</h4><p>I would commend the government so far for a job well done. On the other hand, supporting small-scale businesses and entrepreneurs is key. When the company started when I was 25 years old, I went to university in the UK and shared my ideas with them, and most of my tutors were very much interested. They told me if I wanted to start a business, they would offer me a little space to start up. The university gives office space for entrepreneurs with good ideas without no cost at the initial start of the business, then, the business agrees to give 2-3% of the net profit of the business at the end of the year to the university, which is not going to hurt a new business. It tries as much as it can to support small-scale businesses. That is not the case in Nigeria, and it is a major issue. People keep complaining about unemployment, and as far as I am concerned, Nigerians have the entrepreneurial spirit. Helping such people could make a huge difference in the country. That is what the government should focus on. Secondly, customer service needs to be revamped. It is one of the big issues in Nigeria. The country as a whole needs to change its mentality from giving successful people more respect. Currently, there is a general lack of equality when it comes to customer service. It may be hard to change the mentality because it is so ingrained in the system, but hopefully in the near future we will begin to see change. Thirdly is power. I believe it is one of the major problem in the country. I strongly believe, if power is sorted out, lot of investor and businesses would do well and things will fall into place such as unemployment rate. Finally, in terms of agriculture, the government needs to look at investing in people in 2018. Gradually, I believe we can do it as a nation by the grace of God Almighty.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>The government is getting there, but it needs to improve the economy so that businesses such as ours can grow faster. Most importantly, we should see more support of SMEs in 2018. It is so difficult for an SME to go into a bank today and get financing without collateral. There could be a university graduate with a good idea, but it may not mean anything if he or she does not have a start up fund to implement such ideas. There are so many cases online of young people who create new ideas but do not get the support to carry on. If they have that support, Nigeria could be a country that should be manufacturing cars, for example. Once we support more local and innovative ideas, the country could become more self-sufficient, and prices would drop. Once we have a lot of entrepreneurs and they are being supported, exporting goods outside of the country could start to really take off, like it has in China. The blunt truth is even the UK and the US buy from China. It would be amazing if someday everyone wants a Nigerian brand. As for Aniibol, I feel positive about 2018. I believe in my dreams, no matter what anyone tells me and the difficulties that may arise. For the last couple of years, things have been difficult, but now we are growing gradually and I can see great changes. The company is investing in several sectors, and I see 2018 in a positive light.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your priorities as the new Minister of Tourism, Culture, and Arts in Ghana?</h4><p>The tourism sector is what we call the rough diamond of Ghana. We are blessed with the new administration's vision to promote tourism as one of the economic pillars for growth, job creation, and diplomacy. There are three priority areas we are working around the clock on to realize its potential. The first critical one is hospitality training. The entire nation sees tourism as a viable economic activity; however, we need skilled personnel in that sector to promote service. The manifesto of the New Patriotic Party had specifically stated that we will build a state-of-the-art hospitality training school with with five satellite campuses modelled on international best practices. The second priority is the development of the creative arts. We have many business hotels, though no leisure hotels for tourists. We have also embarked on an ambitious project to construct affordable, elegant hotels across the country to showcase the ethnic handicrafts, arts, and décor of Ghana. We have registered the patented name as GH Akwaaba Hotels, and these will seek private partnerships because growth is built via the private sector. The third and final priority area is Marine Drive, a project that has been on the drawing board for 60 years. When it takes off, 241 acres of coastline will be developed to house hotels, boardwalk, marina, cruise ships, and theaters. It will be a designated tourism enclave that will take off between October and December. These are the three main projects, though there are others that were halted as a result of these three developments we are focusing on.</p><h4>How does the ministry plan to enhance the agricultural sector?</h4><p>The first month I took office, we ambitiously started a project called See Ghana, Eat Ghana, Wear Ghana, which spells the word sew and indirectly promotes fashion of the Ghanaian culture and fabrics. Eat Ghana ties in directly with agriculture because we encourage the hotels to promote Ghanaian cuisine, thereby promoting homegrown produce such as tomatoes, peppers, and cocoyams from Ghana. Everything that is grown in Ghana can be served western style at our five-star hotels. Ghana is the second-largest producer of cocoa in the world next to the Ivory Coast, and we want to promote cocoa consumption and its health benefits. This will indirectly benefit farmers, our government, and GDP. We will also build a cocoa museum; plans have been drawn up and we are now awaiting financing.</p><h4>What were the highlights of the 2017 World Tourism Forum?</h4><p>That is one of the biggest selling points for Ghana; MICE is big business, and Ghana is strategically positioned in the ECOWAS zone. The World Tourism Forum was a platform to share with investors from all around the world what Ghana has to offer, and they were overwhelmed by the hospitality. It was the first-ever summit in Africa, and we were chosen over other large tourist countries on the continent. With the collaboration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior, we will work with the Vice President's office to ensure that e-visa becomes a reality to improve tourism traffic. One of the projects that links in with our top three is an iconic building to tell the world that Ghana is the center of the world since we have the longitude and latitude of 000.</p><h4>How are you working to make entry easier?</h4><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is working tirelessly on this such that hopefully by 2018 Ghana should be seen as a country where e-visa is available, and that will improve tourism traffic. Also,  the airport expansion is a major boost, and we are working with the Ministry of Aviation to make sure there are more terminals and more flights. We only have 34 international airlines coming into Ghana and it could be 50. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Saudi VAT tax and the property market]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[mowaffaq-al-hashimi-executive-chairman-saqifat-al-safa]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has changed for Saqifat al Safa over the past three quarters?</h4><p>A lot; the market has started to reshape itself with all the changes that government has made. They have started initiating the VAT tax, and the initiation of the program was sudden since none of our calculations for our projects were based on VAT. However, we support the concept, and it is about time the government starts to move away from oil-generated income to taxes and service fees. I anticipate that this will be for the better of society, but on the other hand some changes in labor laws and fees have also affected the market. Everything that is happening is the foundation for going forward on the 2020 and 2030 vision of the Kingdom. We are happy it is being done; it is not just a vision but a vision being put into practice.</p><h4>You spoke about a policy made in 2013 that stopped a large number of people from taking out new loans to buy property. Has this policy changed?</h4><p>I wrote to the Crown Prince and asked him to look into it again to allow people to buy properties. To my amazement, the first time I wrote HRH the Crown Prince they responded apparently to my suggestion. I recommended that the government pay the interest for a SAR500,000 loan so that consumers can buy housing on the open market. They subsidize the loans rather than the buildings and let the market work its way through. In just a few months, they put up a whole system and are rushing to the banks trying to get a loan.</p><h4>What is this program called?</h4><p>They call it the expedited loan. You apply, they send you to a bank, you get your loan to buy you house or apartment, and they pay your interest up to half a million for the whole term; that was my recommendation. I was enthused by this undertaking, which drove me to write about letting people buy properties during the waiting phase for the King Abdullah Loans, and when their term comes up they get the loan. It is just a methodology to increase the turnover of sales. In late 2016, the total turnover was SAR436 billion in property per annum, and when they started this land and loan program the volume of turnover started to decline by an average of SAR70 billion per year. In 2018, I expect it to have fallen by approximately 70% to SAR175 billion, so prices have not fallen as much as the volume of trade has. That is healthy because the prices here in real estate have tripled between 2009 and 2012 Kingdom wide. We did a correlation for it and found that it is panic money going to real estate because oil prices were not increasing, while food and other consumer goods were. Therefore, we did a correlation study to find out why the value of property was going up so fast. We discovered that after the global lending crisis in 2008 the confidence in shares and financial instruments went down a lot and everybody started to buy gold. Gold prices went up to 2000 dollars an ounce globally. However, in Saudi Arabia the increase was in real estate because we do not really trade gold due to Zakat, the religious tax on gold and reserve cash. Hence, a vast price increase happened, and the market needed to correct itself. We are developers and look more into continuity, longevity, and the benefits to be reaped from consistency. We are not disappointed with the situation, and the less expensive the value of land, the better for our children and grandchildren.</p><h4>Are you being consulted about changes that may affect your sector?</h4><p>When the land fees structure was created we were consulted, but of course, it is a big change. I am proud of the system. The land fee structure is something I have been calling for since 2006. This controls the value of land and defies the incredible increases or price hikes that happen where people use land as a commodity. Land is not a commodity; it is something where you breed solutions for society in terms of housing, agriculture, and administrations. You do not use it for trade; you can use a small land parcel for trade but nothing tremendous. Hence, regulation is serving and it is wiser, quicker, and the results show much faster.</p><h4>Have you seen an impact already?</h4><p>There has definitely been an impact. Out of fairness, the tax they ascribed according to the structure we recommended is perfect. If your land does not have sewage networks, water networks, electric power generation, police services, fire brigade, or civil defense within its immediate vicinity, they are exempt 5%. So if your parcel has a neighboring parcel that is SAR1,000 per sqm and has all these services and you have none, you are probably exempt 85-90%, which is only fair. </p><h4>Have landowners turned to developers to do this yet? </h4><p>Not yet. That was supposed to be the case but there are only 2,400 people in the first phase of the land fees, and phase one targets undeveloped parcels that are 10,000 sqm or more. This means that in phase one there will only 2,400 applicable parcels, whereas in Phase II 10,000 sqm of developed land will be included and is meant to start in 18 months.<br></p><h4>What are your plans for the year ahead and your expectations for the market?</h4><p>We are in the property management business as well so are focusing on that field for the time being. We are still in the market and have this development that we are going to start selling soon. This is going to play a major role in funding our expenses in terms of our investment and benefitting from our investment. Prices have fallen sharply, but we are attempting to sell this development within acceptable market prices, lest it not sell. Therefore, this is a big sales program worth about SAR6 billion in land. Hopefully we start within the next month or two selling. One parcel will house a shopping mall, six hotels, and two office towers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief overview of your different activities and the synergies between them?</h4><p>Wisynco Group celebrated 50 years in 2015. It is completely a Jamaican and family-owned company, and it has a number of subsidiaries. We are making changes in terms of the structure, and the company plans to list on the stock exchange soon. This will, perhaps, be the largest listing on a local stock exchange in the country's history. The primary part of the business and the majority of it is distribution and manufacturing; we produce beverages and plastic disposables in two factories and also have three subsidiaries. In addition to producing our own brands, we also manage on a third-party basis brands such as Red Bull, General Mills, Kellogg's, and more. In total, including our subsidiaries, we have over 3,500 employees, the majority of which are in the main distribution and manufacturing company. The main business is quite diverse and locally manufactured products make up more than 70%. Our other main business is distribution; we have the widest coverage and distribution network in the country. We service around 13,000 customers with a sales team of almost 700 people, and our penetration in small outlets with all these brands and products is difficult to compete against. Virtually our entire production is produced, finished, and distributed by us.</p><h4>To what extent is protecting the environment a key part of your operations?</h4><p>A large focus for us as a company is environmental sustainability, and because we are the largest producers of plastic in the country, this is an issue that we take seriously. Historically, we have also driven the whole environmental view of plastics, recycling, and so on. However, we need more support from the government on this area. There is a global standard that Coca-Cola has that we have to comply with as a Coca-Cola bottler: by 2020, we have to be able to put back every drop of water in the ecosystem that we take out, and there cannot be any waste of water at all. Similar to these, there are global standards for environmental waste, energy, and so on that we are moving toward.</p><h4>Can you also elaborate on your operations outside of Jamaica?</h4><p>We have primarily distribution partners, and our main export markets outside of Jamaica are the UK and US. We also have essentially full regional coverage in most of the markets, except the Dominican Republic. From time to time, we sell in Central America, though our main markets in the Caribbean are the English-speaking territories for a number of reasons such as laws, competitive issues, and language; we do not have a great record dealing with Spanish-speaking markets.</p><h4>Are international markets something that you would like to develop?</h4><p>From our plan to list on the stock exchange, we are raising capital to expand our local production to increase exports. We are new on the beverage side of the business. Over time, we have continued to expand and increase capacity, and every time we put in additional capacity, the local market has absorbed it and we just could not build enough scale to get a real export market going. We are doing a major expansion, and this will be the single-largest capital investment the company has ever made. We completed a warehouse and have added an additional 12,000sqm to the original building and have about 1,500sqm of offices as well. We are also putting in about 3,000sqm of storage facilities to increase our distribution capacity. This will be by far the largest facility in the English-speaking Caribbean. The next expansion will come in part from the proceeds of the listing on the stock exchange, and also some debt. That will give us an additional 30-40% increase in capacity in the next two years, and we hope to expand into the international markets on a bigger scale from that. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Rumming Up Business]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[rumming-up-business]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>NRJ owns iconic distilleries in Jamaica; how do you plan to leverage these assets?</h4><p>NRJ is comprised of the Long Pond Distillery, the Clarendon Distillery, and Innswood Distillers Limited. Among those three facilities, we make some of the finest rums, for which we have won several awards. The rum fermentation process is unique and cannot be replicated due to the local environment and many other indigenous properties such as yeast, water, wood, and materials, so we are unique in each facility. We produce some of the finest and most exotic rums in this hemisphere and recently started a more precise marketing drive in Europe and Canada, and are working to establish ourselves in the US. We are also in conversations with potential customers in the Caribbean, Latin America, and China. Bulk rum represents around 90% of our business, and we produce rum and ship the product in containers to other major distilleries, where it is re-blended and bottled. We are in the process of moving our business more in that direction to capture a piece of that higher-value market.</p><h4>What changes in strategy are you implementing as the head of NRJ?</h4><p>Part of my mandate is to take us along the branded route in a more substantial way, widening our footprint in Jamaica and internationally. We want to prove to our customers that we also have an excellent finished product they can enjoy. We have five expressions: top-of-the-line Special Reserve, Classic Gold rum, Special Gold rum, White Overproof rum, and Whispering Breeze. We also have aged stock up to 15 years old, as markets are changing and people place great value in aged premium rum. The idea is to expand even further and create more blends. One of our major achievements in 2017 was the re-opening of the Long Pond distillery after a four-year closure; in the Clarendon distillery, we can process 12 million liters per annum whilst in Long Pond we can produce 1 million liters of alcohol per annum. We have worked hard with the regulators and stakeholders to ensure that the Long Pond distillery could be re-opened in July, and it has allowed us to re-engage customers in Germany and other parts of the world.</p><h4>What are the challenges and opportunities of producing rum in Jamaica?</h4><p>One major challenge is the issue of authenticity; companies place a little rum in a final product and claim it is from Jamaica. We are a part of the Spirits Pool Association and the West Indies Rum and Spirits Producers Organization, and they assist in classifying what is called rum from all perspectives, including a geographic value indicator. Rum has evolved into a real industry, and certain rules and regulations have to be placed around the industry to protect it. Jamaican rums are sought after in international markets, and there is an opportunity as a country to establish ourselves in a more macroeconomic way, enlisting government support in terms of simplifying tariffs, duty structure, and how rum is dealt with in general. We do not sell much of our products locally because we are only 3 million people. There are several billion consumers across the globe, and that is the market we should be looking at, rather than focusing on the local market.</p><h4>What are your goals and objectives for the coming year?</h4><p>If I can achieve an increase in our branded rum business from 10 to 20%, then half of my job is done, because it is a higher value chain. That is one of our main goals for the coming year. Currently, we outsource our bottling, and the plan is for us to do that in-house in a few years' time when we reach the right critical mass. That would mean an expansion and hiring more staff. We as a team need our excellence to permeate every aspect of our business, and we encourage that sentiment in the company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you help the coffee industry in Jamaica grow?</h4><p>The Coffee Industry Board has been the regulatory agency for the industry here for more than 50 years. We work the entire value chain, from seed selection, producing the material, and quality assurance; we take custody of the product and handle the shipment arrangements, provide the licensing and ensure that we build equity in the world's best brand of coffee, Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee, and its close rival, Jamaican High Mountain Coffee.</p><h4>The Blue Mountain Coffee brand is strong internationally. How do you promote the High Mountain brand?</h4><p>They both have unique attributes; however, Blue Mountain, by virtue of its unique location and careful selection of materials, communicates a different kind of attribute in the marketplace. Still, there will be consumers for both, with Blue Mountain at the higher end of the marketplace and High Mountain in the next tier, which rivals products like Kona from Hawaii.</p><h4>Can you tell us about plans your for diversifying markets for Jamaican coffee?</h4><p>The Jamaican coffee supply will always be relatively small in the global context, so we will work to retain that special boutique appeal in the marketplace. We target the higher end of the coffee market, which is generally small and specialized. Japan has been a traditional player on the demand side for Blue Mountain Coffee, a longstanding relationship the entire industry and board appreciates. What has happened is not a reduction of demand in Japan per se, but a pricing issue since supply constraints in Jamaica resulted in higher prices of our product in Japan. However, we also need to diversify our effort into other markets, and the board has been proactive in supporting producers and processors in Jamaica to source markets in the US and Europe. We are promoting companies in those markets to acquire licenses to handle the brand in these regions and make strong inroads with large corporations in the US.</p><h4>How does it also relate to the blending regulation?</h4><p>We try to work in the industry to ensure that Jamaican manufacturers and exporters can position their products at the correct price points to appeal to their market segments. The board retains that flexibility, even though we impose a minimum requirement on blends. Once we fulfill this, we encourage entrepreneurship to move forward and use their own innovation to create blending products that appeal to consumers.</p><h4>Do you want to develop tourism around the fact that this is one of the best coffee-producing places in the world?</h4><p>We have been contemplating that to a certain degree. For example, people who hike in the Blue Mountains and enjoy the coffee, climate conditions, cultural practices, and traditions that go into it are interested in that element of ecotourism, which we hope to expand. However, the board is also conscious that this is a fragile ecological zone. The sustainability essential to ecotourism must be managed in a particular way. Just as the coffee is boutique, so must the ecotourism.</p><h4>How do you target tourists coming to Jamaica?</h4><p>We take a differentiated approach inside hotels, where we expose guests to Blue Mountain and High Mountain Coffee and provide the opportunity for it to be distributed in specialty stores inside the hotels. We are also trying to get coffee festivals in the hotels to expose tourists to the 100% pure variants of our coffees rather than merely the blends they find in the store.</p><h4>Is there still room for quantitative growth in the coffee supply?</h4><p>Our forecast is that demand will generate our supply in Jamaica. Given our size, we will never be a large producer. However, if the product is appropriately positioned, we could easily increase production by 80 or 90% without having any adverse effect on prices. There is room for us to significantly increase production without negative repercussions in the marketplace, though we will never be a large player like Brazil. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the vision behind Lifespan?</h4><p><span></span>NAYANA WILLIAMS We started Lifespan 12 and a half years ago in Portland, Jamaica after we returned from the US. We did our research and found that water was a natural resource available in abundance in Portland; however, it was not being adequately distributed. We decided to take advantage of that market and established Lifespan, also with the objective of assisting the local community and creating jobs. There was no concept like ours in Jamaica. The water we sourced was naturally alkaline, which no one else had. We decided to capitalize on this—that is how we marketed our brand.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see to further develop your business?</h4><p><span></span>NW Currently, our bottled water is not as widely distributed as we would like. This has to do with our production capacity being restricted by our equipment and space. However, we do have land space of over 40 acres and about seven springs. One of our springs has a flow rate of over 1,000 gallons of water per minute. Lifespan has been growing organically since we started the company. Now we are at the point where we satisfy the market and do some exports, though we want to go at it on a larger scale. This would mean getting an investor or going public.</p><h4>What is Lifespan's current market share?</h4><p><span></span>NW We are at about 30% of the local market. Over the last five years we have grown over 4,000%. We can still grow organically. But to get to the point where we can really market outside Jamaica on a larger scale, we definitely need a capital injection. We currently export to a few Caribbean islands; however, I see where we can get into the US and other Latin American countries. Another possibility is Europe and the Middle East, which are ripe for products such as ours.</p><h4>What is Lifespan's unique selling point compared to other international bottled water brands?</h4><p><span></span>Devon Williams The island of Jamaica is pure and entirely green. That is a big plus for us. Our water source is as perfect as it can be. Therefore, we do not do a lot of processing. Also, having naturally alkaline water is very rare. Importantly, we are close to a harbor, just 18 miles away, an asphalt road, and located at the base of the mountain. We are easily accessible.</p><h4>Do you partner with the government to promote a healthier lifestyle in Jamaica?</h4><p>NW We try to do this with every opportunity we get. Lifespan is a great example of a healthy product, which many others cannot claim. We work with the Ministry of Health; we partner in health fairs and fun-runs; we organize the annual 007 swimming competition; and in 2017 we invited several Olympians to participate. We promote sports tourism in Jamaica and have aligned our brand with that.<br></p><h4>What are your current projects at Lifespan?</h4><p><span></span>DW At present, we are about to move into the five-gallon business on a larger scale and want to double our income from this segment in 2018. We employ over 100 people and will expand our warehouse space by 14,000sqft. We are also installing solar energy. We will be hooked up to the net billing system. Having solar will also help greatly with our downtime because to complement the system we are putting in a generator to run the plant if the power goes out.</p><h4>What target do you have for external funding to expand Lifespan's operations?</h4><p><span></span>NW We are considering putting up at least 20% of the company in 2018 to raise USD5 million in investment, so we can carry out our expansion plans. However, at the moment, we are still assessing the options. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Innovation-based Economy]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jorge-portugal-general-manager-cotec-portugal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance on innovation in the Portuguese economy?</h4><p>COTEC is framed upon the vision that our economy has been through a transformation from low-skilled production toward the opening of our markets, transitioning to an economy based on innovation, variety, small batches, and high speed. As a result of innovation, companies have acquired new knowledge and developed more technologically advanced products. One of the key capabilities necessary to move into a different business model is to be able to manage innovation processes, and this is where COTEC comes in. We frame capability into several pillars: alignment between the market strategy and innovation strategy, human resources, culture, new knowledge sourcing, project management, open collaborative networks, funding and the protection of industrial property at a time of stronger value integration. User protection is critical now that one is sharing information with their customers and clients. Protecting one's know-how is the ultimate means of boosting one's competitiveness. We are focused on this key issue that companies face when they integrate more closely with clients.</p><h4>What are COTEC's key objectives?</h4><p>For us, one of the key aims is to generate open innovation and collaborative networks. Many companies improve their production lines and value chains, though they do not work with outside external partners. Some already source knowledge from universities, though not yet from business peers. COTEC is a network that brings companies together. We are not focused on any sector or specific level of company development. From the outset we looked to create synergies between SMEs and large companies as a key mechanism for promoting economic growth. We now see a growing interest from larger companies to address the innovation problems they need to solve, and they believe interaction with SMEs with specific skills from other sectors may bring in additional expertise that can help. Working with the government also plays a major role, and Industry 4.0 is a great example of identifying innovation barriers to be overcome.</p><h4>To what extent can a culture of innovation act as a catalyst for job creation, and what impact can it have on supporting SME development?</h4><p>The typology of our economy is one of the few large companies without much potential to grow, and therefore our growth potential is in moving SMEs to different stages of scale and impact in terms of turnover or employment. From that perspective, we demonstrated a strong correlation between innovation and the ability to manage these processes with a proprietary maturity framework called Innovation Scoring. We demonstrated also the growth potential of SME companies. This would have a growth impact on the national economy of approximately 0.5% of GDP. Innovative SMEs create more and better-paying jobs. Because they are more profitable, they play an important social role since they distribute more profit across society. This growth model supported by innovative SMEs is a sustainable one, both in terms of business growth and achieving quality employment. SMEs in the COTEC network are on average smaller and stuck in that trap between size, scale, and level of innovation. They have many opportunities to grow but simply do not have the resources or financial capital to address those opportunities.</p><h4>What initiatives have been the most effective in achieving COTEC's core objectives?</h4><p>For example, Portugal's aerospace cluster has been evolving for 100 years. During this time, a number of companies active in maintenance, transport, injection-molding, and metals have been entering the market, and it has been growing strongly over the past decade. In 2004, Brazil's Embraer bought OGMA from the Portuguese government and in 2008 it opened two factories. Other international companies followed in the last years. For the cluster of activities, Portugal is currently in the extremely selective club of aeronautic manufacturers. There are almost 200 companies in Portugal working in some way; however, this is just one example and there are many more. We need to stimulate a cluster of activities in order to extract the growth potential because most are highly capital-intensive and knowledge-intensive and able to provide quality employment. They provide many positive externalities with a great deal of networking in terms of collaborative innovation and high potential for growth. As aeronautics, we can identify several clusters, including food, the agro and pulp and paper industry, tourism, and health as having excellent prospects for new growth and investment.</p><h4>What image you would like the international investment community to have about Portuguese innovation?</h4><p>In the last 25 years, we have been building an international case to have the appropriate talents and capabilities in different areas. We have well positioned universities that are training researchers and professionals in management and engineering with one of the best engineering faculties in Europe, and the best proof of the way we train engineers and managers is the success of the Portuguese abroad. A number of sectors have been transformed into innovative businesses and we are able now to use not only the supply capabilities, but also have markets and business that can use those innovative capabilities. What we need is external investment to boost and consolidate these areas of high-value activities. More investment will have not only a direct effect but a multiplying one because the country is ready to grow on the next-generation demand. We already have the connections between the companies and universities that supply the source of knowledge; however, we also need a great and international partner network. COTEC may help to bring together and activate those cross-country networks of innovation with what we call entrepreneurial discovery, which is not only about the business people and entrepreneurs but the scientists, technicians, and companies that supply technologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate the need for new housing in Jamaica now and in the coming years?</h4><p>At the trust, we conduct demand surveys that assist us in determining areas of focus and also the needs of our contributors. This is complimented by private developers who come to us from time to time with a project concept. In those instances, we look at their proposal, conduct the financial assessment, and match it to our demand survey and other forms of due diligence. We decide whether it is a project NHT could finance with the deciding factor being the extent to which NHT contributors will benefit.</p><h4>Is there room for vertical expansion in Kingston?</h4><p>Vertical expansion is something that NHT has been considering and is now taking steps to integrate in our building model; however, we have to measure that against density factors, which ultimately determines the number of rooms per building. Importantly, we have to ensure that our developments are matched with available resources such as water and roads. This aspect of the construction process is regulated by the National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA). NEPA analyses and organizes developments. NHT works with that agency, and is, therefore, guided by NEPA assessment in determining what type of solution it puts in an area.</p><h4>Do you have plans to work in developing downtown Kingston?</h4><p>Generally, there are plans afoot to revitalize downtown Kingston. We are working with the Urban Development Corporation (UDC) to target certain areas to refurbish, remodel, and reconstruct, as well as to put life back into the downtown area. UDC has been offering incentives for companies to go back to downtown Kingston. With these activities, there will be a need for housing, so NHT is on board with this program, and we are looking at mixed developments that include housing as well as commercial spaces so people can be close to where they work. </p><h4>How do you partner with developers?</h4><p>NHT partners with private developers through our Interim-Finance Programme whereby we provide loans for the construction of houses. There are also joint venture arrangements, and we currently have one with West Indies Home Contractors Limited (WIHCON), in which we are developing 1,500 units at a site called The Estuary at Friendship in St. James. WIHCON owns the land and is also the contractor, with NHT coming on board as the financiers and marketers of the project. The units have come out at a price point that is comfortably within NHT's loan ceiling, which means that the majority of our contributors who qualify will have ready financing through NHT. We are looking at similar projects under a Developers' Programme. The trust has parcels of land all across Jamaica and is currently inviting developers to indicate an interest to develop these lands especially for low-income housing. We are also hoping to see more interest from international developers to drive competition, which will in turn lower prices and improve efficiency.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the housing sector, and how will you contribute to it in the coming years?</h4><p>The outlook for housing remains strong based on current demand figures. NHT's current housing plan is to see 15,000 housing starts by 2020. We have projects that should yield upward of 1,500 housing solutions in St James, 2,000 in Manchester, well over 3,000 for Clarendon, and a similar figure for St. Catherine. At this rate, NHT will be able to have a significant impact on the housing demand figures in the next few years. Our contribution as an enabler for more housing constructing projects through financing developments that fit into our target markets will continue, and we will continue to make land available to developers. With the current high demand for housing, NHT realizes the housing industry will be key for Jamaica's economic turnaround. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Treatment Plans]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[treatment-plans]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give us an overview of the investments made by VCGP in Jamaica?</h4><p>The highlight of our activity over the past 17 years has been a number of successful projects, approximately 10 major projects that have all been finished on time and within budget. Among those was the Jamaica Water Supply Improvement Project (JWSIP), the largest potable water project in the history of the English-speaking Caribbean. It was a vast and fully integrated program from concept design and discussions that started in 2008 to the implementation from 2010 to 2015. The project was divided into two phases, one USD68 million and the other USD89 million, with different components all over the island. JWSIP was a comprehensive project from the catchment of raw water in the rivers to its treatment via the construction and refurbishment of major water treatment plants. The project also included transmission pipelines and storage tanks, pumping stations, and distribution pipelines. We have laid some of the largest pipelines on the island and smaller distribution networks as well for the National Water Commission (NWC). We have now developed other business lines in Jamaica and are working on the expansion of the port in Kingston.</p><h4>How is the expansion of the port progressing?</h4><p>The port is a complex engineering project, requiring many specializations. VCGP has partnered with different subsidiaries of the VCGP group specializing in maritime and quay works to come up with innovative engineering solutions to minimize the cost while maintaining the quality of the work and safety of all personnel. We have approximately 500 employees working on this project, and completion is expected in December 2018.</p><h4>What is the outlook for the water sector in Jamaica?</h4><p>VCGP has worked on the largest water production centers on the island and the largest plants for potable water, yet there is still a need for more water. Around 85% of the population has access to piped water or close to it, however water demand is increasing every year because of population growth, and therefore, there is a growing need for the construction of additional catchment and treatment facilities and for other smaller distribution networks. We are currently developing programs with the government and NWC to alleviate the shortage of water in the Kingston metropolitan area. It is one thing to treat raw water and produce potable water, but now we have to be able to treat wastewater as well. There are several existing wastewater treatment facilities but most are aged and require upgrades or completely new facilities to meet new environmental regulations, which came out in 2013. VCGP has recently designed and constructed the Boscobel and Elletson Flats treatment plants, our first two wastewater plants in Jamaica designed in accordance with the new regulations.</p><h4>What are your goals and objectives in the coming year?</h4><p>Separate from the port expansion project, we are implementing the KCT2 Pavement Project, which is a large, 60,000-sqm concrete pavement project that will be finished by the end of 2017 at the Kingston Port. We are also building the Port Antonio Wastewater Treatment Plant and installing sewer pipelines, which we expect to commission by July or August of 2018. In terms of new projects, we expect to start the construction of a new treatment plant in 2018 in the form of a PPP. There is one PPP in the wastewater sector, but we want to develop the first one in the potable water sector. We have strong financial partners who are ready to invest money. Jamaica has a lot of infrastructural needs, but the government has little financial resources at the moment. PPPs could be one solution to fill the gap in the current capital investment structure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DHL Jamaica celebrates its 30th birthday in 2018. What have been the milestones of its presence on the island?</h4><p>During this period, we have become the express market leaders with superior local customer service, service quality, and island-wide reach through various retail partners that continue to work with us as a global logistics brand. Some of these partners we have joint service agreements with are the US, Canadian, and Dutch embassies; Passport Immigration &amp; Citizen Agency (PICA); Jamaica Postal Agency (JAMPOST); and Western Union. Additionally, our cost effective retail “Express Easy" solution makes it easy and cost-effective for SMEs to ship internationally. In this timeframe, DHL Jamaica has also been awarded with numerous awards such as being named a Top Employer by the Global Top Employer Institute three years consecutively in 2015, 2016, and again in 2017. This speaks to the investment that DHL makes continuously in our human talent. Other notable awards, have been the Best of Chamber Award in 2015 in the large business category from the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce and the Private Sector Organization of Jamaica, and Jamaica Customer Service's Service Excellence Award for 2017.</p><h4>Jamaica is striving to become a global logistics hub. How do you see the outlook of the logistics sector in Jamaica?</h4><p>Significant growth is forecasted due to many opportunities for companies to enter the logistic sector, primarily providing e-commerce and B2C solutions. DHL Express is geared to handle the changes in logistics infrastructure to realize its full growth potential. Despite the recent introduction of ASYCUDA, the customs management system introduced by Jamaica Customs to make interaction with customs and processes simpler and faster, there are still opportunities to increase the amount for personal shippers to drive more shipment volumes into the country through e-commerce. This is definitely an area that must improve to make trade facilitation easier. This, in addition to related projects such as improvement of the seaports, airports, and highways to sustain the hub, will definitely result in more FDI and potentially drive down the cost of logistics, positively impacting our economy and GDP growth.</p><h4>Do you expect that the privatization of the Norman Manley Airport will enable you to further develop your activities in Jamaica?</h4><p>As an express courier service, improvements in air infrastructure and roadways will certainly impact our operations in a positive way and allow us to serve our customers better and to be more efficient doing it. DHL has worked closely with both the public and private sectors, and DHL stands to gain from the privatization of the airport, as it is expected that privatization will raise standards, facilities, and infrastructural development to world-class levels. This can only impact our growth positively and give us the ability to provide better and more efficient services as a result of improved gateways at the airport. We will also benefit from the construction of the North-South Highway and expansion of the Kingston Freeport Terminal.</p><h4>What are DHL's main objectives in Jamaica for 2018, and how do you plan to achieve them?</h4><p>Our main objective will be continuing to drive growth through quality by being the most insanely customer-centric organization in Jamaica, while driving service improvements in all areas of our operations. This will allow us to achieve significant revenue and shipment volume growth, and is part of our Focus 2020 Strategy. The main sources of this growth for us will come from new customer acquisitions with a focus on SMEs, e-commerce partnerships, and significant retail expansion. To ensure our objectives are met, we will continue to invest in our people, technology, and infrastructure. We believe in taking care of, training and motivating our people, who in turn take care of our customers and enhance their experience. Once the customers are delighted, they will take care of us and ensure DHL remains a sustainable business and market leader. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is ZIM's history in Jamaica?</h4><p>We started here in 1973, when the company decided to go into the container business. ZIM was actually established in 1945; we started bringing passengers mainly from Europe, and later on we went into the cargo business. In 1973, we were amongst the pioneers in container shipping, and Jamaica was an important hub for us from the beginning. We are still the only carrier with a constant, ongoing presence here, supporting the country's economy.</p><h4>What sets you apart from your competitors?</h4><p>Our most important asset is our people, because they learn how to work in an international environment and provide a great service whenever we need it. We always strive to be more efficient, which ultimately means providing better customer service. Behind every container is a customer seeking a personal touch. ZIM is also unique because, as an independent carrier, we have significant advantages it terms of flexibility of operation and tailor-made customer service.</p><h4>How do you use Jamaica as a hub?<br></h4><p>We focus mainly on the east-west trade that comes from the Middle East and Asia and goes toward the east coast of the US, the Caribbean, South America, and the US Gulf. Ships from the Panama Canal go to the main market, mainly to Miami, Savannah, Norfolk, New York, and Halifax. Kingston is right by the main shipping lines and has deep waters that allow fully loaded ships to enter the country. The Caribbean is also in the center of our network, making Kingston the second-largest hub for the company, and we need to have a great network to be able to send cargo throughout this network as fast as possible. During the 1970s, we realized the great potential of the small islands and the countries surrounding the Caribbean. It was clear at that time that large vessels were not able to go to many of the ports because there were many restrictions and limitations. The Caribbean is considered a secondary market, with the main market being the east coast of the US, and vessels need to arrive at their final destination as soon as possible. We function almost like a traffic light—vessels stop, discharge their cargo, and continue on their ways again. We have the fastest record of splitting cargo to send to the Caribbean.</p><h4>How will your activities benefit from the expansion of the port?</h4><p>We established, in 2006, a logistics company called Kingston Logistics Center. We already realized the huge potential for that market years ago and decided to form a partnership with a local player and to work with the government. We are hoping to facilitate a more strategic positioning of Jamaica as a logistics hub. There is a lot cargo that is to the Caribbean, but to Jamaica because the authorities are more concerned with fees than increasing ease of doing business. Everybody is trying to make money out of it; however, we have to compete with Panama and the Dominican Republic, and unfortunately, we are far more expensive in terms of costs compared to them. There are many customs fees hindering the creation of new jobs. Many containers are choosing to go to other places due to Jamaica's high fees. The existing government is working to make some changes, and once they are established, we will increase our market share.</p><h4>What more should be done for Jamaica to become a logistics hub?</h4><p>We need to consider three points. It has to be an easy place to do business, there must be fast and reliable services, and we need to be cost competitive. Currently, Jamaica has low marks in all three areas. When these start to change, I am sure we will see more business in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the objectives and progress of the expansion of the Kingston Container Terminal (KCT)?</h4><p>The expansion of KCT is being undertaken by KFTL, a company incorporated in Jamaica that was granted a 30-year concession by the government to operate, expand, and improve the terminal. The purpose of the upgrade is to position Kingston as the top-ranking hub in the region, enabling KFTL to accommodate the largest New Panamax vessels, which can carry up to 14,000 TEUs. Our initial achievements included the deepening and widening of the nautical access, upgrading of all IT systems, construction of a new IT infrastructure,  and acquisition of two large gantry cranes, among other numerous handling equipment. The entire project will be completed by the end of 2018. We have already experienced a surge in transshipment volumes since the takeover of KCT in July 2016. CMA CGM and ZIM are currently our two main customers in terms of volume. When global shipping volumes grow by 4%, for example, the simultaneous increase of the vessels' size generates more transshipment volumes in well-located hubs, which is the case for Kingston. Hubs such as Kingston have to absorb the demand surge due to these new larger vessels. To meet this demand, we have also embarked on an aggressive recruitment and training policy to increase the number of vessel gangs available around the clock.</p><h4>How will the development of the port improve the Jamaican economy in the coming years?</h4><p>This state-of-the-art maritime hub is a competitive advantage for the Jamaican economy as a whole. It allows local manufacturers to source their materials from a wide range of markets, and they also benefit from having direct connections to a wider range of export destinations, reducing their logistics costs. To take advantage of this situation, we are engaged with the Government of Jamaica and many agencies and entities, such as the Port Authority of Jamaica (PAJ), Jamaica Promotions Corporation (JAMPRO), and the Airport Authority of Jamaica (AAJ). We are a major player in Jamaica's logistics hub initiative and see our role as providing a world-class hub, delivering top service to our customers, which include the shipping lines, importers, exporters, consignees, and local corporations. We work closely with all the relevant stakeholders, such as the Jamaica Customs Agency (JCA), Port Trailer Haulage Association (PTHA), Jamaica Chamber of Commerce (JCC), Jamaica Manufacturers Association (JMA), and Jamaica Exporters Association (JEA). Every day we serve them efficiently and provide the service they need from us. On the shipping line side, the availability of berths and other services at our port for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year is a key factor of our competitiveness. A second factor is reliability, in that when we start an operation we have to deliver. The third factor is efficiency. Because all the time spent at berth is a loss of time and money for a shipping line, we continuously work to improve our productivity levels and efficiency. Safety and security at the port are also key factors in our operations, and we constantly monitor these at all times.</p><h4>Are the regulations or incentives adequate to turn the logistics hub initiative into reality?</h4><p>The Jamaican Special Economic Zone Act is a new legal framework for business that we are satisfied with. Cooperation with the PAJ and JCA is great. It takes some time to build these processes, and we need to continue with this work and investment. The resources being made available locally match what we need for the hub to expand. There are currently discussions about developing the land adjoining the port for hosting major international logistics operations. Hopefully, by 2018, there will be tangible development of the logistics hub. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[New Stimulus]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[new-stimulus]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your role in developing a global logistics hub in Jamaica?</h4><p>The PAJ signed a concession agreement with Terminal Link Consortium, owned by CMA/CGM, for a period of 30 years to finance, expand, operate, and maintain the Kingston Container Terminal (KCT). This concession supports Jamaica's efforts to become a global leader in trans-shipment as well as a global logistics hub. In support of this agreement, the government of Jamaica and the PAJ are providing the necessary space for landside near-port logistics operations and are commencing the development of the new Kingston Logistics Park (KLP). With this development of modern warehouses, Jamaica is providing a new stimulus to offer modern logistics facilities, as the existing facilities at Kingston Free Zones are old and less attractive to international logistics companies. The park is designed to host logistics and value-added activities/light industrial activities to support the modern port infrastructure that will be available in the Port of Kingston and will have special economic zone (SEZ) status. This will allow firms to fully utilize a wide range of favorable conditions for international trade such as the exemption of duties and taxes and attractive lease prices. This brand-new KLP will be operational in August 2018. It contributes to Jamaica's ambition to develop from a global trans-shipment hub to global logistics hub. Logistics companies and large international trading companies can now seek the opportunity to take advantage of Jamaica's strategic and cost-effective position in global cargo trade. KLP will be located adjacent to the Kingston Port and operate in the same SEZ. The PAJ is developing and implementing the KLP to provide, for the immediate term, modern facilities to showcase Jamaica's logistics potential. These initial warehouses can be considered as incubators, to enable firms to “try before they buy." Warehouses can be configured to accommodate from 500 to 5,000sqm, focusing on import and re-exporting to regional destinations including in the Caribbean, Central and South America, and the Gulf and East Coast of the US.</p><h4>How could Jamaica attract even more cruise ships in the future?</h4><p>In the short to medium term our specific focus is the upgrading of our existing cruise port facilities; however, in the longer term we will seek to develop additional berths. Last year we began the upgrading of the terminal buildings in Montego Bay to accommodate two homeports simultaneously. This year we have been upgrading the berthing capacity at the Reynolds Pier facility in Ocho Rios, which will allow us to accommodate two post-Panamax vessels in the same day in Ocho Rios. Next year we will be dredging the Port of Falmouth to accommodate two Oasis-class vessels, the largest class of cruise vessel in the world, at the same time. Additionally, for the long term, we are also evaluating other areas of the island that may be ideally suited for cruise shipping growth. Dredging works will be undertaken at the historic Falmouth Port this year to increase the port's capacity. Currently the port can facilitate one Oasis-class and one Freedom-class vessel simultaneously. Expansion works will enable to port to berth two Oasis-class vessels at the same time. Extensive development has been undertaken at the Port of Montego Bay to increase the port's competitiveness and improve the cruise passenger experience. This includes the construction of a new cargo berth and the expansion of the cruise shipping terminal as well as the addition of a new shopping arcade and other amenities. Jamaica will also need to give sharp focus to the development of new attractions and continue to implement strategies to reduce cruise visitor harassment in order to improve its attractiveness as a cruise ship destination.</p><h4>What positive trends do you see for the Jamaican economy?</h4><p>The local economy continues to demonstrate positive trends generally and reflects the outcome of the economic policies being pursued by the government. The level of unemployment is decreasing, and new jobs are being created especially in the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, where the authority is a major player in the BPO investment space. Inflation continues to be low and this is as a direct result of relatively stable oil prices along with the government's efforts to streamline related policies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your priorities as Minister of Transport and Mining?</h4><p>The role of the Mining and Transport Sector in Vision 2030 was laid out in 2007, when I was first minister and sought to implement a multimodal transport system, connecting road, rail, sea, and air. The railway connects all of the ports of Jamaica and, therefore, we do not need to put in that infrastructure. Rather, we are moving forward in terms of connecting the railway with other transportation, such as the East-West leg of highway 2000, which itself needs be extended further and will now be extended to Williamsfield in Manchester. That is supposed to connect Vernamfield, a World War II airfield that was only returned to Jamaica 10 to 15 years ago, with our highway network. We are pursuing that with what is called an Aerotropolis development concept, which will allow us to bring goods into the port of Kingston, put it on the railway, deliver it to Vernamfield, and then put it on the plane for the rest of the world. Vermanfield is in the reach over one billion people within a 10-hour flight. The Aerotropolis will drive the development of the cities and towns to which it is connected; therefore, Vision 2030 must relate to the growth of this development strategy. This is part of what was implemented with the North-South Highway, which was the vision when I was previously minister and has now been implemented. The rail service is already serving the mineral and mining sectors, especially the bauxite companies. The logical extension is to incorporate cargo and, by extension, passengers on those routes. An important element that gives economic growth is of course the heritage side to the railway, which can move the visitor on an excursion that is second to none. Had it not been for the railway, the mining sector would not have been able to hold its own during the downturn of the bauxite industry. Now that the value of minerals is increasing, it has led to an uptick in the importance of bauxite and limestone. There is also potential for copper and gold, and we are exploring our potential oil resources.</p><h4>How does the expansion of the Kingston Container Terminal relate to your vision?</h4><p>The extension of the port comes under another Ministry and is particularly important for development. We also intend to expand the reach of ports as well. That is why we show collective support rather than focus on one port. Now I want to connect the Kingston container terminal to the Cargo Airport at Vernamfield. Ian Fleming Airport is being developed to be a regional hub in the Caribbean, as air transport is going to become critically important and will connect to ports as well.</p><h4>What kind of interest are you seeing from foreign international companies who want to get involved in the intermodal transport system?</h4><p>The interest is expanding exponentially. We have to understand how to structure that and consolidate it. Every day I hear from about four different investment companies with the capability to develop Vermanfield. I have three representatives from overseas companies coming to see me who are ready to invest. JISCO is ready and has budgeted to spend USD1 billion each year for the next three years. The ministry must ensure investment flows do not get delayed in order to maintain investors' interest in Jamaica. Regulations and legislation, including those in special economic zones, are important in this regard, and laws should help create a conducive business environment. Right now, I see that the generation of alternative power is creating a lot of unexpected issues and is impacting the way that power is distributed. Jamaica has to recognize that we are in competition with others and, therefore, by extension, we have to keep pace with new developments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company grown since GB Energy acquired Texaco's operations in Jamaica?</h4><p>When we took over at the end of 2012, we were number three on the retail side; now we are number one. These five years have been a great experience for us. We have been able to grow in many aspects. We started with 52 service stations and are now supplying 67, including a few stations for airports. Previously, we had 2% market share, selling 1.2 million gallons of fuel per year to airlines. In 2016, we closed with 30 million gallons and 46% market share. It has fluctuated a little because airlines renew their contracts every year, though we still retain a high percentage of the market. Furthermore, we have started to supply to many of the industries as a result of our relationships and reputation for being a reliable supplier of energy. We are now entering into new businesses, for example selling asphalt to the Chinese as well as the LPG business.</p><h4>How do you evaluate your contribution to the Jamaican economy?</h4><p>From the beginning, we decided to work with and purchase from the refinery here to help contribute to the growth of the country. We are currently Petrojam's largest customer. We also have a trading division based in Panama, and can supply fuel to Petrojam, helping with its import needs. In terms of employment, we truly support local talent. We instill a high level of confidence in our people, and they have developed a great deal of trust in the future. At the moment, we have 49 direct employees between this office and the terminal facilities. We have around 60 contractors in the stations and 24 contractors in the aviation facilities. If we include the total number of people working in service stations, our employees total more than 1,000. We are also active participants in local organizations and chambers. We are heavily involved in JAMPRO and the Private Sector Organization of Jamaica (PSOJ), where I sit on the energy committee and the membership committee to assist the interaction of the private sector with the government. Our goal at PSOJ is to help companies and SMEs grow. I also sit on the board of American Chamber of Commerce in Jamaica, and we actively work with the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce.</p><h4>How has your partnership with New Leaf enabled GB Energy to reduce its energy costs?</h4><p>At service stations, we consume a large amount of electricity on illumination, walk-in coolers, and air conditioning. We partnered with New Leaf Power to install solar systems in our service stations, and that has halved our electricity bills. The beauty is that whatever excess we produce can be sold back to the grid for credit; there are savings all around.</p><h4>What challenges and opportunities do you see for gasoline retailers and the petroleum industry in Jamaica?</h4><p>Next year, the Texaco brand will celebrate its 100th anniversary in Jamaica, and most of our retailers have been there for over 20 years. In the past, their mentality was that the oil major had to do everything, and they did not have to do much. We have changed all of that. My retailers are being trained now in entrepreneurship and leadership and are looking at business in a different way. My preferred retailer is the one who comes to me and says he wants to invest. We go 50/50, and they put money into their business. We can then maximize the use of the money to be more effective. As for challenges, we need to continue supporting the refinery here and help it grow; otherwise, it will become a storage facility. The challenge is for it to come up with the upgrades it needs to continue functioning as a refinery so we can support it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Do Jamaican companies have a competitive advantage when it comes to exporting?</h4><p>People often ask how we can compete against exporting countries such as China and other larger markets in the world. We cannot compete with everything, though we can compete with many things. I visited Singapore with the Jamaica Special Economic Zone Authority (JSEZA) team, as I am also the Chairman of JSEZA. Based on Jamaica's location in relation to the Americas, we play a role similar to Singapore's in Asia, which includes a great deal of transshipment, which significantly helps its economy. Singapore manages to manufacture with no natural resources whatsoever and with a market that is as small as ours. Jamaica does not have many competitive advantages, though we do have some. Firstly, our location is a key competitive advantage. Added to this are our infrastructure and trainable workforce, which speaks English. We have excellent electricity supply; it may not be at the best price yet, but it is improving and is certainly cheaper than some other regions. We have excellent telephone, internet, and data services, along with great weather. We are innovative people. Therefore, Jamaica has certain advantages, and we have to choose the products we will manufacture wisely.</p><h4>What programs does JMA implement to help Jamaican companies with manufacturing?</h4><p>In most cases, to be successful in manufacturing, a company first needs to be successful in its home country. Therefore, we need to build capacity in our manufacturing sector. JMA is working with the government to implement a new government procurement policy. In any economy, the government is the largest purchaser of goods and services. Currently, the least-cost method of procurement that we use in Jamaica does not serve us well. In many cases, it eliminates local companies as suppliers. We need the government to give local manufacturers a weighted advantage because public spending on procurement should not only be about the bottom line; it is also about building the local economy. </p><h4>How does JMA work with the banking sector to improve access to commercial loans for SMEs?</h4><p>When we survey our membership, especially SMEs, the three most important factors for them are financing, factory space, and procurement. JMA has put together two lines of financing, one of which is through EXIM Bank. This finances up to JMD1.5 million for micro-companies without any collateral, as this is sometimes where they have a problem. It is at 12%. We have also put a line together of up to JMD1 billion per company with the National Commercial Bank at 8%. The third initiative we are working on is writing to the Minister of Finance requesting a pool of funds to be made available to manufacturers through the National Development Bank of Jamaica at 5%. We hope to be successful with this in the coming months. Regarding the issue of factory space, there is a Factories Corporation of Jamaica (FCJ) that was established to deal with this. However, 85% of the FCJ's space is currently being utilized for distribution and retail. We have asked FCJ to provide us with a significant amount of space at a concessionary rate for a one-year period to help get SMEs off the ground. Then, as they build up their businesses, they will be able to pay the rent at normal rates. Our largest growing sector in JMA is the SME sector. We have over 120 new members, individuals who are mostly women and who are starting small factories out of their kitchens, living rooms, and garages. They have great ideas and innovative products where all the raw materials come from Jamaica. They seek to develop those enterprises. When they join JMA, they hope we can help them with these three areas—getting the government to buy their products, factory space, and finance. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[hawk-like-vision]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Hawkeye developed as a company, and how have your services and client base evolved?</h4><p>Hawkeye has two arms: guarding and electronics. The electronics side will turn 30 in 2018 while the guarding division will be 32. In the past, the two companies operated completely independently and were run by different brothers. Several years ago, we merged the management structures to resemble one brand, giving customers the impression that we offer one complete solution. Hawkeye does everything in physical security, including armed and unarmed security guards. On the electronics side, our primary service is installing alarm and panic systems, as well as monitoring and armed response to alarms. We also offer many accessory services that our core business has allowed us to build. The second-largest part of our business currently is the sale of equipment. We do a great deal of installations of camera and access control systems for small to enterprise solutions. We have installed 2,000-3,000 cameras over the past year, particularly through a great deal of expansion in the hotel segment. We have also seen a large expansion in the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector. We are currently working with Petrojam and tend to do almost all the BPO sector's electronic security.</p><h4>What does Hawkeye bring that is different to what local security companies offer in the US, for example?</h4><p>Generally speaking, there is not much to differentiate between what the various companies offer in the security market in the US. One of the reasons for looking outside Jamaica is that the margins here are slim. There are greater margins to be found for security services outside the Jamaican market. We also look to continue to drive our current lines. We are doing a great deal of training and expansion of our sales force. We expanded our sales force by about 25% in 2016 and intend to increase it by another 25% in 2018 because we have seen the returns from this expansion. The final plan is to look at areas of opportunity that are new business lines for Jamaica. We are exploring the information security field. Hawkeye's name is strong in the security market and we can leverage our name to take ownership of the information security market here. This is an area that our customers have been asking us if we are considering. Awareness of cyber security is growing rapidly. The need for physical security services will not go away; this is just another area that will grow, and we want to be the ones to fill this niche.</p><h4>What sets Hawkeye apart from its competitors?</h4><p>It is hard to say one thing because we offer many different services. On the electronics side, which is monitoring and armed response, our unique proposition is that Hawkeye offers the fastest response times in the industry. Our current ratio is 350 customers to one response team, while our competitors have ratios of 650 to one. On the guarding side, what makes Hawkeye different is our focus on training. In 2017, we became certified as an accredited training organization, and we can now train and certify our own level-one security guards under international accreditation standards. There are only two other security companies that can do this. We are also the only company in the security industry here that can offer level-two training for security supervisors. Our next step is to expand our training institute beyond our own staff and train other security guards who want to become certified. Then, we want to expand further into other areas, such as training in customer service and installation of security equipment. Training is important at Hawkeye. In 2017, we were the proud recipients of an award from the American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) for investing in getting a large number of our managers certified as security professionals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[just-the-right-blend]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is WIHCON's strategy?</h4><p>WIHCON has two arms: we are a developer, and we are also one of the larger building and civil engineering contractors on the island. As a developer, we are always making long-term projections of the future and making commitments to this projection by securing land banks for at least five years. But government decisions and policies, for example taxes, and international competition have a significant impact on what we do. In Jamaica, we are one of, if not the only, major sectors of the economy that does not have any protection from international competition. Therefore, the industry is vulnerable to large companies from countries like China, Europe, and the US. Therefore, we formulate our long-terms plans within this uncertain operating space, which means we always have to reassess and, if necessary, change our plans and strategies. As a company, we try to balance our business by also operating in the contracting space for selected clients. This affords us the opportunity to bid and work on projects that do not have all the attendant risks a developer faces.</p><h4>What income level are the majority of WIHCON's projects aimed at?</h4><p>We undertake smaller mid- to higher-end developments, though not the extremely high end, as there are other companies that cover that segment. We then leverage these projects while looking for the larger lower-income project opportunities that have longer planning periods and  require greater capital outlay. We try to create a blend of projects from the base to the top of the middle tier of developments in an attempt to even out demand fluctuations. This is a deliberate strategy by the company not to stick to one particular development band.</p><h4>Does the company have a positive outlook with the economy in Jamaica doing quite well at the moment?</h4><p>We are optimistic about the future of Jamaica. As a result, we are looking at putting products in the marketplace, which is a sign of our optimism. We have just finished a housing development at Red Hills called Forest Ridge. It is a combination of two- and three-bedroom condos as well as studios and two-bedroom apartments. We are just about to start another project across from our National Stadium featuring a six-story and a nine-story block of apartments. We expect to delivery about 18 months from the start of that development. We are bullish on the development side of the business and are active in the contracting space, tendering for opportunities with companies we feel are blue chip, meaning companies with an ability to pay. We are currently working on a project in Montego Bay in conjunction with the National Housing Trust where we are producing 1,500 one-bedroom, low-income solutions. The first delivery of around 400-500 units will be around YE2017. We are also looking to develop another 250 acres of land with a similar kind of joint venture and seeking other opportunities along the northern coast.</p><h4>Is the smart house concept, developed in partnership with the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS), something you are planning to develop further in the future?</h4><p>One of the things we are always looking at is how to make homes more energy efficient and smarter. We have introduced a pilot program for a housing development with JPS in Montego Bay where we are trying to create a smart house. The Ministry of Science, Energy, and Technology has a smart energy program, and we are actively courting the ministry to see if we can incorporate our smart house development into that program. We have to move with the times as a company and embrace the technologies that are available. We have to incorporate new, affordable technologies into the homes that we are developing, which will give us a competitive advantage. We are constantly on the lookout for products and opportunities to offer our customers through these partnerships. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has FLOW worked to increase and improve internet penetration in the country?</h4><p>We have been investing heavily in our network over the past few years.  Compared to traditional developed markets, our internet penetration levels are low, at 20%. However, we have made investments to ensure we are laying the backbone for internet penetration, which means each and every part of the island, rural and urban, is included. In 2016, that investment also saw us bringing high-speed internet of a minimum of 25MB/s speeds to 150 communities. We rolled out those internet speeds for another 220 communities in 2017, making sure we continue to expand penetration across the island. In 2018, we seek to make further investments to bring our technology up to date. We were the first company to bring mobile to Jamaica and have seen the gradual progression of technology, from 2G all the way to LTE. Everything about this market is developed in terms of the technology that is available to our customers, even more so for business customers. We have created a solid backbone for business operations, and that is why we are the number-one choice for the BPO and hospitality industries. We have developed the type of networks that create and support the kind of productivity that the nation requires.</p><h4>Where are you currently focusing your investments?</h4><p>We are creating a fault-tolerant network with several layers of redundancy to which we will migrate our business customers. The reality is that we will be the only network within the region that can offer that level of authentic redundancy built into the network to provide nearly five lines of reliability. We create the kind of telecommunications environment that is “futureproof." We see ourselves as a connectivity and entertainment business; we create the backbone for smart cities in collaboration with the government and the private sector. Soon we will play a major role in creating smart homes and smart government. We are in discussions with the Ministry of Health for telemedicine. For the hospitality industry, because it is entertainment driven, we are working with hotels to create billing systems, integrated networks for movies, and Wi-Fi solutions so that we will continue being their preferred choice.</p><h4>What sets the Jamaican market apart from the parent company's overall business?</h4><p>Jamaica is a huge market for FLOW, and one of the largest outside of Panama in terms of contributing to revenue. That comes with its own pressure because we are expected to carry our weight. We are improving the quality of our service, improving the customer experience, and improving our engagement. We are still in the midst of integration since it involves two massive companies coming together in a quick span of time. Nothing we do in the background should be seen by the customer; they should see one brand, one company, and one vision.</p><h4>What are some of the opportunities and challenges in the Jamaican telecommunications sector?</h4><p>As we continue to improve on technology speeds, the opportunities are limitless. It is expensive, but we cannot stop investing. That is what we make sure to do every single year to stay on the cutting edge. Because we provide data at a lower cost, we can improve companies' bottom lines and margins. We are in the fourth industrial revolution and in the age of artificial intelligence. There will be jobs that will be replaced by artificial intelligence. As we continue to grow, we see artificial intelligence coming into play, though the country will still need connectivity and us. We will be a large part of fueling growth. Jamaica is truly an ideal place for IT and telecommunications. As long as the country continues to invest in education, technology, and computer sciences, we can be on the cutting edge. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Sangster International Airport play in the Jamaican economy?</h4><p>Sangster International Airport is the main airport in Jamaica and the main gateway for tourists arriving into the country. Tourism is one of the key pillars of Jamaica's economy. We handle approximately 4 million passengers per year, and the growth pattern in 2017 has been positive. We have grown beyond our expectations. We are working hard with tourism sector stakeholders to ensure that we tap into the right potential growth markets. The markets of interest include Latin America, where we are making inroads. We are mainly interested in Colombia, Peru, and Chile. There are currently no direct flights from Jamaica to Latin America, other than to Panama. We have been talking mainly about the airport in relation to tourism; however, we are also working to support the development of exports, especially agricultural exports. We also see more business people flying into Sangster International Airport because of all the things going on in Montego Bay. For this reason, we are working with businesses to look at developing the real estate opportunities we have at the airport.</p><h4>What flights do you have to connect Jamaica with Europe and other main markets?</h4><p>The second-largest group of passengers for us is the diaspora, and these are Jamaicans living mainly in the US, Canada, and the UK. Around 70% of our passenger traffic comes from the US, followed by Canada at about 20%, and then Europe. In Europe, the main markets are the UK and Germany, though we do have flights to other parts of Europe, including Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Poland in the summer season. We also had flights to Spain and Portugal in 2017 for the first time in many years.</p><h4>What expansion works do you have ongoing at the airport?</h4><p>Sangster International Airport initiated a new phase of development in 2017, with a focus on investing in and improving our infrastructure. We expect that over the next 15 years, Sangster International Airport will see investments of over USD100 million. We will enlarge the terminal building, increase facilities, and add gates to reduce congestion. We will renovate car parking facilities and improve the check-in area, as well as the commercial area to make it much more attractive and interesting. We are working with the immigration authorities to ensure that the passenger experience is pleasant when people enter the country, with the installation of new kiosks. We are investing in air conditioning and many other things to modernize the airport. On top of this, we will also lengthen the runway at an additional cost of over USD60 million.</p><h4>Is the infrastructure in Montego Bay adequate to give people the best tourism experience?</h4><p>It is great that hotels here are also investing and growing. There are more hotel rooms available, thanks to both the expansion of existing hotels and the construction of new hotels. Tourists who come here seem to enjoy the experience. And there is potential for more. I see many upsides to Jamaica. Because we know there will be more hotel rooms coming and we have the passenger demand here, our strategy at Sangster International Airport will be to grow our facilities. However, we want to work together with other entities to ensure that the entire experience is as great as it can be. We are working with hotels and playing our part to ensure that passengers who fly into Sangster International Airport can easily get on their hotel buses. We are also opening a bus station at the airport, which will facilitate multimodal transport inter-connectivity. We are also a homeport for many cruise liners; therefore, people fly into Sangster International Airport and start their cruises from here. We have a number of flights from Europe bringing passengers in for this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the contribution of the Montego Bay Free Zone to the development of the economy and Jamaica in general?</h4><p>The Montego Bay Free Zone was created in 1985, and it is the second-largest employer in the city, behind tourism. The free zone has truly been the first mover in terms of economic development in this area, and over the years, it has consistently provided employment opportunities for thousands of Jamaicans. It has also spearheaded and stimulated innovation in telecommunications. We have also helped to build a platform for growth in e-commerce, training and development, and ICT, and the backward and forward linkages with the domestic economy have been enormous in the free zone. We have nurtured and developed an outsourcing industry, starting with garments under the Caribbean Basin Initiative program and eventually transitioning to data processing and back office support to contact centers to now moving up the value chain in knowledge process outsourcing. Many of the companies that now operate in Jamaica—both in the public and private sectors—either came through this free zone or are connected through the talents that this learning curve has produced within the incubator.</p><h4>How do you see your role in developing human capital in the sector?</h4><p>The free zone continues to support the development of human capital by working with various agencies, including the Business Process Industry Association of Jamaica (BPIAJ), to diversify and expand the capabilities of the BPO cluster. We have worked with training institutions such as the Caribbean Maritime University, Montego Bay Community College, University of the West Indies, and University of Technology. More importantly, we have always maintained a partnership with the government's training agency, the Heart Trust NTA. We have distinct capabilities in certain areas of BPO, namely customer services, sales, receivables management, finance, and accounting, and we are gradually moving up the value chain in software development. In fact, the first software development company from Jamaica came from this free zone and is still located here.</p><h4>What are your current projects to attract even more companies to the free zone?</h4><p>We have a partnership with BPIAJ, of which I am president, to provide a 200-seat incubator. It is a full turnkey plug-and-play facility for new investors coming in or local entrepreneurs seeking to get into the business. Three years ago, we sought and received funding from the Inter-American Development Bank's Compete Caribbean Program to finance the development of the incubator. The incubator helps stimulate growth and diversity within the BPO sector as well as attracts foreign investors coming to Jamaica.</p><h4>What would you say to investors coming to Jamaica?</h4><p>Jamaica is one of the best places to do business. Jamaicans are productive and have outperformed many of their competitors in other parts of the world. We are open to providing all the support that investors need to be successful. Our government, especially Prime Minister Andrew Holness, is accommodating and foreign investment is a priority, particularly in global services, which is where we operate. The government has a growth target of 5% in four years, and this sector is one of the primary sectors that have been selected to support that growth. We have been growing consistently since 2012 and intend to continue growing. We have over 25,000 people employed within the sector currently, and there is significant development taking place in both the private and public sectors as we diversify and improve our talent capabilities, making sure we are ready to meet the demands of the 21st century. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the convention center evolved since 2011?</h4><p>SMG, the management company, came on board in January 2011, and in the following six months, MBCC was in consultation on the structuring of the convention center. In July, SMG was formally engaged to manage and operate the facility. MBCC has come a long way since then. One of the major challenges we had in the early stages was getting the right resources to help market the center. That situation has improved significantly since MBCC's alignment with the Ministry of Tourism, which has led to substantial gains. 2017 was MBCC's best year ever, and MBCC was able to accomplish what was wanted with regards to its targets. For this year, which finishes in March 2018, MBCC is on point to exceed its goals. Much of this has to do with the fact that MBCC has been given additional resources to market the center internationally. The Minister of Tourism, Edmund Bartlett, is a firm believer and understands the convention center business, which really is an asset to MBCC. We recently hosted the UNWTO Global Tourism Conference on Sustainable Development and Tourism Partnerships. Before that, MBCC held the NCAA Jamaica Classic Basketball Tournament for the first time and now has a 10-year commitment to host that event. The all-around economic impact not only benefits Montego Bay but Jamaica as well, and this is quite impressive.</p><h4>How does MBCC plan to generate more revenue in the upcoming years, and how can you get more utilization?</h4><p>What would really help MBCC get more utilization is to get a hotel on site. MBCC has challenges with is the peak season for tourism, from the end of November to about the beginning of April. There are many important conventions that MBCC would like to host but is not able to because a lack of hotel rooms. Most hotels are already booked during the peak season or winter tourist season. MBCC's hotel would have mainly a business focus and would provide the room count needed to attract those conventions during the peak season. MBCC is also working on a sponsorship package; we are giving businesses the opportunity to advertise their products here and promote them during major conferences.</p><h4>What kind of international events is MBCC looking to organize in the coming year?</h4><p>MBCC is actively working with the Jamaica Tourist Board (JTB). The chairman of JTB is also the chairman of MBCC's board, and this provides a good synergy. In April 2017, MBCC also hired a national sales manager who is based in Washington DC. She is helping us maximize our international relations. MBCC currently has commitments with Kiwanis International, FIFA, and Latin Finance but the center is extremely flexible and can accommodate performances, sporting events and conferences; as a matter of fact, MBCC is in discussions to host a karate and boxing tournament as well.</p><h4>Where do most of MBCC's foreign visitors come from?</h4><p>The US provides the most visitors, and then MBCC has regional visitors followed by Canada and Europe. MBCC tries to develop a one-stop shop scenario to make it easier for visitors. For example, MBCC works closely with JTB to ensure that tourists are well educated on the customs and immigrations procedures. This way MBCC is able to improve visitors' experiences at the convention center. The Ministry of Tourism is now able to work with customs, making the process of importation of conference equipment easier than before, which has been an advantage to MBCC. MBCC's pricing is based on prices in the US, though there are discounts for local events; MBCC's pricing is very competitive. There is excellent audiovisual equipment on site, a great selection of tables and chairs, and an upgraded Wi-Fi system. MBCC is fully prepared for an extremely busy 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[New Roles, New Opportunities]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[new-roles-new-opportunities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Chamber of Commerce contribute to the development of Montego Bay?</h4><p>The Chamber of Commerce advocates for the benefit of our membership, the expanded business community, and the broader city of Montego Bay. Whenever the need arises, we lobby the government. A prime example is the fact that Montego Bay has been growing both from an economic and a population standpoint, to the extent that we have outgrown the current roads infrastructure. We have been lobbying the government to build a highway or bypass road that will take people outside and around the city of Montego Bay and effectively address this traffic issue. We also advocate and support government initiatives that relate to workforce development to help address the youth unemployment rate, which sits at approximately 30% across Jamaica. The chamber is playing a role through a special initiative that was recently introduced by the Prime Minister.</p><h4>What can be done to make tourism even more beneficial for Montego Bay?</h4><p>There is a great opportunity for attractions. Currently, in Montego Bay, cruise ships come in and people stay in hotels; however, they have to venture out to other areas to participate in attractions. There are opportunities in the attraction space and entertainment, particularly for local entertainment such as live bands and Jamaican performances, allowing tourists to leave their hotels and interact with locals and enjoy the entertainment here. It is a great opportunity for investors in entertainment and attraction ventures.</p><h4>What more could be done in offering affordable transportation for tourists?</h4><p>As Montego Bay's population continues to grow, it is important to improve both public and private transportation options and costs. Part of the challenge is that there are not enough activities to drive people out of their hotels, so taxi drivers are looking for yield as opposed to volume. Structurally, we need to address the issue of getting more people out of their hotels seeing and experiencing Montego Bay. Tourists have to be inclined to try different places rather than worrying about how much it will cost to get there. Once we get to that place where we have more attractions and entertainment within the city, then we should see a drop in the rates. Again, this is something that the chamber can work with different organizations and play a role in moving forward</p><h4>What are the highlights of the growth in local industry, and what are the areas for further development?</h4><p>The BPO sector has been doing well, and we have seen exponential growth in that area. I would like to see the industry play an even greater role in the business value chain, and not just the call center experience. Montego Bay, and Jamaica as a whole, is seeing its role increase in the value chain for large companies. There are also opportunities for agriculture; today, farmers are the reaper, packer, transporter, accountant, and deliveryman. What we need are different groups owning different parts of that value chain to ensure that we have the required scale for a sustainable agriculture industry to supply the needs of the hotels and local economy. We want to see agriculture play a key role in the continued growth of hotels and the hospitality sector. Hotels are more often than not unable to secure locally the volumes of fruits and vegetables that they require, and this is an opportunity for economies of scale in agriculture. They want to source locally but they cannot get it at the requisite quality and volume. The local economy is more than hospitality and tourism; for example, there is an opportunity in the tech industry. We want to make sure that Montego Bay is not left behind in the conversation and is actually involved in the technology space, including fintech. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Why Not Go to Montego?]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[why-not-go-to-montego]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you promote Montego Bay as a tourist destination while also ensuring that there are linkages with the local business community?</h4><p>Montego Bay by itself is a product in the tourism industry. When people speak about tourism in Jamaica, the first place that comes to mind is Montego Bay, and we cherish that Montego Bay is a tourism capital of the Caribbean. The tourism industry in Montego Bay is still the largest employer in St. James. We have over 20,000 hotel rooms, and by 2021 we should have about 26,000-27,000 rooms in Montego Bay. Tourism also supports the agricultural sector, which contributes greatly to feeding tourists. We still have to import some agricultural items; however, with the government's trust in agriculture, we seek to reduce our imports going forward.</p><h4>How do you ensure there is diversification in the economy of Montego Bay? </h4><p>Business process outsourcing (BPO) is a welcome industry because Montego Bay is truly known for tourism. The BPO industry employs over 22,000 people, and based on what we see on the ground, by the end of 2018 we should see close to 30,000 people. There is a projection that it might rival the tourist industry as the government seeks to grow the industry to employ some 250,000 people. In tourism, there are about 102,000-105,000 direct jobs in the formal sector. We also have significant employment through the airport, the port, the banking system, health industry, and the power plant operated by the Jamaica Public Service.</p><h4>Is infrastructure investment one of your priorities?</h4><p>Infrastructure investment is extremely critical. Our infrastructure has outgrown its capacity, and as a result, we tend to have heavy traffic jams, flooding, and a buildup of trash at times. My vision for Montego Bay is to have a cleaner, more orderly, and organized city. I recently returned from China and have learned a lot about smart cities. Thus far, I am pleased with the progress we are making. Our major challenge at this time is our market district, and we will implement measures come December 1, 2017.</p><h4>What would you say to investors looking at Montego Bay?</h4><p>Montego Bay welcomes investors, and the municipality is here to cooperate in whatever way we can. We are here to drive the process and encourage investors because it is the only way that we can achieve our growth agenda. We recently launched a database-driven system whereby applications can be submitted and processed online. However, as a city, we have our own challenges. It will take some time to achieve what we seek to achieve—a peaceful and family-oriented country of which we can be proud. I am just a part of a relay race and the baton is now in my hand. I have to ensure that when I pass on that baton it is done well so that the next holder can continue the relay. We have had some bad times in Jamaica where the baton was dropped, and as a result of that, it took us years to get back on track. There is now greater discipline in the government, including fiscal discipline. As a country, we cannot afford to slip back to where we were five or 10 years ago. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Andrew Holness, the country is in great shape. I lead a team here, and we have 17 councilors, including myself, in the municipality. We are all on the same page; we must do better than those before us. Montego Bay is a great city. I know that when I leave my position, I will leave behind a Montego Bay that is better, nicer, cleaner, and more positive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the highlights of Sol Petroleum since starting operations in Jamaica?</h4><p>Sol is our parent company and was founded a decade ago by Caribbean entrepreneur Sir Kyffin Simpson. The company started operations in 2005 when it purchased the Caribbean assets of Shell, a multinational oil and gas company. Following Sol's initial purchase of Shell's assets in the Eastern Caribbean, Guyana, Suriname, and Belize, Sol expanded to 23 Caribbean territories. This expansion included the conversion of some of Shell's service stations to Sol service stations, as well as the purchase of the Caribbean operations of ESSO in 2014. As a result, Sol operates three separate retail brands (Sol, Shell, and ESSO) across the region. Sol, the largest independent petroleum marketing company in the Caribbean Basin, is one of the region's best business success stories. While Sol and its iconic blue and orange logo may be considered new to Jamaica, its role in the Jamaica energy landscape is significant. Sol solidified its footprint here in Jamaica in June 2013, when the company became the macro distributor for Shell lubricants. Subsequently, Sol partnered with Petrotec to provide bunkering services in the Kingston harbor. We are still quite excited about the introduction of Shell's cutting-edge full synthetic products: Shell Helix Ultra with PurePlus„¢ Technology, which has been available on the market since April 2015. Shell PurePlus„¢ Technology is a revolutionary gas-to-liquid process that converts natural gas into a crystal-clear base oil with virtually none of the impurities found in crude oil. The unique combination of Shell PurePlus technology with active cleansing technology enables Shell Helix Ultra to deliver even higher levels of cleansing and protection for today's engines, making it Shell's most advanced fully synthetic motor oil ever.</p><h4>How does being part of the wider Sol Petroleum Group help your operations in Jamaica?</h4><p>We are in fact the largest petroleum company in the region; we are in 23 locations and employ over 900 talented team members that share best practices. There are many competent professionals in the organization, and we lean on those resources in terms of expertise, advice, and guidance. The company is well known, which speaks volumes for us and makes it easier for us to broker deals.</p><h4>What do you see as other opportunities in the market?</h4><p>We are always exploring various opportunities for growth and are now looking into opportunities such as LPG, aviation, retail, and the commercial fuel business. We are also looking at power generation. We know there is a move now by these companies toward gas and are exploring available opportunities to see how we can add value. As the Panama Canal expands, Jamaica is looking into the new logistics hub, which opens up more opportunities. As a group, we supply our territories through our chartered vessels, and we see Jamaica as a strategic location to service the whole region. The sky is the limit for us here at Sol Petroleum Jamaica.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the transport sector in Jamaica?</h4><p>Jamaica is poised for growth. We are in a great position in the Caribbean and Latin America; therefore, we can only go up from here. There will always be trade, and we are in a position to facilitate a great deal of trade as the port handles a significant amount of transit. Kingston is the seventh-largest natural harbor, and we ought to capture the opportunity to make use of it. Education and skills training will be critical in the future, especially in maritime. The road network is also improving, which means movement of goods by road to port and airport will also be easier. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the highlights of Total Jamaica's presence in the country so far?</h4><p>With a network of close to 60 service stations, Total has the largest number of service stations in Jamaica. We also have assets at the fuel depot Jamaica Petroleum Terminal in Montego Bay. We are in the aviation business at both airports and supply lubricants and special fluids. Total supplies fuels mainly from Petrojam, the local refinery; however, it also imports fuels directly  from the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Total also has a general trade business in Jamaica, which involves B2B activities, where we supply fuel products and lubricants to various businesses in Jamaica. This covers almost every sector, including mining, transport, agriculture, and tourism. Total is an international company; however, Total Jamaica is a Jamaican company working with Jamaicans. We have close to 60 direct employees, and our businesses facilitate the employment of over 1,000 more. One interesting dynamic to our business in Jamaica is diversity; some 68% of Total employees here are women, and women also dominate the local management team. We are committed to developing diversity and training. We offer our employees not just local, but regional careers. We identify talented people who we can move around the region and even send further afield to places such as Paris to develop their skills at our headquarters.</p><h4>Does Total intend to invest in renewables in Jamaica?</h4><p>Total as a group aims to become a major player in renewable energies worldwide, with 30% of its energy mix coming from renewable sources by 2030. In Jamaica, we are defining market opportunities. I am personally enthusiastic about developing solar energy for the local market. Jamaica is one of the best countries for this initiative, because the cost of energy is high here and the tropical climate is a great enabler for solar. Furthermore, there is a strong willingness from the government, whose goal is to source 30% of the country's energy from renewables by 2030. This is exactly the same as Total's global target as a group. Total is involved in biomass and, through SunPower, with solar. SunPower is a leading global company in solar panels and owned by Total. We are also developing in the storage field with batteries with Saft. The very first step is to equip all our service stations in Jamaica with solar panels by 2021.</p><h4>How does Total differentiate itself from the other main players in the Jamaican market?</h4><p>We are investing a great deal in state-of-the-art service stations. Since 2015, we have invested more than USD5 million every year because we believe in the potential of the market. Convenience stores are big business in Jamaica because service stations here are a meeting point for people and where they go for supplies. We are bringing as many services as possible to our customers. We have partnered with a French franchise to offer attractive and quality food service in our stations. Total Jamaica has also recently launched its new generation fuel Total Excellium. This represents a new step in innovation; thanks to our new generation fuels, our customers' vehicles have cleaner engines that consume and pollute less. Total Excellium combines all of Total's technological know-how in its unique formula and reflects a high commitment to quality. We use social media to engage with our customers, and we look to further develop mobile payments for the local market. All these efforts will make customers' lives easier. Another of our goals is to make Total the safest service station in any neighborhood, and we have many initiatives planned in this regard. Because of these commitments to our customers, Total Jamaica Ltd. was selected as the preferred partner to build the first highway service station in Jamaica, which should be ready for business in early 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your advancements so far toward Vision 2030?</h4><p>The Ministry of Energy and the government of Jamaica are implementing renewable energy and energy efficiency programs to achieve certain energy targets by 2030. PCJ is the energy-implementing arm of the government, and we have interests in a wide cross-section of the energy sector. This arm begins with refining, where we have 51% ownership of the Petrojam refinery, 100% ownership of Wigton Windfarm, 100% ownership in the biofuels company Petrojam Ethanol Limited, and other interests in the retail sector, such as Jamaica Aircraft Refuelling Service, one of our joint venture companies. In addition to refining, PCJ is involved in oil and gas exploration. While we are going green on one side, we believe fossil fuels still have some ways to go. We have embarked on several energy efficiency and conservation programs, both with the government and other institutions. We are working with the Inter-American Development Bank, the UN Development Program, and the Ministry of Energy itself. The intention is to reduce our generation from fossil fuels as well as improve our use of renewable energies such as wind and hydro. In a nutshell, our goal is to assist the government in achieving the 2030 Energy Vision. Hopefully, this diversification will result in a reduction of energy costs in Jamaica. We would like to see an improvement of use and reduction of greenhouse gases as well. In recent years, we have done several projects that highlight our success in reaching these goals. Wigton Windfarm has expanded into the largest wind energy facility in the English-speaking region of the Caribbean with just under 63MW of wind energy, a substantial amount. Within PCJ itself, we have completed several energy retrofit programs for hospitals, schools, and government buildings that include installing PV panels and replacing inefficient light bulbs and AC systems with more efficient units.</p><h4>Where do you see potential for renewable energy in Jamaica?</h4><p>We have abundant sunlight, so solar has great potential. The difficulty is that we do not have the landmass to address wide-scale solar. We have to balance solar and wind since we also have great wind potential. We are looking at the possibility of doing offshore wind as well, though that is in the preliminary stages at the moment. My personal view is that we have to look at diversification more to ensure we will have a little bit of everything and not be solely dependent on one source.</p><h4>Could you go into more detail regarding your education and awareness programs?</h4><p>We have fairly extensive energy awareness programs since public education on all energy matters is one of our priorities, especially with youth. Our main vehicle for reaching young people is our Schools Energy Program, where we talk about conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy. We try to explain the national energy challenges and teach them about the importance of efficiency and conservation. This started off with 12 schools and has now expanded to 85. We hold seminars for the students and do tours of energy-producing entities like the Petrojam refinery, Wigton Windfarm, and the JPS hydro plant.  We also take them to entities that have incorporated renewable energy into their operations. These include the new Digicel building, which is highly energy efficient; the Wisynco factory, where the warehouse has an incredible solar operation; and the Grand Palladium Hotel. We also have poster, essay, and science competitions, with a grant of USD4,000 for the winning school to implement a project designed by students. We also do PR campaigns for the general population and go to expos, trade shows, seminars, and lecture series seeking opportunities to engage with the public to push our message of conservation and energy efficiency.</p><h4>What is the potential for biofuels in Jamaica?</h4><p>The biggest opportunity is in the use of gas from sugarcane as well as biofuels and biodiesel from castor oil. Jamaican castor oil is renowned worldwide, and JAMPRO is pushing more production in that area. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main priorities for JPS in the coming years?</h4><p>My number-one priority for the organization will be safety; I have been in the utility industry for 26 years, and safety trumps everything else. Once people get hurt, then no one cares about rates or reliability. That is a priority as well as a value for us. The second priority is making JPS the most effective and efficient organization it can be; therein comes the focus on reliability and service to our customers as well as price. Ultimately, customers want the lights to be on and to pay the lowest possible rate. The number-three priority is the social and economic development of Jamaica, and JPS plays a pivotal role in enabling the economy as one of the primary energy providers to the country. We can do a great deal to enable industry regardless of whether that is manufacturing, mining, or one of the many other industries in the country. We enable it not only with low energy prices but also facilitating new connections. For the most part, when companies look to enter a country or jurisdiction, they look at rates as well as the amount of red tape or regulatory burden they face. In many cases, they will forego the lowest rate if there are too many obstacles and hurdles for them to jump through, which is where JPS can play an important part in enabling new customers to come with the least amount of red tape and the most straightforward transaction in terms of setting up in the country. One of the things I will be doing is working with the regulator here. Regulations make good utilities great, and the regulator can help us do a better job. I want to work in partnership with the regulators and government as we have common goals. In the end, we are both working toward the same thing, which is to serve the people of Jamaica in the best way possible.</p><h4>What are your plans to help bring down prices and make energy more available?</h4><p>While JPS has enabled renewables, we have not really participated in its implementation as much as we could have. This we will start doing much more in a very real way, up to 10 times the amount of renewables that we have today. Jamaica is blessed with sun, wind, and water. There is also potential with biomass and waste energy, so we will look into all these different options and evaluate them in light of the latest technology. In five years, solar might not be the most economic, but will be easiest to implement since Jamaica has already installed several solar and wind farms. We are well on our way to developing more hydro, and there is still a great deal of untapped hydro potential we can utilize on the island. We can evaluate some of the waste energy options that would be useful for Jamaica, depending on how they rank in terms of their cost. In 10 years, half of Jamaica's energy may very well come from renewable sources such as hydro, wind, and waste. This is our goal and objective, which is higher than the Vision 2030 target. Looking at the implementation of renewables, we cannot forget the cost of electricity. There will be environmental benefits as well as cost implications that we simply cannot afford. For instance, achieving some of the goals of the country—even 30%—would require something in the order of at least USD1 billion in investment. If we could achieve renewables that come in at or below the marginal cost of existing generation, this would imply no rate increases to customers to implement renewables. Implementing renewables at any cost is not an option. The generation has to be there to back up renewables so that consumer rates do not increase. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the sector evolved over the past few years in terms of the services you offer and the level of education of your employees?</h4><p>The services offered are continuously evolving. A few years ago, the services were basic, requiring little decision-making and variability such as transferring data from a physical healthcare form to an application for upload. Over time, we have become attractive for more complex processes such as finance and accounting, and with the talent pool educated to handle this, our services delivered include finance, accounting, and HR outsourcing, with medical and legal outsourcing on our radar. Today, we deliver services that are more complex and require undergraduate degrees and, in some cases, graduate degrees as well as specific professional qualification such as the charted professional accountant certification. The labor pool in Jamaica is of an extremely high quality, for example, 60% of our employees at a tier-one level are either in college or have a degree, and this is not a pre-requisite for the positions. This is one factor that allows us to deliver the high-quality output we provide to our clients. Most of our revenue is driven by clients in the top 15 companies on the Forbes list of Fortune 500 companies.</p><h4>Does the BPO industry have the ability to reshape the economy of Jamaica?</h4><p>Comparing our unemployment rate and BPO numbers from five years ago with those of today, there is a direct impact. Sutherland specifically has grown by 1,000 employees per year over the past five years to more than 5,000 today. Jamaica continues to be attractive for BPO investment and growth for several reasons, which include location and high proficiency in English. This industry has the ability to not just dramatically improve unemployment numbers but also improve the quality of jobs. To achieve this, we invest in technology. The objective is to automate lower-tier jobs that require little decision-making and have little variability, freeing up resources that can be developed to take on higher-tier functions. The income that accompanies higher-tier jobs will add value.</p><h4>How does Sutherland differentiate itself from competitors?</h4><p>Our main differentiators are our employee engagement initiatives, high-caliber clientele, and ability to consistently deliver performance excellence to our clients. We have promoted more than 137 employees by two levels or more over the last year. This, and our employee engagement specialist, confirms our commitment to grow and develop our employees. We also engage the community through our Community Technology Centre (CTC) program in partnership with Microsoft. This program targets youth who have either dropped out of high school or lack the pre-requisites for a tertiary education. We have certified close to 2,000 people, and a lot of these youth go on to work for Sutherland through an apprenticeship program, making it a great sourcing mechanism for solid candidates.</p><h4>What projects or goals will you focus on in the coming year?</h4><p>We are now looking at opening our fifth site and in 2018 could be opening two more. Our ultimate objective is to get to 10,000 employees, which should be possible if the talent is available. We are also the only BPO company that has partnered with a college, Portmore Community College, where we have launched an associate's degree program in business process management specific to our industry. We worked with the college to develop the curriculum and are committed to providing paid internships for every student that graduates. We are in the process of signing an MoU with the University of the West Indies to launch master's degree programs. Another objective is targeting high-unemployment areas and generating further economic impact. We will see significant growth in our leadership tier and may see another 200 employees promoted two levels or more in 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Guardian Life evolved since 1999?</h4><p>We have been operating in Jamaica since 1999. During the financial meltdown, the Guardian Holdings board decided to invest and purchased the portfolios of five insurance companies in Jamaica that were being sold by the government through FINSAC, which were then consolidated to form Guardian Life Ltd. We have been able to grow and develop over the years; our average RoE for the past five years is about 27%, and we have been able to achieve a great deal as an organization. As a start-up, we were just in group life, pensions, and individual life. In 2006, we entered the group health business and in 2017 entered the individual health business. We now have the full suite of individual and group products.</p><h4>What are the benefits of having such a diversified portfolio?</h4><p>The key thing here is to be a one-stop shop for life insurance, health, and pension products and services. There are more people starting up small businesses that cannot now qualify for group health coverage, which presents a great opportunity to grow this business. These start-ups, as well as individuals who are unable to access group health coverage, have also presented a great opportunity for the individual health market; our decision to enter this market has been influenced by such factors.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the mobile health unit you launched last year?</h4><p>One of the key things is to be proactive, and an important feature of healthcare is early detection. Our mobile unit works in collaboration with companies and other small employers to make basic health checks available to their employees free of cost. We also go into communities and offer free health checks to residents, as well as do “back-to-school" check-ups for students.</p><h4>What are the challenges and opportunities in the life insurance sector?</h4><p>Unemployment is falling, which is great, as it means more people have the ability to pay premiums. We try to convince our clients and prospects that having life insurance should be a key part of their financial planning, so that their goals and dreams for their families will still materialize even if they become critically ill or die. We are positive about the economy and what is happening. The country has gone through a tough time, and we are not out of the woods yet; however, we see positive signs. For example, tourism is growing, which means increased employment and growth in other sectors, such as agriculture and entertainment. When these things happen, more people are able to afford insurance.</p><h4>You are also diversifying in real estate. How do you plan to grow in this and other sectors?</h4><p>As the economy grows, like in any other modern city, people need somewhere to live. What we are doing here is developing this neck of the woods, but it is not just us. There is the BMW franchise, which is part of the ATL Group. We also understand that a Marriot Hotel and the IDB head office will be built nearby. Our development is in the New Kingston area and gives convenient access to all the facilities available in New Kingston, whilst being removed from the hustle and bustle of its commercial life. In the past, investing in government instruments was enough to provide a reasonable return to shareholders; however, the government has wisely sought to bring down interest rates to allow for more lending for people to develop businesses and grow the economy. This should reduce the dependence on government instruments and encourage investment in critical areas that will fuel economic growth. We see housing as one such area and are looking at other residential developments and opportunities as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the keys to CAB's success, and what have been the highlights of the company?</h4><p>Because we place a high value on our clients' needs, we are known in the marketplace as advocates of our clients. We fight for them. In addition, our outstanding team takes the time to educate our clients, which is a key component to our high customer service delivery at CAB. While the average person may only consider the cost of insurance, not realizing that the cheaper option is not necessarily in their best interest, CAB educates all its clients with the best option available for their personal needs. CAB ensures its prices are competitive because the brokerage arena is characterized by fierce competition, and as such clients shop around. With constant market intelligence, research, ongoing reviews and client feedback, and innovative initiatives, the company continues to differentiate itself from its competitors. Additionally, CAB owns several products that allow it to provide clients with more competitive rates. The company also generates at least 65% of its electrical needs via solar energy. Electricity is a major cost driver in Jamaica, and this has given CAB a tremendous advantage to operate at a lower cost and pass these savings to customers.</p><h4>Who are your main clients today?<br></h4><p>CAB offers a variety of insurance products and services, resulting in us having a variety of clients, including corporate entities and individual clients. We have many individual clients, mainly from our local life and health, general insurance, credit union benefits portfolio, and international high net-worth individual plans.</p><h4>What specific projects are you working on right now?</h4><p>There are many strategic and innovative initiatives currently being pursued, both new and improved, that will significantly propel the company to the next level and be counted as another pioneering first in the industry. The company will use these to continue to revolutionize how the industry does business and is in keeping with the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit that CAB is synonymous with. In recognition of our loyal and valued clients, we recently introduced another value proposition, our Caribbean Assurance Brokers Loyalty Programme (CABLP). We want our clients to continue to love doing business with us; therefore, we are providing them with access to benefits, such as savings, discounts, and cashback at over 200 merchants and provider locations island-wide. These include leading supermarkets, wellness centers, retail stores, hotels, pharmacies, hospitals, valuators, restaurants, gyms, car dealers and much more. We even engaged an entity out of Canada to provide us with the analytics for our merchants and providers to understand how they benefit from giving discounts to our clients. In addition, we are currently in the process of adding an e-commerce component to our website, which will soon be launched.  Our clients will have ease of access to simply make online purchases in a safe environment. This will also facilitate any prospective clients from other Caribbean islands. There are also plans to expand our travel insurance product throughout the island. We recognized that a considerable number of tourists travel to the Caribbean without travel insurance, and it is not until they arrive that they consider purchasing a plan. These are only a few of the initiatives that we have in the pipeline. Our strategic marketing and integrated communication plan have assisted in building our quality brand equity and will continue to be one of the tools we use to reinforce the company's competitive advantages, exceptional products, and highly qualified and respected team. Our outstanding social corporate responsibility mandate will also allow us to remain one of the most respected major players in the industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you help Jamaicans reach their financial goals?</h4><p>We were established 139 years ago in 1878 by a group of clergymen who wanted to promote financial inclusion for ordinary Jamaicans. Financial inclusion is still a relevant issue in Jamaica in 2017. What we do is try and make it easier for customers to open accounts. More importantly, we deliver value to them through higher interest rates on savings and lower mortgage rates. Our commitment fees for new residential mortgages are 0.5%, compared to 2% and up to 3% elsewhere. We also offer a 15% discount on our evaluation services provided by Victoria Mutual Property Services. Therefore, as a complete package, our product makes it easier for a first time homeowner to get a start on their property journey. </p><h4>Do you also help SMEs? </h4><p>We do, particularly through Victoria Mutual Investments Ltd., via which we just launched an IPO to provide far more financing for SMEs using insurance premium financing, lease financing, and regular commercial loans. We have also been active in terms of providing corporate finance services to medium-sized enterprises through VM Wealth and helping them get listed by helping them raise equity and debt capital via bonds, among others. On these fronts, we have been very active. </p><h4>Can you tell us more about Prime Asset Management, which recently rebranded to become Victoria Mutual?</h4><p>It will become Victoria Mutual Pensions Management and is probably the largest independent pension fund manager, since most others operate as part of life insurance companies. The prospects of growth here are strong because only 10% of people employed by the private sector are covered by a pension plan, in contrast to government employees. Hence, there is a huge untapped market for pension fund coverage. We have an approved retirement scheme we believe is suitable for that market and intend to market it heavily in the new year; we just wanted to improve the technology we use first. Thereafter, we will be aggressively driving the growth of the approved retirement scheme for people in SMEs, the self-employed, and professionals in the markets we are going for. </p><h4>What opportunities do you see for investment in Jamaica?</h4><p>The macroeconomic conditions are quite favorable now; we have record low interest rates, low inflation, and public debt to GDP is still high but declining, which was made possible by more disciplined fiscal management since 2013. Therefore, the confidence level from both businesses and individuals is high, which encourages investment. We also have a competitive exchange rate that helps the productive sector. What needs to happen now is for private entrepreneurs to start taking risks and taking their good business plans off the shelves and figuring out how to exploit these positive conditions. We want to help with this in several ways through Victoria Mutual Investments Ltd. First of all, people need to insure their businesses. Second, to equip a factory or office you need to acquire and install equipment, and we can provide lease financing for this. Third, you may wish to expand by way of buying a new factory, office, or space, and we can provide a commercial loan to do so. If you are going to raise equity by way of an IPO, our team can advise you on that whole process and put the entire package together to help you with the prospectus. So far, we have not been providing a lot of underwriting services like that. The final thing we want to look at is providing private equity financing down the road. There are small companies that do not intend to go public at this point, but probably will in five or seven years. With a partner such as Victoria Mutual Investments Ltd. they could access some capital and know-how in terms of governance practices to facilitate that growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your group's vision and contribution to Jamaica?</h4><p>With 144 years of history behind us, the group has always sought to ensure that its products and services are accessible to all Jamaicans, facilitate their individual growth and development, and assist them in achieving their respective financial aspirations. As a pioneer in providing home ownership through the Jamaica National Building Society (JNBS) for more than 14 decades, the organization has served to elevate the prospects of Jamaicans wherever in the world they live. This ethos is underpinned by a deep commitment to the concept of mutuality, where all members have the same rights irrespective of the level of their business with us. JNBS has consistently supported and fostered a sense of innovation throughout its 144-year history. Examples of these span both JN's business expansions as well as its numerous corporate social responsibility initiatives. This commitment to bold innovation and to serving the country has always been the foci of its strategy, which we plan to continue into the future. Our initiative with Microsoft 17 years ago, for example, revolutionized the local remittance sector with the introduction of internet-based remittances through one of our subsidiaries, JN Money Services (JNMS). At that time, it took days or weeks to deliver remittances to Jamaica. JN, however, decided to boldly challenge this and partner with a world-class innovator to deliver a new and more efficient way to remit funds to Jamaica. That spurred one of JNMS' popular slogans, 'As you quint it reach!', allowing people to receive a remittance the very same day that it was sent. That is routine today, but 17 years ago was a bold innovation. JN has always been committed to improving the welfare of its members and the wider Jamaican community. In the area of education, the JN Group, with its roots in rural Jamaica, helped its members by directly improving education in concert with the Ministry of Education via the Centres of Excellence and iLead programs. </p><h4>How have you restructured and rebranded the group into a commercial bank?</h4><p>JN Bank was launched in early 2017, emerging from the previous Jamaica National Building Society (JNBS), which dated back to the Westmoreland Building Society in 1874. With the ardent support of our members, JNBS was restructured to become the Jamaica National Group, a holding company that would facilitate member companies in conjunction with two other holding companies of the group. The services of some of these companies had been restricted for being direct subsidiaries of a deposit-taking institution, so the building society was converted to a commercial bank and is now JN Bank, an independent subsidiary, while JN Fund Managers (JNFM) is the investment management company within the group. There is also JN General Insurance Company (JNGI), JN Life Insurance (JNLI), and JN Cayman, a building society in the Cayman Islands, a subsidiary of JN Bank. Other member companies of the financial services group are JN Small Business Loans (JNSBL) and JN Money Services (JNMS), the remittance company.   </p><h4>What is your growth strategy in a competitive financial sector?</h4><p>JN Bank has become the dominant non-government mortgage player in Jamaica with more than 600,000 members and approximately 20,000 persons who access mortgages from the company. Our banking model is built on respect for all members, which resulted in our superior customer engagement. This theme of respect is echoed throughout all the subsidiaries in the group. This central value proposition of customer service drives a significant portion of our activities across all our entities. As a group, the management team met a year ago and established about five or six objectives, which included remaining the premier mixed conglomerate in Jamaica and increasing our international business, among others. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of your ministry in dealing with the issue of unemployment?</h4><p>Unemployment is one of the most persistent problems in Jamaica. Part of it is a structural issue that relates to inadequate training for many of our young people who reach working age without being fully trained. There are a number of things we have to do; we need to ramp up training and are doing so with the Human Employment And Resource Training (HEART) program to train more young people who have gone through the high school system but dropped out without any formal certification. We are aggressively working on building more investment; however, with investment comes greater demand for trained workers, and we have to ensure we attract investment while having trained workers. A great example of that is the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector; Jamaica is the third-largest English speaking country in the Western hemisphere behind only the US and Canada even though we have about 2.8 million people. That is a large selling point for BPO and one for which we must ramp up the training of more young people. A few years ago, we had about 5,000 people employed in BPO, while today the figure is now 25,000. We are targeting 50,000 in two years and can reach 100,000 in five. </p><h4>Are you working to overcome the inconsistencies of Jamaican farming?</h4><p>We are working with farmers' groups that have come together and organized themselves. One example of a great program we are about to significantly expand is the Rural Economic Development Initiative (REDI) with the World Bank, where we introduce greenhouse technology so farmers can produce higher volumes in controlled climatic conditions. This could quadruple production in volume and quality. We have completed REDI 1 and are now applying to the World Bank to get REDI 2 going, a USD40 million project to get more small farmers across Jamaica involved. These projects are beginning to bear fruit, which is why unemployment has fallen from 12.9% in 2016 to 11.3% in 2017 in an environment where the actual labor force is growing, a great sign.</p><h4>How do you encourage the private sector to provide more accessible financial services at better rates?</h4><p>We have to push the private sector because some of our commercial banking institutions have become too comfortable with high interest rates. We have to bring in mechanisms and have two that are currently supported by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and World Bank called partial credit guarantees. The idea is to sell off credit to SMEs that are compromised with collateral but have solid business ideas. We provide partial credit guarantees that can give them a chance to get a loan at a reasonable interest rate. We have also launched a financial inclusion strategy at the Bank of Jamaica aimed at creating an atmosphere of financial literacy directed at more formal economies. Currently, 40% of our economy is informal, and we need to become more formal. The more formal we get, the smoother we will be able to integrate into the global economy.</p><h4>International institutions have highlighted the need for public sector reform in Jamaica. How do you plan to increase the efficiency of public services?</h4><p>We are undergoing a fairly ambitious program of public sector reform and transformation, among which is building greater efficiency, re-training government workers, and outsourcing some of the activities that should be in the private sector. The wage-to-GDP ratio is too high in the public sector, and many activities should rightly be in the private sector. We have targeted 84 companies for closure, merger, and divestment into the private sector or put them back into central government. This is across the entire government; however, the first four I have targeted in my ministry are the Caymanas Race Track, the Jamaica Racing Commission to regulate horse racing, Betting Gaming and Lotteries Commission, which regulates overall gaming, and the Casino Gaming Commission. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Capital Hindsight]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[capital-hindsight]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate your impact on the Jamaican economy?</h4><p>Our role is to facilitate capital formation and secondary market activities, and the role of which is extremely important to the Jamaican economy. This is especially significant in light of the fact that it is very difficult in most cases for SMEs to get capital to grow, expand, and compete. When the interest rate is high, it is even more critical that the stock market plays a pivotal role in ensuring that these companies can be properly capitalized and that there is a place for them in terms of growing the economy. While we cater to all companies seeking to raise capital, since 2009 we have focused heavily on ensuring that the facility to raise capital is attractive and, as a result, have partnered with the government in terms of special dispensation for SMEs to raise capital on the market. The secondary market is also extremely important. Again, going through the cycle from trading to settlement, we also have a securities depository. It is extremely important in this scheme of the capital market to encourage confidence, the raising of capital, and secondary market transactions.</p><h4>What have been some recent successes of the stock exchange market?</h4><p>In 2015, Bloomberg recognized us as the best-performing exchange in the world. In 2016, we were among the top 10, and in 2017 we continue to hold our own. In terms of the statistics, our results are not a flash in the pan but a result of the level of interest that people show in the market based on the fact that we have had a concentrated effort on market education. In addition, our 13 broker members have shifted their focus somewhat from concentrating too much on debt instruments to equities and galvanizing SMEs to taking advantage of the market. The fact is that every subscription since 2009 has been oversubscribed, which means people are also recalibrating their portfolio such that instead of concentrating heavily on fixed-income securities or banks, part of those funds are flowing into the capital market.</p><h4>What incentives are in place to enter the Jamaican Stock Exchange?</h4><p>In 2009, we felt it was important to grow the equities market, and our discussion with the government was on growing both the supply and demand side of the market. The government decided that on its end it would provide companies with a tax holiday. SMEs have a 10-year tax holiday, namely five years where they pay no corporate tax and another five years where they pay 50% of the prevailing rate. There is always the question of whether the government has the resources to forego those taxes; however, all the studies we have conducted have shown the move is tax positive. The government may provide relief on corporate taxes but PAYE, NIS, NHT, and GCT taxes all show tremendous growth for the government. Therefore, it is a win-win situation as companies become more compliant, those on the stock exchange are more sustainable, and there is significant growth seen when a company lists as there is immediate transformation and growth, no matter from the standpoint of corporate governance or profitability. </p><h4>What are your current projects and do you plan to have more companies listed?</h4><p>We certainly do, which is why we have partnered with the Multilateral Investment Fund, an arm of the IDP. The idea was to promote access to equity capital, and the project takes us to potential listing companies to talk about their appetite to come to market and see where they have deficiencies. We assist the companies in terms of their business plans, financials, corporate governance, and any other aspect that may prevent them from coming in. The project has been extremely successful, and we have many SMEs preparing themselves for market in the pipeline. This speaks of the sustainability of the exchange and of being in synch with the government's thrust for growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[chris-perry-ceo-open-blue]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the evolution of Open Blue in Panama?</h4><p>We have been operating here in Panama for almost 10 years. We are a mission-driven organization, with a core purpose of feeding current and future generations in harmony with the ocean. This is important because the global population on the planet continues to grow rapidly. When we think about food security and how we will feed ourselves, we will require new innovative ways to produce our protein. Open Blue has developed a new paradigm in agriculture. Our biggest differentiation point is that we are a truly open ocean offshore site. We are located 12km offshore, far away from sensitive nearshore ecosystems in a high-energy, pristine environment that is natural for the fish. Cobia is native to the waters here that we operate in, which is a critical component for us. Over these 10 years, we have had many challenges as well as accomplishments.</p><h4>What are some of the main benefits of producing and consuming cobia?</h4><p>Cobia is a marine white-fin fish and its unique attributes relate to nutrition, culinary applications and the rapid grow out cycle. It is high in omega-3 and is a dense, flavorful fish. Many people compare it to black cod and other premium species. There are not many fish with such a broad scope of versatility, which is why professional chefs and home cooks love it. It has the meatiness of a steak, is of high quality, and tastes great.</p><h4>How much cobia do you produce per year?</h4><p>We think about our production  in terms of biomass harvested and processed; we processed about 1,200 tons in 2017 and will do 1,800 tons in 2018 and 3,700 tons in 2019. Our production cycle is 12-14 months. Another unique attribute is that we are able to get a target harvest size in about 12-14 months from egg to a harvest size of over 5kg. That is twice as fast as salmon, which is around 2.5 to three years.</p><h4>Your exports amounted to USD11 million in 2017. What is the target for 2018 and to which markets?</h4><p>For 2018, it will be roughly double that, between USD22 and 23 million. Our core markets currently are the Americas, including Panama, and Europe. In North America, we have a three-pillar approach. One is national accounts, which are big box retailers such as Publix for example and we recently completed a promotion with Bonefish Grill. Our national accounts will be the primary volume takers as we continue to expand our national footprint in North America. The other two channels we focus on are distributor partners who move the product into their customer base within their key areas and North American Asian markets. In Europe, where we are selling into Italy, UK, Germany, and Switzerland, our focus is across multiple channels in those respective markets, primarily focused on major retailers and food service customers.</p><h4>How important is sustainability for Open Blue?</h4><p>It is critical; when we think about sustainability within our environmental,social and government strategy, the environmental component is obviously critical to ensure we are working in harmony with the ocean and supporting the social environments that we work in. Another important area we are focused on related to sustainability and the ocean is our our feed and diet of the animal. . This includes a focus on animal welfare and delivering a diet that will provide our fish  with their nutritional requirements. Our social focus is also critical to what we do, especially in the communities that we operate in. For many of these communities, we are the primary employer and have made significant direct investments in scholarship programs, drilling freshwater wells, and more.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for 2018?</h4><p>For 2018, we are at a critical inflection point as we move to profitability. We are still at a relatively early stage in our life cycle relative to the amount of volume we are producing. In 2018 we are focused on delivering that USD22-million figure as well as preparing for 2019. A great deal of what we are doing now is setting up for 2019 given our production cycles. We are excited about the many opportunities ahead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on your activities as a business school?</h4><p>The Mona Institute of Business started nearly 30 years ago as an initiative between UWI and the US Agency for International Development (USAID). The institute evolved over time to become the Mona School of Business (MSB) offering only graduate programs, while the university offered undergraduate business and management programs through the department of management studies (DOMS). In 2012, a decision was made to merge MSB and DOMS to become the Mona School of Business and Management (MSBM). The merger has been successful and it is doing well. MSBM is now the largest business and management school in the Caribbean. We are a company limited by guarantee, so we are separate and independent, while still being part of the university. UWI has a robust quality assurance mechanism to maintain quality across its institutions. For example, our MBA program was recently re-accredited by the Association of MBAs (AMBA). We are currently the only business school in the Caribbean with five years accreditation. Eduniversal International has consistently ranked MSBM programs in the top 20 in Latin America and the Caribbean region. In 2017, we had quality assurance training for all members of staff. We want to ensure that we have continuous improvement and that MSBM is at the cutting edge for all our programs.</p><h4>How does Mona contribute to Jamaica's economy?</h4><p>We have academic programs for undergraduates and graduates. We offer executive education with short courses for professional executives and management training. We regularly hold seminars and forums engaging parties from outside the university on various topics. We have our own applied research publication called The MSBM Business Review. We frequently interact with public and private sector organizations. MSBM also has a strong alumni network, so there is an ongoing connection between the school and its graduates. Being a part of UWI means we are also aware that this is a regional university with four campuses: three physical and one virtual. We are thus able to reach not just Jamaica, but the wider Caribbean, because we are part of the UWI family. We have made a significant contribution in terms of educating the population. We have recently introduced some new programs, such as our master of science in corporate finance and another in logistics and supply chain management because Jamaica is working to become a logistics hub. We also offer a master of science in marketing and data analytics and another in procurement management. MSBM has trained many executives across various sectors. For our doctor of business administration, we have had several executives from the National Commercial Bank (NCB) graduate from this program.</p><h4>How does the Mona School of Business and Management differentiate itself from other business schools in the region?</h4><p>A key difference between Mona and other local business schools is that we do far more research, both pure research for academic publication and applied research. This is important because we are then able to provide the new knowledge that is used for innovation. Historically, a great deal of the research we used came from outside of Jamaica. However, we have come to realize over the years that context matters. Therefore, we are leading the way in doing Caribbean specific research. For example, we recently partnered with NCB to conduct specialized research on corporate transformation. We not only produced academic publications out of that project, but also provided the financial services sector with new knowledge specific to that sector. Before that research, Caribbean financial services were lumped in with the broader Latin American space, so they had lost their unique identity. Mona and NCB's research is the first on Caribbean financial services. A great deal of the work we generate is being used by the business community. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Caribbean Maritime University contribute to making Jamaica a logistics hub? </h4><p>This institution represents a transformation in the Jamaican education and training landscape at the tertiary level. For years, we operated as a closed economy. We would import many goods, primarily bananas and sugar, and export certain services such as tourism. As globalization took root, we saw the pattern of world trade shifting from north to south. We were no longer just importing from Europe, but from China and the Far East. The most direct route would be goods arriving on the west coast and going through the Panama Canal, which was a shortcut to the Caribbean and the east coast of the US, though these were limited by the size of access. Up until 2016, they could only take ships carrying 4,800TEUs. Back in 2005, when the expansion of the Canal was being planned, the largest ship afloat was 6,000TEUs, and there were projections that in the coming years it could reach 8,000TEUs. However, by the time the canal opened in 2016, ships had already surpassed 18,000TEUs. The growth in this industry is now exponential, and the canal is still not sufficient to service existing trade. The second shift has to do with how goods and services are produced globally. We are now living in a mass customization age and need to customize goods just before they reach the final consumer. It is no longer about making a final product in China and shipping it to consumers directly; it is about utilizing special economic zones (SEZs) as areas that can do the final touches and send them on. We are now leveraging our geostrategic location to create value added. This is what being a global logistics hub is about. </p><h4>How is the evolution from an institute to a university helping you achieve your vision? </h4><p>A large part of it is branding while another is funding; at the end of the day, people perceive institutes and universities differently. It gives us a larger stake in the game, and there are now funds we have access to. The government now recognizes that we play a critical role in economic development. Now that we have achieved this status, a great deal is now on our shoulders. It gives us an opportunity to add greater value and be part of the transformation. </p><h4>Jamaicans used to travel abroad for higher education. Is that paradigm shifting today? </h4><p>That is correct. We have students coming here now for education from all around the world—from Africa, Egypt, Peru, the US, and Europe. Human capital is critical because we are dealing with high-level skills that are the most important when attracting companies to the SEZ. In our core programs, international students comprise about 10%, which we hope to increase. We now have a campus in Antigua and are looking to penetrate both Africa and China soon. That is in our five-year plan. We also have many international certifications. We have been certified by Lloyd's for our quality management system and have institutional accreditation from the Accreditation Service for International Schools (ASIC) in the UK. What's more, seven of our degrees are fully accredited by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in the UK. We are the only whitelisted trading institution in the English-speaking Caribbean. We have neutral recognition from the UK and EU in terms of maritime trade. We are second to none, offering a similar or even better education at lower rates. </p><h4>How do you apply the "blue ocean strategy" to your institution? </h4><p>We redefined the maritime tertiary education space. The traditional approach was to offer degrees and produce programs catering only to the cognitive side of learners, leaving the practical skills for training institutions. We ventured into a section of the market that everyone said should never be touched at the tertiary level: affective domain and getting into the psyche of their behavior. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What did the launch of GWest bring to Jamaica?</h4><p>
	The idea behind GWest is to create a modern medical environment, which allows my colleagues and I to practice medicine in Montego Bay similar to the way I was trained in the US. We needed to create a medical environment that was modern, efficient, and provided a high quality of service. Hospiten is here, so we are not the only players in the market. There are similarities; however, there are also some major differences. For example, Hospiten is perhaps more interested in tourists than the local market, whereas the local market is our primary market. People coming to work and live in Jamaica usually have three questions. They want to know about the crime rate, the education system, and the availability of healthcare. There are many Jamaicans in North America and the UK, who are retiring or thinking of coming back to live. Having a place like this gives them a level of comfort and reassurance that they will receive quality care. In addition to taking care of the local market, it is also important to take care of the Jamaican diaspora. Thirdly, we want to eventually do more medical tourism.
</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the health of the population and the medical services that they receive?<br>
</h4><p>
	Basic healthcare is reasonable, and the quality of personnel is high, as there is an intelligent population. What we most lack is financial resources. Therefore, much of the equipment in our public hospitals is older and not maintained well. Our diet is still relatively healthy; people still exercise and walk. It will be interesting to see in 25 years how this will change. We see more obese people now than we did 25 years ago. People drink and smoke; still, these are not huge societal problems. The basics are taken care of; however, at the moment the public healthcare system is stretched thin and a great deal of the care ends up being done privately. This benefits the private sector to some degree because, in a place like Canada or elsewhere, things will be done by the public system because it has those resources.
</p><h4>
	Do you address international and local customers differently?
</h4><p>
	We give the same kind of care to all. However, we have some ideas on how to attract international clients. For example, because labor is cheaper here, an operation such as a joint replacement may cost 30-40% less than in Florida. Therefore, it is possible to attract people who need that surgery and can get a vacation at the same time. It is also possible to attract international doctors to do the surgeries and have some time to relax afterwards. GWest operates four core facilities. There is an urgent care center, which opened in November 2017. Our lab opened in January 2018. In late 2018, we will open an ambulatory surgery center, with two large operating rooms and two small rooms, and a small overnight in-patient facility of eight beds. We do not seek to be a fully-fledged hospital; our main emphasis is on outpatient care. We are considering plans to open similar centers in other parts of Jamaica, where there is nothing quite like this with a wide range of services. There will be many practitioners, surgeons, and specialists using our facilities such as the surgery center and the lab.</p><h4>What are your priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>
	There are several priorities. One is to complete the facility and get the whole group of services completely integrated and running smoothly. We are dealing with people, and getting the right team in place, training, and so on takes time. This first year is completing the process of getting it right. Then, we ramp up the marketing, develop our client base and partnerships. This includes maybe operating in other geographical locations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Medicanja recently received orphan drug status for Chrysoeriol from the FDA. Would you tell us about the development and future vision of this product?</h4><p>As far as I am aware, this is the first time a developing country has had an orphan drug approved by the FDA for its potential to treat leukemia. Medicanja started work on this about six years ago. We looked at how we could get out of the stereotype of looking at cannabis as a crude drug resource. As the cannabis business frees up and more businesses get involved, it will become unattractive financially. This is why we decided to go into nutraceuticals as well as pharmaceuticals. We are fortunate that our research on medicinal plants over the years has given us great leverage to move into this new pathway. I need to give credit to the University of Maryland Medical School, which has supported us, along with friends and family who could see we were onto something great. We expect the FDA and NIH to support us financially as we work toward commercialization.</p><h4>What are your other products and projects?<br></h4><p>We are likely to make a second submission to the FDA early in 2018 for a pancreatic cancer drug. This type of cancer is deadly and usually kills most people within six months of diagnosis. If we can develop and bring this drug to market, Jamaica will be on the world map for finding a product to manage a major global medical problem. Apart from the pharmaceuticals we have done a great deal of nutraceuticals work. We have developed a nutraceutical called Alpha Prostate Formula. However, because of its efficacy and no toxicity, doctors are prescribing it for enlarged prostate and the prevention of prostate cancer. We have also developed a total of 10 other nutraceuticals as supplements. These are medicinal treatments that we select, formulate, and blend. In addition, we have what we call cosmeceuticals, skin products, developed from our plant products. This is potentially a multi-billion-dollar business. At this time, we need investors to support our work because it is expensive. Finally, we have developed the first and only health and wellness facility in the region, Eden Gardens Wellness and Lifestyle. We have a corporate structure with a one-of-a-kind hotel containing 22 suites and three restaurants, one of which is purely vegetarian. We hold corporate events here and have a number of healthcare practitioners, such as nutritionists and chiropractors.</p><h4>How do you assess the global potential for medical cannabis?</h4><p>I have been involved in this type of work since 1972, and  I am the only person who has been granted the retail and therapeutic licenses in the areas I wanted. We are just awaiting our dispensary license. We are the only company involved with cannabis R&amp;D to have had eight products approved by the Ministry of Health and licensed by the Jamaica Cannabis Licensing Authority. We also have a biotech R&amp;D institute on the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies. This research facility is used to develop both our nutraceuticals and cannabis-based products. In theory, Medicanja could be looking at an annual revenue of over USD100 million when we build out our market in the next three years or so. The nutraceutical industry is worth over half a trillion dollars, so I am looking for investors who can come on board and join us as we move forward. The lack of access to loans and funding for businesses in Jamaica has to change. For example, in my small operation I employ 135 people, which has had quite an impact, but we cannot keep doing this indefinitely unless we get loans or grants.</p><h4>Are you considering listing the company?</h4><p>Yes, possibly in first or second quarter of 2018. All market indicators suggest that it is timely and should be successful. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the vision behind launching the university, and what are the highlights of your journey?</h4><p>We are currently celebrating our 25th anniversary and will celebrate until the opening of our new facility on our main campus in spring 2018. When we started, thousands of young Jamaicans and high school graduates were leaving the country to seek better educational opportunities abroad. At the time, there was only one university in Jamaica, the University of the West Indies, and access to tertiary education was, therefore, limited in the country. It was even more difficult for working adults to go to the only university at the time; it was just not convenient or flexible. We lost many adults and working people who sought additional educational opportunities abroad. We saw that as an opportunity to establish a non-traditional post-secondary type institution, which led to the establishment of the then Institute of Management Sciences (IMS). From there, we started to offer degrees and diplomas to these adults, largely on a part-time basis, and created a vehicle for them to access quality post-secondary education. It was successful and grew rapidly, such that after 10 years we acquired the largest private post-secondary institution, the Institute of Management and Production (IMP), which had been around since 1976. We competed in a very competitive bid and were successful in acquiring it. The merger in 2004 resulted in the formation of the first university college in Jamaica and the Caribbean, the UCC.</p><h4>How are you evolving in terms of strategy?</h4><p>We originally focused only on working professionals, and the main focus is still there. That was the model for IMS too, with working professionals making up 90-95% of the student body and the remaining 5-10% being high school graduates studying on a full-time basis. We still have that model, though we look to change it, especially with the physical expansion where we will have more conducive facilities at our main campus and will be able to provide for more students on a full-time basis. Our mission is to reach out to a larger number of high school graduates seeking full-time studies. The kind of technology we are embarking on will infuse our curriculum with programs that are more relevant and adaptive to younger students leaving high school. We also continue to build additional connections with universities abroad. The Caribbean has huge potential, and Jamaica, in particular, is well positioned to be a destination to export higher education.</p><h4>What are your plans for to set up a knowledge city in Jamaica?</h4><p>We seek to establish Caribbean Knowledge City (CKC) or University Town in Kingston or in St. Ann; we have a comprehensive business plan with the government of Jamaica, with significant support from the UDC &amp; JAMPRO. It will be a major physical infrastructure that could be part of the planned Caymanas development or in Saint Ann. CKC will be developed in partnership with the China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC), which will develop some 700ha in Kingston. CKC will attract and house international students, as well as attract high-quality universities from the UK and the US, similar to the model in Dubai. We aim to have up to 5,000 students in the first year. CKC will be a larger and more comprehensive structure that will not only look at the traditional delivery or higher education but research and innovative e-products and commercialization as a true knowledge city. CHEC will hopefully break ground as early as late 2018. It is important for Jamaica to ensure we have greater access to higher education and quality education, and all of these efforts are part of this vision. That is our prerequisite for a country if we are to achieve the goal of becoming a developed nation. After all, this is part of our Vision 2030, and increasing access to higher education and developing human capital is the key to this goal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the plans for the ministry in Vision 2030, and what progresses has been made in this regard?</h4><p>The ministry's strategic and three-year business plans are aligned to Vision 2030. We work closely with the planning institute of Jamaica to monitor and keep track of the targets. We are even working with the private sector to make sure our education and training is aligned with what the industry requires. We are integrating STEM and TVET into the curriculum. We are strengthening early child education, ensuring every child has the opportunity for full high school education up to grade 13. Students will graduate with at least an occupational degree with some skill they can use for further education or transition into the world of work. All of that is consistent with Jamaica's quest to develop world-class education and training system, with no one left behind, training and certifying aligned with the demands of the 21st century economy and beyond.</p><h4>How do you make sure the education system is aligned with market expectations?</h4><p>We are transitioning out of an agriculture-based economy, which is employing higher levels of mechanization. We developed strong capabilities in the service sector; tourism is one of the major industries. Along with that, there is transport and logistics. We have expanded that into maritime and maritime logistics, cruise tourism, among others. Those are emerging opportunities. We have recently approved the establishment of Caribbean Maritime University. Therefore, we can train more young people in these high-paying jobs in maritime logistics and transportation, and we are excited about that. The BPO is another area we are targeting. We have done great work for tourism. There is a great deal of potential growth in this particular area. We now have to customize our training program to make sure the graduating students are not generic. They should be trained in technical skills, customer service, and the ability to use the technology to deliver these back-office operations.</p><h4>What competitive advantage do you identify in Jamaica for foreign students, and how do you plan to leverage this?</h4><p>We already have large cohorts from the US, Canada, and other places around the world. Globally, the cost of higher education is increasing. Jamaica is a low-cost country. Our labor is relatively cheap. Jamaica is far more attractive in studying abroad. We also have tourism, so students can come and in addition to studying they can travel. They can participate in our tourism product, all-inclusive tourism, or whatever type of tourism they want. Jamaica is a major international brand. We have so many great Jamaicans. In a lot of countries, Jamaica is a household name. We have to build out the capacity for tertiary institutions to accommodate this particular demand. I have been in discussions with a number of these players. The UCC is one. The UCC and the Caribbean School of Medical Sciences Jamaica are partnering together. To be sustainable, they have to seek to attract international students. Jamaica is not unique in the sense that Antigua, Dominica, and Grenada have already gone in the market for offshore medical schools. We are in a prime location for investment in so many areas, particularly in higher education.</p><h4>How do you better associate the Jamaica name and brand with education?</h4><p>It is all a marketing plan in the same way that we are marketing tourism. We use social media. We have a large diaspora group. We even have a diaspora consultant that works with the diaspora in the US. Part of the mandate, along with our ambassador, is to develop our marketing plan. We have to ensure that we have the capacity. The University of the West Indies is expanding to accommodate some of that. We have UCC, which is also expanding. It has a task force to help manage this initiative. All of this is taking place together. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the major health challenges in Jamaica, and how does the Ministry address these?</h4><p>Non-communicable diseases are a significant burden. Seven out of every 10 deaths in Jamaica, roughly 17,000-20,000 deaths a year, are linked to non-communicable, lifestyle diseases. There are two approaches to respond to this; one is to promote preventative measures. This is more primary healthcare, where we push for persons to live healthier lives, engage in physical activity, and manage their consumption habits. We have launched a number of strategic partnerships with companies, such as Nestlé, to promote healthier living and lifestyles. Although we do partner with private sector companies, we are also guided by a food and industry task force. This looks at consumption habits, measures to be taken going forward, and a regulatory framework to discourage the consumption of certain things, such as sugary drinks. The other approach is curative, which is how to provide specialist services to treat those with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, or cancer.</p><h4>What is the potential for health tourism in Jamaica?</h4><p>Jamaica does have an opportunity for health tourism for a couple of reasons. Jamaica already has a tourism product and a reputation of service. There is a familiarity both regionally and further abroad in Europe. We currently provide health services to some of our regional colleagues. Some of our hospitals provide specialist services that are not provided in some of the smaller islands. Our other advantage is the relatively low cost of healthcare in Jamaica. In North America, the cost of healthcare is quite high. North America is also an attractive source market because of its proximity. And we are seeing now how products tailored to this segment are emerging. The ministry is looking at public-private partnerships for major, new infrastructure development. We are building out the public-private framework that will see private capital invested in infrastructure. </p><h4>What kind of interest are you seeing from international healthcare groups in Jamaica, and how do you think that compares with other islands in the region?</h4><p>Jamaica, from a regional perspective, is one of the more attractive locations. For starters, we have a larger population than many other islands. There is an internal market. Second, there is easy access to the island by air from the key centers in North America, Europe, and the region. Third, we already have a market for local persons seeking specialist care outside of Jamaica because they can afford it. This is a small group; nevertheless, they have overseas health insurance and a disposable income. Four, most of the time if not always, it will be cheaper to have that care done here than in North America. Combined with expertise, there are opportunities to capitalize on international interest.</p><h4>What is the position of the ministry on medical marijuana?</h4><p>While we do not support recreational smoking, the ministry does support the exploitation of medicinal extracts from marijuana. We are represented on the Cannabis Licensing Authority (CLA). We provide the medical guidance as it relates to CLA, how it functions, and the requirements to institutionalize the industry. The government, through the CLA, has already issued a few licenses and more will come in the future. We went to WHO and asked for marijuana to be reclassified from a narcotic to an input for medicinal value and use. I know the export group at WHO is looking at that, and other countries support it. And we are part of the process of advancing that. Jamaica has a reputation for growing, and we do have the intellectual capacity at the university level to do research from which to benefit. We have to depend on partnerships to fully exploit the possibilities. The downside has always been the acceptance of marijuana by the international financial system. We are preparing ourselves to benefit from the industry. However, that will require some international partnerships to achieve. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you describe the activities and vision of Baywest Wellness Clinic?</h4><p>Baywest Wellness Clinic started in 2012, and we have gained the trust of the local population. Presently, the health sector is in somewhat of a health crisis, especially at the main hospital in Western Jamaica. We have developed a multi-specialty clinic that includes an outpatient surgical department for the local population and have different specialty clinics surrounding Montego Bay. We provide medical care for business sectors under another of our brands called E-sure Medical, as well as through corporate nursing stations. The next step for us is to centralize the services we provide by establishing a hospital, which we look forward to opening in 2018. Our vision is a 15-bed hospital with all the basic amenities available. Our aim is to create a facility that will provide first-rate care for both local and foreign patients.</p><h4>How are you addressing the gaps in current healthcare services?</h4><p>We are indeed filling the gaps in the current healthcare sector. People know of the brand Baywest. For those who want to avoid the hustle and bustle of public hospitals, our 24-hour urgent care facility, Fairview, is an excellent alternative and is well equipped with all the necessary services to take care of them. At this time, we still refer a small percentage of cases and this is where our hospital will come into play. Once we have that on board, we will be able to provide all services for our valued patients.</p><h4>How will you reach your goal of becoming the largest private provider of healthcare services here?</h4><p>We require the funds. We have the workforce; however, capital is needed to outfit the different centers throughout the island. There are enough doctors and support in paramedical structures available. We need the capital to retrofit our spaces and turn different areas into different urgent care facilities throughout. In the long term, we plan to expand to every part of Jamaica. We want to become the premier private medical facility in Jamaica, not only at the primary care level but also on the tertiary care level.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the potential of health tourism?</h4><p>The potential is enormous. We can target the non-insured population in the US. We have the expertise; however, we need the proper infrastructure. Once we have that in place, we will be second to none. The only difference will be the location of where we do surgery. Health tourism is a massive market; however, the only benefits Jamaica is experiencing currently is trauma-health tourism, which includes accidents or a sudden illness.</p><h4>What specialties do you see the greatest potential for within health tourism?</h4><p>The cannabis health industry is second to none and extracts from this industry have numerous benefits, for example, a cannabis hospice that deals with chronic pain management, seizure activity, and glaucoma. Quick procedures that allow patients to get in and out of hospitals quickly are another possible area. Orthopedics are also a big thing, though they are chronic. The rehabilitation sector could be profitable as well, which includes physical therapy, speech therapy, and other similar paramedical areas.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the health industry in Jamaica?</h4><p>The problem with our present health industry has to do with finances and political willpower. Free healthcare for everyone in a third world country is not sustainable. Healthcare can be free for certain segments of the population or we can phase it such that primary healthcare areas are free while in the hospital setting, patients have to pay for drugs, lab tests, surgeries, and so on. Jamaica's strategic location is ripe for health tourism. What Jamaican tourism needs to do is create packages for business people, for example tax incentives, because once they enter the sector, they will invest and the money will stay in Jamaica and boost our economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Zoí«try was officially opened after an important renovation. How did you enhance your customer experience?</h4><p>Zoí«try Montego Bay officially opened in December 23, 2016 after being closed for a major renovation that took approximately one year. Zoí«try Montego Bay offers a Jamaican experience with Endless Privileges®, providing an elevated and personalized stay where everything is included. We intertwine wellness, gourmet meals, top-shelf spirits, fine wines, entertainment, and other luxurious amenities during the guest's getaway, without them having to worry about additional charges or gratuities.</p><h4>How does Zoí«try  differentiate itself from other all-inclusive hotels in Montego Bay?</h4><p>Unlike many other resorts in Montego Bay, Zoí«try has a strong focus on wellness as a niche market. Activities are offered to better a guest's wellbeing, such as yoga classes, meditation and mindfulness, and a complimentary 20-minute wellness experience or fitness consultation. In addition, the cuisine served in our restaurants is prepared with organic fresh and locally grown ingredients. Being a boutique resort with only 49 suites also differentiates us and allows us to offer top-notch personalized service that guests will not find anywhere else in Montego Bay. Each suite is attended by a butler dedicated to the guest's every need. We also offer complimentary Club Mo-bay services so that guests can feel like a VIP from the moment that they land at the airport in Jamaica.</p><h4>The hotel is divided in three buildings: Wood &amp; Water, Bamboo, and Blue Mountain. How does the hotel affirm its Jamaican identity?</h4><p>Focusing on wood and water, bamboo, and the blue mountains, Zoí«try Montego Bay was designed with the ecological tapestry of Jamaica in mind. Guests can embark on a serene experience and explore the natural elements surrounding the property, immersing their bodies, minds, and souls in the quintessential Jamaican culture. The true soul of Jamaica comes from the people. From the friendly front desk staff to attentive butlers and entertaining bartenders on property, the soul of Jamaica comes through at every turn.</p><h4>How do you ensure that the hotel provides linkage with the local communities and economy?</h4><p>We work with mostly local suppliers, especially our farmers and fishermen, ensuring that we meet the highest standards on the quality of items received. Zoí«try provides a unique farm-to-table dining experience for our guests, focusing on wellness options while making an important contribution towards the local economy and community.</p><h4>Is AMResorts, the parent company, planning to open other boutique hotels in Jamaica?</h4><p>AMResorts is always looking for new opportunities to increase our portfolio. There are no concreteplans at the moment, though Jamaica remains a great possibility for expansion in the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the positioning of Terra Nova, and how is it different from other hotels in Kingston?</h4><p>Terra Nova All-Suite Hotel delivers the complete boutique hotel experience by implementing a three-pronged systemic approach to Caribbean hospitality: bespoke luxury, modern amenities, and personalized white-glove service. Every suite is appointed with touches of old-world elegance and the comforts of international concierge standard modern amenities. Terra Nova becomes every guest's home away from home, as it boasts the getaway of an oasis in the heart of Jamaica's capital city. As the hotel was once home to Chris Blackwell's family, Terra Nova is an important part of Kingston's modern history.</p><h4>Jamaica's macroeconomic indicators are very positive. Do you expect more businesspeople to come the capital?</h4><p>Absolutely. Kingston's identity is starting to become more defined as a multi-faceted center of the Caribbean. While historically, tourism has been the major attraction to visitors, many other industries are growing at impressive rates. As Kingston is the commercial center of Jamaica, there has been a natural progression to more diverse groups of travelers to Kingston, and they are here to do business. Some sectors of growth attracting visitors with commercial interests are agribusiness, ICT and BPO, cannabis, logistics, manufacturing, creative industries, sports, and food.</p><h4>What are the challenges for hotels in Kingston, and how do you plan to face them?</h4><p>There is a historical corelation between Jamaica and tourism. Visitors to Jamaica still crave sun, sand, and sea as much as always; however, more than ever before, they all crave authenticity—the real Jamaica. Kingston is the best place to immerse oneself in as many aspects of Jamaican culture as possible, particularly if time is of the essence. We enjoy exposing our guests to the diverse experiences offered in Kingston—the sun, sand, and sea included, if desired. The crime rate here is not indicative of one's potential exposure to crime. With the help of our partner in social responsibility, CHCF, we strive to play our part in contributing to education. Our long-term vision as a nation should place education as the top priority, to ensure our social security and maximize our potential in every industry.</p><h4>How can Kingston attract more tourists?</h4><p>Kingston already has much of the tourist-related infrastructure to attract more visitors on vacation. In addition to cleaning up crime and the social elements that increase risk for visitors, targeted PR campaigns with the assistance of the Jamaica Tourist Board would be helpful in capturing vacationers seeking a more authentic Jamaican experience. Kingston needs to be sold as the one-stop on the map tourists must visit to complete their authentic experience. As demand grows, our fixed capacity needs to increase. There will be even more opportunity for investment as demand increases. We will require more hotel rooms, larger conference spaces, and more island-wide ground transportation. Kingston as a cruise ship port is a pipe dream at this point. The Urban Development Corporation's (UDC) Redevelopment of Downtown Kingston &amp; Port Royal project is a complex, ambitious plan that could prove to be extremely lucrative, creating jobs, boosting the economy, and breathing life into what was once the commercial center of the Caribbean.</p><h4>What are Terra Nova's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>Our mission is to maintain our high standard of personalized service that we are well known for. We also plan to continue to diversify our entertainment options on our property, adding to our existing gaming lounge, formal indoor and more relaxed outdoor dining options, and luxurious Regency Bar. We look forward to unveiling additional developments that will enhance the property's offerings in 2018 and beyond. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the first completely digital bank in Nigeria, what has been the response to the platform thus far?</h4><p>We launched ALAT in May 2017, coincidentally the day that Wema Bank marked 72 years in the industry. Wema Bank is the only surviving indigenous bank in Nigeria. With what we have learned over the years, we decided to position ALAT as the bank of the future not only in Nigeria, but in Africa at large. After going live, we received tremendous support and response from the market and had roughly 15,000 users on our platform as of June. The volume of deposits was also impressive, at over NGN150 million. By October, the customer base had grown to over 130,000 and deposit volumes to more than NGN850 million. ALAT offers customers the convenience they have been seeking. It simplifies all their transactions and ultimately gives them a greater ability to do their banking transactions without visiting a physical branch. A typical retail bank has branches in almost every strategic location where they can easily reach out to customers. This is great, and almost all of them want to make their branches accessible for customers. We, however, have a slightly different view. As great and as conducive as these branches are, young professionals and entrepreneurs do not enjoy going to branches. We allow them to do their banking transactions from their homes or offices. Excitingly, there are over 80 million Nigerian subscribers combined across the four major telecommunication platforms in the industry.</p><h4>What is your strategy to increase Wema Bank's customer base from 1.5 to 3 million and revenue from NGN54 billion to NGN200 billion?</h4><p>We defined our business clearly before embarking on the journey to ALAT. We have certain loyal customers who are in the older generation, because of the age of the bank. Therefore, we needed to reach out to younger customers who should be able to build and grow with the bank and change the perception that Wema is only for older people. We will be vibrant in our outlook and approach. We also want to disrupt what seems to be the status quo in doing banking transactions. That is the force driving our work. It is a deliberate decision to do retail and do it more effectively. We are now leveraging on technology and reaching out to customers. We want to meet them at the point we can easily catch up with them and provide offerings that will get them excited to use the bank.</p><h4>What is your point of view on the threat digital banks pose to traditional banking?</h4><p>They do not pose a threat, but will merely change how banking will be done. Banking will always be necessary; banks, however, will not. The largest industry in the word is the payments industry. This cuts across everything we do, as well as every lifestyle and type of commercialization. Payments and banking are one and the same. Therefore, the digitalization of banking will not pose a threat. It will, however, complement the industry. Today, people can do their grocery shopping online; why not do the same for banking? If the education system, music, and public transportation can be disrupted by technology, why not banking? Technology makes everything a level playing field. It disrupts almost every business, including banking. It is not a function of “if," but “when." That time is now, and we are leading a path in the industry. We are disrupting the way banking used to be done as the first fully, end-to-end, digital bank. </p><h4>What are your expectations from 2018?</h4><p>We expect to have millions of customers in the coming months. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since the company's founding in 2005, Posta Plus has grown and developed into a diversified organization across many countries. What is the current scale of your operations?</h4><p>The inception and launch of Posta Plus started in Kuwait, where we began with one thought in mind; to demonstrate a greater localization in the region and become a company that is an extension of our customer and understands and delivers their needs exactly. We provided the customers with the choice: choice in how they engaged with us, in the services we offered, and provided long-lasting relationships. During the start, we took delivery services to the next level in the areas of logistics, supply chain, and standard door-to-door delivery. Ultimately, we grew profitably in the region and expanded our presence to Bahrain, the UAE, the US, the UK, China, and Egypt, the latter a recent one. We are strategically planning to expand our presence to become the number-one logistics company within the emerging markets in the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia being our next target. This will help us diversify and also strengthen our offering to our customers in more markets. The evolution of e-commerce in the region has given us a new understanding on how to serve the markets and bring in potential customers, acknowledging the concept of localization.</p><h4>Could you tell us a bit about MyBox, which Posta Plus acquired in 2008?</h4><p>We acquired MyBox with the idea to bring our customers closer to the US market. The idea was to make the US online shopping experience more convenient for the customer, especially with the recent rise of e-commerce activities, globally and regionally. Statistically speaking, online shopping in the Middle East is rapidly evolving. With one of the highest global per-capita internet penetration levels and strong mobile usage, the online spending potential is quickly emerging as one of the highest compared to other regions, causing shake-ups in the logistics landscape. We are making online shopping and shipping easy. With MyBox, customers can order their desired items from the US at competitive prices using a reliable delivery solution. Our service provides customers with access to the leading e-commerce websites and allows them to track their shipments across the supply chain. Currently we are working on an additional product to MyBox, which will enhance customers' experience when shopping online.</p><h4>What are some of the unique characteristics of the Kuwaiti market, and how has Posta Plus remained flexible in that environment?</h4><p>We became the key player in the market with our understanding of the local culture and consumer behavior. We started by offering solutions that would be more convenient for the Kuwaiti market, knowing that Kuwaitis and the people who live here value their time. They are also extremely mobile—they do not like to stay in one place. To reach out to these customers, we always make sure to be available to complete deliveries at a convenient time, subject to the customers' availability. We have also developed an innovative solution very unique to our region that allows customers to avoid paying online. People in this region prefer to receive the product before they pay as they are reluctant to share their credit card details. In such cases cash on delivery has become the most preferred method of payment, accounting for about 75% of online orders.</p><h4>Which markets are more important for Posta Plus currently?</h4><p>Kuwait and the UAE remain our priority markets in the region. The UAE, being the regional and international hub, allows us to build our network and expand our client base across various other countries in the region, including Kuwait. With our presence in the US and China, we easily connect GCC customers with these two economic giants in the world, acquiring more market share for their international business. Once we strengthen our existence in the UAE market, we are confident that it will present various business opportunities in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and other potential focus areas.</p><h4>Posta Plus acquired National Express in 2014. Does Posta Plus foresee more partnerships in the near future?</h4><p>We are keen to go the extra mile and build strong strategic partnerships, driven by want rather than by need. We understand the role and value of collaboration in the logistics industry and are constantly building alliances with other major conglomerates across borders which are helping us to expand more rapidly. Most recently, we formed an alliance with an Egyptian partner that will allow our presence in the Egyptian market. We have also partnered with Qatar since Kuwait is one of the countries that still cooperate strongly with Qatar. This allows us to ship packages to and from Qatar at competitive prices. In addition, we also have a partner in Saudi Arabia now, which will be the starting point to a more promising alliance. One of our exciting project is establishing an alliance with Turkey, which is geographically strategic for Posta Plus. In Turkey, the language is both an opportunity and a challenge. For example, the largest Turkish websites do not offer English-language options—they are purely in Turkish. We believe we should tackle that space and make it easier for people to access the Turkish market at their own convenience. Turkish products are cost friendly and of high quality. We already have a presence there through a company operating at a minimal level, and we look forward to becoming more prominent there soon.</p><h4>According to the WTO, global trade is expected to increase by up to 4% in 2018. Will this positive forecast affect your business?</h4><p>This figure refers to global trade in all business sectors; the logistics sector could see double-digit growth. In fact, we anticipate massive growth until 2025. This is one of the strong reasons we recognize the importance of investing heavily in the region and forming strong alliances across various global locations. With the e-commerce explosion in 2016 and triple growth rate, we have big plans and ambitions that will allow us to keep up with the market growth and innovate our services to fit our customers' preferences at all times. We look forward to updating the market about our initiatives in due course.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Tourist Attraction]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[tourist-attraction]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the purpose of TEF and its biggest achievements since its inception?</h4><p>TEF was established in 2004 as a result of a tourism master plan that recommended a number of aspects to upgrade tourism areas and architectures. We charged USD10 for every ticket that is bought outside of Jamaica to come to Jamaica, which is how TEF is funded. Now, there is a demand to also assist with the marketing of tourism so the fee was doubled. 50% of the fund goes directly to the tourism board exclusively for marketing while TEF keeps the other 50% and we deal with projects across the island. In Kingston, we spent over USD2 million refurbishing Devon House. At Montego Bay, we put in traffic lights, and there is a corridor called the Elegant Corridor, where we maintain the landscape and put in streetlights. We concentrate on upgrading resort towns and ensure that they are kept beautiful and clean. There is a government entity called National Solid Waste, and we financed it to clean up all major towns across Jamaica, in particular resort towns.</p><h4>What are the major challenges and opportunities in the tourism sector?</h4><p>One of the major challenges in the tourism sector is crime. It has not affected tourism yet, though there is always the threat. That is why we have police funding as well because crime has to be controlled so as not to affect tourism. Tourism has been doing extremely well; in 2017, it is projected to grow 5% and we are currently ahead of that, at 8% to date.</p><h4>Are linkages with the local economy a challenge in the tourism sector, and how do you work to improve this?</h4><p>We have established a group called the Linkages Program chaired by Adam Stewart from Sandals Resort. This is to further integrate tourism with the local economy and agriculture, advising farms what is best to produce and ensuring more local products are being used in hotels. At the moment, with tourism we retain 30% of the tourism dollar, and the minister wants to increase this to 50%, and these linkages will help significantly. Every effort is being made to reach 50% in the next three to five years.</p><h4>How can the entertainment offerings for tourists be developed in Montego Bay in the coming years?</h4><p>In the early 1970s and 1980s, Montego Bay had about four nightclubs and each one was busy. At that time, there were regular, not all-inclusive hotels. All-inclusive hotels started about 1980 and gradually grew. As a result, everything has dried up and people stay in their hotels. This is why there are not many elegant upscale restaurants in Montego Bay. There are not enough customers. Casinos could possibly pull people out of hotels. Once they are out, they will take a taxi and be more exposed to restaurants and so on. Setting up a nightclub will not be strong enough to pull sufficient numbers to make it viable.</p><h4>How do you plan to continue to grow the Jamaican brand in the coming years, and what projects do you look to finance?</h4><p>We will continue to keep cities and the resort areas clean. In Montego Bay, we are building a major park at the cost of JMD700 million (USD5.57 million) and work should actively start in April and take about two years. We are also setting up artisanal villages for craft people, one in Montego Bay, one in Trelawny, and one in Negril. There is currently one in Falmouth. This will be a large attraction, and people will produce artisanal Jamaican products. The craft village in Falmouth was built at a cost of JMD500 million (USD3.98 million) and we are working with the port authority on that. In 2018, we hope to start one in Ocho Rios and in Montego Bay. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[All Things Tourism]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[all-things-tourism]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you support the Jamaican brand internationally to attract more tourists?</h4><p>Jamaica is an interesting place primarily because of our warm and friendly people. We have a reggae superstar and the fastest man on the earth, and Jamaicans are always doing something that is interesting and worthy of international attention. We even have a professional female bobsled team that participated in the Winter Olympics in South Korea. As the agency that markets Destination Jamaica, the Jamaica Tourist Board has offices in our biggest market, the US, Canada, our second-largest market, as well as the UK. We also have an office in continental Europe that is headquartered in Berlin that supports activities in Germany, Holland, Spain, Portugal, France, as well as Italy. We recognize Europe as a market for the future and also Latin America. We have a Latin American representative in Mexico with representatives in all the large countries such as Brazil, Chile, and Argentina. Though we advertise in most of these markets, we put more weight on the US, Canada, and the UK. With the advent of new hotels and new investors coming into the country, the accommodation landscape has increased dramatically.</p><h4>Are you promoting new tourist destinations in Jamaica?<br></h4><p>We are always promoting the diverse offerings of our tourism product. People are always surprised at the depth of our product given that we are a small island. Every resort area is uniquely different. For example, there is Port Antonio, a special place with no big hotels but cottages instead; people are protective about the land. People do not want to see 800 room hotels, and I agree, as the landscape is beautiful and delicate. Once the road infrastructure from Kingston to Port Antonio gets completed, the parish of St. Thomas will likely see quite a lot of new tourist facilities because the sea and the beaches there are incredible and are totally underutilized. Once we get the infrastructure in, development will come.</p><h4>Do you also communicate with investors in order for them to develop tourism offerings in Jamaica?</h4><p>We developed a program called the Shovel Ready program, because investors do not have much time to waste on bureaucracy; they buy a plot of land and want to get it going as quickly as possible. We work with JAMPRO, the trade and investment company, to help investors because the more hotel rooms we have, the more people we can accommodate. This program is in fact funded by the Tourism Enhancement Fund, which also benefits from bringing more people to the island.</p><h4>What successes have been linked to this program?</h4><p>There is a major project we are working on currently with a company called Karisma, which has bought a 400-acre piece of land. We are working with it to get it Shovel Ready. When it is finished, it will be 10 hotels with 5,000 rooms. Karisma hopes to launch three of the hotels in early 2018. It is on the north coast, just out of Runaway Bay, and the three hotels will have about 3,000 rooms.</p><h4>How do you see the evolution of the tourism industry, and what are the trends and the outlook for the industry?</h4><p>People like new experiences, and in order to be successful, we have to keep our products fresh, which means that even if we have an older product, we have to evolve. As the newer hotels come in, they get more competitive in terms of what they offer. Visitors are drawn to the unique experiences that are here in Jamaica; our cuisine, our music, our hospitable people, and our contagious vibe—the thrill of spending time in a community and hanging with the community members is second to none. As we pursue the Asian market, we will have many more Chinese and Indians, and the world's middle class is expanding rapidly. Our product must be ready for that market as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Changing Face of Tourists]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[changing-face-of-tourists]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the evolution of Jamaican tourism, and which key markets are you targeting to increase the number of visitors?</h4><p>Tourism today is characterized by a larger demographic of people with knowledge and empowerment, though they possess a limited purchasing power. This is a younger group defined as millennials with a desire and need to travel, do good, and contribute; it is traveling with a purpose beyond leisure. People are also traveling now more for health and wellness because of new medical applications, innovations in medical technology, and the use of nutraceuticals and alternative medical applications. These are the passion points around which products have to be developed to respond to psychographic profiles to enable a destination to now be relevant. In the middle of all that is a price point that also has to be affordable. This has resulted in the emergence of new business models, such as the sharing economy with Airbnb and Uber, for example. Therefore, tourism is evolving into a system of access, and the new entrepreneurs are those who enable access.</p><h4>Has this evolution enabled you to develop new tourist destinations in Jamaica?</h4><p>That is one part of the new tourism evolution; the second part is developing the possibilities as we democratize and offer new destinations in Jamaica. We are constructing a new highway, the southeastern corridor from Kingston through to Port Antonio, which will create a new opportunity for a destination in St. Thomas. It could perhaps become driven by diversity because tourists are traveling through the Blue Mountains, and there is an enormous opportunity for eco-tourism. In addition, the parish has many beaches, and there is also the possibility of having a highly diversified experiential destination on the southeastern coast. Brand Jamaica promotes entertainment, sports, and music, and the new tourism strategy will build a stronger presence of entertainment, music, and sports in the global space.</p><h4>How is multi-destination tourism going to benefit Jamaican tourism?</h4><p>Multi-destination tourism will be a key factor in driving this expanding connectivity across the world as a small island like Jamaica will have difficulties in scale in dealing with large carriers that will bring hundreds of passengers across the world. It has become easier to transport more people over longer distances and travelers can now spend two to three weeks in the region; they do not fly all the way just to spend a few nights in one place. Multi-destination tourism, which offers travelers the opportunity to have multiple experiences within a prescribed geographic space, will be an important part of enabling the reach to those markets.</p><h4>What would you advise international investors that are keen to invest in the local tourism industry?</h4><p>This is the right decision because Jamaica is poised for significant growth. In 4Q2017, we welcomed the 4 millionth visitor to Jamaica and earned approximately USD3 billion for the year. That is a significant milestone, and this is where the real economic impact of tourism will be felt. When a country with 2.7 million people earns USD3 billion, it begins to have a net accretion. Even if the retention levels are low, the absolute amount left in the economy is substantial enough to make a difference. Jamaica is right at that point where it is exciting enough to attract larger partners than in the past. Investors are now on to something; here is a market, a product, and the possibility of connectivity. Investors have an opportunity to make a move now because in another 10 years, investing in Jamaica will become a more difficult proposition because of greater competition. It is important to build our human capital and strengthen the capacity of our people to produce more and more cost effectively. To do so, we have to change and build on the intellectual and competence levels within the industry. We are using the opportunity now to create that infrastructure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[expert-advice]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you help companies reach their objectives?</h4><p>I leverage my years of solid experience in Jamaica's corporate world and through international linkages, where I have had the opportunity to meet and interact with CEOs and top executives from diverse businesses. My modus operandi is that I discuss with potential and existing clients their plans and objectives for their respective businesses for the short and medium term. I help them formulate the appropriate policies and direction in areas such strategic and corporate planning, integrated marketing communication, business development, operations, customer service, and training, creating the linkages with strategic external partners and monitoring these solutions until they are successfully implemented.</p><h4>What have been your major projects and achievements?</h4><p>They are various. One is the current engagement with a leading corporate entity in the financial sector that has a successful track record in that industry and has sought to propel the company to the next level with the vision of further enhancing its corporate image, providing its customers with a unique loyalty program and expanding regionally. I was able to successfully provide a blueprint and strategic links to ensure that there was a successful achievement of its main corporate objectives, which led to the ultimate achievement of the goals of customer acquisition, retention, and expansion. This contributed to a significant increase in the company's market share and profit margin, as well as positively increased the brand equity of the company, which continued to give it the winning edge in the industry.</p><h4>Do you see growing interest in hiring external consultants in Jamaica?</h4><p>There is definitely an increased interest in hiring consultants, both local and internationally based. Most Jamaican companies are progressive and forward thinking, and are always seeking opportunities to reinvent themselves. As a part of a competitive global economy, it is imperative to ensure that investments in new and existing businesses are informed by sound research and recommendations by consultants who are experienced and qualified and have a solid track record in providing outstanding results in their specialized fields.<br>What are the opportunities and challenges of doing business in Jamaica?<br>There are boundless opportunities for doing business in Jamaica in areas such as tourism, aquaculture, mineral extraction, agriculture and agro-processing, workforce training, and offshore financial centers. Some of the challenges of engaging in business in Jamaica—although getting better—include the conservative nature of the banking sector, which continues to rely on collateral secure loans rather than the potential of business plans and the qualities and business acumen of the proprietors. Bank interest rates could be more competitive from a global point of view, and reduced corporate tax rates would make the country more competitive and help attract more investments.</p><h4>What are your goals for the coming year?</h4><p>My goal for 2018 is to continue to grow my business by providing services to a wider and more diverse group of business owners while ensuring that my existing pool of clients continue to enjoy the highest level of service delivery and valued expertise that has characterized my service throughout my career and exceeding expectations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Wealth of Words]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-wealth-of-words]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has the creation Business Access TV brought to Jamaica?</h4><p>It has revived the conversation about entrepreneurship and put a direct focus on local domestic business. We are not a financial channel, but a business one. We cater to all sectors of the economy, from telecoms to finance and manufacturing. We look at all aspects of the economy. We also focus on blue-chip, medium-sized, small, and micro-companies. We also look at the creative industry. In a nutshell, Business Access TV has opened the conversation around entrepreneurship and showcase many new businesses that, under normal circumstances, would not be able to afford television. We have become a gateway and platform to showcase many of these businesses that do not have access to exposure. Our news programs in the evening do not talk about death or murder; they only cover what took place in the business community and activities on the stock market.</p><h4>How have your programs evolved since you launched the channel?</h4><p>The programs have evolved in an organic format. When we launched, we designed programs that would cater to specific needs. For example, we have programs that focus on small businesses, blue-chip companies, the creative industry, business and current affairs, and one on lifestyles called Chill Spot.</p><h4>How do you plan to boost your audience?</h4><p>We plan to do this by reinventing ourselves. We consistently look at the programming and market and see who is consuming the product. From there, we determine if we need to tweak the programs or introduce new ones. Currently, we are introducing a new program called Teen Boss to be launched in early 2018 and focus on the teen market that is interested in business. If we can catch them as viewers from this point in their lives, then we can hold them as they grow older. Before launching the channel, we launched the Wealth magazine, which is complementary. Wealth was first launched at a time when Jamaica was going through a recession and many were complaining about losing wealth. As wealth was a popular theme at the time, that is what we decided to call the magazine. Rather than focus on people's fortunes, it focuses on the journey they made to amassing them. The tagline of the magazine is “educate, inspire, and empower." The TV station was built on a platform on the backbone of the magazine.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans?</h4><p>We have plans to expand to the Caribbean in early 2018 into Trinidad and Tobago, St. Lucia, Cayman, Barbados, and the Bahamas. We will have the same channel with the same content. Then we will regionalize the content, so that interviewees on Chill Spot will no longer be only from Jamaica, but the other five islands as well. I see us as the major CNN/MSNBC/Bloomberg combination of the Caribbean. As we show a great deal of local content for Jamaica, we will do the same for each of the other countries. Business Access TV will no longer be a Jamaican product, but a Caribbean one. All of the programs will have a more regional feel. Our news will include top stories from within the region. This expansion will require new capital, and we are forming new partnerships to raise this.</p><h4>What are your short-term goals?</h4><p>The short-term goals for Business Access TV are to continue to dominate Jamaica and expand our reach locally. We want to include content not only from Kingston and Montego Bay but also St. Thomas, St. Elizabeth, Mandeville, and all the 14 parishes. We currently have an average of 160,000 viewers on which we are looking to build. This is why we also plan to expand into some smaller satellite and community-based cable companies in order to expand our reach. We also want to continue to associate ourselves with every major event and breaking business news. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[In It for the Long Haul]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[in-it-for-the-long-haul]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has PanJam evolved since its creation?</h4><p>PanJam is an investment holding company listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange and celebrating its 54th year. It was founded just after Jamaica's independence in 1962, capitalizing on nationalistic enthusiasm and positive growth prospects at a time when many opportunities were presenting themselves. My family has been in Jamaica since the mid-1700s and our fortunes have ebbed and flowed along with our country's. Over the years, we have remained invested in Jamaica and confirmed this commitment through our association with PanJam since its inception. In fact, one of the things that distinguishes PanJam from its peers is our continued optimism about Jamaica's future. We owe this success to our focus on a well-defined strategy, whereby we maintain a good combination of entrepreneurial risk-taking and conservative investment policies. We started life as a real estate management and development company, but have branched out to become an investment firm. PanJam has invested in Jamaican projects and businesses across a broad range of industries, predominantly real estate, financial services, hospitality, manufacturing, and tourism. Rather than taking controlling ownership positions, we became minority shareholders. Our current portfolio reflects our strong belief in Jamaica's potential, with growth expected in almost all economic areas. We are the second-largest shareholder of Sagicor Group Jamaica, giving us exposure to the financial services industry and are invested in Walkerswood, a sauces and seasonings manufacturer, as well as Chukka Caribbean Adventures, a regional tour company. Recently, we developed the Courtyard Marriott Hotel in the heart of New Kingston, and expect to complete work on the former Oceana Hotel, first built on the Kingston Waterfront in the 1970s.</p><h4>Do you think that the waterfront and downtown Kingston could become more attractive for investments?</h4><p>The public and private sectors have long talked about the restoration of downtown Kingston, which has suffered from neglect and a lack of investment. The downfall of the area was driven in part by events in the 1970s, the relocation of the port, and what I call the “suburbanization of the population," where some of the suburbs took the energy out of Kingston. Jamaica's lack of economic growth over the last 40 years has not provided the resources or created the will to really develop it since then. Therefore, we need to look for external sources of revenue to drive its rebuilding. At the moment, Kingston is primarily a business destination, though it is developing a tourism aspect. In some ways, it is the real Jamaica; Kingston was the home of Bob Marley and the birthplace of many elements of Jamaican culture. Cruise ships are the quickest way to introduce the city of Kingston back into the mix; the historic waterfront has been the gateway for the vast majority of people coming to Kingston over the centuries, including Port Royal, notorious for its role in the Caribbean's pirate era. My father, who founded PanJam, led the drive for a modern Jamaican business center, New Kingston. PanJam was also at the forefront of the development of residential real estate in the 1970s and 1980s. Building on that legacy, we are currently involved in the Kingston Restoration Company, which since the early 1990s has been at the heart of driving the agenda for the revitalization of the city. </p><h4>What kinds of investments are you looking for in the coming years?</h4><p>We have really struggled to diversify PanJam's risk profile, focusing on local businesses that have global opportunities and natural competitive advantages. Tourism is clearly something that we think Jamaica is able to capitalize on. We have wonderful people, a beautiful country, and a welcoming culture that are highly valued by international travelers. Additionally, Jamaica is well positioned relative to the Panama Canal and its associated shipping lanes, so the government-led logistics center initiative is a real prospect for growth and development. Business process outsourcing also has some opportunities, in addition to agriculture. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[coming-of-age]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the transformation of the company progressed since you took over the reins in 2004?</h4><p>Musson's core competency is distribution. It was initially a trading agency business, but over the years we developed into a distributor and manufacturer. We integrated backward into buying some of the brands that we distribute. Over the last 15 years we have moved from being primarily a food commodity distributor, specifically for rice and flour, to getting more dairy verticals. We are fairly large in the dairy business in Jamaica and Caribbean and have gotten involved in manufacturing biscuits. We have a bakery as well as a vegetable refinery, a new flour mill, and a cornmeal plant. On the base of our core distribution we have developed and built a distribution businesses in telecoms. We distribute most of the handsets across the Caribbean and Central America with carriers like Digicel among others in different markets. We have expanded quite heavily into Central America in both telecoms and an IT business called PBS, a USD200-million business with 1,600 employees that recently went public on the Jamaican Stock Exchange. Our telecoms business is in some 38 countries. We also recently launched in Colombia with Xerox. </p><h4>Musson is one of the flagships of the Jamaican economy. What could be done to help Jamaican companies become more competitive?</h4><p>The reality is that a few years of fiscal discipline cannot substitute for 40 years of poor economic management. There has to be stabilization, which is the basis and foundation for anything. There is a great deal of capital in the country; we focus almost entirely on FDI, and the truth of the matter is that there is a great deal of money stuck in pension funds and fund managers with life insurance and general insurance companies. My insurance company here has the floats of an insurance company's money, but we require a 250% minimum capital test (MCT), while in the US it is 100% and in Canada 150%. We have 250% because we had a financial crisis in the 1990s. People are forced to invest in government Jamaica paper, which suited the government because no one would have lent it money with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 150%. Such regulations helped that dynamic. Now the government is no longer crowding out the private sector. We need to analyze dialing back some of that. Banks are private-sector actors and have to be able to risk capital. To enhance innovation development and meritocracy in Jamaica, people need to have access to capital to be able to deliver good ideas and employ people.</p><h4>Jamaica has experienced a long period of stagnation, but macro-economic indicators are positive. What is key to ensuring growth in the future?</h4><p>We are a young country at 60 and spent these first six decades trying to figure out who we are, almost like prepubescent teenagers. Now we are coming of age and realizing what we are not. We cannot grow by having a simple transfer of wealth by taking from the rich and giving to the poor. We have to grow through private sector-led initiatives that will lead to job creation, investment, productivity, and growth. What we need to do is make this country attractive to people to aspire to stay and attract other people to come here. If we lose our human capital stock then we are losing our best asset. If we are able to keep our best people and increase the number of truly productive people, we will see GDP growth. Musson is building 250,000sqft of BPO space into which Amazon is moving, which will have 5,000 employees. BPO will absorb a large number of workers and create large revenues. This will boost consumption in the economy. We are a few hours away from the largest market in the world, we speak English, and have a wonderful country that people should only want to visit and live in all the more. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[getting-more-by-giving-back]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the contribution of GraceKennedy to Jamaica?</h4><p>GraceKennedy was established in Kingston in 1922 as a small trading company. In those days, we were primarily involved in the food and shipping business. Over the years, we have evolved to become one of the largest group of companies in Jamaica and the Caribbean. Our contribution to Jamaica has been significant. One of the areas we are serious about is our corporate social responsibility and the role we play in the country's development. That is why we are so proud of the work we are doing through our two foundations—the Grace and Staff Community Development Foundation and the GraceKennedy Foundation. Grace and Staff started in 1979 and is today making an amazing contribution to the lives of thousands of young people and inner-city communities across Jamaica. We are currently helping to send over 500 young people to school and in so doing we are changing lives, building dreams, and contributing to Jamaica's development. It is also our intention and my personal goal to increase that number to 1,000 by 2020. The GraceKennedy Foundation provides grants for early childhood projects and university scholarships, and hosts a public lecture each year focused on critical issues that affect our country. The Foundation also funds two UWI (professorial) chairs—the James Moss-Solomon Senior Chair in Environmental Management and the Carlton S. Alexander Chair in Management Studies.</p><h4>What does the company's corporate structure look like?</h4><p>In terms of our organizational structure, we currently employ over 3,000 people in the two main segments (financial services and foods) in which we operate. In the financial services segment, we provide banking, insurance, investment, remittance, cambio, and bill payment services.  This includes our strategic partnership with Western Union where we currently represent it in 12 countries across the Caribbean. In our food segment, we have companies in many parts of the world  and our products are found as far away as France, Germany, the UK, and even Russia. In 2014, we acquired a company in the US, a Hispanic brand called La Fe, and this has been a major game changer for the GraceKennedy Group in terms of getting our brand out there. We are currently in the major supermarkets throughout the US as well as Canada. GraceKennedy is truly an international company, headquartered in Jamaica and owned by Jamaicans. We have six manufacturing plants in Jamaica and many of the products on the shelves overseas are actually made right here in Jamaica. We have also created employment for our local farmers by partnering with them to provide us with quality products on a consistent basis to make our pepper sauces. This has worked very well for us and has resulted in us exporting not only to the Caribbean but as far away as Wales and Sweden. Instead of just spending foreign exchange, we are earning foreign exchange for the country, because we believe that what is good for Jamaica is also good for GraceKennedy. Brand Jamaica is very unique. When people all over the world think about Jamaica, they think about reggae music, Bob Marley, our athletes, as well as our other international stars. They also think about the natural beauty of Jamaica with its various attractions. All of these features make a strong brand, which are closely aligned with our products.</p><h4>Do you consider entering in other markets in the coming years?</h4><p>As we continue on our path to becoming a global consumer group, we are always looking for new opportunities to increase our footprint. We are currently in the Ghanaian market in Africa and we have a strong presence on the East Coast of the US. In Europe, we are in the UK and we need to continue to expand on the growth we have had in countries such as France, the Netherlands, and Germany. </p><h4>Are markets like the US, UK, and Canada, with large diasporas, your primary clients?</h4><p>The diaspora has been the foundation of GraceKennedy abroad, but we have actually crossed over into the mainstream. About four or five years ago, in a WalMart, our products would only be in the Caribbean section or ethnic and international food section. Now our products sit along with other products in the mainstream section. This is because consumers of Grace products have, over the last few years, expanded beyond the diaspora. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What changes in strategy do you plan to introduce at Sagicor?</h4><p>I have been President and CEO since May 2017. We have a strong company that was led by my predecessor Richard Byles for 13 years, and he has passed on a solid legacy for me to continue to build and grow on. My strategy is to take the company on a digital journey that drives innovation over the next five years, which will help with improved efficiency and our clients' service experience across all our business lines. I also want to increase the interaction between the different parts of our diverse financial group to encourage more sales and cross-selling of our products and services. Insurance is our core business and has tremendous growth potential in banking and investments. Our investment arm is a large player in the stock market and corporate finance world in terms of wealth management. There is a major upside for those areas. We are also the largest pension fund manager in the country and largest third-party fund manager and have large investments in the hotel and tourism sector. We would like to leverage those managed funds to do more things to benefit our clients and us.</p><h4>What are the advantages of being such a large group with diverse services?</h4><p>The advantages are access to capital and our 1.6 million client database. We have the largest client database in Jamaica, which gives a huge advantage in terms of leverage. For example, we have a health insurance plan that insures the entire family; hence, those people are also in the database. We know their birthdays and other information that can be used to market and sell to them. We also have the ability to spread technological innovation across a wider revenue stream.</p><h4>Are you a one-stop shop in that sense?</h4><p>Yes, we have a plan to create financial centers so that our clients can go into a branch and meet an insurance agent or finance expert. We have already started and plan to accelerate that in the coming years. We plan to have about five or six in total, and most of our bank branches already have an investment section as well. The idea is to incorporate life insurance, which does not exist in Jamaica to the extent and scale we propose. We also have plans to do micro-insurance at the retail level and introduce payment methods that are appealing to the unbanked, such as mobile money and app-based bank accounts. </p><h4>How do your investments in real estate relate to your other activities?</h4><p>We manage the largest real estate fund in Jamaica. Real estate is an integral part of any investment portfolio, in addition to bonds and stocks, and we have a target for our total funds to be in real estate, which means we have to find investments. We have done a great deal in tourism, including the Jewel Hotels brand, which has been doing well. There is also commercial real estate. We are building a mall in May Pen, which is a growing part of the country on the south coast off the new highway. We are always on the lookout for new projects. There are also investment possibilities in business process outsourcing (BPO) and infrastructure projects, such as airports, ports, water, and energy.</p><h4>How would you characterize Sagicor's corporate social responsibility programs?</h4><p>We have our own Sagicor Foundation where the main focus is on health and education. Our Sagicor Sigma Corporate Run, our marquee charity event in Jamaica, has strong support from corporate Jamaica and individuals. The 2017 staging attracted over 25,000 participants and remains the largest road race in the Caribbean, and the 2018 staging will mark the 20th anniversary of the event. The run has helped raise over USD2.39 million for charity over the years and is something we are proud of. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most common concerns of a foreign company interested in entering the country?</h4>
<p>
	The Jamaican market is unique in the investment opportunities it offers foreign investors. The number of foreign companies operating in Jamaica would indicate that not only is there interest in Jamaica, but that they also achieve a reasonable return on their investments. The fact that we have a democracy and the absence of any intervention by the army with elections held generally every five years is another important factor for investors. The level of red tape is of concern, and in this regard, the government has appointed a Minister without Portfolio in the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation with responsibility for investment portfolios. The latest statistics in 2017 indicate that crime is down in most areas. Jamaica is regarded as an extremely friendly tourist destination, and for a number of years, incentives have been offered for investors in different areas of the economy. Such incentives include the Hotel Incentives Act and other acts that provide tax holidays for investments. Jamaica has generally removed foreign exchange restrictions, and companies are free to remit their profits abroad. The currency has declined in value vis-í -vis the currencies of its main trading partners over a number of years. However, it has shown signs of recovery in 2017. Statistics indicate that there are few strikes in the labor force, and there is the presence of an Industrial Dispute Tribunal to deal with disputes between workers and employers. The final court of appeal in Jamaica is the Privy Council in England, which gives investors the assurance that any dispute will be settled in an impartial manner. Furthermore, the Constitution provides that proper compensation be paid for any compulsory acquisition of property by the government.
</p>
<h4>How would you assess the current level of foreign interest in the country?<br>
</h4>
<p>
	Jamaica was the leading recipient of FDI inflows in 2016 among the English-speaking Caribbean and small island developing states (SIDS) group according to the World Investment Report 2017. The main areas of investment at the moment are the tourism industry, which recorded over 4 million visitors to the island in 2017 and has seen a substantial increase in the number of hotel rooms in the last 10 years mainly due to investments by Spanish companies; the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector, which has become the fastest-growing industry in Jamaica, employing 14,000 persons in 2014 and 26,000 people in 2017; bauxite, which is presently making a comeback; and special economic zones, which are geared toward utilizing the business opportunities presented by the widening of the Panama Canal, providing opportunities to assemble and repack goods destined for the US and Europe.
</p>
<h4>What regulatory changes are likely to be implemented in Jamaica in the medium term?</h4>
<p>
	An increase in the inflow of FDI and strong advisories from international lending agencies have forced law makers to take swift legislative measures to future proof the economy. Legislative and regulatory changes that have recently or will be implemented include the Companies (Amendment) Act 2017, the National Identification System (NIDS), special economic zone (SEZ) regulations, Data Protection Act, and medical cannabis regulations.
</p>
<h4>What positive trends do you see, and what is your outlook on the economy?</h4>
<p>
	The present government came into office in 2016 with a promise of prosperity. It has set up an economic growth council that has set a target of achieving 5% annual growth by 2020. Two of the main constraints in achieving this are the present murder rate and red tape. The present government has a small majority in parliament, and it is in its interest to promote growth. The growth rate in Jamaica for the last 20 years has averaged less than 1%. To ensure a greater chance of re-election, the government has to deliver on growth. The government presently has a proactive stance, which will reduce murders and result in growth. <a href="https://dunncox.com/" target="_blank"></a>

		<url><![CDATA[making-finance-serve-the-folk]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the bank's contribution to the financial sector and economy?</h4><p>The inflation rate as of September 2017 stood at 4.6%, which is right within our target of 4-6%. This is a significant decline from 13.3% in March 2010. Surveys of businesses' inflation expectations conducted by the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) on behalf of BOJ have consistently shown an expected inflation rate below our actual target. Low inflation is not achieved by the central bank alone; it requires a supportive environment, which we have had. We have a high proportion of trade in imports and exports to GDP so it matters significantly to have that balanced. That itself creates an opportunity for us to guide the monetary environment toward lower interest rates that contribute to the broader objective, which is sustained economic growth and job creation. Up until 3Q2017, we had nine consecutive quarters of growth. The dip in 3Q2017 is a reminder of the importance of progressing with the reform agenda. We have seen positive signs with employment, with some 30,000 new jobs created in 2016 and more than 20,000 in the first three quarters of 2017. The unemployment rate for July 2017 stood at 11.3%, falling significantly, though still too high. This fall came from job creation, as more workers are joining the labor force. We look forward to sustained growth driven by reforms that attract investment, which is quite different from public sector-led growth.</p><h4>What reforms are currently critical?</h4><p>We require a number of supply-side reforms that are all incrementally important. In terms of customs, for example, we are an open economy, and the ease of crossing the border is important. However, a well-regulated border is also key. We need to find a way to do that in a modern world using technology, such as the port community system and implementation of the Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA), which reduces red tape. There is soft infrastructure being done by the government, such as updating the customs law, as well as hard infrastructure by private sector interests, like the dredging of the port of Kingston. BOJ also has an important role to play in the financial sector as a supervisor of banks. We also oversee overall financial system stability through a statutory committee called the Financial System Stability Committee that has representatives from the big financial sector regulators and policymakers on it. This enhances the macroprudential oversight we have in place in Jamaica. We also continue to reform the liquidity provision mechanisms to modernize and introduce more market pricing.</p><h4>How do you plan to continue supporting the improvement of macroeconomic indicators in Jamaica in the coming years?</h4><p>The number-one thing is to deal with the reform and modernization of BOJ, specifically the changes that need to be made to transition BOJ's policy operations to fully fledged inflation targeting. The government is currently considering proposals for modernizing the central bank and is likely to proceed with them. This will put the authorities in a position to allow stakeholders to think about money in the context of low inflation and rely on that over the medium term. The value of that is that with the focus of monetary policy on inflation rather than the exchange rate, we then have the opportunity for the central bank to push further in financial deepening. This allows the financial sector around it to innovate and adds many things that people are seeking in terms of more efficient regulation. We can have a better environment by changing some of these rules and regulations, which is a prize worth having since the financial sector can be a drag on an economy and at times perpetuate certain types of behavior that sap value. However, a financial sector that serves an economy effectively and efficiently can resemble the oil in an engine.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-grass-may-not-be-greener]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of Portland Holdings in the development of Jamaica, and what investment opportunities do you see?</h4><p>Portland Holdings has major investments in terms of financial services with banks, such as National Commercial Bank (NCB), the largest bank in Jamaica, and Guardian Holdings, the largest insurance company in the Caribbean, which we have recently taken a large interest in. NCB is the largest financial conglomerate in the Caribbean and Jamaica, and thus, we have an opportunity to have a positive impact on its development. We have been a great role model for other companies in terms of our attitude of not only doing well as a business but also doing good for the community. When we took over the bank in 2002, it had a 24% market share and made USD6 million in 2001 in after-tax profits. In the year ending September 2017, we made over USD150 million. In the last 14 years, we have had cumulative profits of over USD1.5 billion and have paid nearly half a billion dollars in income taxes. The bank, therefore, is influential in that not only is it a role model but also an economic driver and the largest taxpayer in Jamaica. Its mission is to build an institution so eminent in its global success that young bright Jamaicans will not feel the need to emigrate to get their professional, financial, and entrepreneurial fulfillment, but can get it working for a globally distinguished financial institution hailing from Jamaica.</p><h4>How would you characterize the overall investment climate in Jamaica in terms of foreign investment?</h4><p>There is a great deal of liquidity in the system, and this is always a great thing. Secondly, business and consumer confidence is the highest it has been for 50 years. The government is working hard to make Jamaica business friendly, and the objective in the next three years is to be in the top 10 of the World Bank's ease of doing business list. The environment is extremely pro-business, the rule of law is absolutely strong, and there is confidence in the justice system. For a foreign investor, it is a great opportunity. Things can be acquired relatively inexpensively, and given the current environment, this is extremely positive.</p><h4>What are the remaining challenges for foreign investment and the country's strategy to overcome these?</h4><p>The biggest challenge is the reputation of crime. Jamaica has reduced its debt-to-GDP ratio from 160% in 2013 to about 115% in 2017, a challenge taken on when Jamaica signed the IMF agreement in 2013. Since then, Jamaica has been an A student at passing quarterly IMF tests; whatever task Jamaica puts its attention to, it does a wonderful job. The focus is now on reducing crime significantly, which is one challenge. The other is just resetting and recalibrating standards of expectations in getting things done by the bureaucracy.</p><h4>What is your short-term outlook for the economy and your company's priorities for 2018?</h4><p>I never have a short-term outlook because life is not linear. You know which direction you are aiming toward, and if you work toward that, then great things will happen. You just have to focus on what it is you are doing, put in the requisite intelligence and passion, and persevere and great things will happen; often they already are. It is not linear, so I cannot predict with any accuracy what will happen in the next year. However, the table is set in terms of the confidence level that is in Jamaica, not to mention the liquidity, strength of national reserves, and direction of debt-to-GDP, which is tumbling. This is all against a background of the government not having any room to maneuver to stoke the community. Once there is more fiscal space, the government will have the room to do more infrastructure projects and stoke of the economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the Jamaican diaspora in investing in Jamaica and consuming Jamaican products?</h4><p>The remittances from the diaspora amount to over USD2 billion per year. In addition to that, the diaspora is a warm market for Jamaican products, given people's nostalgia for what they ate as a child. The UK, Canada, and the US are the core markets for our food exports in particular. JAMPRO takes Jamaican companies to trade shows internationally. For some markets, this is our principal means of penetration. We try new consumer penetration strategies as well. Currently, we have several companies exhibiting their products in a cosmetics and beauty supplies store in London. We are bringing in distributors to look at and try products and hopefully sign contracts.</p><h4>What is JAMPRO doing to promote foreign investment in Jamaica?</h4><p>Our investment program starts with Vision 2030, a bipartisan program aimed at making Jamaica a developed country by 2030, part of which includes FDI. We have six sectors in which we promote investment that we have selected based on Jamaica's advantages, such as our natural and human resources and location. The six sectors are tourism, outsourcing, minerals, mining and energy, manufacturing and logistics, and agriculture. One of the biggest events we have is our triennial Jamaican Investment Forum, which we stage in Montego Bay. We held this in 2012 and 2015 and will hold another in 2018. This event is for around 400 handpicked and vetted investors potentially interested in these six targeted sectors. Of these, tourism is one of our biggest contributors of foreign exchange and growing at about 5% per year in terms of visitor arrivals. There are at least 10,000 rooms that will be built in the next five years. Secondly, outsourcing, including business process outsourcing (BPO), in which 25,000 people are already employed and growing presents a huge opportunity in Jamaica. The opportunity here owes to our strong local workforce for BPO. Added to this, our proximity and cultural affinity with the US makes it quite seamless, with Americans being happy to have their call answered by a Jamaican voice. In the minerals, mining, and energy sectors, our largest mineral exports are bauxite and alumina. We have had some strong investment in this area recently, with the Chinese takeover of the Alpart Alumina Refinery in St. Elizabeth and the American Noranda Company, which has taken over the plant in St. Ann. In addition to bauxite, over 80% of the surface area of Jamaica is limestone, which has a huge opportunity for export because of its 99.4-99.8% pure-grade. This means we can export food and pharmaceutical-grade limestone. In terms of energy, JAMPRO plans to expand the use of renewables to 30% by 2030, from 14% today. Manufacturing will receive a huge boost because of the development of Jamaica's special economic zones (SEZs). SEZs will take over from the free zones because they are more integrated into the fabric of the economy. This makes it exciting because we are truly looking at investments along the entire value chain. This leads to logistics, and Jamaica's location directly north of the Panama Canal gives us a great opportunity to be a regional distribution hub. The Port of Kingston was privatized by a French firm in 2016 and is improving its efficiency. The sixth sector with huge opportunities is agriculture. Jamaica has long been a producer of sugar cane, but that is far from the only product. Another is Blue Mountain Coffee, which is one of the five most expensive in the world. Then there is cocoa production, Jamaica being one of the eight countries in the world allowed to use the term “fine cocoa" because of our cocoa blend. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[50% of Saudi population under 25]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[fadi-kawar-ceo-lebara-mobile]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you positioned Lebara Mobile as mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) in the telecommunication landscape?</h4><p>The Middle Eastern mobile markets have relatively high barriers to entry for MVNOs, though we have succeeded in capturing our market share nonetheless. We found a niche with our offering and have gathered a strong subscriber base. The frequent changes in the regulations in the Saudi telecommunications have not distracted us from our focus; it encouraged us to streamline our operations. Globally, our focus is to target migrant communities and Medium Low Income nationals with pay-as-you-go SIM cards, and that is how we started in 2014. Before entering the Saudi market, Lebara has experience in building a successful MVNO in eight countries, and we have the know-how to target the underserved segment of the market that we are in. Simplicity and trust are our core values, and we have built our entire business on these values.</p><h4>How do you envision Lebara Mobile being part of the Kingdom's comprehensive transformation trajectory to diversify the economy?</h4><p>Vision 2030 has opened up major opportunities for the technology sector, and we will certainly be part of this journey. Saudi Arabia is in a unique demographic position, with 50% of the population under 25 years old. The current leadership of the country is young as well, understands technology better, and wants to make a real change. With NEOM and the opening up of the entertainment industry, the Kingdom is set for a major transformation. This also means an influx of FDI into a broad range of sectors, as our economy grows more open and transparent. The total revenue of global telecommunications industry is anticipated to be almost EUR1.2 trillion by 2019, and Saudi Arabia has the highest mobile penetration, which means opportunities lie ahead. The coming years are all about offering differentiations to our customers, and as the country opens up, we explore new tools and partnerships to provide more products and services. Vision 2030 gives unique momentum to agile and dynamic companies to grow quickly and to serve customers better, and we want to be part of that wind of change.</p><h4>How has your mobile virtual network enabler (MVNE), in collaboration with Huawei, advanced since its inception in 2016?</h4><p>This was an excellent partnership and it has been great to see how it caught on and evolved. We are able to enter certain segments and issue new products quickly and effectively. It is mostly the speed of action with this platform that allows us to be more agile and dynamic.</p><h4>How do you envision becoming more active in the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT)?</h4><p>The Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) issued two public consultations, one related to relaxing regulations and the other on the intention to issue licenses called IoT-VNOs, which is an MVNO that specializes in the IoT business. These regulations will facilitate our IoT positioning as we already have the proper infrastructure and expertise to enter in this market.</p><h4>What are your expectations of the telecommunication market in the coming years, especially with regard to data?</h4><p>The opening up of VOIP communications has had a negative impact on our voice revenue, while it positively attributed to the data demand of our customers. The shift to data is a global, and similarly to our operations in other countries, we are building our projects and offerings around this, for example, free minutes along with data packages. IoT, along with other data-heavy mobile phone applications like video streaming and online gaming, will boost data demand in the years to come. For gaming, we are working on new partnerships.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the coming years?</h4><p>We want to diversify and transform our telecoms business to align with vision 2030 requirements.  The telecommunication industry is rapidly developing, and we want to ahead of the game. Telecommunications—voice and data—will remain our bread and butter for the time being, though we will explore and materialize all the opportunities to broaden our services. We strive to create new revenue streams and change the way we approach the market. We are an international brand with a national heart.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[bader-khalid-al-anzi-ceo-solidarity-takaful]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Solidarity Takaful's position in the market?</h4><p>Our vision has always been to offer the best takaful products that comply with sharia principles, all while serving customers in a way they have not been served before. This was not an easy journey, and while the SAMA works to help takaful companies, we had to come up with a hybrid model to satisfy the customer and regulator. We came up with a unique model since our company was established, and it has to do with distributing the surplus for our customers, if we have one. Some companies now seek to follow that same model that we created.</p><h4>How do you distribute the surplus to your customer base, and how is it different from what was done previously?</h4><p>Our company's role is only to take a percentage of what customers paid in order to provide our service, rather than using the entire premium. The model that we use is that everyone contributes to our takaful pool, though at the end the company takes 5% for management fees and a 10% performance incentive for our employees. The remainder goes back to policyholders as long as there is a surplus in our portfolio. No one else has this unique model, and we are extremely pleased with how it is working. Our customers are also pleased by how much they get back from their overall annual contribution. Sometimes they use it to renew their policy, and sometimes they simply take the cash.</p><h4>How have adjustments in the framework by SAMA impacted your operations?</h4><p>It is working on organizing the competition and avoiding the bad practices that occurred in the market before. It is also working to be fair with both companies and customers at the same time. In prior years, customers did not know their rights. One challenge SAMA is working on is aligning the insurance market with Vision 2030. New products are needed in the market, and we see that with international companies that seek to enter the Saudi market and want to have the right insurance plans while they are here. We received news about a few special products that will be introduced in the market. Through our coordination, we came up with new products that will be extremely helpful for newcomers in the market.</p><h4>What products have been growing in demand in recent years?</h4><p>We have 67 products in total. We work to have a great mix in our portfolio, avoiding concentrating on just a few. Some companies do not do this; however, it is key to our success. The market is open, as is competition. We need to use this opportunity to build a balanced portfolio, without depending on anything specific. We have life, marine, engineering, medical, and motor, for example, and some of them are compulsory, while others are commercial.</p><h4>Do you provide packages to your customers?</h4><p>We do have packages, though they are limited. Therefore, we are trying to offer too many packages that could be complicated. We prefer to let our customers select what is most useful for them. We always try to offer whatever they may need and keep their business within our company, though the competition is challenging. People are now more aware of insurance than they were before. They previously believed it was unacceptable and not compliant with sharia. However, they now better understand what it is and the benefits insurance can bring. They also know there are specifically sharia-compliant products on the market now and they can contribute and still get the same benefits. The industry has flipped 180 degrees. 2017 saw the market expand to nearly SAR37 billion (USD9.87 billion), and growth is ongoing. There are still some challenges, especially during this transformation period; however, I hope growth will continue. It all depends on how people understand the market.</p><h4>What is the current level of understanding of life insurance specifically?</h4><p>Life insurance is still a huge challenge in Saudi Arabia, and we are working hard to convince our customers about how important it is. Lately, the government has also come out in support of the idea of life insurance, and pensions become more popular. It will not be compulsory, though the government will encourage people to contribute to such products that can help them retire or pay out a bulk amount to a beneficiary. Most people believe that it is against sharia to have life insurance, and our mission is thus to promote products that are in line with their beliefs. Then, we will educate and explain how they work and how people can reap the benefits of such products. I expect a major shift in the life segment in Saudi Arabia in the coming years.</p><h4>What synergies do you strive for with your sister companies in Bahrain and Jordan?</h4><p>We have Solidarity Group Holding, which owns 27.5% of our stocks. It also owns majority percentage in Jordan and the same in Bahrain. There has been a great deal of coordination between the three affiliates recently. We have unified our logo and one will be able to see the same branding in all three locations, which will make customers more comfortable when it comes to using or planning their insurance in all three countries. When it comes to experience, Bahrain is the most well versed in the market, as its company was established long before ours. We are working to learn as much as we can from its products and performance. We are currently studying our options for expansion, and there may be more news coming soon.</p><h4>What are your ambitions and expectations for the coming years?</h4><p>The local market has more insurance companies than needed, and many companies are working to merge to create stronger and larger entities that can compete. Solidarity is also looking for a M&amp;A opportunity; we have not made any decisions yet, though we expect such a move to increase our market share and create a stronger company. There are currently 30 companies in the market; however, 15 would be enough for this market. SAMA will likely not issue any new licenses at this time. It may later issue licenses for foreign companies, though it may want to minimize the number of companies operating currently.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the relevance of Embraco's presence in Mexico in reference to its global strategy?</h4><p>The North American market is extremely important for us in terms of global strategy, not only because of its size but also because of the number of customers we have here. Having a facility here is not just for the supply chain; we rely on our staff in both Mexico and the US to improve the partnership and relationship with our customers. This team of professionals from customer service and technical support is dedicated to provide the best products and solutions.</p><h4>How successful has your decision to move here in 2011 been?</h4><p>The decision has proven to be extremely successful. Over the past five to six years, we have increased our relevance here significantly and not only in terms of productivity or product portfolio. Today, we have 1,300 people in Mexico unit, in addition to the sales office and warehousing in Atlanta. It has been a major driver for us here in North America and we continue to focus on finding different ways to deliver value to our customers and improve our operations globally.</p><h4>Do you see any opportunities for expanding your facilities and manufacturing facilities in Mexico in the short or medium term?</h4><p>Over the past few years, we sought to continue to improve the business and look for opportunities to increase our portfolio of cooling solutions. Now, we are on an important journey for our operations that is the implementation of a methodology called world-class manufacturing (WCM). This is a methodology that started to be implemented at Embraco in Brazil and has spread to all our plants around the world. In Mexico, it started in 2015. It is a structured, rigorous and integrated methodology for continuous improvement of operations, and not just for productivity. It impacts the mindset of the organization. One of the big changes in terms of mindset is to believe that “zero is possible:" zero accidents, zero defect, zero waste, and zero breakdowns. This drives the environment of operations, dynamics, and management, and the way it is structured to truly incredible high-level self-efficiency. It goes back to the way that we engage and train our team and select the different project teams. It is an interesting framework that we have been applying to all our plants step by step. It is a long journey and we have just started.</p><h4>What are the pillars of Embraco's innovation strategy?</h4><p>Innovation is part of everything we do and it starts with the company's mission to provide innovative solutions to improve the quality of life. We focus on two things: innovation and sustainability. On the innovation side, we invest 3-4% of our revenues in R&amp;D. Today, globally we have almost 600 people who are dedicated to research technology and innovation. From those, 120 are in partnership with universities around the world. We have 47 labs around the world for research and development. It is about innovation focusing on delivering business results and we have seen the results. At last count, we had 1,700 patents granted worldwide,  and almost 60% of revenues in the past five years came from products launched within the same period.</p><h4>How are your products more in line with the industry's environmental concerns?</h4><p>Sustainability for Embraco is not just about the product; we approach sustainability as part of the value chain. We also have two other strategies on our sustainability approach. One is related to our employees and our people. We connect it to values in diversity and our impact on local communities. The other one is related to the supply chain; we try to engage with our suppliers, setting the highest standards to minimize the overall impact. On this supply chain, we have a circular economy approach. We collect the home appliance used by our customers and recycle and upcycle them. We increase the value of the raw material or end product and sell it back to partners or other industries that use this material. This has more value than the usual process of tearing a product apart. In three years, we have recycled 20,000 tons.</p><h4>What are your short-term goals in 2018, and what is your strategy to reach them?</h4><p>The short-term goal is to continue to drive the WCM in operations. As an industry, we have goals in terms of increasing productivity and improving all dimensions of the business. In the short term, our goal is to work on overall operations, not only on the productivity side but also the manufacturing side and the entire process of operations. On the innovation side, we work on partnering with customers to provide short-term solutions on core development programs to tailor products to their needs. In parallel to the process, we want to create the technology for the future. It is an exercise of addressing the urgent needs of our customers by keeping in mind what the future will be and how we can continue to innovate and provide solutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[2017-usd23-billion-in-contracts]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the evolution of Powerchina in Panama since 2014 and what is the importance of Panama for the entire group?</h4><p>The initial contact of the group with Panama was in 2009, in the bid for the first expansion of the Panama Canal through its subsidiary Sinohydro. Following the restructuring of Powerchina's international businesses in 2016, six regional offices were established globally. Panama was chosen to be the headquarters of the group's operations in the Americas in August that year. One year later and thanks to the work of a multidisciplinary team formed by Panamanian, Chinese, and professionals from other nations, Powerchina was awarded, in consortium with a local company, the water infrastructure project 'Extensión del Anillo Hidráulico hacia Panamá Este'. This election and achievement underline the commitment of Powerchina with Panama and its firm interest in contributing to the country's development process, supporting the execution of plans, programs and strategic projects in the fields of energy, social development, and transport infrastructure.</p><h4>Why was Panama selected as one of the company's six regional offices?</h4><p>As mentioned before, the group's international businesses is divided into six regions, one of which is the Americas. As the leader of the company's business in the Americas, I had to take the decision on the location of this regional headquarters. Among the options, there were the countries where our presence were already consolidated but Panama was finally the choice. What set Panama apart from the rest of the other alternatives were its strategic geographical position, its economic stability with the US dollar as currency and its political and social stability as a democratic country. Panama offers a central location from where we can oversee and manage our operations in the region. Besides that, Panama is connected by air to almost every major city in the US, and this year it will become connected to Beijing. As well it has one of the most developed infrastructure in the region and a high quality of life. And finally, there is a Multinational Corporation Headquarters law that provides benefits, both at a corporate and personal level, and thanks to which we have access to tax exemptions and special visas for personnel.</p><h4>What is your opinion of public sector support in Panama?</h4><p>Panama has a healthy economic environment and a high institutional support is offered for the development of infrastructure projects in the country. Proof of this is the government's strategic plan, where the public investment programs in infrastructure sectors are one of the central pillars. Currently the overall budget for the construction industry is approximately USD4 billion, which represents important public support for companies devoted to the construction sector. Regarding private investment programs, we are focused on the energy sector, where we expect to qualify to participate in PPPs and concessions for a hydroelectric plant and a transmission line.</p><h4>What are your main projects in the country and what others are in the pipeline?</h4><p>We are pursuing a number of projects in Panama in cooperation with local companies and foreign companies with a consolidated presence in LATAM. One of them is Line 3 of the Panama City Metro, in consortium with the Spanish construction company Acciona. This project is of greatest interest to us due to its scale and the technical challenge it represents. Such a partnership between a Spanish company and a Chinese company like ours creates a synergy that makes us a strong and reliable proponent, offering quality, technology, the understanding of the socio-cultural environment and language, and great financial capacity. Others are energy-related projects involving transmission lines and a hydro-power plant: the Transmission Line IV and Bocas del Toro hydro-power plant. Due to the scale of both projects, our strategy will be as well to form alliances with foreign company with strong presence in LATAM. We are assessing other medium-sized projects in the fields of social development with the aim of expanding the scope of work and becoming an important player in the development of Panama.</p><h4>What are your projections for further China-Panama business in light of growing diplomatic relations?</h4><p>I am extremely confident that in the coming years this market will be active for Chinese companies. With the government-to-government finance framework agreement already signed, it is very likely that funding from the Chinese government will come soon to promote infrastructure projects of major importance to Panama. This new context represents an excellent platform for trade and investment promotion. I have participated in a number of business forums held both in Panama and China and I can say that there are great business opportunities here that will definitely attract the interest of investors from China. There are also talks of a first direct flight between Beijing and Panama City which is said to start be operated at the end of March this year and will undoubtedly promote tourism by Chinese citizens. The establishment of bilateral relations creates a scenario suitable not only for economic and trade cooperation but also social, cultural, and educational cooperation in pursuing joint development goals. I have been working overseas for over 10 years and based on the country's potential I can see that in the future Panama will be among the most developed countries in the world.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for 2018?</h4><p>We are focused on developing an adequate capacity at headquarters for the support of the operations of the group in the Americas. We are aiming to strengthen our internal governance system. This is extremely important, as our philosophy is to manage the company and projects with people. In 2017 our numbers were great; we won about USD2.3 billion worth of contracts in this region and broke into the markets of four new countries: Panama, Brazil, Peru, and Guyana. In 2018 we expect to have around USD2.5 billion worth of business and to enter the Chilean, Dominican, and Paraguayan markets. We want to extend our business network to cover every corner of the Americas. Particularly in Panama we will bid flagship projects with estimated contract values between USD500 million and USD2.6 billion and our target is to secure at least one of these.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[15% of EBITDA from Portugal]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[joao-manso-neto-ceo-edp-renewables]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since 1996, EDP Renewables has grown extensively to become the world's fourth-largest wind energy producers. How does the company currently contribute to Portugal's energy mix through its installed capacity of wind farms?</h4><p>We began in Portugal and Spain, which today are two important markets, and have been developing from the beginning. We represent around 24% of the Portuguese installed capacity. Renewables not only reduce our import bill in terms of energy, but also have an important impact on local communities. Traditionally, renewable energy is located in areas with low levels of development, and the wind industry has been able to distribute income to those areas. An important part of our portfolio was linked to an industrial cluster in Portugal. About 10 years ago, there was a competition wherein developers not only had to build wind farms but also bring together an industrial cluster. Today, there are more than 1,000 people linked to that. It is important because this electrical production not only supplies the domestic market but most of this production is exported. Our work in Portugal not only has a direct impact in terms of balance of payments and population, but also in terms of developing the industry itself.</p><h4>EDP Renewables carefully plans wind farms throughout the construction, development, and operation of the project. How does this meticulous process enable your company to fully maximize the value of your assets?</h4><p>This is not a short-term activity. This is something that we need a long-term view for. If we want to extract value, we have to go through the entire value chain, from the identification of the country and place to the kind of renewable energy available. We also have to obtain permits, which are extremely important. We cannot deny that renewables are important; however, they also have environment impacts as well. We have to mitigate these impacts, such as visual impact or noise. Subsequently, we focus on the optimization of the layout and construction, as well as operation and maintenance throughout the entire project. In the past, things were different, and we just had tariffs and the sale of energy was not an issue. We were just focused on production and generation. Today, we have to know how to sell in the markets. We have to be able to manage market risks and have a better forecast of the wind. This enables us to be better prepared throughout the entire value chain.</p><h4>How do you determine the best sites for your photovoltaic projects and what kind of potential do you anticipate for the solar power market in Portugal?</h4><p>In the past, we did not develop solar. Everyone wants not only clean energy, but also cheap energy. About five years ago, solar was significantly more expensive than wind. However, following recent trends, solar energy could also be important. Solar tends to be cheaper today. Solar power also has some of the advantages that wind power lacks, such as a lower impact in terms of sound and visual. Solar will become more important in the near future.</p><h4>What is your company's commitment to world-class engineering and construction standards?</h4><p>The plants that we build should be first-class plants. We do not build plants to have the maximum amount of MW; we build them to be efficient. Wherever there is sun or wind, we must be available in order to generate power. Having a high quality of construction and first-class management is extremely important. Construction is just the first phase. We also need excellent operation methods; otherwise, we do not extract value. Before, developers externalized everything. What we are doing now is increasingly internalizing activities to take care of what is going on in the core in terms of operation. We have increased the quality of our work as well as the yield.</p><h4>What have been the key factors contributing to EDP Renewables' successful international expansion?</h4><p>When we go abroad, we have to be able to prove that we can do it. Our core markets were Portugal and Spain, and we decided to go abroad exporting our experience throughout the entire value chain. We began with France, though the big jump was with the US. Today, the US represents about 50% of our total capacity, and it has been the most dynamic market. We are proud when we go abroad to act as a local company. We have centralized expertise, however, when we go out to the field, we act as locals; therefore, we are not seen as a foreign company. We have to act according to the rules and customs in each country. It is important that we do not have an obsession with centralization but with efficiency, respect, and understanding the local market. Today, Portugal represents no more than 15% of our EBITDA. Spain is still important, though the US is one of the most important areas in terms of growth.</p><h4>What steps are you taking as CEO to ensure the company delivers robust revenue growth, profitability, and overall value for shareholders and investors?</h4><p>We have a simple strategy: we grow where it makes the most sense in terms of the country and the company. For the country, it makes sense when it needs renewables to replace fossil fuels and when a country has excellent resources. It should be a profitable business model and based on long-term agreements. We want to grow, though in a way that makes sense. We need to have an excellent way of operating. The first issue is that we have strong discipline in terms of finances. We have to be comfortable with our level of debt and financing. Our financing is based on our ability to generate cash. In addition, we have a human resources policy that is focused on empowering people in the field.</p><h4>Given the economic recovery underway in Portugal, what are your expectations for the economy in the coming years?</h4><p>Portugal has made important efforts in recent years in terms of opening its economy. That will continue, and the power sector offers an important opportunity in terms of reducing the import bill and in terms of creating jobs. In addition, economic growth will continue to accelerate in line with the decentralization we are seeing in the power sector, and not only in renewables.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What distinguishes PSU from other public and private institutions in KSA?</h4><p>What distinguishes PSU is primarily our academic structure and flexibility in decision making. As a private university, we are nimble and responsive to the needs of the job market. Additionally, the diversity in our population is a plus; we currently have 34 different nationalities among our faculty members and over 25% of our enrollment is international students. Our academic facilities are also equipped with the latest technologies. As the first step in a crafted three-stage curriculum, the focus is on cultivating soft skills as the students go through a one-year preparatory program that cues the transition between high school and higher education. Then, moving onto the second level, they select and do their university pro-grams. The third, and capstone element, level is the co-op program. This is a rigorous seven-month immersion into the workforce that narrows the gap between the theories learned in the classroom and the practices of the workplace.</p><h4>How have you achieved a high level of internationalization in terms of students?</h4><p>International students know very well what they will receive when they come to PSU. PSU has proven the success and value of private higher education through its quality academic programs. Over the years we have developed a reputation for the rigor and thoroughness of our programs and the quality of our graduates. Our programs are designed to bridge the gap between education and employment through OJT cued directly to the job market. Public universities have a great mission to educate and graduate the young adults of our nation. We have a more flexible remit and the international students enhance the experience for everyone.</p><h4>PSU's graduates are in high demand from the private sector. How do you develop curricula to meet the market's needs?</h4><p>It is extremely important to match what the job market needs with the skills university graduates possess. Three parties have roles to play here: the private sector, universities, and the government through the Ministry of Education. We have an advisory board in each college that meets once a year. These boards are drawn from the business and professional communities. With all of this input, we update our programs frequently with the help of international consultants as well. For example we reviewed and upgraded our law program a few years back. PSU was the first institution to start a law program for female students in 2007. After two waves of graduation, we assembled an international committee to work on updating our law program and had it reviewed by law professors from the University of Richmond, Cambridge, and Harvard Law Schools. Typically, lawyers are either familiar with Islamic law or US or UK law; we want our graduates to have knowledge of both. The fact that our students have moved on to renowned American law schools, such as Harvard, Duke, Columbia, and UC Berkeley for their LLMs and passed the New York Bar Exam demonstrates the quality of our programs.</p><h4>Is the sector witnessing a period of change and, if so, how are your goals impacted?</h4><p>PSU contributed significantly to the National Transformation Program. The University started on that campaign with its Community Services and Continuing Education Center's Education for Employment (E4E) program in 2009. It is specialized for unemployed local university graduates. Candidates are screened and selected on merit. Participants go through the program for 16 months, first building up proficiency in English and development of practical skills. They then move on to advancing up levels of professional certifications. We want to nationalize our E4E model and see it adopted with guidance from PSU at other universities across the country. Higher education has to deal with the evolving professional needs of the 21st century, and in this sense we have been part of this reform for nearly a decade.</p><h4>What are your plans for the next 12 months?</h4><p>Our strategic plan is focused on research and NTP initiatives. We have established a Research and Initiatives Center that has three components: PSU Research Review, an international scholarly journal; pursuit of NTP initiatives led by research teams from our five colleges; and lab research and group projects that signal the identity of PSU research work and raise the impact of our published works.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where do you see opportunities for increased bilateral trade and investment in the coming years?</h4><p>Canada and Jamaica enjoy a strong trade relationship. In 2016, bilateral trade was valued at CAD316 million (USD255.5 million), with Canadian exports of CAD113.6 million (USD91.87 million) and imports from Jamaica of CAD202.4 million (USD163.7 million). The financial services sector has long been an area of Canadian economic engagement in Jamaica. Two major commercial banks in Jamaica are Canadian-owned: Scotiabank and CIBC First Caribbean International Bank (CIBC). Jamaica has always been a popular destination for sun-seeking Canadians and Canadian tourism providers have found excellent opportunities in the country. Canada and Canadian companies will continue to innovate in this sector as Jamaica explores sustainable and inclusive tourism options. Ecotourism is a growing sector of interest for Canadian companies, tour operators, and tourists alike. In terms of promising sectors for increased trade and investment, these include clean technologies and renewable energy, where Canada has substantial capabilities and experience. Particular strengths exist in solar energy, wind energy, bioenergy and biofuel technologies, small hydro, energy storage, and smart grid technologies.</p><h4>How does Canada continue to aid Jamaica mitigate criminal activities?</h4><p>Canada is a key international partner for Jamaica in its efforts to fight crime and violence. Jamaica has benefited from USD9 million in Canadian support since 2009 through the Anti-Crime Capacity Building Program (ACCBP) and the Counter-Terrorism Capacity Building Program (CTCBP). Assistance has been provided for training to tackle issues such as illicit drugs, corruption, human trafficking and migrant smuggling, crime prevention, security sector reform and proceeds of crime. Jamaica, along with the other Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries, is a recipient of development assistance through the USD600 million, 12-year Caribbean Regional Development Program announced in 2007. Collectively, Canada currently supports justice reform in the Caribbean with four projects worth over CAD80 million (USD64.7 million), two of which are dedicated to Jamaica and two that cover all CARICOM member states, including Jamaica.</p><h4>Canada hosts a significant Jamaican diaspora. What are the major contributions of this exchange of cultures?</h4><p>Canadians and Jamaicans work in areas of key importance, including security, human rights, and development. The Jamaican-Canadian population is approximately 350,000 strong and makes vital contributions in both countries and to the broader bilateral relationship. Jamaican Canadians are particularly prominent and influential in the Toronto area. Canada and Jamaica have a longstanding history of academic cooperation through a variety of agreements between our education institutions and through scholarship programs. Approximately 3,500 Jamaicans study across Canada every year.</p><h4>What role does the Canadian-Jamaican relationship play in Canada's foreign policy objectives for the region?</h4><p>Jamaica is a close partner for Canada in the Caribbean region and an influential member of CARICOM. Canada and Jamaica celebrate 55 years of diplomatic relations in 2018, though our relations have even deeper roots. Our relationship is founded on shared values: we support the rules-based international order by collaborating within the Commonwealth, the UN, and the OAS. We enjoy a comprehensive relationship, covering trade and investment, security and defense, development cooperation, and people-to-people relations. On November 21, 2017, at the CARICOM-UN High Level Pledging Conference in New York, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Development, announced Canada's pledge of CAD100 million (USD80.8 million) to support reconstruction and climate resilience efforts in the Caribbean region over the next five years. Canada's contribution will help the most vulnerable people, including women and children, to rebuild more resilient communities so they can be better prepared for natural disasters. Particular attention will be given to specific projects aimed at reconstructing essential services, improving disaster risk management and emergency preparedness practices, supporting the role of women as leaders in reconstruction, and adopting climate-adaptation measures at the community level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key actions of your government in order to foster sustainable and inclusive growth?</h4><p>The figures for 2017 will mark the fifth consecutive year of economic growth for the Jamaican economy and the highest employment level in the history of the country. These developments were supported by continued stability in the macroeconomic environment. This turn was supported by a sustainable fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation has been one of the pillars that underpinned the improvement in Jamaica's macroeconomic stability, which was supported by fiscal rules that are enshrined in the country's legislation. One of the key commitments of the government of Jamaica under the fiscal rule is a reduction of Jamaica's debt-to-GDP ratio to a ceiling of 60% by the end of fiscal year 2025/26. Additionally, the country has implemented several reforms to foster a continued low and stable inflation rate, stability in the exchange rate, and a gradual reduction in the interest rate. Another important issue was addressing key supply side constraints to economic growth. The Jamaican economy suffered as a result of weather-related shocks as well as price shocks, particularly fluctuations in oil prices. These shocks, in addition to crime and the level of education and training of the labor force, have historically contributed to low levels or the complete absence of economic growth within the country. Measures that have been implemented to address supply-side constraints include stabilizing the supply chain, diversifying energy sources, strengthening linkages within the economy, developing human capital, improving the overall business climate, and increasing access to financing, particularly for micro, small, and medium-sized businesses.</p><h4>Jamaica seeks to become the place of choice to live, work, raise families, and do business by 2030. How is Jamaica advancing toward this national vision and what are the main challenges?</h4><p>Vision 2030 Jamaica — National Development Plan is Jamaica's first long-term national development plan, covering the 21-year period 2009-2030. The plan presents a strategic roadmap for Jamaica to achieve developed country status by 2030 and is currently in its eighth year of implementation. This development will be sustainable and inclusive, engaging all Jamaicans in the plan, design, and implementation processes and providing equitable opportunities to all Jamaicans to benefit from development. Vision 2030 Jamaica is built on a results-based management framework, comprising four goals, 15 national outcomes, and a strategic and operational framework geared toward the achievement of the goals and outcomes. The achievement of the goals and outcomes is embodied in the Vision Statement “Jamaica, the place of choice to live, work, raise families and do business." Our risks and challenges include vulnerabilities to shocks in the global economy and the impact of natural hazards and climate change. Other challenges include delays or reduction in aid flows and donor funds due to Jamaica's upper middle-income developing country classification, as well as delays in the implementation of reforms and projects.</p><h4>Jamaica is strategically located between the Panama Canal and major international markets. How does it plan to leverage this asset to become a center of trade?</h4><p>The Logistics Hub Initiative (LHI) Market Analysis and Master Plan completed in December 2017 indicates that at full buildout, the LHI will comprise just over 3,800ha of development across the island, with a total order-of-magnitude cost of over USD28 billion (USD22 billion in industrial investment) and the creation of 87,400 direct jobs. Jamaica must aggressively position itself as a global logistics hub and special economic zone destination by capitalizing on its strategic maritime location and attractive airspace to serve the major trade corridors of globally trading firms. With port and airport expansion and complementary logistics facilities development already underway, Jamaica has a unique opportunity to leverage the physical and performance dimensions of its assets to attract investments into our SEZs, with many export-focused industries having much to gain from the expanded transport connectivity and increased access to markets that large domestic ports and airports can provide. Market access potential for industries is significant as the Latin America and Caribbean region represents a consumer market of approximately 800 million people. The LHI and SEZ strategies leverage the logistics infrastructure and market access arrangements, and motivate several marquee industrial clusters being developed. Among many others, these developments include the JISCO Jamaica Industrial Park (JJIP), an aluminum cluster of over 100 firms, an aviation and aviation-related industrial cluster involving Sangster International Airport, Norman Manley International Airport, the proposed Vernamfield Aerotropolis, and the Caymanas Special Economic Zone, which will serve as a flagship light industry and logistics cluster. Jamaica has a distinct competitive position as a preferred western hemisphere investment location due to its proximity and connectivity to major trade blocs and markets that exist in close proximity of Jamaica. The US and Asia trade route is the main import route for small manufactured items in containers passing on their way to the east coast of the US. These commodities could be intercepted by Jamaica for customization and distribution, as the country has the potential to capture substantial trade that will stimulate a host of activities associated with freight handling, value-added, and light manufacturing activities. The Panama Canal expansion creates opportunities for Jamaica to capture cargo flows along Asian, US, and Latin American routes, especially due to the modest shift of Asia/North America trade from the Suez to the Panama route. The changing size of vessels and deployment of Post-Panamax Generation II (PPX2) of 8-10,000TEUs is being incorporated into the improvement of Jamaica's infrastructure capacity for transshipment services, to enhance the country's ability to effectively compete in the region.</p><h4>Your government is strongly pushing Jamaican competitiveness and ease to do business. What is your message to the international investor community regarding Jamaica's future in this regard?</h4><p>The government of Jamaica is committed to reforming its business environment to make it easier for local and foreign investors to do business. It has sought to do this through the creation of a competitiveness framework that seeks to identify challenges to doing business and mobilize the relevant arms of the government to implement reforms that positively impact the investor experience. In 2010, the government of Jamaica established the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) as a public-private partnership body to advance policy advocacy, research, and public awareness of reform initiatives that facilitate the creation of an enabling environment for businesses in Jamaica. Over the last five years, the government of Jamaica, through the NCC, has demonstrated that it is serious about improving the ease of doing business in the country and that it wants to provide a more enabling business climate for both local and international investors. This has been reflected in the upward movement of its ranking in the Doing Business Report from 867 in 2012 to 70 in 2018. Notably, Jamaica currently ranks fifth in starting a business, ahead of countries such as Singapore (sixth) and the US (49th). It also ranks 20th for getting credit and 35th for resolving insolvency. Jamaica is now third in Latin America and the Caribbean for reforms implemented over the past 15 years, with 25 reforms implemented, following Mexico and Colombia. In this year's ranking, Jamaica ranks second after Puerto Rico in the Caribbean, while the country maintained its sixth-place spot in Latin America and the Caribbean, behind countries such as Mexico (49), Peru (58), and Colombia (59). In recent years, some key reforms that have been implemented are the implementation of a single business registration form and agency, the strengthening of the Commercial Court Division, consolidation of labor-related tax payments, mandatory system of e-filing for all major taxes, and the enactment of the ASYCUDA customs system to manage trade across borders, among many others. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the highlights of the past year for SGS?</h4><p>For SGS, 2017 was a special year. We began an extremely ambitious transformation plan to achieve certain KPIs. We have revamped our entire strategy in a process that involved all stakeholders. Today, we are present in 27 airports in the Kingdom and want to have a presence in every new airport that is constructed. We are working to expand beyond the definition of ground handling to become a services company that provides ground handling, ticketing, passenger services, hotel transfers, and related hospitality services. In the past year, our on-time performance has improved by more than 26% while customer complaints fell by 24%.</p><h4>How has the recent liberalization of the industry affected your business?</h4><p>We embrace the growing competition in the market. Living without standards or competitors against which one can assess their performance leads to inefficient operations. Competition brings greater vitality to the sector and gives us the energy to enhance our operations, standards, and perspectives. While there have been many positive effects, there have also been some negative ones. For example, while prices have fallen across the industry, we are not a price-driven organization, and if someone seeks a service based solely on price, then they will not approach us. We provide an integrated service from A to Z. Part of this includes managing the difficult environment we live in. We offer firms the ability to maximize operations across a wide variety of areas. Our clients require experienced account providers, and, as market leaders, this is the role we play. We are an agent that allows our clients, such as airlines, to maximize the efficiency of their operations. Our competitors undercut our prices by offering more restricted services, and we simply have to make this clear to the market.</p><h4>How has digitalization impacted your efforts at reform?</h4><p>We have time assessing our internal operations in order to design and implement more efficient systems and business processes. Before we implemented new technologies, we spent a great deal of time understanding exactly where our money was going. After conducting this analysis, we developed a solid plan to transform the company on both the services side and the operations side. We want to improve in ways that maximize shareholder value and customer experience. In order to ensure long-term sustainability, we have to understand the minutiae of our operations.</p><h4>Do you expect to benefit from the new airport in Jeddah, and how do you plan to capitalize on this project?</h4><p>This is a notable project, and we are eagerly anticipating the airport's impending opening. We did a great deal of work to partner with the airport authority and our partner airlines to make sure we could be responsive in this new environment. We want to be able to deliver comparable and superior levels of service in this new airport. Another element has been determining how we can maximize our own operations and revenue in this new space. There will be fewer buses in the new airport, for example, which is a service that generates significant revenue at the current airport. However, we will expand our special needs services in the new airport, which will tie into the increased number of Hajj and Umrah visitors. On that subject, we have launched a concept called Road to Mecca to assist religious visitors who often get stuck in Jeddah for a long time on their journey to Mecca because it is the gateway airport. Our aim is to minimize the traffic in Jeddah by transporting passengers directly from their home countries to Mecca. For example, we take their luggage directly to their hotel in Mecca and take care of their other requirements. We are building a luggage center in Mecca in partnership with the developer Jabal Omar Development Company so passengers do not have to check in at Jeddah Airport. In combination with the opening of the new Jeddah Airport, all this will make the growth in the number of pilgrim visitors smooth and easy.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the market in 2018?</h4><p>2018 will be defined by a great deal of transformation. Transformation on a company level begins with close analysis of financial statements with an eye on maximizing operations. In many transformations, the first year of change is the worst in terms of financial results. After the first year, the financial results fall in line with expectations. Currently, we expect SGS to perform well within our expectations in 2018. Transformation and modernization are important, though change is expensive. We expect to see even greater results in the coming years. Technology is a vital enabler of this business, and we must work to ensure that we position ourselves in a way that maximizes our current and future prospects. This year, we will ensure a future plan is in place, and we want to collaborate and share information with the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) and various other stakeholders. Opening the new airport in Jeddah is a major priority both personally and for SGS. We are committed to having it up and running successfully. Another key pillar is people. This includes how many we have, where they are located, making sure they are in the right jobs and have the right skills, and ensuring we have the right team, culture, and procedures in place. We hired our first female employees in December 2017 and aim to have 500 women working for SGS by the end of 2018. We are also working on a closer cooperation with TVTC to optimize our in-house vocational training, whilst our accredited Training Academy can also be used by other entities in the sector. This is all part of rebuilding the company in line with our KPIs and objectives, which have been shaped by the larger reform agenda at work in the Kingdom.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does your recent Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accreditation enhance your international recognition?</h4><p>Only 5% of the world's universities that offer graduate and undergraduate programs are accredited with AACSB, while only 2% of universities that only offer graduate programs have this accreditation. LBS has been accredited by AACSB, and we also received the Association of MBAs (AMBA) accreditation, which, again, only 2% of the world's schools have. We join an extremely elite group of schools. The AACSB accreditation is the gold standard, which helps us significantly because now we can attract people who would otherwise go abroad since we offer global standards. It does enhance our reputation, which is likely why we have seen such a high intake for the MBA program in 2017.</p><h4>What more can be done to reverse the trend of young Nigerians choosing to study abroad?<br></h4><p>We need more high-quality education institutions. Nigerians invest in education expecting a return on such an investment, and thus the only way to address this is to strengthen education to a higher quality. This cannot be done without resources, and in a recession, education institutions have fewer resources available. USD2 billion is spent on overseas education, which could be spent on the national system instead. Nonetheless, as of 2017, we have a higher number of private universities. If institutions like us can attain accreditation, this will prove to the people of Nigeria that local institutions can attain global standards, and their degrees from an accredited Nigerian school will appeal to employers around the world.</p><h4>What is the potential for Nigeria to become a higher education hub within Africa?</h4><p>There is a great deal of potential. There are currently more private universities than public ones, and the number is constantly growing. There is greater funding available because such universities typically have either an extremely wealthy owner or are faith-based, and hence promoted by a particular organization. Foreign universities are also interested in coming here; however, there are currently certain constraints in the regulations preventing foreign universities from setting up stand-alone campuses. Foreign universities are inclined to come and partner with a local university in Nigeria and that has the potential to strengthen the quality of the offering in the country. There is great potential, especially given that, by 2050, Africa will have the largest population of college-age students in the world.</p><h4>What can be done to further enhance the sector through public and private cooperation?</h4><p>The various arms of the government seek ways to partner with private universities. For example, the Lagos State government has raised the issue of internships for students in our various programs. Also, there is the TETFUND, a tertiary education fund that applies an education tax on all companies. This is a pool that is given to universities to enhance their operations. However, currently, the law precludes private universities from benefiting from this fund. If we are concerned with enhancing education at a national level, then funding should go to the entire tertiary education system, public or private. It is in the interest of private corporations to have a better qualified and skilled talent pool from which they can get their workforce, and various private companies have sought out ways to make this happen. Other ways of support include offering scholarships to undertake research. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In early 2017, the hospital was listed by the Lagos Stock Exchange as one of the fastest-growing companies in Africa. What was the main driver behind this success?</h4><p>The hospital has grown rapidly in the past five years, and since 1999 we have opened new clinics, increased our staffing, and put in place new processes and protocols. Our competitive edge is our ability to remain focused on providing quality healthcare. I look at other hospitals not as competitors, but as being in the same business of trying to provide quality and effective healthcare for the large population. The whole point is to provide quality healthcare at a reasonable cost, and we focus on that without cutting corners. There is a large gap in providing affordable healthcare. There are more entrants coming into the medical space, many coming from abroad from places such as India and Turkey. This proves that the healthcare business in Nigeria is vibrant, and there are untapped opportunities.</p><h4>What should be done to reverse the trend of people seeking treatment abroad?</h4><p>A great deal has to do with confidence in our system, and part of this is educating people and giving them examples of what has to be and can be done. Healthcare institutions have to showcase their achievements. We can safely perform various treatments here; however, people still go abroad for operations, mainly to the UK. It is a matter of building confidence through publications, demonstrations, and citing examples. There are other problems: Some hospitals and practitioners are not up to scratch, so more work has to be done by the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) to sanction and enforce regulations of what can and cannot be done in a hospital. My role in building up trust in Nigerian doctors is by running a company that patients can trust.</p><h4>What can the government do to boost the healthcare sector?</h4><p>The government and Ministry of Health can do more to equip the doctors with what they need to do their jobs. In the teaching hospitals, they need to do audits just to raise standards. Trying to do something with the government is extremely difficult; in addition, the sector needs stricter regulations and controls that must be enforced. The government needs to provide an enabling environment that encourages 'reverse' brain drain. Another important aspect of our trade is tools and medication. The cost of equipment is astronomical due to exchange rates and import taxes, as we do not manufacture equipment necessary for meaningful healthcare. Routine medical consumables, from the disposable couch covers or paper hand towels to disposable gloves, are more expensive that they ought to be. Drugs for some chronic ailments, immunosuppressants, and chemotherapy are beyond the reach of most of the people that require them, leading to avoidable deaths, 'poor' treatment, and various societal anomalies. Unless there is a determined effort by the government to review the healthcare space in Nigeria holistically, we will continue to lag behind our peer nations.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>The hospital will expand in 2018. I would like to increase our bed numbers; we currently have 65 beds in two hospitals and I would like to increase that to the hundreds. Also, I would like to perhaps open another hospital. In terms of the general operating environment, a great deal depends on things that are not under anyone's control. I do not think anything drastic will happen. In 2018, the country will prepare for the next election and that will have an impact on the economy as a whole. We do not expect any adverse effects on our business and hope to continue what we do as best as we can. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the evolution of Trace TV and Venator? </h4><p>Venator Partners is a media and entertainment business focused on the West African regional market. We sell advertising, manage celebrity talents for brands, and produce events, television shows, and trendy short-form clips. We also have a content business focused on the newer wave of audio-visual content in the region. When I started Venator in 2010-2011, one of the first clients I brought in was Trace TV, and we were representing them as an advertisement platform. Since then, we have become one of Trace's most important partners in Africa, and now, we hold a master license agreement (MLA) with Trace and work within the group on a Pan-African basis. Trace TV is a completely separate entity from Venator, but there is, in fact, an overlap in what both companies do. Because of our MLA, we report all our revenue to Trace TV, while for television advertising, there is a portion that goes on Trace channels and a portion that does not. For the rest of the business, we do revenue shares on predetermined percentages. We have been fortunate that Trace TV has grown into one of the most influential music and entertainment brands in the region.</p><h4>How can Trace TV help the music industry grow?</h4><p>We have a major part to play in that. Nigerian music is highly exportable, and we have 11 channels that are broadcast in over 180 countries with hundreds of millions of viewers. More than a third of our viewership is outside Africa. Our channels are broadcast in Europe, Asia, the US, and the Caribbean. When we promote a video, artist, or a song, we can open ears and influence listening habits much more so than other music platforms. We are in a unique position to do this with Trace TV because the other channel brand that has this global reach is MTV; however, MTV is regionalized in its content. For example, we put a great deal of effort into bringing Caribbean vibes to Africa that people here do not normally have access to. Conversely, we take Nigerian, Kenyan, and South African content to the Caribbean. We cut across multiple markets.</p><h4>How can Nigeria harness the potential of its talent and passion for music and make a business out of the entertainment sector?</h4><p>Some of the fundamental infrastructures of the music industry are not in place here in terms of publishing and music rights. The government is doing a few things, though it has not truly given that much attention to these issues to enable the industry to thrive. There is a royalty collecting society, however, it is unable to enforce its mandate because they have a limited repertoire, in addition is not supported by the government. Approximately 80-90% of the value of artists and songs is being played into the air and disappears. Beyond that, there is a great deal that could be gained by the general promotion of music here, for example by developing music tourism, whereby people come to Nigeria to check out the clubs and the live music scene. Then, there is the issue of live performances, as there are not enough venues. There should be 500 bars and clubs in Lagos where there is a live performance every weekend, but this is not the case. Lagos State is doing something about this; it has opened a second Terra Kulture in partnership with Bolanle Austen-Peters on Victoria Island. By the end of 2018, there will be six Terra Kulture centers in each of the major areas of Lagos. This means we can start to tour artists, music, plays, and more around Lagos. Given our love for music and enjoyment, a live music culture could easily thrive here. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which line of business has the largest weight in Doyin Group's portfolio today?</h4><p>I started in the agriculture business by growing and selling maize when I was 12. It cost me GBP48 at the time to start this business. Today, we are involved in all sectors of the economy, from agriculture to manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. We focus mainly on the food industry, the hospitality industry, and agro business. Agriculture is a major part of the government's policy to diversify the economy. Our products include what we can sell to department stores and exportable products. These include sesame seeds, cashew nuts, and ginger, which we grow and sell locally. Exportable products made Nigeria rich before independence because there was no oil at that time. For Nigerians, the land is God's gift, as is grain. When we were young, people used to plant large amounts of cotton and other products. When oil came, everyone left agriculture and cities grew. Agriculture has not been done in a modern way until now. It is much better for agriculturists to farm now. Furthermore, universities have begun to teach the subject, which they were not doing before. Agriculture is the only alternative to oil right now. There is definitely an incentive to go into agriculture. We will not need to import many varieties of food as they can be grown in the country. We are currently exporting some agricultural products, such as cassava. Many know they can earn more in foreign exchange in the form of exporting agriculture, which can be used to import raw materials for industries. Rice is one of the products Nigeria is talking about in terms of achieving self-sufficiency.</p><h4>How challenging is it for a company to initiate development solely with local capital and labor?</h4><p>My own determination is, in a sense, a part of how this company began without relying on foreign labor or capital. Nigerians should believe in themselves. What can be done anywhere in the world can be done here. There are enough brilliant people in Nigeria because many Nigerians have businesses in the US and elsewhere. We should use the technological achievements in Nigeria to develop the country so that is not dependent on foreign technology to survive. Take, for example, the Made in Nigeria brand, of which I am one of the pioneers. I believe in local resources. However, there is a perception that European goods are better than Nigerian ones.</p><h4>What impact has Doyin Group had on the country's economic diversification and growth?</h4><p>We have several thousand employees currently, and this is our contribution to the country's economy. Furthermore, our entire staff is Nigerian. In the hospitality and agricultural industries, I am determined to only hire Nigerians, and we are able to succeed because of that. I have been able to contribute to the country and train Nigerians—those who have left us to start their own business, those who are still with us, and those who have yet to join us.</p><h4>How would you assess the economic environment today for businesses?</h4><p>I see a great deal of progress in Nigeria. When I came to Lagos there was no Ikoyi or Victoria Island. There was only the island where Lagos was situated, a tiny space. In the last 50-plus years, over 100sqkm have been developed. I see many achievements.</p><h4>What do you expect from 2018?</h4><p>I hope to be able to bring our group more success in the relevant sectors of business. I also hope Nigeria will be able to do more by improving our skills. It is important to focus on areas that will make our country self-sufficient economically. Looking at South Africa as an example, Nigeria can do much better than any developing country if we are determined to do so. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Nigeria's agricultural sector performed recently?</h4><p>When the government came to power, there was a severe shortage of staples; therefore, so we looked at grains such as rice, wheat, and millet. After two years, I am pleased to say we are achieving self-sufficiency in rice paddy production, though milling is still a challenge. By March-April 2018, we will have overcome this issue, and there will be absolutely no need for Nigeria to import rice. We will have more than we need, and this will be the same for tubers. In terms of the domestic food supply, we are heading toward self-sufficiency by mid-2018. However, we still do not have enough milk, wheat, egg powder, and certain fruits. We are looking at exports, too, because the oil sector will not sustain Nigeria forever. Every country needs foreign exchange, so Nigeria has to find something else to export other than hydrocarbons. We are talking about enhancing cashew nuts and cocoa, not only for local consumption, but also for exports. Also in the works are sesame seeds, coconut oil, shea butter, and castor oil for products such as cosmetics. We look at policies to export to India where there is demand and exciting opportunities for such products. Nigeria is the world's largest producer of yams and we will enter into the production of cassava chips, as well as industrial starch and ethanol from cassava. We also plan to work on improving our processing and packaging.</p><h4>The ministry is committed to engaging the youth in agriculture. What has been the public's response to your measures to increase participation in agriculture?</h4><p>The beauty is that Nigerians are responsive; the number of people returning to agriculture has never been this large. This includes young people, women, civil servants, and the military. If we can mechanize and invite the younger generations into agriculture, the energy hidden in Nigerians that has not been exploited before will come alive. We are excited to tap into this. Nearly every sector of society is heading for the farms now, and it is exciting. Our duty at the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is to help clear the land and give them irrigation and approved seeds.</p><h4>What is the potential of Nigeria's agricultural sector, and what should be done to further unleash it?</h4><p>The potential is extremely high. Nigeria has about 50 million ha of uncultivated land and massive bodies of water and rivers. We will utilize our dams and lakes to ensure we grow food all-year round. This is one of 2018's investments. Once that happens, we invite the world to come. There is demand from Russia and Europe, and also West and Central Africa is fed by us. In another year or two, the world will hear great things from Nigeria's agriculture sector. We also want to educate Nigerians about the need for a healthier diet. Our children do not have enough milk; they should be having a pint a day for their minds and bodies. Currently, there are too many children with deficiencies in their diet, and therefore, they can never truly reach their full potential. This is one reason why we are entering into cattle breeding and working to improve the milk yield per cow.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>We should achieve around 3.5-4% GDP growth by YE2018. It could be more if we solve one problem, which is the cost of credit. If Nigerians have access to reasonable credit, we can double that growth rate. We are improving transportation and building railways, and once the cost of transportation drops and good gets cheaper, the population will be happier. There will be more jobs and a lower crime rate. Once we achieve this, society will begin to benefit and become a much happier and less violent society than it is today. We are heading for better times. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Hall7's main operations since its establishment?</h4><p>Hall7 was established in 2013 and started business in January 2014. Our vision is to create diversified real estate developments that deliver value to stakeholders. Our stakeholders here are our clients and the vendors, and we design and develop projects that deliver value to these stakeholders. We mainly service the medium to high-end real estate segments. Among our projects is the Brookshore Residence with about 230 units. This project commenced in January 2014 and will be commissioned by December 2017. There are basketball courts, a mini golf course, a swimming pool, and a skate park. We also have another residential development, The Bridge, which we launched in May 2016. Our projects are designed to satisfy critical areas of value addition.</p><h4>How is your housing project in partnership with NNPC developing?</h4><p>Imperial Vista is a 216-unit development in the Kafe district and will feature unique architecture. We signed the project with NNPC to develop part of the project for its staff while the other half will be open to investors. There we will be a mini waterpark, and it will be designed like a mini smart city. It will feature controls for all housing appliances, with automation and access, as well as smart TVs and more. We will light up the streets in a way that makes everyday look like it is a celebration.</p><h4>What is your strategy to stay ahead of the competition?</h4><p>Our focus is never on our competition; our focus is our customers. For all our developments, we look at dominating the market and becoming a market leader to dictate the pace and direction of development. We focus on what creates the most value for our customers. The strategy is quite simple; we must use our vision to dictate the market and not succumb to the market, thereby creating the demand within the market. One of the key things about our developments is that they are smart; we are integrating several smart developments.</p><h4>Do you have any expansion plans, and where do you want to be in two years' time?</h4><p>We have begun planning to enter the Lagos market. This is after the commissioning of the Abuja projects. In two years, we want to have completed all our current projects. This includes Brookshore Residence, The Bridge Peridot, The Bridge Garnet, and Imperial Vista. Once we deliver those projects, we can focus on the Lagos market. The market is fairly huge and still open.</p><h4>How would you assess the real estate market today in Nigeria, and what trends do you observe?</h4><p>Lagos is about 37% of the market, Abuja is 22%, Port Harcourt 6%, and the rest of Nigeria is the last 35%. Abuja is the size that it is because it is the capital, and there are many people willing to invest in the federal capital city. However, in Lagos there is a high level of private sector activity. There are many foreign companies coming in and a high level of developments going on, as well as businesses that are not dependent on the government.</p><h4>What trends do you observe in terms of activity in the sector, and how would you define doing business in real estate?</h4><p>It is an interesting sector, and risk can be high at times. For example, in the last 10 years there were times when prices went up over 100% because of inflation. In the last 18 months, we have seen the price of cement increase over 100%. The price of reinforcement has also increased over 100%. All these have negatively affected the business. However, somehow we are able to find our way and forge ahead. What drives us is our vision, which sustains us in the midst of challenges that are meant to be overcome. The market is promising and growing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the evolution of Manazel's portfolio reflect the trends in the Abu Dhabi real estate sector?</h4><p>Since its inception, the company's portfolio was created with a vision to provide a holistic, self-sustainable living environment. This can be seen in all our project launches since 2006: they were all consecutive residential, commercial, and retail developments. In particular, we look for energy saving techniques that cut running costs, connecting developments through district cooling plants. A prime example of this concept is Al Reef 1, which provides its 17,000 residents with retail options and clean energy solutions. Another example is the district cooling plant that connects Capital Mall with the related land that will feature Manazel Medical City in addition to future developments. That being said, we continue to look for opportunities to target the middle class-market segment within the UAE and MENA at large despite tight margins and the risk of oversupply. In doing so, we will leverage our strong and highly capable workforce, made up of many UAE nationals occupying various positions across all levels of the organization and its subsidiaries.</p><h4>How do you project demand for your properties to evolve in the near future, and how does Manazel seek to adjust to this evolution?</h4><p>In terms of clients, the company has built a solid brand value synonymous with the mid-income segment. The mid-market segmentdle class represents a completely different target compared to the majority of domestic and international developers and investors engaged in the UAE, whose aim remains the luxury real estate. However, in light of the new economic changes impacting the country, Manazel has sought to diversify its revenue stream through a varied portfolio to insulate itself from the volatility of the property market. The company has been strategically utilizing existing lands and branching into healthcare, education, and other non-cyclical defensive sectors with recurring income.</p><h4>What could revitalize the property sector in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>The growth of the property sector is strongly tied to investor demands and sentiment, which are in turn highly influenced by macroeconomic signals. Abu Dhabi's economic growth is greatly reliant on the performance of the oil sector, which plays a crucial role in creating demand for both residential and commercial property in the Emirate. Over the last few years, the UAE has taken a number of steps to reduce its dependence by encouraging the growth of the non-oil sector such as healthcare, education, technology, and so on, while also increasing government funds through VAT. The signs are positive, with recent reports from SCAD reporting an overall GDP growth of 5.3% for Abu Dhabi in 3Q2017 compared to the same period the previous year. We have seen investor sentiment increasing since the start of 2018.</p><h4>How is technology shaping the real estate and facility management industry in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>As a developer, business intelligence is extremely important in order to pace the launch of projects, and we have seen this aspect being incorporated at the government level in the Dubai Land Department's Smart Investment. Technologies such as virtual reality and 3D printing will be a large part of the real estate and construction business in the years to come, and, just as in the finance and health industry, developers will have to adapt to in order to maintain their competitive advantage.</p><h4>What are biggest opportunities in the real estate market, and how would you assess the impact of the new regulatory measures affecting the industry?</h4><p>The UAE real estate market supported by the country's strong levels of market growth and sound planning will eventually resume its performance. The current offering of premium value is not only domestic, but also for international investors, whether they reside in the country or not. Thus, more regulations were a necessary step to continue to attract investors and increase confidence. This is true for the real estate market and for other key non-oil sectors that will experience growth. Investors in the UAE will seek unique real estate that gives stable yields and insulation from market volatility in growing markets such as healthcare and education. With this in mind, the company has and will continue to carefully cultivate its portfolio to meet investor needs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the ministry's most recent policies to help tackle the 80 million housing shortfall in the country?</h4><p>I see an opportunity to build a real housing economy. The policy is clear and undeniably global: to create affordable housing. That then morphs into various social housing concepts. All we are trying to do now is restart a national housing program that will unleash the housing economy here. Having a national program primarily entails knowing what people want in terms of housing. This defines the acceptability and affordability of housing here. The first leg of the housing economy is already underway; artisans are being employed and the solid minerals sector has grown positively for the first time after nine negative growth quarters. People are buying sand and other building materials, and there are quarrying activities happening. Around 13,000 people are directly engaged in construction and about 40,000 people are indirectly employed in the supply value chain. There are 653 indigenous Nigerian companies employing Nigerians. By the time we finish, the financial sub-sectors will also be involved in activities, such as mortgages to support acquisitions, as well as the merchandising sub-sectors, for example furnishing the houses. I am focusing on the opportunity to do something that works and survives partisan politics.</p><h4>How will the government fund its housing projects given shrinking oil revenues?</h4><p>If we look at what the government contributes to the GDP, it is barely 10%; the remainder comes from the private sector. Therefore, it is not appropriate to expect the government to bear the entire cost of funding houses. However, the government can initiate the policy and program, evolve the design, test the market, verify the principles, and support private capital. This is what we are doing. We are running our pilot schemes in every state, and if they succeed, then we will multiply them 10-fold. The government, whether state or federal, will not have all the money, but it can assist in certain ways because it has fiscal powers, policies, and the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN). Notably, the government can become the financier of acquisition. Once the private sector sees that workers can get loans to purchase houses, then we will have created an incentive for the private sector to build. We are strengthening FMBN to grant mortgage acquisition loans to workers, and this is an incentive for the private sector to replicate our house-building model many times more than we can. The money for this comes from the monthly contribution workers make to the National Housing Fund. In addition, we will soon announce a government guarantee for acquisitions through the FMBN. We have to improve access for people in the informal economy using the vehicles they use best, which follow the cooperative model. This model has worked in transport, farming, and refuse collection, now I want to test it in housing.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the power and housing sectors, and for Nigeria in general for 2018?</h4><p>2018 is clearly the year when we can expect to see some significant advances. We should see more results in terms of the effect of our programs in the power and construction sectors, as well as how these drive other sectors such as petroleum, bitumen, and diesel fuel for construction, along with all the industries that support construction and provide the inputs, like the steel industry and mining. This should be consistent with the real impact this government seeks to make in terms of investing in infrastructure to drive growth and development. 2018 will be a better year compared to 2017 in the same way 2017 was an improvement on 2016. This goes to show the trajectory of policies, the goverment gaining momentum, and change truly being imminent. In 2018, we will be measuring the results. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Ready for Recovery]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ready-for-recovery]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved?</h4><p>Unireach was established in 2010 by my two brothers and I. As co-owners and executive directors, we manage the day-to-day business together. I have been in the logistics and supply business myself for over 12 years. We started from a team of only 15 people and now have over 40 highly experienced Nigerian and expatriate professionals, some with over 20 years in the business throughout African and European markets. We seek to grow as much as we can even though Nigeria has gone into recession, and it has not been easy. We work on a project basis, which is our niche; we do not just approach potential clients asking to handle their containers customs clearing and airfreight shipments, but consider the entire supply chain as a turnkey project. We provide complete solutions for our clients' logistical needs. We are part of a major network abroad and can position any container for loading of goods or order any cargo pick-up anywhere in the world within 24 hours. We handle documentation, freight, customs clearing, and delivery to the final destination, and we have our own warehouse and distribution service. We have the complete supply chain under great management.<br>What gives you the edge over the competition?<br>Our differentiator is the personal attention to our clients. Clients require someone present, responsible, proactive, and trustworthy to handle their shipments; they want someone who can also make tough decisions on the spot when a problem arises. They want fast and immediate action on their shipments. Recently, we have been busy with a large project and were able to successfully import and deliver the first solar power solution system for further installation by our client on about 10,000 telecom towers across the country. We have handled the entire supply chain. People have started to realize we are a central player in the logistics industry and our volume has steadily grown.</p><h4>What can be done to further boost Nigeria as a logistics hub?</h4><p>Nigeria is in a great location; however, the ports need a great deal of work and expansion, and the road infrastructure needs to be improved. It is unacceptable to have no access to a port in a country as large and important as Nigeria. We receive regular updates from port and terminal handlers regarding volumes coming into Nigeria, and the numbers are so big that sometimes it is a wonder how containers are able to make their way out to importers' warehouses. However, it is happening, and we are one of the companies managing to push our delivery trucks through any accessible road. I am sure the government has a complete infrastructure makeover plan for all areas surrounding the port. They must keep on supporting importers as revenues from duty payments are massive and definitely support the construction of a mega port in Lagos to accommodate the imported volume. Also, a company cannot trade without foreign currency, and this has certainly crippled imports.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>By 4Q2017, we expect things to be better. Things were tough in 2008 and 2009; however, things came up well in the end, and I hope 2018 will be a great year. I already noticed the increase in existing clients' volumes and new inquiries from new clients. This is a healthy and positive sign for the coming year. We believe in Nigeria's ability to overcome such hard times; this has been proven in the past, and there is absolutely no reason why a total recovery cannot happen again. This strong belief and faith in a better business environment have pushed us forward despite the general negative business mood in the country, to expand this business and diversify by establishing new businesses in 2017. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the company?</h4><p>We started this business in Nigeria in 1994. In 2011, we sold our brewery business to Heineken and diversified into other areas. At the time, we had an injection molding factory and were producing the crates for Heineken, Guinness, and SABMiller. We manufacture plastic pallets and were the first to start in Nigeria as all other companies were using wooden pallets. We have two recycling plants where we recycle the crates, battery cases, and whatever plastic we get from the market. We are launching a PET recycling plant and two plastic recycling plants in 2018, which have already been sourced. We have nine total industries, including two independent power plants.</p><h4>How has your ethanol plant project impacted local businesses?</h4><p>We recently completed the plant and conducted a water trial in December. We have a distillery here; importing pure ethanol is extremely expensive as the duty is 30%, and we decided to bring in crude ethanol, the raw material for the distillery. It was entirely internally financed, and we have not taken any bank loans. The next phase, which will take place in 2018 after starting production, will be to produce crude ethanol from cassava. The government has given us some land for which we have found some co-producers and farmers. We will control the farming here, and 1,000 farmers will be involved. The plant capacity is 120,000 liters per day, which requires 300 tons of cassava per day. We have formed a cooperative, and once we receive the physical allocation of land from the government, we will start harvesting there. We have a malt extracting plant that was also financed internally and produces malt extract from locally produced sorghum for breweries like Nigerian Breweries, Guinness, and SABMiller as well as glucose syrup, which we supply to bakeries and biscuit manufacturers.</p><h4>How does Sona contribute to Nigeria's socioeconomic growth in the long term?</h4><p>The government is encouraging local industries, and the industrial agenda provides employment to people; we have a direct workforce of 3,000 people and almost 8,000 indirectly through the supply chain of transporters and so on. We also pay taxes and duties to the government as well as excise duty as we produce alcoholic beverages.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans for the future?</h4><p>We have complete confidence in the Nigerian economy. We are still expanding in the biscuit and chocolate industries as well as our packaging industry. All our machines are from Germany and other European countries; European machinery may be more expensive; however, it is of the highest quality and lasts for a long time. In 2017, we committed EUR50 million for machinery, some of which are under construction and others under commission. Our total investment in Nigeria thus far has been almost USD650 million, and we have committed an additional EUR50 million for this machinery.</p><h4>What is needed to further boost the 'Made in Nigeria' brand and import substitution?</h4><p>Items from the Far East, especially China, are cheaper. To compete with that, the government needs to provide infrastructure and better roads. The second issue is that the borrowing costs in the country are high: commercial banks charge 25-26% interest. The Bank of Industry is supposed to support industries; however, it charges 10% in addition to other charges and the fees come to almost 11.5% per annum. It also charges 15% for working capital, in addition to a monitoring fee. In terms of finance cost, there is no support from the government. Industrialists cannot bring 100% investment here, and some support is required from the industrial and infrastructure banks. Other challenges are power supply and the high cost of diesel. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Nurturing Entrepreneurs]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[nurturing-entrepreneurs]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was the company founded?</h4><p>Chinook Capital was founded on the principle of encouraging start-up companies in Nigeria. We incubate small start-up companies and help them to grow. We have about three projects already. We target our products and services for people and clients who have ideas but likely do not have the means or the ability to nurture those ideas. We help them build those ideas and assist with funding at the early stages of the start-up such as developing the idea, incubating it, and getting the proof of concept out. Once we get the proof of concept out, we then invite venture capital firms to come in and fund the project. Obviously, because we are technology driven, we have a technology lab where we have our own programmers and developers who provide technology services for these start-ups. We also provide technology services for third parties; there are people who approach us for help to develop their ideas using our technology.</p><h4>What is your long-term ambition for Chinook Capital?</h4><p>Our objective is to become the de facto start-up capital fund in Sub-Saharan Africa. Around 99% of the funds available as venture capital today do not target West Africa. The Sub-Saharan part of Africa is even worse; if we remove Nigeria, South Africa, and even Kenya from the equation, the rest of the continent does not have access to funding for start-ups. The banking industry does not fund entrepreneurship and does not understand it. The industry only funds purchase orders from conglomerates or requests for collateral that would probably kill the companies in the process of providing the collateral. Funding start-up enterprises is not easy, and special funds are required. African start-ups are not only fintechs; there are Nigerian start-ups doing things that are not standard in the West, and companies like Chinook Capital are there to give them a hand to get them into industry. We also do mentoring and management training for entrepreneurs so that they can understand the difference between an entrepreneur and a trader. From day one, when we pick up such projects, we structure them in a manner that they are ready for venture capital.</p><h4>How would you assess the environment for creating new businesses in Nigeria today, and what should be done to boost it?</h4><p>I started my own business when I was 26. It was hell; there was zero funding at the time. Today, however, things are different. The world is global, and technology has become accommodating; before, technology was the most expensive item on companies' balance sheets. Accessing funding is also easier; there are many initiatives around to enhance access to funding for start-ups, such as the Tony Elumelu Foundation. Nigeria has not even scratched the surface of technology at all. Our use of technology is still low even though we are leapfrogging and taking advantage of learning from the mistakes of the West. Outside of Lagos and Abuja, not many Nigerian cities have good data networks. The second-most important thing is to learn from the Indian experience. The government there recognizes that the only asset it has are its people and it has made structures to enhance access to technology. The shift in accumulation of technology skills in India from the beginning of the 1980s to date is unbelievable. Today, India is recognized as the Silicon Valley of Asia. We are the most populous African country. The energy that Nigerians have is uniquely different from the rest of Africa, and it needs to be harnessed by the government by enhancing support for start-ups and entrepreneurship. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Huawei's main projects in the country, and what impact does it have on the ICT sector?</h4><p>We launched the first 4G LTE network in Nigeria with three major operators in 2016 and now operate almost 60% of the market in partnership with them. In the last few years, we have launched a number of products in the ICT domain. The first was the Business Enabling System (BES), which changed the telecom business. Our BES projects provide real-time experience for clients. This is the first project of its kind for Huawei overseas. In the next few years we will play a major role in upgrading the network for Nigerian subscribers. On the enterprise and government side, we want to help develop smart city solutions. We are building the national broadband backbone for the government and have completed the first stage of the plan that will link most ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAS). We are also doing something similar to Amazon, whereby all e-government services are based on our infrastructure. There is a great requirement for data storage, and we also see this as a great opportunity. Mobile money will also be important, and Huawei is working on a number of mobile money projects in Nigeria.</p><h4>As a foreign investor, how is your relationship with the Nigerian government?</h4><p>Our role in the ICT domain is extremely important. We offer great value to the country and believe the digital economy can add 10% to GDP. Our role is be a consultant to the government. Doing business in any country, including Nigeria, without support from the government would be extremely difficult. We are close to regulators and are always keen to influence policy in a way that promotes innovation and development in the ICT space. We want to be close enough to maximize communication. There is a perfect position to be in, and we want to find that place.</p><h4>What are the main challenges of doing business in Nigeria?</h4><p>We want to see large-scale government support for the entire ICT sector. Foreign investors are afraid of the uncertainty that we sometimes have to contend with. Currency fluctuations have been particularly impactful, and we want to see an improvement in this area. If the central bank increases liquidity, that would be better for us. Stabilizing the currency is directly related to the health of foreign businesses. With a stable currency, Nigeria is still the most attractive place for foreign investors.</p><h4>How important is Nigeria within Huawei's global portfolio?</h4><p>Though Nigeria was recently hit by a recession, there is still huge potential in the country. It has a large and extremely young population. GDP is huge as well, which means Nigeria will remain Huawei's most important market in Africa. The government and enterprise area represents great potential. If the oil price remains stable, then business in Nigeria will remain strong. We expect it to remain the number-one global market for enterprise business. Huawei is not as interested in consumer goods in Africa after the devaluation of the currency; our consumer models are too expensive for this market. Starting from 2018, however, we will review our structure and work to reduce costs to enter these markets. For example, we will soon launch a special phone for the African market that is redesigned and more affordable.</p><h4>What role can Huawei play in the future development of ICT in the country?</h4><p>We see our role as building a healthy ecosystem for the entire ICT sector. We want to develop a platform that can support innovation and development across the board. This will create more diversity and growth in the sector. The industry will need more investment, and we can bring the key stakeholders together to transform the space. We need a strong ecosystem that includes strong participation from the government and regulators. We always apply the latest technology to emerging markets and are excited about the opportunity to do this in Nigeria. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does India's USD4-billion investment in Nigeria mean for the country?</h4><p>We are extremely excited that Indian companies are committed to investing no less than USD4 billion in this country. The India deal came about during the last telecoms conference in Geneva, where I had the privilege of addressing the Indian business community. Today, India is a valuable partner; most know that we have a comparable business environment to that of India. In the last few years, Nigerians have gone to India for specialized ICT training, and we are working hard to establish an ICT university in Nigeria that will take off in 2018. It will be the first in Africa, and India can partner with us to establish that university. Admissions will be open to everyone from all over the world, particular Africans, since it will be the first of its type.</p><h4>Is the ministry mostly targeting international investors?</h4><p>We focus on international investors all over the world. I have had the privilege of attending several international conferences on ICT and telecommunications development, as well as cybersecurity and similar issues. I always seek to raise people's awareness of the many ICT opportunities in Nigeria.</p><h4>Nigeria is among the top four countries in Africa in terms of the digital revolution. What role do you see ICT playing in the future?</h4><p>We will continue to improve and increase our work. For example, we currently have a policy in place that makes our system of governance completely electronic. This is an e-government policy. South Korea has been particularly helpful and given us a great deal of training. Batches of trainees are regularly sent to South Korea for one-month training. South Korea has also built a training facility for Nigeria, which required an investment of more than USD1 billion, to ensure that Nigerians are sufficiently skilled, particularly for civil servants who need to participate in the e-government revolution. Apart from that, we have a policy in place that ensures that all communities in Nigeria are connected with a fiber-optic cable. We are open to all investors, and any company that invests here can be assured of quick company registration, as well as favorable fiscal policies that encourage business and easy repatriation of profits within a short time.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Nigeria for 2018?</h4><p>In 2018, our ICT university will be fully established. We also expect more investment in the area of backbone connectivity, which should have fully matured. We have been in talks with many international investors to deploy satellite communication for our rural telecommunications. It will take time for cyber connectivity to spread to all areas; however, India has produced a technology whereby each village has just one center and all the surrounding buildings are connected to that one location. It will not only be satellite based, but solar based, and thus even where there is no electricity it will be active. We are working on all these projects to ensure that people in rural settlements are not excluded from development. Another important area that we are working on is the reform of our postal service, Nipost. We hope to transform Nipost into a multi-service organization. One of those services would be to establish Nipost Bank, which would be able to provide banking inclusiveness for rural dwellers. Secondly, we are considering using Nipost for e-government services. People in rural areas who want to use e-government services could do so at Nipost facilities. Today, there is only one passport office in each state, for example. With the e-government services that we want to introduce through Nipost, one can apply for passports from the local postal agency. That is another push we are hoping to make in 2018. The point is to reintroduce Nipost as a transport and logistics service. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide a background on the operations of the Nosak Group?</h4><p>The Nosak Group has been in business for over 30 years. We are a fully indigenous Nigerian enterprise diversified in about 13 sectors of the economy. We are into ethanol refining, with a plant capacity of 500,000 liters in Lagos state. We also have a refinery in Apapa, where we refine oil with a capacity of 200 liters per day. In addition, we have a distribution company that hauls our products across the country via trucks, as well as CCD Superstores that we use as a distribution channel for some of our finished products. We also have a company in the oil and gas sector called Grand Petroleum and Chemicals Ltd. that has 6-million-liter storage capacity in Amuwo-Odofin and 21.5-million-liter storage capacity in Apapa, where we bring in base oil and convert it into lubricants for vehicles and machineries. These operations constitute about 70-80% of our turnover while the others support our strategic business units, which drive the main core strategy. We also have Saturn Farms, where we have 5,000-8,000 farm plantations in Edo state.</p><h4>What challenges will businesses need to contend with in the near future?</h4><p>In addition to storage and infrastructure requirements, there are government policies that over the years have been unstable. For example, when talking about backward integration and getting more farms, these involve our land laws and issues with the Land User Act, which many feel is outdated. For businesses to thrive, the policies and laws of the land need to be revisited. There has to be a handshake between physical and monetary policies. Interest rates are currently at around 20-25%, sometimes as high as 30%. With single-digit rates, there will be increased investment as currently there is a cannibalistic sentiment as business is balanced for the benefit of the bank. Government policies need to be improved and the environment in terms of government involvement with PPPs needs to grow. The government needs to deal with housing and provide an enabling environment for the private sector to develop through policies and laws. Our president seeks to work toward that direction with the privatization of the ports and airlines. These are the right moves as the business of the government is in fact governing.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>Our look for 2018 in view of our position is that we want to consolidate our backward integration strategy and acquire more land in Edo state and enter plantations for palm crops in a manner that could enable us feed our refinery. Crude palm oil is not available, and the only way we can mitigate that is to import from countries such as Malaysia to feed that gap. If we are able to concentrate on our backward integration, with a gestation period of four to five years to start having some yield, that will allow us to stabilize in the medium to long term. The fleet size of our distribution network is low, and we want to acquire more trucks in order to strengthen our distribution network and haulage business. Furthermore, in the supermarket sector, we should be able to open at least one or two additional neighborhood malls that will help strengthen our distribution channels. In the real estate sector, we want to increase our commercial bases with more warehouses; for example, in Amuwo Odofin and Sagamu, the meeting point is outside Lagos. In 2018, we need to consolidate all our strategic options that we developed for 2017 in a manner that is sustainable for the environment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[new-year-new-goals]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the main driver behind the establishment of the company?</h4><p>The company was established in 2012, and we were driven to make housing affordable for all with the aim to reach as many Nigerians as possible. We know there is no shortage in the high-end market; the housing deficit is within the low and middle classes. The entire affordability concept is not about housing being cheap; housing is not cheap anywhere in the world. It is expensive. But it is not about the houses itself, rather the totality of the environment, such as schools, roads, bridges, hospitals and so on, as well as a flexible payment method. Therefore, the affordability concept is that, if a house goes for NGN10 million (USD27,740), one is able to pay for that over a period of 20 years. When a client approaches a mortgage institution in Nigeria, they will request collateral, which many cannot provide. We came in with the strategy of not going through the bank but providing a flexible payment plan between five to 10 years which is payable on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. The daily basis is affordable for most Nigerians, especially those who work in the informal sector. The majority of them earn wages on a daily basis and it is easier for them.</p><h4>What sets you apart from your competitors?</h4><p>Our vision sets us apart. We are not afraid of competition as we have a clear vision and are a focus-driven company with a target. On a daily basis, we increase our land bank and our clientele. We were not impacted by the recession; in fact, in 2016 we experienced tremendous sales. We were not hit because our products are tailored for the local market. Foreign transactions incur huge costs; we did not make any foreign transactions, or rely on foreign products during the recession. Nigeria has a population of over 170 million, and over 18 million of them are homeless; that is a huge potential. We sell every day, and we have demands for our housing products. The lower and middle classes are in dire need of this product. Our vision was to reduce the housing deficit in Nigeria by 10% within the first 10 years, translating to 1.8 million new homes. In the first five years, we have achieved over 100,000 subscribers, which means we still have a long way to go. However, that is a landmark achievement and very historical for a company that is just five years old.</p><h4>What are the current challenges in Nigeria's real estate sector?</h4><p>The challenges are enormous, starting from land acquisition to product conceptualization and delivery. The land law or land use decree of 1978 is not favorable. Land titles are also a major problem; getting the certificate of occupancy can take months and creates bottlenecks in land ministries. What should cost a few million ends up costing several millions, which adds to the cost of the land or property you build on it. Also, we have to rely on laborers from the Republic of Benin and other African countries who are often more expensive than our local artisans, increasing the cost of production. However, with the government's current economic plans , we are beginning to see an influx of foreign companies setting up production factories in Nigeria. Right now we have companies from China producing tiles in Nigeria. This is great for the sector.</p><h4>What is your outlook and expectations for 2018?</h4><p>Every year we have great expectations. As a company, before we start a year, we look at our what we have achieved as well as our shortcomings. We will approach the new year with new goals and expectations. In 2018, we will expand more into other West African countries, build more houses, and acquire more land to satisfy and delight our clients even more. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the current power supply situation in Nigeria, and what are your plans to increase power generation and distribution?</h4><p>If we compare how much African countries have spent on power over the last two decades compared to western countries, Asia, and the Middle East, we can see the investment and therefore the results gap. Our energy issues have not defied solution; they have simply not received the kind of attention and investment that is needed. We have had decades of inaction while our population continued to grow. Now, we are ramping up our response and the speed at which we are procuring more power is consistent with our roadmap to get incrementally more energy, steady growth, and later to upgrade our power. In terms of incremental energy, we have increased production of power from 2,690MW when this government was inaugurated to 6,900-7,000MW today. In November 2017, we secured another 115MW from Gbarain and in December 2017 another 240MW went on-stream. In March 2018, 240MW will come in and by July 2018 another 40MW should be added. There are close to an additional 2,000MW coming in over the next three to 15 months in terms of production. At the same time, Nigeria's national grid is expanding. We currently have around 33 transmission projects, many of which we will conclude between 4Q2017 and YE2018. Distribution projects are also being completed. This is a dynamic and evolving process, and Nigeria's transmission capacity is now close to our generation capacity. The real area of challenge now is the distribution side, because Nigeria's power generation capacity has outstripped its distribution capacity. We need to intervene and ramp up our distribution capacity. We are collecting data about where peak power needs to go from each of the distribution companies, where collection losses are lowest, and where there are more customers willing to pay. Then, we will plan the rollout of distribution equipment and funding.</p><h4>What is your response to investors' claims that electricity tariffs do not match the cost of investment?</h4><p>That is one argument; another is that consumers are paying more than the tariff through their own self-generation, sometimes two or three times more. The question is what investors can do to get consumers to trust them with that money, and the answer is provide the service. Electricity providers have to meter because consumers are ready to self-generate power. If they provide the service, then they will get more money and consumers want to see what they are paying for so they have to meter them. Another argument is the assumption that the tariff and unit costs will not guarantee recovery. Again, this argument is flawed because we only collect from disclosed consumers. Every distribution company must improve its means of auditing and censoring all the people consuming energy within its business area. They need to develop a consumer database. They are operating based on the consumer numbers given to them at the time of privatization, which is about 7 million consumers for the whole of Nigeria, which cannot be right. If they keep the same tariffs but improve the collection base, their income doubles. The solution lies in collecting more from more consumers who are not currently paying for their electricity. In any event, ultimately the Federal Ministry of Power, Works, and Housing does not decide or approve the tariffs; that is not our job. There is a regulator with a statutory duty, and the ministry does not stand in its way. Our responsibility is not just to help businesses, but maintain the balance for consumers as well. Indeed, businesses ultimately exist because of consumers. It is difficult to store power and not as easy to control as other commodities where if the price is increased the commodity is still there. Once people receive a better service, their resistance to paying drops. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Rainoil is one of the most successful downstream petrol companies in Nigeria. What has been the driver behind your success?</h4><p>I have always wanted to be an entrepreneur. In 1994, we incorporated Rainoil Limited and commenced operations in 1997; essentially, Rainoil is a classic case of a start-up. We started from ground zero with little capital; however, with hard work, dedication, perseverance, and discipline, we were able to build it into what it is today. We are one of the dominant players in the downstream space of the Nigerian oil and gas industry. We have a 50 million-liter capacity multi-product depot in Oghara, Delta State, and a 50 million-liter capacity multi-product depot in the Calabar Free Trade Zone. We have about 59 petrol stations across the country. We are also the second-largest indigenous ship owner in Nigeria. We are massively into distribution, with a fleet of about 90 trucks that deliver products around the country. We provide direct employment to more than 800 people, both Nigerians and expatriates. We are an integrated downstream company and play a role in the entire value chain. Financial discipline has been one of our critical success factors.</p><h4>What are the details of your long-term ambition?</h4><p>I am embarrassed that the country is one of the world's largest producers of crude, yet we import more than 90% of our refined petroleum products. The financial structure in Nigeria does not encourage massive, long-term investments. To build a refinery, we need intensive financial commitments, what I call “patient capital." In an economy where interest rates are as high as 25%, such capital does not exist. We are trying to pull the funding together. It initially would be able to produce diesel and naphtha. We hope that over time we could scale it up to be able to do gasoline, which is the main product we want to see coming out of our refinery. Once we eventually start and the refinery begins to make money, we hope to be able to raise additional debts to scale it up further. Nigeria already has three refineries, but they are old. We should not continue to pour money into the existing refineries. We need greenfield refineries that are brand new. The last refinery was commission in 1985, and we need new refineries with modern technology.</p><h4>Should private investors be the ones to lead these initiatives?</h4><p>Nigeria is brimming with entrepreneurs. The level of entrepreneurship is on par with many places in the world. Many major investments in Nigeria are actually owned by Nigerians. In other African countries, most major investments are led by the governments or by foreigners. We are structurally defective when it comes to funding because interest rates are not investor friendly. The Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance should be worried about interest rates. No other country would allow interest rates to spiral out of control. We cannot tackle unemployment in an economy where interest rates are as high as 25%. Through treasury bills, the government is crowding out the private sector. Banks cannot lend money to the private sector, which are the ones who invest and create business and wealth.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>Nigeria is full of opportunities. We have 180 million people who are talented and enterprising. The outlook remains strong. Regardless of the momentary blips, business is a long-term project. We do not judge a business by what happened in the past two or three months. I have been in this industry for over 26 years and can say this is not the first obstacle we have faced. Nigeria is a preferred investment destination. We never stop investing. We are expanding our retail outlets, our truck fleet size, and starting a new LPG facility. We will not take a long-term decision based on what has been happening over the past few months. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main driver behind Baker Hughes becoming a GE company, and what are the benefits for the Nigerian oil and gas sector?</h4><p>The great challenge for oil and gas companies lies in the fragmentation of the industry around them, including the technology sector, which suffers from a strong inefficiency in the supply chain. We will fix inefficiencies by identifying the technology and services that can be applied across the entire value chain of customer activities. Our new business—Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE)—is the first and only to bring together industry-leading equipment, services, and digital solutions across the entire oil and gas spectrum. For 120 years, the oil and gas industry has not done as good a job to incorporating learnings from other industries, but we are looking to successfully bring the elements of the GE store and the experiences of the wider GE group from other industries into Nigeria's upstream sector, resulting in an overall cost reduction, efficiency improvement, and better synergy and technology applications. There are many applications that came from either advanced materials, turbines, processes, or plastics that we were able to bring into the mid and downstream turbomachinery business. In Nigeria, there is an upstream cost challenge, a down-stream efficiency challenge in terms of refining, as well as an end-user infrastructure challenge in terms of power generation, distribution, and consumption. By adopting BHGE in the up-, mid-, and down-stream and GE store at the back end, we will be able to address some of the issues related to power and electrification. Moreover, a company the size and scale of BHGE is able to support many of the indigenous oil and gas companies in their diversification efforts, supporting their development of mini refineries and LNG plants.</p><h4>What are the requirements and benefits of these partnerships?</h4><p>Anyone with a viable project is a potential partner. Part of the excitement around BHGE is that we have technology and solutions that can be scaled up or down to meet a particular customer's needs. Our new global organization is designed to do just that: achieve business continuity, minimize disruption, and help operators meet and exceed their objectives. Our digital capability is a huge potential gamechanger for smaller companies because we are able to employ predictive maintenance; a smaller company cannot truly afford to shut down its production if it does not need to. Technology also allows us to find optimum shutdown hours. For example, 2% in absolute is a large number for smaller actors and makes a significant impact on their bottom line as opposed to a larger company. BHGE uses cloud-based software and advanced manufacturing to help operators take advantage of these opportunities—reducing risk and improving the productivity of their operations.</p><h4>Do you have other projects where this process of digitalization is showing and coming through?</h4><p>One of our goals is to make offshore profitable again. Many projects have been pushed out or canceled because they are cost prohibitive. We seek to look at the entire production infrastructure. In Nigeria, there are a few deepwater projects under development currently that represent a significant opportunity, both for the operator and for us to do something completely different. It has been around three and a half to four years now that we established our refurbishment and service center in Port Harcourt where we spent tens of millions of dollars in terms of investment to this point. We are looking at the next evolution of that, which is a multi-model facility in Calabar that we are putting together that initially started off as an oil and gas exclusive facility. As a result of the Bonga South West delays, we will service turbines for Nigeria and potentially sub-Saharan Africa; we will engage with the transportation business through the locomotives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[self-sufficiency]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main drivers behind the establishment of Tulcan in the downstream energy sector?</h4><p>Prior to Tulcan, I worked with Negris Limited, an oil and gas service company. My experience in Negris attracted me to the oil and gas industry. In 2010, after my MBA program, I approached a friend for partnership and support to set up a company. We decided to start with trading in the downstream sector, which was less regulated. Tulcan Energy Resources Limited was registered in 2011. Downstream operations require extensive experience, funding and asset ownership to support and enhance reasonable trading and we have done well. We transitioned from bulk buying and depot allocation trading to becoming an importer with a focus on the local market. We started working with licensed depot owners to get direct allocations from Pipelines and Products Marketing Company (PPMC), which has allocations for almost 6 million liters monthly. At the moment, we actively import approximately 20,000-40,000MT of products per month. Although it was not easy to obtain licenses, permits, funding, and bank lines to execute the import, we managed to get it done all the same.</p><h4>Nigeria relies heavily on foreign countries when it comes to finished, refined products. What is your vision for the sector to become self-sufficient?</h4><p>A solution is on the way, though it may not be enough. Nigeria has great potential; however, its refineries are not working efficiently enough to meet the needs of such a heavily populated country. A recent solution in the pipeline is the Dangote Refinery, which might come on-stream in 2018/2019 or 2020. We are working to see where we can collaborate with refineries and help them get the products out. It is competitive; however, we are working out a structure where we can play a role in supporting refineries by buying some of the refined products and blending them further. It is doable, though it will take a great deal of persuasion and strategies. In that way, we can play the role of an important distributor. One day, perhaps we may not need to import anything if we are able to put all of the products we are already producing to excellent use, thereby becoming exporters as a nation. The simple model we seek to work on is either being able to use enough raw material directly or synergizing between companies to make sure we get what we need. If we achieve that as a company and other companies do as well, Nigeria will export more than it imports. If we can locally refine enough products for the local market, it goes without saying that the scale of operations will be large enough to then export as well. That is where we would like to operate, as a company and as a nation.</p><h4>What is it like to do business in the downstream sector in Nigeria?</h4><p>It is challenging and extremely tough, though it is interesting as well. The challenge is to gain a place in the market, and there are many steps to take before companies can have access to imports. There is a great deal of regulations and government bureaucracy to pass before a company can be approved. Furthermore, bank support is also extremely necessary. If companies have the integrity and transparency to convince a bank, they must also demonstrate that they operate with best practices and certain standards. Getting all of that in place is challenging. However, if the company is set up well to do business, it will not see many problems. In fact, there is plenty of room to capitalize on opportunities in Nigeria and expand to other points of Africa from here. We have a great deal of credibility by operating in Nigeria, and that is exportable to the East African Community (EAC), which we are exploring at the moment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Growth Prospects]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[growth-prospects]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an update on JMG's growth and diversification goals?</h4><p>We have diversified and entered into home appliance wholesale as well as supplying electrical and home appliances to supermarkets and malls. As we started from zero, we saw great results in 2016. Certain sectors have improved while others did not do that well; however, in general there was slight growth. Our diversification also covered elevators; we became the agents of ThyssenKrupp and did well in that business. We also diversified into the transformer business and things have picked up there. In addition, we started a lighting business with GE directly and have small projects for lighting, retrofitting LEDs, energy saving, and others. By the end of 2017, we had also invested in some renewable energy products such as solar panels and inverters. Our diversification is moving as expected, though our expectations were not that high because the economy was experiencing a recession. The recession, however, gave us time to position ourselves in the market, and it was a great time to start and await growth. </p><h4>What is the status of your plans to become an independent power producer (IPP)?</h4><p>We are preparing to start doing IPPs across the country and have already done a few projects where we sell power. The IPPs we expect—ranging from 5-100MW—depend on the projects and the appetite of the market. There are currently many issues in the market such as the gas price, exchange rate, and gas pipelines that exploded in the last year; the subsidized power sector is suffering. We have the capability, though we cannot yet see an attractive market and are thus taking on smaller projects. We have done 6-10MW projects with several multinationals and sell them power. We are also into the resale of generators as the aim is to sell power by kilowatt-hour.  </p><h4>What should the government do to make the sector more attractive?</h4><p>Our revenue is in naira, though all purchases are in dollars. On one side, the risk is too high as there are no hedging instruments that can minimize or litigate this risk, and this is one of the major issues in terms of generation. There are many risks in terms of currency and gas prices; on the other hand, companies are collecting in naira and there is a major risk that cannot be accommodated. Another factor is that even if companies have local funding, the interest rate in Nigeria is 26-27% or more. The private sector funding of 8% has long been exhausted and no small IPP is able to benefit from the power sector fund of 8%. With 26% interest one has to meet its targets of NGN38 or even less and then sell to the consumer at NGN38. With the interest rate, it is not possible to have new equipment. In terms of gas supply, 2017 was a disaster and in one sense the environment surrounding this sector is not supportive enough. In terms of what could be done by the government, the pricing and tariff needs to be revised as soon as possible as it is not cost-effective and for us as a business it is not interesting. The gas pricing also definitely needs to be looked at.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>I expect marginal macroeconomic growth for the country and the company. Growth will be different for different sectors; however, in general we will grow. We might grow more than the GDP growth in certain sectors. There are signs of growth in oil production and in agriculture, though we will not see huge investments in the export business or the government focusing on revenue other than oil. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[consumer-facing]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the business environment like for Tranos over the past year?</h4><p>In 2016, we were working on a major power system project for telecoms that was completed early 2017. We have now moved from producing power systems to providing support for the equipment we produced. At the moment, we are focused on industrial customers. Historically, we have always had a B2B model; however, we now seek to expand into the B2C market. We seek to put our name out there and become more “consumer facing" to promote our products. When we tell people about our company and what we do, a lot of people doubt that such a company exists in Nigeria. We plan to introduce several new products by the end of 2017 related to electrical power distribution. The design is complete, and we have purchased new machines, with some of them currently on their way.</p><h4>How much of Tranos' raw materials are sourced locally?</h4><p>It depends on what we produce. On the mechanical side, for products like enclosures, for example, the main raw material we use is sheet metal. We have a local factory for sheet metal on the outskirts of Lagos that we buy from. Generally, depending on what we produce, up to 90% of our products could be made from local raw materials. But, for example, only a handful of companies produce engines to a high enough standard so we have to import engines. If we take engines and alternators out of the equation as well as accessories such as hinges and locks, we aim to localize everything else.</p><h4>What do you hope to contribute to the “Made in Nigeria" brand?</h4><p>The philosophy behind our strategy is not to just manufacture here and source raw materials locally to be able to say, “we did it in Nigeria." We look to localize production and make our products affordable and of a high quality. We are looking at it from the perspective of being able to compete internationally. Our target is to be able to compete with companies in Europe. At the moment, we are competing with products from Turkey. We clearly produce better quality products than China; however, cost-wise we cannot compete with China because the quality is lower. We want to continue to improve so that eventually we can be on par with the best international brands. On some levels, we are already doing that; still, we have a great deal of work to do in terms of training personnel and putting systems in place. We have come a long way; we have contracts with international companies operating in Nigeria that seek to be more localized. We are substituting what they used to buy from their foreign affiliates and have certainly made significant progress.</p><h4>How do you intend to encourage the mindset that products from Nigeria are as good or even better than products made in Europe?</h4><p>First, we benchmark ourselves with brands from the EU or US. We are in fact currently working with some of those brands. They incorporate our products, and we appear with them at conferences as partners. The problem is that there is the current perception that if something is made in Nigeria, it must be much cheaper. However, this is not necessarily so. In local manufacturing, our main advantage is cheaper labor and the elimination of some imports. However, when a company still needs to import raw materials, equipment, and spares, the overall cost of production will be affected. Apart from that, there is still a great deal to do with regards to training personnel. It takes a toll on cost and time, and it is something that we need to look at. It is easy for us to sell our products through a different brand; however, we have a great deal of work to do to be able to market our products with our own branding. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the status of the power plant within LADOL's premises?</h4><p>We started construction of the 50MW power plant that we are building in phases. The first phase is 24MW; it is a gas-fired plant and will support not only our existing operations but also future operations where we now target non-oil and gas manufacturing companies as part of our high-value industrial free zone objectives. We will leverage the infrastructure we built through our oil and gas-related activities to support other businesses. One of our targets is to have cars manufactured locally in Nigeria out of Lagos.</p><h4>Which other sectors do you target to work with LADOL in the near future?<br></h4><p>It is important to look at heavy industries, where we currently spend a great deal of money though little manufacturing is being done locally. That includes the railway sector, general infrastructure works, bridges, and sectors like telecoms. Manufacturing handsets locally is not heavy industrial; however, it is high-value industrial and is an area that requires a skilled workforce and a great deal of automation. We thus hope to work with a wide range of industrial sectors and focus on areas where there is already a large market in Nigeria, little manufacturing capacity, and an opportunity to attract manufacturers to LADOL, where they will find great infrastructure, 24/7 cheap reliable power, and a trained workforce.</p><h4>What role does technology and innovation play at LADOL?</h4><p>The advantage Nigeria has is that we can skip over the technologies deployed in the west that are inefficient, polluting, or obsolete and can go straight to more sustainable technologies that have become significantly cheaper over the past decade. At LADOL, because sustainability is important and makes up a core part of our business model, we have sought sustainable options for power. We have the assistance of US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) in putting together a power plan for us that includes sustainable power generation. The LADOL area is not suitable for widespread deployment of solar power; however, we are planning to use gas and deploy a waste-to-power and solar power in small areas where it is feasible. In terms of our operations, we are becoming a cashless, paperless facility. We are not there yet; however, we are following a USTDA-funded feasibility plan of how we can roll out our operations and ensure that we become fully automated. Automated processes and widespread use of virtual ERP solutions are being built up based on our existing procedures and policies, helping to maintain quality, efficiency, and transparency as we scale. In addition, because we operate 24/7 it also allows us to integrate everything on an international basis. That also enables us to employ more Nigerians and deploy what will end up being solutions and a free zone that will be the best in the world, not just in West Africa.</p><h4>What role do you play to support the diversification of the economy?</h4><p>Our facility is designed to enable large manufacturing and fabrication jobs to be done in Nigeria for the first time. Our first phase of development of LADOL involved investing USD150 million in a deep offshore logistics base, building it out of a disused swamp in Apapa Port in Lagos. Our initial value proposition was based on servicing offshore oil blocks, including deep offshore, because supporting such blocks from LADOL lowers costs by at least 50%. In general, it has been confirmed by international oil companies since 2006 that it is easier, more efficient, and far cheaper to support deep offshore and oil blocks from Lagos. However, the fully integrated support model we built in LADOL makes us the only location in Lagos that can provide 24/7 safe, efficient, and competitive deep offshore support services. We have demonstrated that by working out of LADOL, companies can double their return on investment in Nigeria. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your general assessment of and outlook for the e-commerce sector in Mexico?</h4><p>People often paint e-commerce as an underdeveloped opportunity in Mexico; however, when we look at the growth of the numbers, it is a different story. The e-commerce industry in Mexico is growing closer to 40-50% YoY and customers are getting increasingly comfortable purchasing via e-commerce platforms. We are passing the moment where customer confidence is the number-one barrier. While a great deal of media that continues to talk about fraud and customer confidence of platforms are no longer valid, the challenge is more about user experience and finding out what customers truly need. The younger generation is growing up and starting to consume, and we see this not only in Mexico but all across Latin America. More than 10% of the GDP in the US is pushed through e-commerce platforms while in Mexico it is less than 2%; the prospects for growth are on the up.</p><h4>How do B2B e-commerce penetration and market education differ across Latin America?</h4><p>B2B e-commerce is interesting because in the US, Europe, and Asia it is slightly more than 2.5 times the size of B2C commerce. If we were to take Amazon and all the smaller competitors around the B2C e-commerce opportunity and put them together, it might end up becoming approximately  USD500 billion in global sales, while B2B commerce is closer to USD1.2-1.5 trillion in global sales. It makes a lot ofsense for businesses to buy online as they can have a broader product range and services available, they can make price comparisons, and analyze carefully the different benefits. Ultimately, in Latin America there is a big question around customer relationships that is universal, though particularly in Latin America. Companies will always need to maintain customer relationships in Latin America and B2B e-commerce will never be a 100% automated self-service experience; we seek to maintain some human contact for example a conversation with someone in a contact center or a chat representative. If it is a medium-sized customer, it may have a dedicated sales representative. When we think about e-commerce, we talk about it as a channel without the human elements; however, that will not see much success in Latin America, at least not within the B2B segment.</p><h4>What is your strategy for becoming the largest e-commerce platform in Latin America by 2020?</h4><p>Our goal is to surpass USD100 million in revenue in 2020. The company was founded operationally in 2014 and 2020 will be our seventh year of operations. Colombia and Mexico are our focus and we will continue to penetrate both markets and gain more market share. In Latin America, IT Solutions is a USD120-billion market opportunity that is around 5% of the global market. For the rest of Latin America, we will continue to open more markets via the e-commerce platform and are currently selling cloud solutions to customers in Brazil and Argentina. As we reach a base of revenue that makes sense to open-up a local entity, then we will do so in both countries.</p><h4>Has your expansion strategy in Mexico mirrored the one in Colombia?</h4><p>Because we started in Colombia, we had to adjust our model to find a great product-market fit; however, we found that it was actually easier to replicate in Mexico contrary to what many had said. People paint the picture of each Latin American country being different, which they are; however, OFI offers customers solutions in a more efficient way. We find new customers through digital marketing strategies, developing opportunities, closing them, and approaching new solutions via cross selling, which is more efficient than with a traditional reseller. For customers, it is a better experience with the same product or service, which is why we have been able to find success with our business model in Mexico with less friction than one might see from companies from Spain or other parts of Latin America that have trouble with the Mexican market.</p><h4>Where do you see the most growth in the enterprise IT space?</h4><p>There are a few different categories; one is definitely cybersecurity and we are developing a plan to enter that segment. Our goal is to become an IT security provider as well, although this requires an entirely different skillset. All other technologies are about being more efficient, competitive, and productive; however, IT security is like an insurance policy. If we were to pick one category that is growing faster than any other, it would be IT security or cloud. Beyond that I would say analytics and AI, which are both categories currently being adopted in Mexico.  We also believe blockchain technologies have an important place in the Mexican market and will develop strategies around distributed ledger technologies as well.</p><h4>What is your strategy to help SMEs escalate their businesses ?</h4><p>Everybody is fighting to get to the top of the pyramid by going after corporate customers. We also have corporate accounts and are happy to work with them. Then, there are medium sized customers of 100-500 employees. Businesses below this threshold of employees, we consider a small business and that segment is unserved in terms of IT solutions—not underserved but unserved. They often buy consumer-level products at Best Buy or Office Depot rather than business solutions. Our strategy is to serve them and do it in the most efficient way possible through our e-commerce platform. If you go to OFI.com.mx there are over 100 different manufacturers on our platform that we represent, from HP, Dell, Lenovo, Microsoft, Salesforce, Amazon Web Services, to Google, and our goal is to understand where these businesses are today. If they are just getting started and need a domain name or email then we will help them get established and take them to the next level.</p><h4>Do logistics represent a challenge for an e-commerce platform expanding in Mexico?</h4><p>The cost of logistics is high. Customers want more solutions tomorrow, even if they have to pick it up as they do not want to wait for two or three days. We have connected with a group of different distributors all throughout Mexico; in aggregate we are connected with over 100 different warehouses that hold inventory and that can delivery to business customers in Mexcio. We inform customers if there is inventory closer to them or further away from them and constantly seek to optimize the time to delivery and the costs of that delivery for each one of our customers depending on where they are located. Logistics is complicated and requires a great deal of effort.</p><h4>What are your short-term goals for 2018?</h4><p>We want to hit our numbers. We recently received the certification for Great Place to Work, which was one of our goals and a major milestone for us. Given that we are a service providerone of our most important tasks is to develop our human talent, and this certificationis representative of what we do internally. We have different goals around performance, though it is important that we continue to penetrate the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of Makon Group's milestones and achievements over the past two years?</h4><p>In the past two years, we have commissioned our flagship projects, including the Utorogu NAG2, a 150 million standard cubic feet (MMscfd) natural gas handling facility. It is fully commissioned and is supplying gas according to the West African Gas Pipeline specification into the Excravos Lagos Pipeline System (ELPS). In electricity terms, this quantity of gas will generate close to 600MW of electricity and equals between 10 and 15% of the national generation capacity for electricity, which hovers around 4,000-6,000MW. On flare-out projects, we are currently in the commissioning phase for Adibawa AG. Its capacity is 5MMscfd, though is an associated gas (AG) solution gas project. We take the gas that is produced with the oil, we compress it, and sell it back for further processing through the gas pipeline network. We are working on a number of other gas-related projects, such as the Egbema AG and NAG gas-processing facility for gas supply to Egbema power plant and the 3Us, which will remove flares from different flow stations around Utorogu and Ughelli East nodes. We have done all this with zero lost-time injuries, which is a key achievement for the organization.</p><h4>What is your ultimate ambition for Makon Group?</h4><p>My ultimate ambition is to have an organization that can be benchmarked to international standards. I also want Makon to be the company of choice when people talk about project delivery in this corner of the world. In the past, when ExxonMobil sought a company to assist with automation and control scope, our name came up. I hope in the future this happens more. In Cameroon or Chad, we went in there to work without any advantage and we competed well with international companies. That is why we must benchmark our operations such that if we compete regionally, we can hold our own. There are companies from South Africa that seek opportunities in this region as well; therefore, we have to be ready to compete as we want to play in the entire Gulf of Guinea markets, namely from Mauritania to Angola, if possible. However, it has to make sense and be profitable for us.</p><h4>Now that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) has been passed, what is your vision for how the industry will change?</h4><p>There have been honest efforts to make a dent in the progress to pass the bill; however, there is still a great deal of work to be done. Thus, we still have quite a ways to go. I still feel positive about the potential impact of the PIB on the industry. We have been doing things the same way for several years, and any practitioner in the industry would agree that things must change. There has been progress, though very slow. Oil and gas activities are the heart of our being as a country. Once we see changes in the oil and gas industry, it will visibly affect all the other sectors of the economy. People are unsure; they do not know how it will affect them personally. However, we are on the right track; we just need to move faster and with greater determination.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>We have seen positive movement, especially with the current price of oil. That should allow certain projects to go on. Most of the indigenous operators that bought diversified assets from IOCs are negotiating with banks on how to restructure their loans. Once they finish that exercise, funding should be available to many of them. Some of the projects that were stalled will come back onstream. I see a positive outlook for 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[sector-development]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about your current gas projects and the progress of attracting project funds?</h4><p>We estimated it would cost us over USD3 billion to develop all our assets at Tubu, Okoro, and IMA fields. We have about 45 million barrels of oil in Tubu, about 45 million barrels of oil in Okoro, and 3.2 trillion cubic feet of gas between Okoro and IMA. We recently went on a roadshow to get companies, financial institutions, and off takers to look at our assets and investment opportunities, where we received a positive response. We have also reached out to banks in Europe and the US, who are currently going through the due diligence process.</p><h4>Are you currently focusing more on gas than oil?</h4><p>In Nigeria, we find gas when we are looking for oil; no one has actually gone out looking for gas in this country. It costs the same amount of money to drill a gas well as it does to drill an oil well, and globally the price of oil is perhaps twice or even triple the price of gas. Therefore, I would rather put my money into a 200-million-barrel oil field than a 200 million barrel equivalent of gas. However, more often a gas reservoir has huge yields compared to oil. Most oil projects have a lifetime of five to 10 years; however, for gas it is about 25 years. Given that Nigeria has three to four times more gas than oil, companies such as ours should focus more on gas; in our discovery of gas reserves we should look to harness and monetize the gas as we go along. The government is making a requirement that when looking for oil, companies must find a solution for the gas before they are allowed to produce oil. This is what we have been doing with gas, which is a loss of revenue and also ruins the environment; we have serious pollution in the Niger Delta as a result of gas flaring. In Nigeria, we have power issues because we do not have gas; thus, we need to make sure we monetize the gas while also reducing environmental pollution.</p><h4>How do IOCs and indigenous companies work together to develop the sector?</h4><p>I see significant requirement for development in the service sector. Close to 80% of the money we spend in the oil and gas industry goes out of the country; if only 20% stays in the country, that is a fraction of what should stay and therefore not sustainable. We currently spend USD8 billion a year in the operations of oil and gas in Nigeria. If we could develop the service sector and keep 60%, that is USD5 billion, could be kept within the economy. This in turn would increase employment, work transfer skills, technology, and more. However, in the upstream, there is a great deal of cooperation right now between independent indigenous oil and gas companies and the IOCs. It is a symbiotic relationship, where IOCs do not want to lose their assets, and the only people they can get to buy them are indigenous companies. There is a great relationship. In fact, 90% of IOCs are run by locals; therefore, Nigerians are the ones being trained and developed by the IOCs.</p><h4>What are your expectations in 2018?</h4><p>I can only talk about the global economy because the Nigerian economy hardly affects our operation. I hope we will be able to stabilize oil prices at between USD50 and USD60 a barrel; if we were to do that, at the least our plans for 2018, which is to reach 50,000bpd, will be achievable. For these three projects, we will be kept extremely busy and 2018 will be a great year for us. We are looking at a few assets that we should be able to acquire that will allow us to look further into 2019 and 2020. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Obijackson Group is currently one of the leading conglomerates in Nigeria. What advice would you give to your peers and investors looking to enter the country?</h4><p>It was important to us to look at areas of the economy that were emerging or where opportunities existed at the time. We focused our attention on those areas and developed our business from there. We saw opportunities for Nigerians to enter the oil business and participated by developing a company to provide oil and gas services: this is how Obijackson Group started. From the services business, we progressed into the oil production business. We have other companies within the group that were created as a result of the opportunities that arose at the time we were doing projects for major oil companies. Hence, Obijackson Group has a portfolio of diverse companies covering different aspects of oil and gas. Because we have a production company as well, we are more or less doing the same work as international oil companies (IOC) such as Shell, Total, and ExxonMobil. The difference is that we are 100% local and use local Nigerians to grow the country's production. This is extremely important because we want to continue to build capacity in Nigerians. Over time, Nigeria has started doing this work well.</p><h4>Three of Obijackson Group's subsidiaries were included in the LSE's Companies to Inspire Africa report. What does this mean for the group and Nigeria?</h4><p>This was a great result for the Obijackson Group. It was a sign that we are moving closer toward going public, both in Nigeria and London. More importantly, these businesses that are being talked about in London are businesses that we need to develop a succession plan for. We need to remain focused on getting these companies into the market. Also for Nigeria, this is the beginning of transformation for certain indigenous companies that aspire to be listed. Other companies will look at this acknowledgment and realize what we have done is a great way to go about growing their businesses as well. For us, the next challenge is looking at coming to the market as soon as everything is ready.</p><h4>What should the government and the private sector in Nigeria do to send a more positive message to the international investor community?</h4><p>Nigeria has more to do to send the right message to the international community in terms of attracting investment into the country. The regulatory authorities need to ensure that all the legal bottlenecks that affect and make doing business difficult in Nigeria are addressed; there are too many regulatory bodies involved in the process. The government needs to align all these to encourage more foreign investors. Nigeria's currency also needs to be stabilized with a mechanism to cushion and guide it, similar to most currencies around the world. The government has to monitor the economy in such a way that it becomes more investment friendly.</p><h4>What is your outlook at Obijackson Group for 2018?</h4><p>2018 is a promising year because we expect to consolidate on the gains we have achieved over the years. Nigeria has just emerged from a recession and we are beginning to show signs of growth. Most of our companies' projections for 2018 are promising because we have a stable economy and foreign exchange rates have stabilized somewhat. With this, most of the losses and pains from the recession are behind us, and we will now build and make our mark. It is a promising year for the group in oil production, construction, and more. The price of oil has stabilized somewhat. Most of our major income in the group comes from our exploration and production (E&amp;P) business and in 2018 we want to ramp up our production by at least an additional 30-40%. Oil and gas is still our dominant business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Nigeria overcome the issue of relying on the imports of finished products?</h4><p>The government is extremely committed to having as much processing of crude oil as possible within Nigeria, and we hope to reach a point in the medium term where we can start to export products. Our strategy is to repair our existing refineries and encourage new investment in refining by the private sector. We see great interest in modular refineries and have also received at least four proposals for large-scale refineries to be established here. We have enough production to support this, although we expect production to increase. We project new refining capacity of about 50,000bpd added to the current capacity and the existing refineries to be up and running within the next two years. If we add the revamped refineries, we should have enough to respond to our domestic needs. As for exports, that will likely take several years, when other refineries start production.</p><h4>What are the ministry's views on gas flaring and monetizing gas?</h4><p>This government has come up with clear policies toward flare gas monetization and flare gas elimination. We have taken a holistic view; we want to provide third parties that have the technical commercial solutions with access to the flares. There are about 700 million scf of gas that is being flared daily, making Nigeria the sixth-largest flaring nation in the world. If we can capture some of that gas flaring, we can use that for power production and industrial use. In addition, the government has committed in the Paris Climate Change Agreement to nationally determined contributions toward the reduction of greenhouse gases. For the petroleum sector, our commitment is to eliminate gas flares. To this end, we have designed a comprehensive program called the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Program through which we want to make sure that the flare issue is behind us by 2020.</p><h4>What is the role of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in developing local content and talent?</h4><p>If the experience did not come from international oil companies (IOC) then it came from NNPC. Agreements between NNPC and its partners require localization. It has worked reasonably well, though there is still room for improvement. Now that we have the Nigerian Content Monitoring Board, this will help even further. Nigerian content is improving. We now have a strong regulator that is reasonably independent and will strengthen that system. There is still a large amount of technology developed internationally as it is an international industry; however, we have Nigerians working all over the world in industrial sectors and the international oil economy. That could flow back if we have a better managed industry. As the industry broadens, we expect to see more Nigerians coming back and getting involved. We are building strong Nigerian upstream companies.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges companies in oil and gas will face in the coming months?</h4><p>It is important for upstream that we have clarity around the fiscal regime and that works both for the government and investors in the upstream. There is no policy until we actually implement fiscal policy and the earlier we implement it, the more clarity one has because it affects investment decisions. For service contractors, and even in upstream, efficiency in contracting will also be a major issue that we have to work on so that decision-making can become quicker and costs are lowered. The way that we project costs for projects is an issue for us currently on the government side. We expect tighter rules around cost management and cost containment, which will have an impact on the service level. Service providers must now be more efficient and competitive, because if we put more pressure on the upstream to be efficient cost wise then they have to put pressure on service providers to also be competitive and efficient. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Neconde Energy's main operations and projects?</h4><p>Neconde Energy is in a joint venture with the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) to manage OML 42. OML 42 is a swamp asset that was acquired from Shell Petroleum Development Company in 2011. Neconde owns 45% while the other 55% belongs to NPDC on behalf of the Nigerian government. We have gone through a fairly checkered history, from acquisition to date, dealing with such issues as who has operatorship rights and challenges with evacuation of crude due to the 18-month outage of the Trans Forcados Pipeline (TFP), which takes crude from our fields to the Forcados terminal. The outage of the pipeline was a result of the insurgency in the Niger Delta. That long outage led us to experiment with barging as an alternative method of crude evacuation.</p><h4>How does the new barging line of business change Neconde's operations?</h4><p>We had to recreate the TFP using boats, barges, and so on; we transported produced oil from the well into a vessel that would sail down a river or creek to a floating storage vessel that accumulates crude until it has enough volumes for export. This completely changed the nature of our company. We used to be just an oil and gas company but have now also become a marine company. A major part of the challenge of the experimentation was trying to keep all the elements working in sync to replicate the seamless flow through a pipeline.</p><h4>What is the advantage of barging over using the TFP?</h4><p>Barging is not necessarily cheaper; however, it gives us the assurance that we can always produce. Since the TFP became operative again, there have been considerable improvements in its up time. However, the pipeline still goes down every four to five weeks because of leaks; it is over 40 years old and has been abused by all the attempts to steal crude from it, the bombings, and bunkerings. When it goes down, production has to be stopped. One feature of this production is we need to nurse our wells and take great care of them. With barging, we are no longer exposed to shutdowns as a result of TFP outage. This also means we are better able to maintain our wells at peak performance.</p><h4>What is your strategy and timeframe to achieve your goal of 100,000bpd from OML 42?</h4><p>The alternative pipeline solution is a key component in achieving and sustaining that level of production. It is one thing to attain a level of peak production; it is another thing to keep production going at the peak. More importantly, following the restoration of the TFP, we have a lifting of the restrictions that we had earlier and can at least produce and export products. Later in the year, we have a number of major interventions that we have to carry out and a number of additional wells we need to drill; through these, we expect to achieve a production level of 110,000bpd by the end of 2018.</p><h4>What do you expect from 2018?</h4><p>2018 will be more of a consolidation year; we would like to have high targets that we want to meet and surpass, though we are also looking at the macroeconomic environment and the fiscal enablers. We would like to see more of a settlement of the questions around the Petroleum Industry Bill. Removing that cloud from the business environment would also make additional investment easier because a bad bill is better than the uncertainty of the current moment. I am also hopeful that with more of the things that we are doing in Neconde, we will begin to see an end to the restiveness of the Niger Delta in 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-most-profitable-participation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the volume of stock trading over the past year?</h4><p>Compared to 2016, volume has significantly gone up. Currently, we do almost 400 million shares a day, which works out to a little above NGN4 billion on the equity markets. We also see a great deal of activity in the primary market, mostly driven by fixed income. There was USD5.6 billion worth of listings in 1H2017, and about USD5 billion of that is fixed income. The federal government has issued a number of fixed income products, including Eurobonds. On the equity side, we saw about USD188 million worth of listings in 1H2017. We have had two listings, two M&amp;A activities, special placements, and similar others.</p><h4>Is the government interested in issuing more diaspora bonds, particularly considering the low tax collection rates in the country? </h4><p>Nothing can be a true substitute to an appropriate tax return. Our tax laws need to be updated and enforced. There needs to be enough flexibility to support the government agenda in terms of giving incentives to particular sectors or industries where the government wants to stimulate growth. If the government wants to do import substitution, it has to determine the industries with a competitive advantage, and support and focus on those.</p><h4>How developed is the derivatives market in Nigeria?</h4><p>We need strong risk management tools. The exchange has been working hard to introduce exchange-traded derivates. A clearing house is needed that will support and create innovation. It is the contra to every trade: buyer to seller and seller to buyer. If this were present, we would see greater risk taking. We need the infrastructure and frameworks that support entrepreneurial activity and risk taking. Derivatives are a tool to drive economic development. One can hedge on anything from interest rates to commodities and FX, which is something we want to encourage. We do a high level of capacity building, speaking to various players from regulators to potential users. From the regulators' point of view, derivatives are often viewed in a negative light; however, we have the opportunity to design derivative products that are not that highly leveraged. Therefore, if the market moved against us, it would not blow everything up. We have the advantage of having a clean slate here and can learn from developed markets.</p><h4>What is the NSE's role in attracting foreign investors to Nigeria?</h4><p>We have built a credible platform from a regulatory perspective, following just and equitable principles, and have tried to create a fair market that is transparent. From implementation to automation to having the appropriate rules and disclosure mechanisms, we have got it all in place. We have also gone out to engage with institutional investors, doing roadshows in the US, Europe, Asia, and South Africa, talking to investors and explaining the improvements and reforms we have made in the market, and letting them understand how they can access our market. We have been active with both foreign and domestic investors to get them to participate in the market. Finally, we have partnered with many global institutions, being full members of the World Federation of Exchanges, and are the first African exchange to join the ISG. A number of these bodies provide standards and best practices. Membership in these organizations means adopting best practices, which gives global investors the confidence that we are committed to running a world-class marketplace.</p><h4>What is the NSE doing to improve the investment climate here, and how would you assess the attractiveness of Nigeria?</h4><p>Nigeria is not where it needs to be in regard to its attractiveness to investors. We are doing a great deal to improve our ranking, however. We have engaged the government to help work on the ease of doing business, including: the ease of registering companies, raising capital, entry of goods and services, entry of people, and so on. We can do more in these areas and are working closely with the government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide more background into Heritage Bank's operations and its major achievements?</h4><p>We looked at the business foundation of Nigeria when forming Heritage Bank and developing our business model, and observed that no family-owned Nigerian business had successfully transferred local ownership beyond the second generation. The complete business lifecycle of Nigerian businesses was only three generations: the first started operations, the second oversaw the decline, and the third buried the business. We asked ourselves what we needed to do differently to correct this and allow Nigerian businesses to thrive from generation to generation. If we could show that generational banking is the bedrock of economic development, we could have a real impact. Amongst SMEs in Nigeria, there has been too much of an individual focus rather than a holistic or intergenerational focus. There is not enough focus on partnership amongst Nigerian SMEs, and this causes ventures to fail. We need to expand this mindset to allow the Nigerian economy to thrive in a sustainable way. Business leaders can create a powerful legacy this way. Our contribution to this effort has been to change the mindset of business leaders in Nigeria. We have emphasized the need for businesses to change their approach toward their ventures, starting with simple yet fundamental things such as ensuring that financials are in order, a board is in place, that risks are shared, and that proper governance mechanisms are in place. This is why we focus so much on technology. With technological innovation, we can drive business. We have to think completely differently as the environment has truly changed.</p><h4>What has been behind Heritage Bank's recent success?</h4><p>Truthfully, it is our people. This business is about the next generation, the young graduates. We started a graduate training program where we take in recent graduates and put them in a six-month training program. They develop ideas and concepts that we had never even considered, and that allows us to drive innovation from the bottom up. We want to instill in our people a recognition that it is not about short-term profitability but about creating a legacy. When people think about Heritage Bank, we want them to think about all the qualities that define who we are and what we do, and that process begins with having the best people. By extension, this means that strong and visionary leadership is paramount. Every week we discuss leadership and things that matter when serving people. We do not perceive our customers only as those who have accounts with us. We view everyone as a potential customer and treat them as such.</p><h4>What are Heritage Bank's expansion plans?</h4><p>Our philosophy does not rely on traditional banking metrics like growth in the number of accounts. It is based on how many businesses we can help develop in the next three years. We want to help develop these companies to the point where they are able to publicly list on the primary and secondary markets. We want to put businesses in a position to thrive, and from this, our account numbers will increase. In the next five years, we want to see our clients develop from SMEs to being publicly listed on exchanges. We invest in companies that have ambitious visions because we want to see them develop into large and thriving firms that can bring transformative development to Nigeria. We work with our clients to develop plans tailored to their specific growth needs. If we facilitate the success of our clients, then we are succeeding. This is not a conventional approach for a bank. Of course, we recognize the importance of sound business fundamentals; however, if we can help our customers develop, then we can be stronger and more profitable. Rather than money, we place our customers first because in the long term, they are the best investment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your activities in relation to your mandate to set standards in higher education and quality control?</h4><p>Our main goal is to drive excellence all over the higher educational institutes, and to help universities to improve their performance in a continuous way up to the international levels. Towards this end we build a new set of accreditation standards that response to the immediate and far needs which are outcome-driven rather being a process driven as before. The new accreditation standards are impactful, economic, flexible, and scalable. NCAAA does not work as inspection agency yet, it helps the universities and faculty to build up their capacities and improve their caliber for continuous improvement. We provide training, consultations, and versatile range of support to all types of universities including those established 50 years ago and more, a middle section 20-30 year-old, and the newly established one. Our accreditation standards concern about two major domains namely institutional capacity and the educational effectiveness.</p><h4>Education is considered a major pillar under Vision 2030. What does that mean for NCAAA?</h4><p>It means a lot, where Vision 2030 requires a skillful, impactful manpower, which is directly related to education and training, which is the core business of NCAAA. All the educational institutions, and their academic activities must be aligned and coordinated in a suitable frame that serves vision 2030. There is a clear shift in student preparation and evaluation from knowledge to competences including the soft and future skills necessary for 2030. The future is rapidly changing and the labour market and the needed jobs and professions in the future is totally different from those of today, and we must be ready, and quickly respondent through student preparation which all serves the vision.</p><h4>How does the NCAAA meet international benchmarks and to what extent is it collaborating with foreign partners to do so?</h4><p>We meet the international benchmarking on several levels including the individualized work on one hand, through the international experts we cooperate with them in training and in external review of institutions, and on the institutional levels on the other hand where most of our work such as the accreditation standards are subject to international evaluation. Moreover, many memorandum of understanding are in place with many international bodies such as Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in the area of accrediting IT and engineering programs, as well as many others in the area of medical education. We are a member in ANQAHEE, Council for higher education accreditation (CHEA), and working on obtaining a full membership from INQAHEE. This -in turns- will reflect on Saudi universities where we have five universities are included in the top 500 universities in the world ranking, and planning to have five on the top 200. Saudi universities now are the best in the Arab world.</p><h4>How do you envision increasing the amount of research done in the country and what are some of the ways it will be funded moving forward?</h4><p>The amount of research is one of many other concerns and interests where the added value of the produced research, its impact on improving the reality, helping to shift into knowledge society and building the knowledge economy are serious issues we are working on. The newly developed accreditation standards included a complete standard on scientific research and innovation, and we start preparing a specific indicator for this standard to be able to calculate the international indicator, to which the performance of each university could be compared. A proposal for ranking the universities based on scientific research regarding productivity, creativity, applicability is under consideration. Having the link between the scientific research and its applicability will change the funding map and landscape where the industrial institutions will accelerate in funding the good research and this itself will enhance the quality of researches. All these acts are supported by restructuring the universities and widening the governing bodies and boards. We are focusing now on new directions such as artificial intelligence and other fields that will increase the citation index of Saudi researches.</p><h4>What changes do you expect to the education landscape in the coming years, both for public and private institutions?</h4><p>Universities have to work according to our standards. However, we want to connect both public and private universities to the market. It is now mandatory for all schools to have advisory boards made up of representatives from the market, including large companies and corporations, as well as government. Once the universities are connected—and most of them already are—we do not have problems with future employability. However, the problem before was that every school has its own mission and objectives. Now, we ensure their visions are aligned with the national vision to make sure there is coherence between the needs of the market and all the stakeholders and schools, private or public. This is what we are working toward for the future. Many schools are already working closely with us, though the newer ones are on our agenda for the coming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the monetary policies implemented by the CBN over the past few years?</h4><p>Over the last three years, the Nigerian economy encountered enormous external shocks that exposed our vulnerabilities. Due to inherent structural imbalances, Nigeria relies on oil revenue for its foreign exchange supply and has an unwarranted taste for imported goods. The sharp collapse of oil prices that began in 2014 adversely impacted fiscal revenue, foreign exchange reserves, and exchange rate stability. As fiscal space contracted, the maneuverability of macroeconomic and social policies diminished. All these, in addition to shrinking reserves and a depreciating exchange rate, put immense strain on the Nigerian economy. By 2016, the economy had fallen into a recession as inflation surged to intolerable heights. Given the importance of price stability in macroeconomic stabilization and the role of the exchange rate in the dynamics of relative-prices, the CBN focused its efforts on battling inflation and maintaining exchange rate stability. Our analyses indicate that runaway inflation could only worsen the already unsavory situation. Hence, monetary policy stance remained cautiously tight in its efforts to categorically rein in inflation and extricate lingering money illusions in the macroeconomy. We also took several decisions to finetune operations in the foreign exchange markets, with a view to purge the system of unscrupulous excess demand and ensure exchange rate stability.</p><h4>How do you intend to ensure exchange rate stability is sustained into the future?</h4><p>Through our multifaceted approach to combating foreign exchange market instability, we succeeded in stabilizing the exchange rate from NGN515.0/USD in February 2017 to about NGN365/USD in November. The bank's strategy was to resolutely manage FX demand while concurrently seeking means to enhance FX supply. We eliminated speculators, bettors, and round-trippers and restricted access to FX in the market. The bank also increased transparency in the market through a more flexible FX market and the establishment of an I&amp;E window. Moreover, we ensured an appropriately tight monetary policy throughout that period. All these jointly culminated in the stability we see today. To ensure that this endures, the bank will sustain transparency in the market so as not to upend investor confidence. We will also continue to target transactions-based demand, shut the door on unscrupulous rent-seekers, and continually fine tune the policy stance to ensure its appropriateness.</p><h4>How would you assess the health of Nigerian banks today, and what message would you send to boost the sector's performance?</h4><p>Our assessment indicates that the financial system remains fundamentally robust despite the enormous external shocks that debilitated the economy. This is highlighted by increased profits recorded across the industry and improved credit ratings from prominent agencies. To ensure sustained financial stability, the CBN will continue to closely regulate banks using the risk-based supervision model and maintain the elevated threshold of prudential indicators. As against the CAGR of 8% prescribed internationally, we set a threshold of 16% for systemically important banks, 15% for banks with international presence, and 10% benchmark for all others. Given that the banking system is the lubricant of the economy, banks have an enormous role to play in supporting the economic recovery. I would encourage them to channel more credits to agriculture and MSMEs through our development finance initiatives. Contrary to the amplified risk perception of MSME credits, that sector's NPL is far below the industry average.</p><h4>What role can the bank play in funding agriculture? </h4><p>Four commodities—rice, fish, sugar, and wheat—consumed nearly NGN1.3 trillion annually in import bills. These and other commodities in the list of 41 items were a drain on our FX reserves. Our proclivity for imports has enriched other countries and impoverished ours. If we increase domestic food production, we will create jobs, reduce poverty, and shield our economy from foreign impulses. Thus, the bank is channeling a great deal of development finance and interventions toward agriculture to ensure sufficiency in the production of food and raw materials through our various development finance mechanisms and schemes. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Unlocking the Housing Market]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[fabrice-susini-ceo-saudi-real-estate-refinance-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does SRC work toward the objective of unlocking the Saudi housing finance market?</h4><p>SRC is one element in a more global ecosystem put in place under the umbrella of the Ministry of Housing. The whole plan of developing home ownership, housing, and access to home ownership is relying on three pillars. The first is supply, which is about ensuring we build enough affordable houses. The second is broadening the scope of who has access to home ownership, which is where the Real Estate Development Fund (REDF) plays a key role. We need to design accessible and affordable financial products. The third element is that there are homes coming to the market at an affordable price, and there are elements or products that make them affordable to more people; however, more has to be done to channel liquidity towards originators. Channeling liquidity means that there is a story to tell and to make sure that our products and our packaging are attractive to investors. Providing the liquidity is where SRC comes into play. We are now getting some traction because of the recent deal with Deutsche Gulf and Bidaya, and we are currently finalizing negotiations to sign the third transaction coming up with another mortgage finance company. Our approach is to provide a global answer to what the mortgage finance companies and the banks need to do or to see how we can help them to originate more. We interact with the originators to expand the eligibility criteria, and we promote standardization and transparency while we support the mortgage companies and banks and channel liquidity. It is nice to entice people to originate more loans and to grow the volume with a broader range of borrowers; however, at the end of the day we need also to make sure that we can bring the funding to these originators and that is what SRC is all about.</p><h4>How will SRC acquire and package the finance portfolios to make these attractive for domestic and international investors?</h4><p>This process drives on the expertise that we have within the company and that look at what we can do, what we shall do and what we need to avoid doing in order to make sure that we stay away from the difficulties that some markets have met in the past. We want to avoid what happened in the US in 2008 with the subprime. We combine therefore what we know could be done and what should not be done with how the market works here and then how we can sensibly push the boundaries. Secondly, we work on a reverse inquiry basis. SRC has two components in its mission: growth and stability. Growth means that we ensure there is enough funding to propel the mortgage market in the country, and we can only do that by not only relying on the domestic but also on international investors. By the same token it will also shape the “stability" element. We need to keep an eye on what the standards are, and what the narrative is that we will present to investors. With this reverse inquiry base approach, we are reverting to the originators and trying to shape the loans, criteria, reporting, information, and standards to the level that could be expected by third parties. Our intermediary role is partly capitalizing on what the market is, how it is functioning today, and the elements that could be improved and factoring what we know about the expectations of international investors. It is a two-way process whereby we explain and we anticipate to investors how the market works while raising the bar and the criteria so we can meet the expectations of the investors. This is about making sure that as we go we can attract liquidity, and we can fund all these loans, mortgages and acquisitions. It is not a pure game of distribution, but it is really about the real economy and real assets with a careful approach of the risk.</p><h4>Are you targeting specific areas or funds and what are your expectations for the demand to grow?</h4><p>We want to make sure we have the right product in terms of origination. The right product does not mean necessarily being overly conservative or on the contrary, overly liberal. Our aim is to grow the Saudi market sustainably, which means we should offer more loans to a broader range of the population, with the right assessment, right product, and the right coverage. Starting from there and the consideration for the assets, we cannot imagine jumping from a domestic market, which is almost absent on the international map, and say that tomorrow we will issue on the international market. We need to create credibility and recognition first, starting with domestic investors. After that, we go to countries in the region that have a close experience of the Saudi market, and then we will venture further afield. Still, we are aiming for a short timeframe to reach out internationally.</p><h4>What ambitions have you set for the coming years?</h4><p>We have three ambitions for 2018; the first one is to keep signing agreements and transactions, on-boarding new partners, and whilst doing that, to grow the volume and diversify the borrowing base. The second is to achieve our first capital market transactions, which could be a private placement to start with, a sukuk issuance likely. We should start putting our footprint and name on the map of investors by the end of 2018. Being on the radar screen sensibly will make a difference volume-wise. The third element is about creating a proper long-term fixed-rate products that the market does not have on the lending side at present. This means that we start creating or building up a long-term fixed rate curve the benefit of which will be channeled to the borrower which borrow at one point on a longer term and fixed-rate basis. Currently, most people on the Saudi market are floating or quasi-floating  which put us apart from most market we want to “replicate"and that have a proper fixed rate offer. For borrowers, who typically receive a linear salary, it is preferable  that the central bank or macro economic parameters have no influence on the amount of the monthly installment. The raise of the interest rate and their variability is an issue. We want to make sure that in terms of product, we bring something that can help stabilize the market and the position of the borrowers at a competitive price. Hence, the third objective for 2018 is to start to plant the seeds of what will become a benchmark curve on mortgages in the country for fixed rates long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	Can you tell us about your new focus on renewable energy?
</h4><p>
	We started focusing on green energy a few years ago for two reasons. Firstly, it makes financial sense, and secondly it is environmentally friendly. Our business model is also inherently eco-conscious because instead of building two or three towers in the same area, we build one; therefore, less land is occupied and fewer power systems are deployed. To date, we have invested almost half a billion dollars in these initiatives. We have 15,000 tower sites in Nigeria, but since unfortunately every site has to have a power system attached to it, we are working to shift from the old conventional generator power systems to innovative green hybrid energy solutions that include solar panels. We also piloted a few wind turbines, but are focusing on solar technology for now.</p><h4>How can the government support renewable energy initiatives?</h4><p>
	In 2016, we commissioned a research report with The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) on green energy in Africa. The report concluded that governments need to promote green energy as the primary energy source in Africa and help subsidize the sector in order to reach these goals. We must also all work to protect consumers while simultaneously attracting investors by enforcing low tariffs. Governments throughout the continent need to work to improve regulation as well as the general ease of doing business. In terms of what the administration is already doing, the Nigerian government has clear plans for the energy sector, which was evidenced by the recent new ministry appointment. However, , the economy has gone in a different direction over the past few years due to a combination of factors, but we hope the recession will come to an end soon. One of the surprising findings of the EIU report was that South Africa was able to produce energy using green resources at a cheaper rate than with oil. Hence, eventually, green energy could become cheaper, though we must all work to invest in additional R&amp;D to find the most efficient technological solution. Many multinational investors have shown a willingness to build solar farms in the country, but the two main challenges for prospective investors are currency fluctuations and the current state of the economy.</p><h4>It is estimated that in order to meet its renewable energy needs Africa requires USD90 billion in investment each year. How is it going to attract this, and what is the potential for PPPs?</h4><p>
	The potential for PPPs is there, and privatizing the power sector in Nigeria could be the first step. This would involve opening the door for international investors to come and invest here without too many restrictions. Where it becomes tricky is that high levels of investment will eventually force investors into liberalizing pricing; however, Nigeria must work to protect its consumers. This is where the government could come up with a subsidized system to help consumers without deterring investors. The Central Bank has started a few new initiatives to improve the investment climate, including the introduction of a window through which investors can bring in their funds and sell at any rate as long as they find a buyer within the country.</p><h4>What is IHS Towers' impact on pushing the renewable energy sector in Nigeria?</h4><p>
	By making large investments in green energy, we opened the door for many companies to start thinking outside the box. The fact that we have invested almost half a billion dollars into new green energy power systems, and will continue to do so whilst looking for new solutions, should encourage others to take similar steps. We do not always have to wait for the government to intervene. Ideally, we would love continued government support, but until we get there we have to find solutions for the challenges associated with the services we provide. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Investing in renewable energy products]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[mazen-jubaili-managing-director-jmg-limited]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an update on JMG's growth and diversification goals?</h4><p>We have diversified and entered into home appliance wholesale as well as supplying electrical and home appliances to supermarkets and malls. As we started from zero, we saw great results in 2016. Certain sectors have improved while others did not do that well; however, in general there was slight growth. Our diversification also covered elevators; we became the agents of ThyssenKrupp and did well in that business. We also diversified into the transformer business and things have picked up there. In addition, we started a lighting business with GE directly and have small projects for lighting, retrofitting LEDs, energy saving, and others. By the end of 2017 we had also invested in some renewable energy products such as solar panels and inverters. Our diversification is moving as expected, though our expectations were not that high because the economy was experiencing a recession. The recession, however, gave us time to position ourselves in the market and it was a great time to start and await growth.</p><h4>What is the status of your plans to become an independent power producer (IPP)?</h4><p>We are preparing to start doing IPPs across the country and have already done a few projects where we sell power. The IPPs we expect—ranging from 5-100MW—depend on the projects and the appetite of the market. There are currently many issues in the market such as the gas price, the exchange rate, and gas pipelines that exploded in the last year, and the subsidized power sector is suffering. We have the capability, though we cannot yet see an attractive market and are thus taking on smaller projects. We have done 6-10MW projects with several multinationals and sell them power. We are also into the resale of generators as the aim is to sell power by kilowatt-hour. Depending on what can be done in the country, we will do it.</p><h4>What is your ultimate ambition for JMG in Nigeria in the near future?</h4><p>With our products diversification, our mission statement has changed to reflect a global company providing building and infrastructures solutions from power to plug. So we plan to be a company with end-to-end solutions with multiple product offerings, covering several sectors of the market across Africa. We also launched in Ghana and the Ivory Coast and are heading toward Benin. JMG will be a company for the construction, manufacturing, and retail sectors, with a huge selection of products including electrical, energy, and solar. We are trying to give more in terms of energy, power, and electrical products. We are expanding and will continue to expand; we are concentrating on geographical expansion.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the power issue in Nigeria?</h4><p>I see a slow progress in the power sector since its privatization. The current 5,000-7,000MW is not enough for Nigeria. It is not impossible, though significant commitment is required for progress.</p><h4>What should the government do to make the sector more attractive?</h4><p>Our revenue is in naira though all are purchases are in dollars. On one side, the risk is too high as there are no hedging instruments that can minimize or litigate this risk and this is one of the major issues in terms of generation. There are many risks in terms of currency and gas prices; however, on the other hand companies are collecting in naira and there is a big risk that cannot be accommodated. Another factor is that even if companies have local funding, the interest rate in Nigeria is 26-27% or more. The private sector funding of 8% has long been exhausted and no small IPP is able to benefit from the power sector fund of 8%. With 26% interest one has to meet its targets of NGN38 or even less and then sell to the consumer at NGN38. With the interest rate it is not possible to have new equipment. In terms of gas supply, 2017 was a disaster and in one sense the environment surrounding this sector is not supportive enough. In terms of what could be done by the government, the pricing and tariff needs to be revised as soon as possible as it is not cost-effective and for us as a business it is not interesting. The gas pricing also definitely needs to be looked at.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>I expect marginal macroeconomic growth for the country and the company. Growth will be different for different sectors; however, in general we will grow. We might grow more in certain sectors than the GDP growth. There are signs of growth in oil production and the concentration in agriculture, though we will not see huge investments in the export business or the government focusing on other revenues than oil.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dr-fahad-bin-sulaiman-al-tekhaifi-president-general-authority-statistics]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can the Saudi labor market best absorb new talents and what strategies should be put in place to capitalize on the country's demographic bonus?</h4><p>Almost 59% of Saudis are under the age of 30 and 49% are below 25, which means we are an extremely young country. Many are indeed entering the labor market. Within GaStat, we have two teams working on this issue. The first team provides statistics to the relevant entities, such as the Ministry of Civil Services, the Ministry of Labor, and the Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF), which drafts the labor market policies. With our work, we can advance decision-makers in the labor markets and give guidance in how to absorb the young population of the country into the labor market. Our work has become more advanced; we include new indicators of job seekers such as their qualifications, ages, and preferences, in addition to existing work visas and a division in public and private sector, which we have classified before. Furthermore, we classify these job seekers into regions, when combined with the other indicators, we can provide the data for unemployment policy. As our work advances, we are also working to raise greater awareness to use our resources. This is not an obstacle unique to Saudi; all sophisticated institutions across the globe face this problem. For example, not all ministries use our numbers, and that puts us under pressure to raise awareness of these services. Our counterpart in the Netherlands, for example, has a media program for its institutions, with detailed explanations of its research findings. We seek to launch a similar practice.</p><h4>What trends do your current research show with regards to the growth of non-oil sectors?</h4><p>We have evaluated our statistical products according to the international requirements as set out by World Bank and IMF and are currently developing a program to align our indicators and presents more in line with international practice. For example, we need to make some of our figures quarterly rather than annually—GDP is now measured quarterly. Our job seeker indicator is new. To measure the impact of Vision 2030 on the national economy, we have to look at 12 programs and develop our indicators accordingly. One of these new products was developed to support the Ministry of Housing to better serve the needs of the population in terms of housing development. In the recent years—and Vision 2030 has catalyzed this—we have tightened our collaboration with ministries and other government entities and have therefore served the public better. Another new element is our focus on SMEs, and we are developing tools and products to serve them with better insights. We listen more to their needs, and use their feedback in our research strategies. Since GaStat became independent in 2016, we have changed our way of working significantly; we are now more proactive and treat government entities as VIP customers to better serve economic development.</p><h4>How can you serve international businesses and investors with your statistics?</h4><p>Within GaStat, we have a team dealing with foreign investment. It closely collaborates with the Ministry of Commerce and Investment to develop the necessary indicators to measure economic growth and opportunities. It jointly consults with experts from IMF, the World Bank, and other renowned international institutions to satisfy the requirement for international businesses. A better alignment with global standards will make our data better presentable and comparable with statistics of other countries, bring more transparency to international investors, and ultimately provide better opportunities. We are currently finalizing the new data set of top indicators for international investors.</p><h4>What notable trends in sustainable development goals (SDGs) have you gathered or observed?</h4><p>Certain SDGs are easier to track than others; one indicator is easy to develop from surveying the data with well-known methodologies. For this, we plan to maximize those indicators and publish the progress made. During the past two years, we have coordinated with the Ministry of Planning &amp; Economy and other entities, as they are responsible for implementing the policies. In the past two years, we have become more active in international expert teams. Recently, we were asked by the UN to be part of a group of international experts to develop formal statistics on Big Data, and have also joined a board to develop tourism statistics. In 2017, we were asked to join the United Nations Statistics Division. For SDG, we may also join the team of international experts. Each year, we discuss the SDG and then produce and publish them as well as develop the methodology and obstacles to be part of the international organization compared to the other institutions.</p><h4>What ambitions have you set for the General Authority for Statistics?</h4><p>We want to move the General Authority for Statistics from good to great. On the basis of our statistics, it takes an average of six years to change an organization to the point where they become an instrumental and involved entity in a country, while also interacting with international partners. We have a four-year plan to change how we produce statistics and have developed a roadmap to change our style. We should work in three dimensions and six areas. The first dimension is the customer, including the media, the public sector, the private sector, and international organizations, and understanding how to interact with them. The second dimension is quality, and we should take our task as official statistics producer seriously. The third dimension is rethinking the statistical sectors and structure our data in, for example, education, environment, and economical. Then, there are six focus areas in our master plan. The first is strategy, which should be redesigned to become more customer based. Second comes international alignment of indicators and by 2020, we strive to comply 100% with regional and global standards. The third area is on the methodology, and we want to be at the forefront of developing new methodologies, like we do in the international expert team for Big Data for the UN. Data collection is our fourth focus, especially developing new ways of collecting data with the use of technology. Statistical awareness is the fifth area of focus; it is our problem when customers do not use our data—it means we should improve to keep up with the change. The last area is on governance and our organizational structure. We should restructure ourselves and get more involved in other institutions. That way, we can become a global reference point for any international statistics requirements about the Kingdom.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Will open 337 new outlets with BP]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[haryanto-adikoesoemo-president-director-akr-corporindo]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will AKR's business change with your newly secured tender to import fuel for the coming five years?</h4><p>AKR's business in petroleum today is primarily selling high-speed diesel, which is used in industrial applications. Growth has been great in that segment over the last decade. We now see great potential growth areas, with coal prices increasing as well as the metal industry picking up. There is also the bigger part of petroleum downstream, more specifically retail, where there is now an opportunity to grow. Our government contract is mostly for diesel, with a small part comprising gasoline. In 2010, BPH Migas, the downstream regulator, wanted to bring in other parties to support the distribution of subsidized fuel across the country and opened tenders. Since 2010, AKR has been the only private company receiving the allocation of subsidized fuel, along with Pertamina. In 2018, Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Ignasius Jonan also made the move to provide a longer-term contract for the next five years. AKR was selected, along with Pertamina, to develop this business. The extension of subsidized fuel contracts to five years is a welcomed move. Now, AKR can grow its current figure of 135 petrol stations. Going forward, with the JV with BP, we will move on to non-subsidized gasoline. Over the next 10 years, we want to open 337 outlets under the BP brand. That will also bring in the superior quality fuels, lubricants, and retail stores. This is a 50.1% AKR — 49.9% BP Global, whereby AKR will support the joint venture in terms of equity and logistics. We will also jointly develop the outlets, taking care of land and construction. The concept of petrol stations in Indonesia is now moving toward those seen in developed markets. The most important infrastructure we need is storage tanks at the terminals. In the last 10 years, AKR has grown its storage tank volumes from 150,000cbm to nearly 666,000cbm. There are plans to grow this by another 30% over the next few years. Initially, the petrol stations will be owned and operated by the company. In three to five years, we will progress to the dealer-owned and operated model or the franchising model.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the Java Integrated Industrial and Port Estate (JIIPE) project, which has unique treatment from the government?</h4><p>JIIPE is a large industrial estate with an attached seaport that seeks to attract industrial clients. We are developing 3,000ha of land in total, of which 400ha will be the seaport, 1,760ha will be the industrial estate, and 800ha will be residential. The problem in Indonesia is its high logistics costs, which are one the highest in the region and the world because of inefficiencies in terms of transporting goods in and out of the country. The port facilities and road infrastructure need to be addressed. We have been developing JIIPE since 2012, and it will have port access, toll roads, and railway access, which will improve the ease of bringing in goods as well as exporting. We are currently developing Phase I of the project, for which we have acquired more than 1,000ha of land. Here, the emphasis is on developing utilities, such as power plants, wastewater management, logistics, office utilities, railway depots, and so on. All these add value to the clients, which are primarily heavy or medium industry. The development is massive, and we have divided it into three phases. The first will be from 2014 to 2019 and will encompass 800ha of industrial land and road access from highways to our location, as well as interior roads. We are developing three power plants to service customers. The first will be a 23MW multi-fueled plant, which was commissioned in 2017. The second is a 500MW gas-fired plant, while the third will be a 660MW coal-fired plant. Heavy industry requires a huge amount of power. We will develop power here to supply directly to the fertilizers, the smelters, and other heavy industry clients. We currently have more than seven clients, including Swiss Clariant, a specialty chemical manufacturer, Unichem, and Hextar from Malaysia. We also have Djarum Group, which will develop a castor oil refinery. This becomes an efficient proposition if companies seek to import and export, as well as distribute inland. The government supports this project because our partner is state-owned enterprise Pelindo III, which owns 40% of the industrial estate and 60% of the port. Pelindo III will dredge the channel so the port can accommodate Post-Panamax vessels up to 150,000 tons, making the port one of the largest and deepest in the country. The government and others are extremely supportive because they see the need for such an industrial estate to bring foreign and domestic investors and improve efficiencies.</p><h4>What motivated the decision to divest your business in China?</h4><p>AKR has been in China since the 1990s. The first plant was developed in 1994, when we were mostly a chemical producer. It was a sorbitol and sweetener plant in Liuzhou, Guangxi province. As we have significantly grown in Indonesia, it is time for us to close down the China operation. The Chinese government wants to redevelop that area and we signed an agreement to hand over the land. We had also invested in a port project in Guigang, Guangxi. We had a great offer from a Chinese state-owned enterprise that is also a port operator. Both transactions will net us at least USD250 million to bring back to Indonesia. Now that we have initiatives in retail and the industrial estate, we can deploy the funds more effectively.</p><h4>What are your immediate plans and ambitions?</h4><p>We expect to grow in the double digits in 2018 in terms of profit. There is new growth in retail, aviation, and utilities that will see the company growing much bigger and more balanced over the next few years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does a company need in order to stand out in the UAE market?</h4><p>Relevancy is the main challenge that all our clients here and generally around the world face in their communication strategies. In order to become relevant to their audiences, one must start with the type of content. Brands face questions on how they can gain a space in the market and invest given the current takeover from social media in the communications world. Platforms such as Facebook enable anyone to add content and get data on who views that content. Thus, the answer to these questions lies in allocating money on content. This is how Careem moved from being a small player in the UAE to competing with global players such as Uber. The company received millions in funding, spreading awareness across the region through Smart Think and sharing videos across the web using the right personality. Careem thus represents a case study for the market, using the right content at the right time. Moreover, brands and clients in this region should look at Emirates Airline and how it embodies a perfect example of a local brand behaving globally. The key to its content strategy was sponsorship, which in fact translates into relevance. The third aspect, which is the most important, is using the right platform. Traditional media is not dead and newspapers are still the first source of decision-making. When this trusted source of media and news adapts to the new digital age, it will be an extremely successful medium of delivering the message.</p><h4>What challenges do brands face in the UAE?</h4><p>Companies that have not adapted to the digital age face challenges, both internally and externally. Certain firms, such as Al Tayer. recently started to adapt an online platform and to e-commerce. Chalhoub Group has not moved completely to e-commerce because it still believes in traditional malls, though it does not mean its business model is wrong. On the other hand, companies like Emaar have adapted to e-commerce through the acquisition of Namshi. Emaar has also had a huge in-house digital team for five to 10 years, and its challenges now are not adaptation but updating in line with new trends. The third aspect is how the government adapts to this trend and incorporates savvy employees to build frameworks for smart cities. For example, we are in the process of launching the first global Artificial Intelligence Readiness Index to test how prepared organizations, especially government ones, are in terms of comprehensively integrating AI. We want to reach out to IBM to be part of this project, especially to find a way to communicate the readiness of an entity to the market. Dubai Police has gradually implemented an accident reporting system through an app enabling people to become accustomed to it. When it felt the market was ready, it adapted a communications campaign to invite customers to adapt to its existing and functioning services.</p><h4>Can you expand on the relevance of market readiness in launching innovative products?</h4><p>The is a huge number of innovative applications that were invented years ago and are put on hold, waiting for the market to be ready. One of them is facial recognition software, which can be now used in supermarket check-outs, to determine if customers are satisfied. This adaptation is still probably 15 years away in the UAE, when the population will be younger and more willing to accept new technologies. The key to launching a product is finding a balance between organization and market readiness. This helps us understand the strategy behind certain decisions that look like they are just operational in their nature. For example, after being initially dropped by Apple, the company went on to reintroduce Bluetooth headphones to the market 15 years later. Apple is also slowly preparing client readiness to insert a chip inside the body. At the beginning it is about making gradual adjustments, such as Bluetooth headphones in the ear. Market readiness has to do with regulation, as there are disruptive companies that are reshaping, for example, the delivery business through drones, with no framework in place. Eventually, the government will have to ensure regulation is in place, as it has no option otherwise. As an entrepreneur, one must take risks and start with the R&amp;D to be ready once the regulation is in place in five or 10 years' time.</p><h4>Which sector has the biggest potential for AI currently?</h4><p>E-commerce for FMCG stands out. Five years from now, marketers will start sell to machines. The example provided by Echo, in this case, gives insights on how machines will make decisions on behalf of customers based on preferences. When a fridge runs out of milk, it will automatically order more. Customers will start trusting machines because they are more accurate than brains. The war on data started 10 years ago, and now it is the war on understanding and trusting it. AI-powered mechanisms will compare customers profile to find similar ones and apply a buying strategy based on price and personal characteristics. The key to understanding why people will not reject this system is the value of time: technology will save customers so much time that they will not be able to say no.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was Sarepta created, and what have its operations been like? </h4><p>Sarepta was created out of a love for my continent and country, and to promote a different image of Africa to the western world. The image of Nigeria and Nigerians abroad is not always positive, and changing this image was the driving passion behind creating the company. I always loved the idea of business and making money, but that philosophy changed when I realized that if I could help better the lives of others through offering gainful employment, the rewards of having a satisfied workforce and employees would lead to greater motivation and better business results, not to mention profit. We started by approaching state governments that had ideas for projects but did not execute them due to a lack of funds or because white elephant projects needed revamping. These included MROs, hospitals, or power plants that were not completely finished. I used my resources and contacts in the US, many of whom were Nigerians who were looking for places to invest. I wanted to make an FDI prospectus that would showcase information vital for any investor, foreign or domestic. Information such as what investment opportunities existed in the region and their markets, associated cost, risk, profit, and potential returns: quantitative and qualitative data that can help a willing and savvy investor make a decision. However, there was little or no data on most of the projects, not even on potential markets or profitability. I said we could do it as a service but governments did not have the funds. I created a small foreign investment directory that I funded with the help of family members and banks. We received the capital we needed, and from that I established other lines of business: the transport line, a paint manufacturing plant, and the construction company. We are also set to launch an affordable office hub space for 25-30 consultants and entrepreneurs in search of a space where creativity can thrive in a corporate setting at a price that creatives can afford. We accomplished all this through our ability to network with existing firms that are key players in their line of businesses. </p><h4>How do you act as a bridge between Nigeria and the international business community to promote investment opportunities?</h4><p>We focused on oil and gas and agriculture, where the byproducts can be used to produce a variety of valuable oils and petrochemicals. For example, we have rubber plantations all over the south, so we detailed how the trees can be converted into rubber, which can be used to make tires and every other kind of rubber-based product that drives manufacturing in other parts of the world and is a big contributor to their GDP. We explain to investors who the off-takers are. With one project, for example, Cameroon was about to buy over USD1 billion of palm kernel from Nigeria just to receive the oil extract. I showed that setting up a factory is cheaper in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world and that we already had direct access to all the raw materials needed.</p><h4>Where would you advise investors to put their money into in Nigeria?</h4><p>I would direct them to agriculture. I wish oil in Nigeria had never been discovered because it ruined our business models for everything. The UAE invested its oil revenues. Nigeria believed the cash cow would never stop delivering, but it has. Even if prices go up slightly in a few years' time, everyone will still be looking for alternative sources of energy. Agriculture is our most untapped and most valuable resource because from north to the south and east to the west there is something we can grow, mass produce, and export, which we are not doing yet. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Simba Group's activities and major achievements?</h4><p>We started almost 30 years ago and have witnessed the economic growth and various changes in the nation's demographics. This 30-year journey has been at times turbulent, at others smooth, but like the rest of the economy we have seen significant growth in the last few years. The country's growth is clearly apparent when traveling along the streets of Abuja, Lagos, and other big cities. Overall, growth has been moderate to good. However, I see a brighter future in the next decade because certain fundamentals that were previously lacking in the country are slowly becoming available. Once the foundation gets stronger, the benefits will begin to show. </p><h4>What projects do you have in the pipeline in transportation and the other sectors you cover?</h4><p>We are distributors of TVS Motors, one of the largest exporters of two and three-wheeler vehicles in the world. Over the last few years, we have invested heavily in further developing our assembly capabilities and ensuring access to affordable service and spare parts across the country. We have also invested in R&amp;D to work with our partners in customizing and developing the vehicles for the local road conditions and market preferences, and simultaneously work toward optimizing efficiencies across the value chain. That begins with local assembly and distribution, but also involves extensive training for riders as well as mechanics across the country. So far, we have trained over 25,000 mechanics, which enables us to deploy our services to every corner of the country, helping our vehicles become the brand of choice. </p><h4>In 2015, you were recognized as one of the leading companies providing services in Nigeria. How has this contributed to your growth story? </h4><p>Our entire philosophy is driven by service; whatever we do, we strive to be the best in terms of service. That is an area we found was lacking in Nigeria to some extent. It might have been a cultural issue, where people had just become used to buying products, not having anywhere to service them, and then going out and buying replacements. Clearly, that is not acceptable and addressing that has helped us to reach the leadership positions we have—not only in the motorcycle and three-wheeler business, but also in the inverter business where we have commanding market leadership. For example, we were the first inverter company to offer customer service through a dedicated call center. Our growth has also been due to the general economy, which was growing rapidly until the recent downturn. People have realized dependency on one commodity is not the way to move forward. These last two years have been times of consolidation and a time to look at which areas we would like to move toward. Agriculture is one; another is renewable energy. We may have actually entered at a time when it was not so popular to be in the renewable space. Now, with the pricing factors of renewables coming down, especially solar, there is a lot of engagement with renewables. </p><h4>What is your ultimate ambition and goal for Simba Group? </h4><p>We do not want to grow for the sake of growth. Topline growth does not excite us as much as being able to come up with something we can get recognition for in terms of being the best. We have always had the slogan that we do not want to be the biggest, but the best. Having said that, we always strive to stay in businesses in which we have a dominant role to play. We would like to have businesses where we at least have 40-50% market share. That is a healthy amount and is achievable—in some businesses we are even at 60%. To remain at a high level of market share is important when we look inward, rather than outward, to see how we can improve ourselves to be able to provide the best to our customers as well as contribute to the sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[from-ground-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Jagal's contribution to developing local content in Nigeria?</h4><p>As a Nigerian company, everything we do has to do with local content. The difference between being a passenger and a local content champion is in providing sustainable capacity that can also be emulated and copied by other organizations in Nigeria. Our contribution is via those who have gone through our training academy and gained skills they subsequently passed on to other companies and employers, i.e. people who used to work for us and projects that we have executed. Nigerian content is an organism that needs to continue to grow and flourish. It needs to transcend the value chain. We do not need to make 100% in Nigeria for Nigeria; we need to create 100% in Nigeria for the rest of the world and export Nigerian capability, capacity, expertise, and technology. This is the future for the country. We set a standard that is world-class because we do not accept those saying that if it is done in Nigeria it is second rate. That is something that we have done, whether it is in our training institute on welding, best practices, the way we plan projects, or our data center, Rack Center, a tier-3 data center that was the first of its kind in West Africa and something we are extremely proud of.</p><h4>How do you act as a bridge between Nigeria and the international investor community?<br></h4><p>Partnerships are based on a win-win situation between two organizations. Companies have to bring value to a partnership, as do their partners. For companies that want to come into Nigeria just to collect their profits and leave, this is not the place for them. For those who see Nigeria as a long-term opportunity and who see the benefit of investing in this country, deploying its vast resources, bringing in technology, and adding value, we offer the counterpart of that. The way we add value is to look at the local environment. We invest with our partners, and that investment is not just financial; it is in people, knowledge, and the ability to improve the ease of doing business here. Nigeria, at times, has a negative reputation because people have a preconceived notion about what is difficult and what is not. Every country has its own culture, and a company just has to understand the way we do business in Nigeria. We try to bring in those opportunities; we do a proper SWOT analysis on the opportunities, threats, challenges, and requirements that need to be deployed to make the partnership successful. Nigeria still has an amazing untapped agriculture, technology, and financial infrastructure, and if companies change the way they look at Nigeria they will see Nigeria adapting to suit their investment.</p><h4>What is the importance for companies like Jagal for the current Nigerian government and the country's diversification?</h4><p>The key benefits are employment, the transfer of skills and technology, and capacity building. The most important thing is sustainable economic policies that deliver long-term jobs and opportunities for growth. Nigeria deserves these opportunities and is able to execute projects that are new, high-end, technology driven, and people driven. It is the right country for economic growth.</p><h4>What would you say to foreign investors looking to do business in Nigeria?</h4><p>They should look at the success stories. They should look at our business and what we have been able to achieve, what we have done in the Rack Center, what we have done in manufacturing, and look at other big conglomerates. In the telecoms sector, there are many positive experiences, transactions, and excellent examples of how Nigeria is a successful story and an opportunity for investors. Whenever an investor has been swindled or experiences fraud, it is typically their fault; one does not blame someone else for their mistakes. We need to communicate government policy better; once harmonized and better communicated, this will improve the business environment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[pulling-out-the-stops]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures has the ministry implemented to tackle the economic downturn and challenges in the sphere of public deficit?</h4><p>The president launched the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) in April 2017 to articulate the administration's vision for the country and set out measures to get the economy onto a path of sustained, diversified, and inclusive growth. We target a growth rate of at least 7% by 2020. We have selected five areas for priority focus: stabilizing the macroeconomic environment, achieving agriculture and food security, ensuring energy sufficiency in power and petroleum products, improving transportation infrastructure, and driving industrialization and manufacturing by focusing on SMEs. With regard to the issue of the public deficit, when we came in as an administration we announced plans to immediately reflate the economy to reverse our deteriorating economic situation. Thus, we increased spending, particularly on capital projects. Achieving this at a time of declining revenues from crude oil meant we had to increase our level of borrowing and subsequently accept higher levels of public deficit. However, we have been careful to keep the deficit within prudent levels. Our fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio is still well within the 3% maximum level allowed under the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Nevertheless, we are concerned by the rising levels of our debt-to-revenue ratios and are addressing this by seeking to raise our revenues.</p><h4>How can Nigeria increase its revenues from other sources?</h4><p>The first thing we are doing in terms of revenue is to make sure we at least maximize income from the oil sector. To this end, we have been engaging with the Niger Delta communities and states, managing to get production back to our goal of 2.2 million bpd. Second, we look at non-oil revenues from various surplus-generating government agencies. One of the measures we introduced was the Presidential Initiative on Continuous Audit (PICA) to identify and cut out wastage in public expenditure. We require such agencies to provide budgets to us, on time, which we closely scrutinize. We are also cleaning up the civil service payroll by linking the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) to human resources systems and extending coverage of IPPIS to all ministries and departments of government. Third, we want to improve efficiencies in revenue collection with customs. Currently, our tax-to-GDP ratio is 6%, well below the average of 16% amongst our peers in Africa. We seek to raise the level of tax collection by widening our tax base, increasing the level of tax compliance, and improving the efficiency of tax collection. One of the recent initiatives we introduced to achieve this is the voluntary assets and income declaration scheme (VAIDS). This is an initiative to encourage voluntary disclosure of previously undisclosed assets and income for the payment of all outstanding tax liabilities with a waiver of any penalties, or sanctions for the prior incorrect declarations. Under this scheme, the Ministry of Finance has estimated that we could raise an additional USD1 billion in revenues. Finally, we intend to expand our manufacturing and agriculture, the solid minerals sectors, and the entertainment industry, including Nollywood, and the music industry. We support such industries through increased expenditure on infrastructure.</p><h4>How can the country unleash the potential of its natural and human resources to build stronger institutional capacity?</h4><p>A strong and efficient public sector is necessary to create the right environment for the private sector to flourish. Accordingly, we are taking steps to strengthen our public institutions and expand their capacity and effectiveness. To this end, we are completing a functional review of all MDAs to link government priorities, ministerial mandates, and individual job descriptions and performance targets. We are also implementing e-government across all government bodies, starting with a pilot scheme in selected MDAs. We want to dramatically increase the volume and variety of goods and services made in Nigeria and are addressing infrastructure and other challenges that impede agriculture and manufacturing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been LCCI's main activities and achievements since its founding?</h4><p>A major activity is public policy advocacy. A conducive business environment is imperative for the profitability, prosperity, and sustainability of a business. This requires quality engagement with the government and its agencies. The chamber, therefore, engages with the government and its agencies on all levels, including the federal, state, and local, to facilitate an enabling environment for investors, whether domestic or foreign. We typically address a whole range of policy issues that affect the private sector, including fiscal, monetary, trade, infrastructure, and institutional. We identify the issues through feedback from our members, who are in business and are able to articulate the challenges of the business environment. LCCI also creates networking platforms for its members and the business community as a whole. Such platforms have resulted in the building of partnerships between domestic and foreign investors in Nigeria. We also undertake capacity building for small businesses. The Nigerian economy is largely made up of SMEs, many of which have capacity shortcomings in managing their business. The failure rate of small businesses in Nigeria is high partly as a result of this factor. Through our capacity-building programs we support these small businesses. LCCI is also a major player in trade promotion, particularly exhibitions. We host the largest exhibition in Nigeria, and the West African sub region—the Lagos International Trade Fair. It is a major trade promotion platform for both domestic and foreign investors. We also organize other specialized exhibitions where we focus on specific sectors.</p><h4>What incentives do you offer members, and what is your strategy to attract new ones?</h4><p>Our main strategy is to ensure the delivery of value. Large companies look up to us to influence government policy. Most often they avoid engaging the government directly. They would rather do so using the platform of a business association like ours. They value our ability to influence government policies in their favor. For small businesses, it is more about seeking more business opportunities. We do this through the various platforms and linkages that we create for them with larger companies or foreign partners. We support the SMEs to build their capacity through training in business management, record keeping, information provision, and funding. We arrange for financial institutions to periodically meet with our SME members and give them discounts for the use of our facilities.</p><h4>How developed is the use of PPPs for big infrastructure projects, and what must be done to increase private- and public-sector engagement ?</h4><p>The country has a huge deficit in infrastructure, and the way to fix this is to attract private sector capital. To do this, we need to promote the concept of PPPs, and the LCCI is a leading advocate of this philosophy. We already have a great partnership in infrastructure between the government and GE to reconstruct and manage major rail lines in the country. At the sub-national level, a great deal of collaboration is taking place in the form of PPPs. For example, the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor in Lagos is a PPP arrangement wherein the private sector provides the buses for this mass transit system. Many PPP initiatives exist in education, health, waste management, and housing. According to the government's Infrastructure Master Plan, the economy needs USD100 billion annually over 30 years to fix the national infrastructure.<br>What will be the impact of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP)? <br>Although the country already had a three-year medium-term expenditure framework as well as annual budgets, the ERGP is a more comprehensive plan that gives a clearer direction on where the government is heading with regard to its economic policy. The targets are realistic and modest, and the plan gives investors comfort about the direction of policy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the transition from private to public sector, and what does your experience bring to NIPC?</h4><p>A wealth of information sits on the public sector side, whereas the intellectual capital needed to exploit that information for commercial benefit lies within the private sector. Therefore, we need greater interface between the public and private sectors to fully unlock Nigeria's potential. As an investment banker, I was selling Nigerian companies for commercial benefit. In my role as Executive Secretary of NIPC, I sell Nigeria for altruistic reasons. The commercial perspective I bring to selling Nigeria is useful because investors first make commercial decisions, not altruistic decisions. Investors would have listened to me as an investment banker because I was a paid adviser. By comparison, as a government official, investors sometimes take the view, especially when it comes to reforms and improvements, that the government is simply saying things that will not necessarily be implemented. My focus now is selling the country as an investment destination. A material difference between the private and public sectors and I have tried to focus on the need to build on the NIPC's constitutional capacity and its ability to meet its mandate. This includes aligning NIPC's strategy based on the government's definition of the priority sectors for investments.</p><h4>What role will NIPC play in the sustainable development of Nigeria?</h4><p>NIPC has a vital role to play in driving Nigeria's economic diversity that is needed for the country's economic sustainability. Depending on oil alone is not sustainable from both an economic and job creation perspective. We need largely labor-intensive jobs, medium-skilled jobs, as well as technical and cerebral jobs for a wide proportion of the population to ensure we are creating skill sets across a broader spectrum of sectors. Part of what we are doing at NIPC is focusing our investment promotion strategy on ensuring we are fishing where the ducks are, that is, where we have the best prospects of attracting investors. It is not NIPC's job to define the areas where the government should invest; however, we play an active role in the government's definition of those sectors. NIPC has four mandates: projecting Nigeria's image as an attractive investment destination; attracting investors to come to Nigeria and invest here, whether they are local or foreign; providing quality after-care to those who have already invested in Nigeria as part our liaison role between governments and investors; and providing the government with guidance on policies, initiatives, and what is required to meet Nigeria's investment and industrialization objectives.</p><h4>What measures are being taken to create a more enabling environment for international investors?</h4><p>There is no better way to establish an enabling environment than having the president of the country take an interest in this. Our president established the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC), which is chaired by the vice president. The object of this council is to remove bottlenecks in doing business and to achieve a demonstrable improvement in Nigeria's doing business rankings. PEBEC has focused on working across ministries and government agencies to improve the conditions for businesses to operate in Nigeria. We hope Nigeria will see a 20-point improvement in the World Bank's doing business ranking by 2018, and ultimately reach the top 100.What message would you send to potential investors?<br>Nigeria is blessed with a wealth of physical resources, such as our minerals and our landmass, which offers great agricultural prospects. Add to this our 183 million people, which translates into considerable wealth. The country is considered by many to be a difficult place to do business, but nowhere in the world is risk-free investment. On a risk-adjusted basis, investors there will realize that Nigeria is incredibly compelling. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you intervened in Nigeria's power sector, and are you investing in the country's northeast? </h4><p>In my first meeting with President Buhari, he specifically said he would like us to support the northern regions of Nigeria, and we have done that. The work there has been difficult. Nigeria, of course, has suffered from the drop in oil prices. Things are just now getting better, but the conversation we need to have with Nigeria is investment in human capital. The percentage of GDP that Nigeria spends on healthcare is less than 1%. Despite the fact that there is so much turbulence in the northern part of the country, not to mention the hit taken from the drop in oil prices, Nigeria has to think ahead by investing in its people and in the things that will allow it to thrive. A rapidly growing, private sector-led economy is what the country has to focus on right now. It cannot rely solely on oil prices going back up. It has to think: what are going to be the sources of growth in the future for Nigeria, in what will surely be a more digitalized economy? And this is true for most of Africa. If you look at the numbers in terms of how successfully African countries have invested in human capital versus other regions, there is a real issue. And so, over this next year, not only in Nigeria but in all of Africa, we are going to focus on accelerating investments in people—in human capital—including health, education, and social protection so that Africa can prepare itself for the next phase in economic development. One of the real questions that we all have is regarding our traditional notions of economic growth, which include agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry, and how many countries in Africa will actually experience that. We must ask ourselves whether we need to consider another kind of path to economic growth focused on SMEs and entrepreneurship as they have in other parts of the world. However, better health and education outcomes will be critical no matter what the global economy looks like. Therefore,  we support the recovery and peace building in the north and hope that as commodity prices stabilize, oil prices come back up and the economy will grow a bit more; however, we must focus on what the drivers of growth in the future will be and on mobilizing domestic revenues for investments in people.</p><h4>What kind of support is the World Bank giving to start-ups and young entrepreneurs? </h4><p>It is difficult for major institutions such as ours to give the relatively small amounts of money that are required for SMEs. That is why we are working with companies like Alibaba in China, which has developed a system where within five seconds it can provide loans to SMEs for up to USD160,000. And it does that solely based on online activity, which for Alibaba is a better measure of credit worthiness than the traditional process called “know your customer" (KYC). We are looking to see if we can utilize some of these methods, these rapid disbursements of capital to SMEs, in Africa. Right now, the answer is not yet, because we do not have enough information on online behavior. Jack Ma, the CEO of Alibaba, recently visited Kenya because it perhaps has the most information on people's online behavior, as 98% of Kenyans do some form of financial transactions online. Within Africa, we have to be much more creative. We are looking at future drivers of growth, and whether they will be more or less traditional. Then we are looking at innovative ways of moving capital quickly and efficiently to people who are going to start promising businesses. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[abdul-monem-al-futaisi-coo-awasr]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Awasr is recognized as having the fastest broadband network in Oman. What strategy has the company followed since inception to reach this milestone?</h4><p>We are the fastest internet provider in Oman because that is what we set out to be. We always had it in our minds, and we knew that for a small company to compete we had to be the best. We started our operation in March 2016 and from the very beginning we had a clear focus on achieving our vision: to lead creativity and innovation to allow our subscribers to leverage the power of the internet. When we started operations, we focused on key delivery elements; to deliver the latest technologies, offer the best quality products, provide a superior level of customer service, and to innovate. These four pillars are the reasons for our success considering that within a year we became innovation leaders in the market. We are also the first company to operate a 100% fiber optic network in Oman, the first to introduce an online ordering system for home connectivity, and the first to introduce 1Gbps speed to the consumer and to offer 10Gbps basic broadband speed for large enterprise. With the latest technologies and the way our network is set up, we are well capable of delivering 100Gbps speed to the market. For now, however, we will begin testing 40Gbps and assess our performance and market demand. Considering our recognition from Ookla recognizing Awasr as the fastest internet provider in Oman and our collaboration with other operators, we can only get better at delivering the fastest network in Oman.</p><h4>How is Awasr working to help achieve the government's Vision 2020?</h4><p>In order for the country to achieve our vision for 2020, Oman needs to undergo a digital transformation and Awasr intends to be at the forefront of that transformation. We have agreed a partnership with the international solutions company SAP. Our project with SAP to deliver the HANA Enterprise Cloud, which will serve companies of all sizes in different sectors, especially SMEs with fully fledged software solutions, customized for their every need. From managing a boutique ship, to running a large shipping port, HANA will deliver the right systems to improve operational efficiency and drive productivity. Our HAHA initiative also caters to the needs of the public sector regardless of the industry. In addition, SAP is helping us to develop and put in place predictive technology for infrastructure in order to maximize productivity and response-effectiveness, which is turning out to be a rewarding initiative, especially considering the value of SAP's business intelligence expertise. With HANA we are capable of helping the government to create a digital cabinet or to start modernizing Oman's infrastructure and services such as water distribution systems, traffic lights, fire prevention, and to help predict problems before they happen by leveraging business intelligence provided by SAP. In this regard, the biggest challenge is creating a local cloud network inside Oman. This will allow us to offer HANA in a way that will be able to access all the necessary information nationally, this will not only maximize productivity but also satisfy the question of maintaining information security. Ultimately, we want our customers to be able to focus on their core business and let us take care delivering first class IT and internet services for them.</p><h4>If a third operator came into the country how would this impact business for Awasr?</h4><p>We have the third Class-1 license for fixed network businesses and any new mobile operator will have a Class-1 license for mobile network. We are complementary and we in fact anticipate that each company will provide services for the other. Meanwhile however, Awasr intends to launch a MVNO, which is a national mobile operation. Because of the advantage of our existing high-quality customer service and network operation centers, we feel we can offer a higher class of mobile service than exists in the market today. We are not standing still waiting for the third mobile operator, but we are open to working with them when (and if) they enter the Oman market.</p><h4>What is the current market penetration of Awasr and what are your plans to reach the 2020 Oman vision in terms of numbers?</h4><p>There are companies that grow on an annual basis but Awasr grows on a daily basis. There is a high demand for our products and services. For the past 10 years demand has been primarily for mobile services, but that market is now saturated. There are 173% more mobile phone lines in than subscribers. However, demand for fast fixed internet services are currently in high demand. Streaming services such as Netflix, Spotify, and Youtube, and gaming platforms like XBOX, PS4 and Steam all require better faster services. These content providers represent the future of entertainment as an industry, and we are the best at delivering the speeds needed to unlock the power and enjoyment of the Internet.  Furthermore, we know that technology can be complex for the normal customer. When we entered the market in 2016, there were already a large number of existing products and services which were complicated for customers to choose from. The TRA reported that a major reason people don't buy internet services is because the packages are too difficult to understand. So we decided to create high-quality and simple product offerings. For internet we have only four different products that are specifically targeted to the needs of customers in Muscat.</p><h4>One of your core values is Agility. What does this mean?</h4><p>Our agility lies in our ability to adapt to the needs of an ever-changing market and we are constantly improving our delivery response time by focusing on efficiency. Moreover, we are smart in the way we implement our services. For example, we were the first to accept order registration through WhatsApp and to implement an online ordering system. Finally, we are caring in the sense that we focus on consumer loyalty by providing first-class services through our 247 in-house customer service center. We are not a large company, we are more like a family, and we have to be quick to adapt and to change, because we cannot fight the big companies head-on.</p><h4>What are Awasr's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>I can say this with certainty: We have just gotten started. We are going to do amazing things. There are multiple services and innovations that we want to introduce to the market. Our focus in 2018 will be on delivering services to government and large enterprise better faster cheaper, introducing a fully functioning HANA Enterprise Cloud to the market as a means to support the digital transformation of Oman. We see ourselves continuing to be the champion of home and business users in Oman and maintaining our leadership as the fastest provider in Oman. Next year we plan to think bigger and launch a national MVNO, as well as deliver smart entertainment services helping people access their favorite TV and content through our superfast network, we will also launch home and corporate security services, and high-speed connectivity solutions for government and large companies. I see the future as very bright for Awasr. I can't wait.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What brand do you seek to create for Ras Al Khaimah, and what are the challenges in creating that brand?</h4><p>We created a brand for Ras Al Khaimah three years ago. In January 2016, we launched a 10-year strategy for tourism in the Emirate and part of that strategy was its repositioning and rebranding. We were able to change the misconceptions of Ras Al Khaimah being only a destination that catered to people seeking the sun, sand, and sea. Ras Al Khaimah has 64km of uninterrupted pristine beaches, fantastic resorts, and is great value for money. However, having done a study on its natural assets, we realized only 10% of the UAE population could recall we have mountains in Ras Al Khaimah; no one remembered the name of the mountain or that it is the tallest peak in the UAE. The focus and repositioning of Ras Al Khaimah's brand involved a great deal of work on the ground to define the unique selling points of the Emirate: its natural assets, the proximity of those natural assets, the mountains, the desert, the sea, and so on. Finding the white space that the other Emirates have not occupied, our natural assets would definitely provide us a stronger ground to play on for us to place Ras Al Khaimah as the future hub of adventure tourism. That involves not only focusing on adventures but also wellness seekers and people who want to connect with culture, heritage, and history. These are the three main pillars that we work with. The beach, desert, and mountains are grouped under adventure. The historical sites go under history, and then with wellness we have fantastic spas here as well as hot springs, which we seek to develop further. Diversity is the name of the game and have been working on diversifying our markets.</p><h4>How do you focus on international tourism in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>Four years ago, Ras Al Khaimah had about half a million visitors and today we are just nudging 1 million. This is a testament of the hard work and efforts we have done to create awareness by giving Ras Al Khaimah its own identity to diversify not only our markets but also our clients. We were extremely reliant on one or two major operators and three markets, namely Germany, the UK, and Russia. I came at a time where all three markets were in decline because of the devaluation of the ruble and euro, and Brexit. This placed a huge risk on the future of Ras Al Khaimah. The diversity that we have worked toward is attracting new markets such as India, Poland, Czech Republic, Scandinavia, and most Eastern European countries. One of our initiatives was to open an office in Russia in 2016. One of Ras Al Khaimah's key advantages is that we are a beach destination offering a five-star product at a four-star price point. For international visitors, Ras Al Khaimah is value for money and affordable, and they are only one hour away from Dubai. Having Dubai just next door is a fantastic advantage for us and we leverage that tremendously.</p><h4>What role does domestic tourism play?</h4><p>Three years ago, 60% of our business was from the domestic market. Through our strategy we are now focused on growing the international market further. The growth in the international market had an impact on the domestic market, though that was a deliberate strategic decision. The rationale behind that is whilst it is great domestic visitors come during weekends, the average length of stay is one or two nights. This does not fully support the GDP growth that we have targeted or the growth of occupancies and visitors that we want to drive. Currently, that 60% figure has fallen to 31% while the growth from the international market has supported our length of stay growth and GDP growth. An international visitor stays for an average of 5.9 nights and spends more throughout the hotels. Still, we continue to focus on the domestic travel; it is important for us, especially during holidays where Ras Al Khaimah has naturally become a getaway. The domestic market decline is because there is less availability of hotel rooms due to the growth of international visitors.</p><h4>What are the major investment opportunities for the tourism sector?</h4><p>The growth in visitors in 2018 is close to 20%, while in 2017 it was 11%. However, hotel room supply is only growing by 3%. Our demand periods and windows of opportunity are limited. For example, the opportunities for growth now are limited to the summer months or the last two weeks of January because the rest of the year we run at an average of 80-85%. Whilst we have about 5,000 rooms in the pipeline, they are not due to open until 2020 or 2021, and there will be phased openings. When we look at 2025, our target is to reach 3 million visitors, which is why we need another 10,000 rooms to cater to that demand. Besides the hotel business, the longest zip line in the world was built in Ras Al Khaimah by a foreign investor from Costa Rica, and we are now looking at proposals for further adventure activities. We will partner to build different adventure parks and opportunities mainly focusing on Jebel Jais at the moment. We want to create a cluster of activities and events there where people can spend a day or two. This will trigger other investments in terms of accommodation or retail. We are investing in building accommodation that will be the first luxury camp in the mountains with about 36 units. There are also great investment opportunities in other tourist attractions. We have identified seven clusters in Ras Al Khaimah's master plan for tourist attractions. Those clusters are presented on different occasions for investors across the globe. We continuously seek investors to build authentic Emirati restaurants so foreigners can enjoy the local food.</p><h4>How does MICE tourism fit in the strategy?</h4><p>We are a 95% leisure destination. However, part of our strategy is to grow the business sector through MICE. The Arabian Hotel Investment Conference (AHIC) is one big example of 2018. Thus far, we have been able to host the German, Austrian, Indian, and British travel associations. This is our appetite to demonstrate our ability to host small to mid-sized events in Ras Al Khaimah. Furthermore, 35% of Ras Al Khaimah's GDP comes from industries and we seek to work together with manufacturing companies on their products launches and conferences to be held in Ras Al Khaimah to support them and build the right infrastructure for such events.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us more about the TAYSEER program and your expectations?</h4><p>The TAYSEER executive committee was formed to improve business performance in the private sector. It was officially launched in November 2016 in line with Saudi Vision 2030. The intent was to increase the competencies of relevant government services and place he Kingdom among the top countries in the world in terms of ease of doing business. The committee was established to pursue four main objectives: increase the efficiency of government services, position Saudi Arabia among the top 20 countries globally for doing business, implement regulations aimed at stimulating the private sector growth, and increase private sector engagement with direct involvement in decision making. Moreover, more than 100 additional reforms are on the list for approval and implementation. The challenges and obstacles facing both local and foreign businessmen and investors will be monitored by SAGIA or other authorities, including the chambers of commerce. These bodies will study and provide recommendations for solutions and submit them to the Saudi Council of Economic and Development Affairs for discussion and approval.</p><h4>How do you envision driving the innovation economy in the Kingdom?</h4><p>Innovation is indispensable to doing business in today's world. Vision 2030 clearly states that innovation and entrepreneurship are two key factors that will foster healthy economic development in the Kingdom. From food trucks to design firms to tech start-ups, young Saudi entrepreneurs are happily realizing the fruits of forming one's own business. Increased focus on e-commerce in the Kingdom also opens the doors for young Saudi techies to create new products aimed at furthering digitization. To ease the transition from idea to marketplace, SAGIA now offers a special entrepreneur's license that makes founding a company deemed “innovative“ far easier than it used to be. A network of incubators and creative hubs also exists to nurture innovative entrepreneurs. There is also a loan program aimed at funding start-ups and SMEs that is fully operational.</p><h4>One of the objectives of Vision 2030 is to increase FDI. How does this affect the Saudi economy?</h4><p>Vision 2030 focuses on creating promising opportunities for investment and development based on investment advantages the Kingdom offers and the competitiveness reflected by the geographic and strategic dimensions of the economy. The economic objectives include raising FDI to 5.7% of GDP and private sector contribution from 40% to 65% of GDP. Vision 2030 is coming to fruition and has succeeded in placing the Kingdom among the top 10 countries worldwide in terms of the business environment, as indicated by the World Bank report on the protection of minority investors. This came as part of the reforms adopted by the government in accordance with the plans and objectives of Vision 2030 to make the Kingdom a unique global model across all levels. The most important thing that distinguishes Vision 2030 is that it has given the local and foreign private sector special importance as a key partner in accomplishing its objectives. Saudi Arabia has allocated billions of dollars to the private sector for its development in accordance with Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program 2020. The most important program is the Public Investment Fund (PIF) program, which is the main supporter of investment internally and externally and serves as the engine for diversifying the Kingdom's economy. The Kingdom's vision of privatizing programs is a top priority. The Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques has begun to privatize 10 vital and promising sectors, including industry and mineral resources, labor and social development, housing, education, municipal and rural affairs, telecommunications and information technology, and finally Hajj and Umrah.</p><h4>What is the impact of your partnership with the General Authority for Tourism and National Heritage on the national economy?</h4><p>The partnership between SAGIA and the General Authority for Tourism and National Heritage has contributed to supporting the efforts to attract investment in various aspects of tourism, including tourism itself, archaeology and entertainment. A joint team was formed to support investment opportunities and provide job opportunities. SAGIA is a key partner in the national economy and focuses on investment. Investment opportunities in the tourism sector are meant to exert a multiplier effect on high economic returns, local development in less developed regions, and the production of real and available jobs for citizens of different ages and educational levels.</p><h4>SAGIA participated in the Kingdom's delegation at the Davos Forum. What was the message to the foreign business sector?</h4><p>The Kingdom's commitment to fighting corruption creates a transparent and fair investment environment. We are also dedicated to reforming the government's licensing system to make investors feel more welcome in Saudi Arabia and emphasize that the environment is part of a detailed legal structure that governs it all. SAGIA also seeks to stimulate the private sector and SMEs. The government has installed an infrastructure program to achieve the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030. The regulatory environment has been modified significantly and new laws have been introduced that governs bankruptcy, mortgage and franchising, facilitating investment by reducing administrative work and combating corruption.</p><h4>What was the impact of the recent visit of the SAGIA delegation to the US and UK? </h4><p>In order to attract more FDI, we granted 35 investment licenses during our visits to the US and the UK. 25 of the licenses went to major American companies such as Apple and Amazon, while the remaining 10 went to British companies, including DMG Events LLC and Ethos Energy Arabia Limited. These licenses reflect SAGIA's interest in achieving economic diversification, attracting more foreign investment to the Kingdom, strengthening public-private partnerships, and overcoming obstacles facing investors in cooperation with the relevant government agencies to develop the licensing mechanism and facilitate business in the Kingdom.</p><h4>How is SAGIA working on its strategies to implement reforms, advance its services, and move the Kingdom up in global rankings?</h4><p>SAGIA seeks to achieve economic diversification, attract more FDI, and strengthen the partnership between the public and private sectors. As a necessary tool to achieve this strategy, the new 100% ownership licenses that allow foreign investors to practice inside the Kingdom will help to transform the economy into a more robust and sustainable one. In cooperation with relevant government entities, SAGIA also aims to improve the business environment and facilitate business processes in the Kingdom by simplifying the licensing procedures through the TAYSEER committee. TAYSEER has recognized 10 reform committees, one for each “Doing Business“ indicator. Each committee has proposed actions with deadlines that are monitored through weekly meetings. A monthly meeting chaired by the Minister of Commerce and Investments was held to follow up on the progress. According to World Bank rankings, Saudi Arabia has risen from 63rd to 10th place globally in terms of Protecting Minority Investors and has the second-highest GDP per capita among the G20 countries. The reform process is ongoing and is tackling all aspects of doing business. As the reforms take hold and more international investors begin to witness the changes in the business environment, I fully expect our ranking in Ease of Doing Business to thrive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Net sales growth of 6% in-country]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[george-rbeiz-general-manager-middle-east-north-africa-diageo]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has Lebanon and the MENA region contributed to Diageo's global growth in 2017?</h4><p>Globally Diageo increased its net sales by 1.7% in its December 2017 results, but Lebanon exceeded this by growing its net sales 6%. What is important for us here is not so much growing our sales to market, but growing our in-market depletion and brand performance. In Lebanon, Lebanon is a scotch market and we are the leaders in market share when it comes to scotch, which is the biggest spirit category and second only to beer, and we grew our share from 63 to 64%, which is huge from an industry perspective. In addition, our market share for vodka is around 8%. Our only beer product is Corona and it is the fastest-growing beer brand in the country, even though the market share for imported beer has not been as high as for local beers to date.</p><h4>Do you see growth for all of your segments throughout in 2018?</h4><p>Yes. The total whiskey market dropped by 1% in 2017 compared to 2016, but Diageo 's whiskey business grew by 6%. The vodka market in Lebanon grew by 1%, versus 10% for Diageo's. That's a clear confirmation we are outperforming the market. For both Arak and Champagne experienced respective drop of 9% and 18% . Main drivers for such a decline are visitors choosing to buy cheaper alternatives instead of champagne. Lebanon's consumption for champagne used to be much higher and this was mainly due to the type of tourists and visitors coming on and off season. We have lost a lot of these visitors. Nevertheless, sparkling wine grew by 18%, rum grew by 6%, tequila grew by 17%, and gin, from a low base, grew by 35%.</p><h4>What steps should the government take in order to improve the hospitality sector's performance?</h4><p>What we need from the government is stability and good educated approach to legislation and reforms, through this we feel our industry is supported. Approximately six months ago, the government was trying to introduce a new excise duty as high as 35%, and this would have really caused serious damages to the industry. Sudden changes to legislations and tax models can have drastic impact on the economy, industry performance and system if the industry expertise is not brought to the table. By expertise I meant best practices and capabilities built throughout wide global networks and markets. As an industry we stand as key contributors to tourism and the economy, and the way we showcase Lebanon to visitors matters. Tourists come here for food, drinks, and nightlife. But we need them to feel safe. On a more professional dimension we need a much closer focus from the government on designing strategies and solutions to stop parallel imports and counterfeiting (illicit).  Both issues have grown so much to promote unfair competition, pricing confusion and put extreme pressures on brand owners and on our intellectual property protection agenda. In many cases we design market specific solutions that cost lot of money to differentiate our own products: for example a strip or ribbon on most of our core brands. We collaborate very closely with the authorities  to stop parallel trading because we want stability and a level playing field in the pricing of alcohol. We also want to bring trust back to our industry system and be seen as key contributors to the economy. Lebanon is unique amongst its neighboring Middle Eastern markets being the only country where alcohol advertising and branding are permitted. This create huge room to innovate and boldly execute activations and build brands and markets to ladder up the whole industry. What we create and innovate here gets replicated in other places like Dubai and we want the authorities to be aware of and support this. We work closely with the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Economy and Trade and we want the legislation to be favorable to our industry and operating environment, instead of suggesting adverse reforms and tax changes that are not based on proper econometrics and data and this is part of our role as a business partner. Lebanon's tourism doesn't include arts and museums and lots of sightseeing but more of food, nightlife, partying, beach and skiing. Providing good service, ambiance, music, and serving good beverage alcohol products are essential parts of this package. Lebanon will not be tourists' preferred destination without those components while the hospitality sector remains a main driver for tourism and the economy.</p><h4>What are Diageo's specific business objectives in Lebanon for 2018?</h4><p>We want to keep on recruiting and retaining good talent in Lebanon and then coach, build, and grow them. We offer an early-career program for fresh graduates to join the company and move up the career ladder and become managers within few years and potentially join a Diageo office in the global network. Diageo Lebanon/MENA region has become a talent hub and this is why we have based our MENA office in Lebanon. We want to grow talent here and have them work in Europe, America, and all over the world. We believe in local talents and capabilities and our youths are smart, energetic, passionate, and self-driven. Another objective is to keep growing our brands. We are one of the few companies in our industry that produces our brands TV commercials from scratch locally. This is a big investment and it creates a lot of jobs. Our Lebanese ad won at Cannes five years ago, and this has led Diageo to replicate what we do here in other places. We think globally but act locally in Lebanon. It is key to our success to keep talking to the Lebanese community locally. We are proud to have been present in Lebanon for the last 20 years, and we want to keep growing this partnership with the country. Our third and most important objective for 2018 stems out of Diageo's purpose and existence and is to promote responsible drinking and position alcohol as part of a balanced lifestyle in Lebanon. We want alcohol to be a positive tool for celebrating, not a harm to the community and we want people to drink better not more.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which economic sectors in Umm Al Quwain have the greatest potential for growth in the coming years?</h4><p>In terms of its natural geography, Umm Al Quwain has a distinct port and many natural islands. Its deserts offer some potential for tourism, as we have seen in other Emirates. We are also expecting there to be a lot of urban development work in the coming years, with transport infrastructure expecting a boost in particular. We expect this to be followed by the retail sector, which is complemented by the port of Umm Al Quwain and proximity to the northern Emirates.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of investing in Umm Al Quwain compared to other Emirates?</h4><p>In general, Umm Al Quwain is not too different from the other Emirates in terms of the privileges it offers investors and its legal procedures. However, it is witnessing remarkable development at the moment and offers many encouraging opportunities for investment, especially in the land development field for industrial sites, commercial complexes, land leasing, and delivery of basic services at affordable prices. Umm Al Quwain has a seafront and a good commercial port that brings competitive advantages to investing in the Emirate. There is great potential for businesses that meet the needs of the Emirate, especially in the fields of information technology, education, and expertise related to the construction sector, in particular.</p><h4>How has FDI from the US developed over the past few years?</h4><p>We in the Emirate welcome these investments, particularly FDI related to technology, which has developed remarkably over the past few years. There are already some joint ventures in the Emirate with American companies, as well as in the free zone, and we hope that economic development in the Emirate will lead to further contributions from US investors, especially in construction and software development. The chamber is ready to welcome US investments in the Emirate and provide advice and assistance in this field.</p><h4>What role do technology and e-services play for the Chamber of Commerce and Industry?</h4><p>In recent years and in accordance with the strategies and directions of the UAE and the government of Umm Al Quwain, the chamber has started to develop electronic services by building a website for the chamber and the provision of services in certification of origin for exports, as well as the implementation of systems and programs related to registration. We have also installed an advanced accounting program for the chamber.</p><h4>In what way can the private and public sector collaborate to further enhance the economic development of the Emirate?</h4><p>From the beginning, the UAE's strategy has been based on full cooperation between the public and private sectors. One depends on the other, and the state has benefited economically from this cooperation. This is particularly reflected in the investment sector, and the government intends to further encourage the private sector, especially through youth projects. Every day we see remarkable developments in every aspect of the Emirate, and we will continue to develop ourselves as part of the UAE. The UAE must strengthen its presence in the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The free zone has been targeting industrial businesses as it attempts to forge its place in the UAE market, which is already home to over 40 special economic zones. What has attracted businesses to Umm Al Quwain?</h4><p>Our success stems from our promise of easy-access, one-on-one interactions with investors, whom we see as our partners and help set up their business every step of the way. Since our inception, our modus operandi has been to facilitate quick company setup through minimal documentation and procedures for our partners, without compromising on compliance. Once word spread about our investor-friendly system, the numbers picked up, and we developed our services ever further. Micro-businesses and freelancers have also come to us in good numbers because of Umm Al Quwain's reasonable cost of living and solid business opportunities.</p><h4>How is the free trade zone developing its physical and digital infrastructure?</h4><p>Warehouses of various sizes are readily available to clients in the existing free zone area. In our 2sqkm area, we want to open our doors to clean industries such as renewable energy, IT, call centers, back offices, R&amp;D centers, and so forth. On the amenities front, our clients will be backed by residential complexes, labor accommodation, a hospital, school, shopping centers, an exhibition and convention center, and a hotel. These facilities can satisfy businesses' everyday requirements and also mitigate travel time and expenditure. The IT policies in the free zone have been implemented with a particular focus on data security. In addition to having installed security devices and peripherals according to UAE standards, we have also put in place a centralized ERP/CRM system, which streamlines activities like sales entry and lead generation. </p><h4>In 2015, the free zone welcomed 850 new companies. From which sectors did the majority of this demand come?</h4><p>In keeping with the UAE decreasing its reliance on the oil and gas sector, we have welcomed manufacturing industries, IT companies, and specialized consultancies. FMCGs, foodstuff-related companies, gems, precious metals, jewelry, and automotive spare parts sellers also constitute a large portion of the investment portfolio chart. In the wake of the UAE's FDI boom in 2012, investors from the Asian subcontinent, the UK, France, and many other countries established business hubs in the UAQ FTZ. </p><h4>A micro-business license is available for those without large start-up capital or a physical presence in the UAE. How will this develop the Emirate's economy?</h4><p>Micro-businesses are essentially start-ups driven by people who are ambitious, but usually new to the UAE. It provides employment opportunities to individuals who may not profile well or want to work for large corporations. Through servicing other medium and large businesses in terms of IT or accounting, for example, these businesses can contribute to the local economy. We have observed that such businesses are customer-centric and tend to customize their products and services better than large companies. Micro-businesses are the stepping-stones for SMEs, and in a small Emirate like UAQ, can find their footing quickly and adapt effectively to economic climate changes, thereby adding strength to UAQ's current sustainable growth. </p><h4>How do you assess the free zone as an enabler for the rest of the Emirate's economy?</h4><p>We want to keep stride with the UAE's vision of sustainable economic development. By stimulating more non-oil exporting businesses, pulling in more FDI, and encouraging more ancillary industries, the UAQ FTZ is making a positive impact on the country's economy. The free zone has also been a great impetus for industrial diversification, as many innovative verticals like 3D printing and big data analysis have been established here. We wish to continue on this path. With the advent of the Dubai Expo 2020 and other ambitious events in the region, we look forward to opening our doors to many more businesses—large, small, and micro. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where is the demand coming from for healthcare service providers in the northern Emirates?</h4><p>In the Northern Emirates, there is a mix of mid- to lower-segment insured and self-pay groups as well as the Emirati population. The Amina Hospital in Ajman, which is a part of Anglo Arabian Healthcare, caters to the mid and upper segments of the population. The Northern Emirates healthcare-seeking population is price sensitive but appreciates good quality of care. The growing opportunities and infrastructure in the Northern Emirates is spurring growth and demand for good healthcare facilities.</p><h4>How do you manage the balance between healthcare provision and maintaining affordable, or just-below-the-premium-bracket, pricing?</h4><p>It is a myth that good quality of healthcare comes at a higher cost. It is all about efficiency and managing the resources optimally. We are continually adopting innovative clinical and information technologies to bring the highest level of care to our customers.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Amina in terms of the positioning within the market?</h4><p>We believe the Northern Emirates is an excellent market and Ajman has lots of potential. The rulers have a great vision; correspondingly, the growth in infrastructure is astounding. More and more people have been moving to Ajman over the last few years. At Amina Hospital, Ajman, we are striving to bring the highest quality of care. Most of our doctors are Western trained and have experience of working at some of the premier institutions. Amina Hospital will be the trendsetter in the Northern Emirates and will become the yardstick for comparison in the near future. We are creating a service culture at Amina Hospital that will enhance patient care by providing a personal touch to the service rendered. Amina Hospital is making rapid strides in becoming the most trusted healthcare provider in the Northern Emirates. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Legacy Worth Imparting]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-legacy-worth-imparting]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the latest developments at the Ajman site?</h4><p>We started in Ajman with the Gulf Medical University (GMU) in 1998, which will soon be transformed into a full-fledged university with engineering, management, and architecture programs. From a student capacity of 2,000, the university's student capacity will soon reach 4,000. Our student body includes over 75 nationalities, and our faculty members are from over 25 countries. We have patients coming from 175 countries. We are also building three hospitals within the campus. One is a teaching hospital with about 550 beds, which will be the largest private academic hospital in the country. We are building a dental hospital with 60 chairs for the dental college of GMU, not to mention a state-of-the-art rehabilitation center that will be one of the best in the region. Our focus is mainly on sports medicine and neurology. We are also trying to get FIFA approval for the rehab center. The dental and rehab hospitals should be ready by September 2017, the main hospital should be ready by January 2018. All of these hospitals are related to the university and will provide healthcare services in addition to teaching and training the students. We also have hospitals in Sharjah, Dubai, Fujairah, and India. We will also soon open new hospitals in Oman and Ghana. Our dream is to have global presence. </p><h4>What role do partnerships play in the growth of Thumbay?</h4><p>Our agreement signed with Ethiopian Airlines is part of the medical tourism project. Our hospitals have dedicated beds for medical tourism. We have representative offices in about 40 countries in Africa to bring in patients. Thumbay Hospital Ajman has 50 beds reserved for medical tourists. The dream is to have over 1,000 patients per day at our hospitals through medical tourism. This will take about five or six years, but we will make it happen. </p><h4>How would you describe the healthcare framework in the UAE?</h4><p>According to the statistics from the Ministry of Health, the private sector represents around 62% of the healthcare industry in the country. In the UAE, there are three authorities for healthcare. The Ministry of Health is related to the Northern Emirates, Dubai has the Dubai Health Authority, and in Abu Dhabi there is the Abu Dhabi Health Authority (SEHA). All three encourage the private sector to participate in the development of the services. We are the only company that provides the whole range of healthcare, from education to research.</p><h4>How do you incorporate innovative methods and systems in all of your business lines?</h4><p>Of the many things we have done in the past, no one has done anything similar in the country. No one has set up a teaching hospital or a private medical university. We have held conferences with many leading institutions around the world such as the Howard Medical School, Johns Hopkins, the Mayo Clinic, Hertfordshire, the NHS in England, the University of Budapest, Lublin University in Poland, Cairo University, Tokyo University, KPG in Malaysia, the National University in Singapore, and Bocconi University in Italy, among others. We are well connected and have built these relationships over the past 20 years. </p><h4>What are the main factors needed to succeed as an investor in the Middle East?</h4><p>The UAE is safe, and the government is encouraging businesses to come from all over the world. This kind of support cannot be found anywhere else in the world. Our dream is to replicate our business model in other countries or continents, such as Africa. We are thinking of launching a project in Ghana to expand upon our operations in Nigeria, Cameroon, Tanzania, and Kenya. </p><h4>What legacy would you like to leave?</h4><p>One is to have a global presence. The other is to have 30,000-40,000 people working for the company. This is a type of business that will continue to contribute to people's lives for generations.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Phase I of Al Zorah Development was completed toward the end of 2016. What was included during this phase, and what is in store for Phase II?</h4><p>Phase I covered preparatory infrastructure work: roads, bridges, landscaping, utilities, irrigation, street lighting, and the sewage network. It also included luxury projects such as the golf course, which has been operational since December 2015. We will open the first resort, the Oberoi Al Zorah, in March 2017, which has 113 rooms, suites, and villas. In the Pavilion building we have opened three restaurants and are looking to complete the first golf course villas during the second phase of construction. We have also completed the construction of four marinas, the first of which started operations in April 2017. The first batch of apartments and villas were made available to their owners in May 2017. The majority of these villas have been sold and the second batch will be released in 2018. These apartments and villas attract a certain kind of residential customer who lives and works in the UAE and plans to make this their home. There is no speculation, as owners are end-users.</p><h4>What distinguishes Al Zorah's business structure in terms of facilitating development and bringing in international expertise?</h4><p>Al Zorah is structured as a free zone where buyers can get title deeds in their names. Another aspect that buyers find attractive is the multifaceted nature of Al Zorah, where residents may enjoy the golf course, the Oberoi resort, and the marina. We are also hosting activities and events starting at the end of summer to attract international clients. Furthermore, we are selling 5.4 million sqm of land in Al Zorah, not only the units, but so that buyers can become landowners and develop their own businesses. So far, we have over 35 investors who have bought land in Al Zorah, the most recent of which is a wellness center in the middle of the golf course, due to begin construction in the second quarter of 2017. Now that Phase I is finished, we are encouraging landowners to begin their developments.</p><h4>What are some of the eco-friendly features of the Al Zorah project?</h4><p>There are 2 million sqm of mangroves, canals, and water, as well as 1.6km of coastline, with a 50m wide beach. We completed the landscaping aspect of the development prior to construction to establish the greenery and create a "wow factor" for guests and customers. Geographically, we are separated by the creek, which gives it a unique sense of being a city within a city. We also have over 12km of walkways that lead pedestrians, cyclists, or joggers to the marina, the beach, and back to the villas. This encourages and supports an active and healthy lifestyle among investors and residents.</p><h4>How is development coming along for the LUX* Al Zorah hotel?</h4><p>We have finished the enabling work and tendered construction in 1Q2017. As the full design is already complete, we are predicting speedy construction that is set to take no more than 18 months. The hotel will offer 192 keys and consists of six beachside resorts, two of which have already begun and two more are currently attracting investors. Both of our current investors bring in international expertise for their operations in the Indian Ocean on islands like the Maldives and Mauritius, which is appropriate since the LUX* Al Zorah will be a state-of-the-art beachside resort. We are excited about getting underway with this project. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key sectors in which the free zone would like to see more investment?</h4><p>We are not necessarily trying to focus on one area, but the way our infrastructure is developing means that the Emirates are looking for more tourism, healthcare, education, and so on. We all have the same mindset: anyone who wants to come and invest in the Emirates is welcome to do so. Through the cabinet and the Ministry of Economy, the UAE federal government has seven priorities, which include innovation and space, and is a good mandate to have. But at the same time, most governments in the Emirates are focusing on attracting any kind of FDI. These are based on their ease of doing business, infrastructure, and availability. For example, when Ajman is discussing strengthening our healthcare offering, we are thinking about developing more labs. The competition is high, which means it is crucial to have the necessary infrastructure to facilitate and accommodate FDI.</p><h4>From where are you looking to attract industry?</h4><p>There is no doubt that our FDI profile has changed over the years. The typical clientele has changed due to political adjustment in the region. That is why the Emirates are reorienting themselves to other markets. We are particularly focused on the CIS countries like Ukraine and Azerbaijan, but smaller countries not well known in this region are also a good target for us. Within the Emirate, we have over 200 nationalities, including players from the UK, India, and the Far East. They are the players that will be the core business and the mediators for this growth, especially Indian companies because, after the visits of Sheikh Mohammed, the quality of business with India should rise. I was feeling optimistic about Africa over the last three to five years, though the return has yet to be strong. </p><h4>What are you doing to make your free zone look more attractive than other Emirati options?</h4><p>Infrastructure and legislation are both pivotal. The third thing is market availability. Sometimes it is not the price or the quality of service, but availability in the market. We are trying to create a market that can be successful in this region. We are expecting some refineries to come, and this will attract other related businesses. People always go after pricing and facilities, but the availability of business opportunities is very important too. I agree with the general consensus that we need to move away from over-reliance on the oil and gas industry and work to diversify the economic base. The infrastructure we have in place supports this. Different Emirates have different niches; for example, many companies went to Ras Al Khaimah because there was a lot of real estate activity there that has now developed into a growing market for schools. Likewise, people go to Dubai because of the potential for trade. We therefore have to try and differentiate our offering. We are examining what our strengths are, and which businesses would be attracted to our Emirate. We want to encourage those with long-term plans and good intentions to come. One sector we are emphasizing is food processing. For this free zone, or any for that matter, it needs to go the extra mile. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the DED-Ajman?</h4><p>
	The role that DED-Ajman plays has been outlined in detail in the Emirate's strategic objectives for 2017-2021. Our work is based on these priorities and falls in line with the UAE's federal vision. Our efforts are highlighted in our continuing move to work closely with other Emirates in order to provide potential and existing investors with a wide array of premium options, which includes lucrative benefits and advantages to be gained from investing in the UAE. DED-Ajman further consolidates these options with the commitment to deliver on these services promised to investors. We are also tasked with increasing the happiness index of these investors, a move that falls in line with the UAE government's overall happiness index initiative. In order to do so, we carefully study and analyze key reports published by notable organizations like the World Bank, taking their recommendations into account and using them as a baseline in our efforts to improve our services, transactions, and processes. The Ease of Doing Business index is also a major area of focus for us as we are always trying to improve the investor experience here. We are also working to enhance consumer rights for residents, which includes dispute resolution. Part of our role is to educate and hold workshops, and we are also tasked with preventing the promulgation of fraudulent goods into the market; therefore, we monitor and conduct inspections to stop the proliferation of counterfeit and pirated goods from entering Ajman.
</p><h4>What is the predominant business activity in Ajman, and how will this change in the coming years?<br>
</h4><p>
	One of the key sectors is the Emirate's industrial sector, particularly its SME industrial segment. Larger industries present in the country today are more suitable to operate across large emirates like Dubai, and as an alternative, Ajman caters to and remains highly suitable for the smaller SME-style industries, alongside green sectors to further reduce environmental impact. This complements our vision to make Ajman more environmentally friendly and sustainable. Amidst these preferences for SME-based investments, Ajman is still looking to attract more businesses that can add value to our economy. We are especially interested in bringing in businesses that can build an economy based on knowledge rather than labor intensive activities.
</p><h4>How are DED-Ajman's priorities split between developing local talent and bringing in international business?</h4><p>
	DED-Ajman's workforce is a good mix of different nationalities that work closely in the move to better understand the views of non-Emiratis. We try to make non-locals feel like they are residents of the UAE and feel welcome. We train our customer service representatives to provide foreigners with quality service both in terms of information and a customer-friendly interaction. The environment in the UAE and the mix of nationalities you find here means that key departments such as the Department of Economic Development need to create a harmonious culture that incorporates Emirati with foreign values. Ultimately, this means making life more comfortable and raising the ease of doing business, especially compared to other markets where a lack of a cultural mélange makes business more difficult for foreign investors.
</p><h4>
	Other than FDI from India and China, are there any other markets that are particularly important for Ajman?
</h4><p>
	Ajman has an excellent, diverse mix of investors, many of whom come from South or East Asia. We also have a large pool of Arab investors from the GCC and other countries in the Middle East, along with investors from Central Asia. One advantage we have is that life in Ajman is easier than in Dubai and other big cities. Ajman is ranked immediately after Dubai in the World Bank's ease of doing business ratings, which reaffirms our belief that Ajman is on the right path. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[1st Smart City in Saudi Arabia]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-alaa-nassif-ceo-royal-commission-yanbu-jazan]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What changes has the Royal Commission at Yanbu seen over the past year?</h4><p>We launched Yanbu as the first smart city in Saudi Arabia and in the process have received many awards, including first prize for the application with our partner Huawei and emerging number one amongst 370 global cities in the Smart City Expo World Congress projects 2017. We are both able to increase the appeal for Yanbu as a city and also use some of these smart applications as a source of revenue. Around 300 industrial entities are now connected to our smart city. Yanbu is a vibrant and growing city, with a number of projects being carried out in community areas. This smart city project aims to improve citizens' quality of life via deploying a new fiber network, building a smart lighting control system, improving overall mobility, creating a big data platform, and developing an Integrated Communication Platform (ICP).</p><h4>How is the importance of downstream segments evolving?</h4><p>Yanbu still has the third-largest refining capacity in the world, and as soon as our new refining organizations are commissioned, we will be number one. Other downstream segments, such as the rubber industry, are also developing at a rapid pace in Yanbu. We have two new projects for manufacturing units that will be fully operational by the end of 2018. We are working on the site to prepare for the renewable energy shift, first solar and subsequently wind. Our competitive advantage in this area is that we will not only produce our renewable energy locally, but also produce the cells needed for this onsite. In addition, we conducted a successful project in industrial waste recycling and now have several plants that produce reused oil and lubricants and are exporting them worldwide. All of our water is reused, either in different industrial uses or for our landscape and irrigation needs; we do not have any wastage.</p><h4>What are you doing to support SMEs?</h4><p>We have a number of projects to support SMEs, some independently and others together with the Saudi Industrial Development Fund. The major issue for industrial SMEs is the high CAPEX in this sector. We, therefore, provide ready buildings that SMEs can lease and we support them by training their staff. In this way, they can commission and produce within three months, and it minimizes the time for SMEs to break even. We have gathered all governmental offices in a one-stop shop called a Business Center, where we help investors prepare everything they need in terms of certification and paperwork in one place. All procedures can be completed electronically to minimize time and cost. The business center started operations in March 2018.</p><h4>How do the goals of your educational institutions align with Vision 2030?</h4><p>The great thing about our colleges and institutes is that they are all market based. One way to do so is through consulting industrial committees. They evaluate our curriculum to determine if the materials are still relevant and if there are new subjects that should receive more attention. Furthermore, our entire program is internationally accredited and we partner with some of the world's best universities to introduce new programs such as insurance specialties. Some of our subjects, such as our supply chain specialty, are unique in the GCC. In addition, we provide certificates and training for those who are more vocationally inclined. In 2017, 70% of Yanbu Industrial College and Yanbu University College graduates were able to find a job within six months, an impressive figure by international and local standards. Our first batch of female graduates will also enter the labor market in 2019. On an annual basis, 50-70% of the students who join the international competition in science, mathematics, chemistry, and biology are from our schools in Yanbu Industrial City. In mathematics, we achieved a gold medal standard, the first time for Saudi Arabia. In 2018, two of our students received scholarships to MIT and Harvard.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[accessing-insurance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What milestones has AFNIC reached over the past year?</h4><p>Our company started in 1976, and the government of Fujairah owns 85%, of which 15% is owned by the royal family of Fujairah, while the rest is public shareholding. In 2016 we did more than AED200 million in business; our net profits were more than AED18 million, with our total assets grossing more than AED580 million. Also, we were rated B-AA-1 by Moody's. At the moment, around 50% of our business comes from Fujairah, and the remaining 50% is mostly from Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and the other Emirates.<br>Can you elaborate on AFNIC's ATM concept, and how that is changing the way you approach the market?<br>The Insurance ATM started seven years ago. When the idea was initially suggested, the ingenuity of the concept was immediately recognized. For this, management created an in-house team to develop the idea and run the project, making us the first provider of insurance ATMs in the world. Today, we have around 10 ATMs that are installed in various ENOC and EPPCO petrol stations in Dubai. It is an automated machine where quick transactions can be performed within five minutes. The ATMs operate from 8am until 10pm, six days a week, and are serviced by an attendant who can offer assistance to clients.</p><h4>Which insurance lines are performing better under current market conditions?</h4><p>Due to market competition in the UAE, we are concentrating on personal retail products such as motor, medical and life, world-wide personal accident, and home insurance, which are doing well. Motor insurance comprises around 50% of our portfolio, and other significant pieces of our portfolio include life, medical, property, and engineering-product insurance. We do all these types of insurance as well as aviation, hull, and all kinds of general insurance.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges in the insurance industry at the moment, and how does AFNIC stand out among the competition?</h4><p>The biggest challenge in the UAE market is tough competition. There are around 60 insurance companies in this market, and in addition to that there are around 150 brokers, which means there is stiff competition because all the insurance companies are competing to increase market share. This creates the second problem of the low price environment, which is pushing premium prices further down.</p><h4>What market developments are you expecting in the medium term?</h4><p>Due to the intervention of the UAE Insurance Authority to make sure that motor and medical insurance was being correctly priced, we have seen more stability and greater market potential.<br>What are your expectations for the year ahead? <br>We are expecting to increase premium volumes by 10-15% in 2017, and we will be deploying more ATMs. We will also be launching two retail products, which are currently undergoing approval by the Insurance Authority. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are your priorities split between domestic development and international outreach?</h4><p>Domestically, we are promoting Fujairah. In terms of the local economy, we are supporting businesses, most specifically SMEs. We have already opened our SME facilities within Fujairah Chamber of Commerce and Industry. We are also trying to impart knowledge and encourage young people to engage with business at an early age, and often we take about 25-30 people to international exhibitions, such as the Canton Fair in China. This allows them to understand available opportunities, gain networking experience on the excursions, and generally feel inspired to establish their own business when they return home. We are always connecting our local investors with foreign investors through conferences and meetings to develop and improve their own businesses. With regards to international outreach, we are welcoming a lot of delegations from all around the world, and most recently, we have been active in the Latin American communities and have received many delegations. We hold meetings and discuss the opportunities between the UAE, Fujairah, and Latin America, as we believe there are many opportunities for all parties. Many countries are becoming more open to international trade and want to distribute their products beyond their local markets. These countries are therefore looking for local agencies here in the UAE, and we are providing that bridge. We invited ambassadors to these meetings and made it clear that Fujairah Chamber of Commerce and Industry can act as an interlocutor, like we have done for parties from South Africa and the Netherlands. There are frequent meetings of this nature, and our door is always open to foreign investment. Fujairah offers a unique strategic location, and the facilities here in are convenient for the investor as we have an oil and petrochemical free zone; we have a seaport with excellent capabilities and location, an airport, and additional free zones, all of which provide competitive advantages for investors. We have also become heavily involved in the food security project, and it is one of the largest projects here.</p><h4>How is Fujairah diversifying its base and strengthening the wider economy, and where do you see opportunity for growth? </h4><p>In Fujairah, we have a burgeoning natural resource industry, which is very important as Fujairah is surrounded by mineral-rich mountains, and we have an establishment for mineral resources in Fujairah. In the oil industry, refining and oil storage facilities are important industries for the Emirate. This sector is inclusive of both the public and private sectors. Fujairah also has great promise for developing a tourism industry.</p><h4>What are the key attractions for foreign investment in Fujairah? </h4><p>Fujairah is home to different free zones that offer different advantages, and foreign investors are free to choose the offering that best suits their ambitions. This is an attractive prospect for investors, because it means that the infrastructure needed to establish a company or an operation already exists and the overhead cost is lower than other Emirates. These overheads also extend to the staff accommodation and equate to greater operational profits compared to other Emirates where the overheads are not as low. Fujairah offers the same strategic location and the full support of His Highness in the provision of international standard facilities and support. Investors are always welcome here in Fujairah, and we work hand in hand with the investor to make it easy for them. Investors sometimes need certain things, and we will do whatever is required to help them do business here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-crest-of-the-curve]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a short history of Fujairah Oil Terminals?</h4><p>Due to its proximity to oil-producing states and markets via the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean, Fujairah has become a strategic location and natural hub for the industry. During the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, a lot of vessels were anchored in front of Fujairah as they waited to get into the Gulf. However, the insurance premium was cheaper in front of Fujairah than going further into the Gulf, so we had a queue of ships. We decided to raise an anchorage fee on vessels and let them enter the 12-mile remit. Since then, Fujairah has developed into a bunker hub because of the number of waiting vessels and the one-stop shop that we developed. Over time, by giving incentives and complying with the regulations of shifting the ships from single to double hulls, we have managed to attract a lot of companies from storing offshore to onshore in Fujairah. </p><h4>What drove your success as an internationally recognized oil hub?</h4><p>Besides the location and calm sea, we were able to grow with flexible regulations and transparency, which we provide to all companies with no monopoly being granted to any company. There is a limited waterfront in Fujairah, which is why we have opted for a technical solution whereby instead of each terminal having its own waterfront we have a center where all the terminals use the port of Fujairah through a manifold matrix, and for each terminal connected to this manifold, they have access to almost nine pairs and a VLC, which can then be split into 17 pairs. This has helped the companies to save on investment. </p><h4>What is the significance of Fujairah Oil Terminals' contribution to the economy, and how does the oil industry create job opportunities?</h4><p>Although there have been several attempts to diversify the UAE economy, oil remains a major part of the economy of the UAE and Gulf states in general. It will continue this way for a long time, so for us to be a logistics center and serve the oil industry is desirable and strengthens the whole economy of the UAE and Fujairah. Our emergence as a hub highlighted the importance of Fujairah's strategic location, whilst also becoming a center from which to export 70% of Abu Dhabi's crude oil. </p><h4>What is the current capacity of the oil storage facilities, and what are the development plans for the next 5 years?</h4><p>The current capacity is approximately 10 million cbm, which is forecast to rise to 12 million cbm by the end of 2019 and, at a later date, 15 million cbm.</p><h4>How has the cost of oil storage evolved over the years?</h4><p>The move from floating storage to onshore storage was more cost effective, which is why we have the current number of terminals. The cost per cbm is budgeted depending on the price of oil, which is cyclical. The price is not fixed, but all terminals in Fujairah are operating healthily, sometimes at 100% utilization. Despite the cyclical nature, most of the terminals are operating above 80%. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We intend to continue growing in partnership with the companies we work with. We listen to them and aim to be ahead of the curve in meeting their needs. We will not stop investing in the future and are aware of the competition around us, not to mention the competition facing the industry. We take all of this into consideration and continue to grow and improve the business and do more for added-value industries.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Historically, what has been the Fujairah Department of Industry and Economy's role in the Emirate's development?</h4><p>The Emirate of Fujairah is almost 77% mountains and has a coastline along the Indian Ocean. Years ago, the department embarked on one of its major objectives to study what natural resources are in the Emirate. A British geological surveyor company was brought in to study, assess, and confirm the geological makeup of the Emirate. The geological map provided information to help identify the minerals that can be used for the manufacturing and building material industries. The geological survey report enabled us to identify two main mineral resources: gabbro, which is one of the hardest rock forms, and limestone. The local cement industry has been using this limestone since 1984, and the rock wool, building material, interlocker tiles, and ceramic industries started around the same time. The next step was to utilize our geography as a gateway to Asia and create the Port of Fujairah. Furthermore, the National Bank of Fujairah began its operations. Then we embarked on building the insurance industry, real estate, the airport, trade center, and so on. Once that infrastructure was in place, which led the way to specializations of the free zone, it attracted SMEs as well as industrialists from India, Greece, and CIS countries. Today the zone is home to a range of companies that manufacture garments or build solar panels, and we are looking further to diversify the portfolio of business and attract more high-tech industries.</p><h4>What business are you looking to develop around the port?</h4><p>When the Port of Fujairah started, it was for containers and later developed, especially during the Gulf and Iraq-Iran wars. The port receives a huge amount of the world's shipping traffic, particularly seaborne oil transport, which paved the way for the emergence of bunkering business, and now we are second in the world, after Singapore. Many ships anchor in the Arabian Gulf and around the strait, which led to the ship-handling business. Providing services to the ships requires a terminal where ships can be serviced. This type of industry developed as per the shipping industry's requirements, and today we have diversified the business with a number of terminals. Adding to it, nine terminals were started just for oil bunkering and have recently opened a very large crude carrier (VLCC) terminal for large vehicle shipping. The opening of the Habshan-Fujairah pipeline coincided with the creation of a large capacity storage tank within the port area to create another zone for storage and loading of oil, most of which is shipped to Japan, Asia, and the CIS region.</p><h4>What strategies do you have for developing the SME segment? </h4><p>SMEs are one of the major topics across the UAE. The SME law has already been approved, and there are many things that can be done here. One of the sectors where there is room for SME development is in clean energy, either solar or wind. We commissioned a feasibility study on wind energy and found that wind farming could produce 60MW of energy in the northwest region of Fujairah. We foresee building an R&amp;D center for clean energy, and have entered into discussions with Spanish and German parties to create a research institute that can bring students from UAE universities to foster greater cooperation. Another option is in the free zone, which has the facility for producing solar energy sheets. This has created opportunities for companies to come and create turnkey projects for companies that require this type of energy. There is also more room for SMEs to get involved in the grain silos industry. We have an important food security program that requires enlarging our food storage capacity for products like rice. We welcome new ideas that can help put Fujairah on the world map. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Accessing Fujairah]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[accessing-fujairah]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have imports and exports evolved in the Fujairah Free Zone (FFZ) over the past two years, and how do you expect them to progress?</h4><p>As the number of companies at FFZ grows, so too does the level of activity we are experiencing. We have managed to attract around 200 SMEs in processing, trading, and services to FFZ, and 20-30% of these companies will be active immediately. Secondly, as these companies grow, they become more sustainable and gain better access to the market along with better knowledge of it. The third factor is that the interaction between companies at FFZ will also grow over time, and these synergies further enhance trade. From our side, we have acquired the knowledge and learned over the years how to better market companies at FFZ. When we run business promotions, both inside and outside the UAE, we focus on the companies that are already here. We highlight their strengths as well as the service, convenience, logistics, and accessibility provided by the FFZ and our partners, such as customs, ports, and freight forwarders. All of us, as a team, help promote and increase FFZ's business.</p><h4>What are the advantages of coming to FFZ compared to the UAE's other free zones?</h4><p>FFZA and all our colleagues in the other free zones try to market the UAE as a whole. I would also highlight the positive environment and support from the UAE's federal and local governments. There are three factors that differentiate FFZ. The first point is that some regions are saturated and some are growing. This will impact the costing, facilitation, accessibility, and expediting of work. At FFZ, we are able to be more attentive to smaller companies coming in compared to a new company going into a zone that already has some 20,000-50,000 members, which impacts the availability of time, services, and cost. The last factor is that FFZ has managed to develop its own identity and market niche. For example, there are free zones focused on the registration of companies and having representation and access to a market in trading, servicing, or real estate. Here in Fujairah, we have developed a great market in the oil sector. FFZ also stands out in terms of its logistics, warehousing, processing, manufacturing, and added-value capacity. This gives us the confidence and capacity to help clients that want to set up a project here. FFZ is flexible and accessible, and we are targeting the market according to our capabilities. Also, we have one of the most important multipurpose ports in the region.</p><h4>Which countries are showing the most interest in FFZ?</h4><p>There is no doubt the Indian Subcontinent has always been the main supplier to this region. Today, the Subcontinent provides management, labor, skilled workers, and investors to the UAE, and most Indian businesspeople have a network of operations across a number of countries. The second region is Asia, the third is European businesses, and the interest in FFZ from Africa is also growing. Africa is a good market for us because it has a lot of resources that require processing as well as access to other markets. There is more scope to come from Africa, as the UAE provides those markets with superior logistics services. In the future, we expect more demand from Eastern Europe. Of course, the CIS market is up and down. Asian businesses know this is a good platform for re-exporting, as the UAE has developed to meet the requirements from each of these different regions. FFZ has reached a point where we can be more selective and enhance businesses. We try to match the UAE's innovation policies with certain sectors, such as food, pharmaceuticals, and aerospace. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What milestones has SCCI achieved in promoting innovation?</h4><p>In line with the UAE's vision, the SCCI is focused on maintaining a culture of innovation, promoting creativity in all fields of operation, and enhancing competitiveness. The SCCI seeks to realize the vision of Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, to achieve sustainable development and a knowledge-based economy through continuous efforts to provide an environment conducive to development, innovation, and education. The most recent program launched by Sharjah Chamber was “Business on Wheels,“ during the “UAE Innovation Week“ at the Sharjah Expo Centre. The first of its kind in Sharjah, Business on Wheels offers clients, investors, and proprietors a mobile one-stop solution to complete their transactions, issuance of certificates of origin, attestation, and signature. The vehicle is a mobile office furnished by the chamber with all the necessities for completing a variety of transactions. Early in 2017, the chamber launched a package of services and initiatives called the “Workshop to Innovate“ aimed at developing ideas that increase everyday productivity. This will be implemented through an application for interactive games that motivate staff to increase their efficiency, focus, and elevate their competitive edge. The chamber also communicates with members and the public through a smart application to provide a “one window“ service, in coordination with the Sharjah Economic Development Department (SEDD).</p><h4>What are the chamber's primary tools for communicating with the public, the private sector, and potential partners abroad?</h4><p>Currently there are more than 45,000 SMEs operating in Sharjah. The SCCI provides every region of Sharjah with integrated services of international standards. Sharjah Chamber pushed further development by adding value to the economic arena by launching the Expo Centre Sharjah, Sharjah Export Development Center, Sharjah International Commercial Arbitration Center (Tahkeem), Sharjah Training and Development Center, and Sharjah Economic Excellence Award. We also oversee the Sharjah Award for Best 10 Entities, Sharjah Green Award, Sharjah Award for Social Responsibility, Sharjah Award for Business Start-ups, and Sharjah Award for Entrepreneurship. The SCCI also maintains close ties with different local government entities in Sharjah as well as its counterparts in other Emirates under the umbrella of the UAE Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry. We also have a strong role in the Federation of GCC Chambers, working alongside our counterparts in the Arab world to elevate and integrate the economic performance of the UAE and our neighbors to the highest degree. The SCCI receives delegates from countries all over the world to improve bilateral ties by strengthening economic, commercial, and investment relationships. We take part in economic events, international meetings and conferences, and organize visits by commercial delegations year round. Sharjah Chamber recently launched a new initiative under the theme “business breakfast“ with the purpose of bringing a select group of Sharjah CEOs together with representatives of diplomatic missions and business council members across the UAE. </p><h4>How does the SCCI encourage growth in the private sector and help businesses build their international profile?</h4><p>The SCCI designed a business incubator project to provide continual assistance for start-ups by providing support resources and services.  The project aims to create a conducive growth environment for start-ups and increase their chances of success in the early stages of operation, which are often the most difficult for new businesses. In addition to helping transform preliminary research and feasibility studies into marketable projects, we offer various support, facilities, and experience to help foster growth. Sharjah Chamber supports start-up investments and honors outstanding businesses of all sectors by providing them with various advantages like allocating monetary awards, international promotion, and increased networking. Each of our awards is given with the intention of spreading a culture of quality and excellence in all segments of the private sector and to support and motivate young entrepreneurs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main factor behind the Emirate's impressive economic performance?</h4><p>The Emirate's biggest revenue stream is not from oil but from the export of construction materials to neighboring countries. This is one of the main reasons why RAK enjoys a stable economy. Although some GCC countries are cutting back on construction costs, the demand for construction goods is still high, plus the Emirate also exports to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The diversified activities within RAKEZ are also a strong indicator of Ras Al Khaimah's diverse economy, as well as the development of the hospitality industry in the recent years, which substantially increased the number tourists coming to the Emirate. RAKEZ plans to further support this strong position by embarking on major infrastructure advancements that will help bolster the influx of investors.</p><h4>What makes the Emirate such an attractive investment destination?</h4><p>Ras Al Khaimah has a strong trading heritage, which continues through continuous infrastructural and economic developments. Today, RAK poses one of the most ideal investment destinations in the region, and made the list of top-10 small- and medium-sized global cities of the future, among the likes of Edinburgh and Zurich. What is great about the Emirate is its cost effectiveness. Costs are lower here, from operating a business to living in the Emirate. Another important factor is business friendliness. RAK is very business friendly and follows clear and transparent regulations that lessen the bureaucratic requirements that have to be fulfilled by investors. The connectivity of the Emirate to the world's fast-growing economies is also a key asset as well as the premier residential places and schools. Overall, Ras Al Khaimah provides convenience to foreign investors, offering them everything they need to grow their business and at the same time, live a comfortable life away from home. What is even better is the high level of collaboration between RAKEZ and other government entities to further ease doing business and ensure the smooth establishment of new companies. For example, our Government Services Department works efficiently with RAK Immigration to quickly issue all types of visas, as well as with the RAK Chamber to help clients easily acquire Chamber of Commerce membership. It is also worth noting that, at RAKEZ, we cater to over 50 industries and thousands of activities. We welcome businesses of all sizes, from entrepreneurs, SMEs, and manufacturers to traders from over 100 countries. To top it all off, Ras Al Khaimah offers an abundant supply of natural resources. The Emirate is home to one of the world's largest rock quarries, as well as high-quality deposits of limestone and clay, which benefit manufacturers, particularly those in the building materials field.</p><h4>What are some of RAKEZ's major upcoming projects?</h4><p>This year, we are all about developing the infrastructure of our industrial zones. Some of our plans have already been implemented while others will roll out in the coming years. All of this this been done to efficiently support our existing and potential investors in their industrial operations. We also recently announced the opening of our Media Zone. Right now, we are doing some enhancements to the Media Zone building so that creative companies get access to the right space and amenities to help them effectively bring their ideas to life. As for the upcoming development plans in the pipeline, we are currently master planning a new specialized zone. The objective of launching a new zone is to provide more locations for businesses to work, play, and grow. Also, in our ongoing effort to bring ease to our customers and investors, we are developing our offices in Dubai and Abu Dhabi to become full service centers. We are also looking into building additional labor accommodations in our industrial zones. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What characterizes RAKEZ?</h4><p>RAKEZ is the evolution of the free zone landscape in Ras Al Khaimah, continuing the story that started with the foundation of RAK Free Trade Zone (RAK FTZ) and RAK Investment Authority (RAKIA) almost two decades ago. It has been established by the government to oversee, regulate, and consolidate the services, facilities, and zones of the two investment hubs, as well as serve their respective clients. It currently houses over 13,000 multinational companies from more than 100 countries covering over 50 industries, making it one of the largest economic zones in the region. RAKEZ uniquely offers free zone and non-free zone licenses through RAK FTZ and RAKIA, and provides its clients easy access to growing markets in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, South and Central Asia. At RAKEZ, we aim to be a customer-focused entity that offers simplified and efficient services. RAKEZ also provides a variety of facility choices such as Flexi facilities, standard offices, executive offices, warehouses, and land for development across many specialized zones across the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah. These include RAKEZ Business Zone; Al Hamra, Al Ghail, and Al Hulaila Industrial Zones; RAKEZ Media Zone; and RAKEZ Academic Zone. RAKEZ also uniquely allows the construction of labor accommodation on site to help eliminate the cost of labor transportation. Being situated in Ras Al Khaimah, our investors also get access to high-quality yet affordable housing, shopping malls, premier educational institutions, and advanced medical facilities. The Emirate offers a unique experience, allowing residents to enjoy a relaxed seaside ambiance, year-round sunny weather, and majestic mountains.</p><h4>How will your strategic partnership with RAK Municipality help boost the competitiveness of the Emirate?</h4><p>RAKEZ actively enters into various strategic partnerships with international and local government bodies. The MoU between RAKEZ and RAK Municipality covers various partnership activities and commitments that focus on improving the economic zone's services to its existing and potential clients. It speeds up documentation and license approvals, issuance of no objection certificates for food, veterinary, and cosmetics industries clients, as well as the adoption and registration of RAKEZ's new properties. The MoU also lets RAKEZ gain access to the governmental land database in order to utilize unused government-owned land for investment in different industries. Our partnership with RAK Municipality boosts further boost the business-friendliness of not only the economic zone but of the Emirate in general to international investors. Time is very important, especially for investors. When they hear of a place where they can save time and money, and at the same time get access to high-quality services and facilities, it immediately draws their attention. With Ras Al Khaimah's different government agencies working hand in hand, investors will surely flock to the Emirate.</p><h4>In which countries do you see a special interest for Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>We have been actively sending delegations all over the world. This year, we went to several countries around the world to present the unique business opportunities offered in Ras Al Khaimah and the UAE. We visited India, Pakistan, China, the UK, Greece and Jordan. All of these have been very successful, but we particularly saw major potential for China and India. In fact, we have participated at the 3rd Annual Free Trade and Special Economic Zone Summit in Shanghai, where we were able to meet a great number of potential Chinese investors. Furthermore, we have recently partnered with KPMG to organize an investment forum in India. Indian investors in the field of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, manufacturing, auto, IT, technology, biotech, financial services, and more have shown keen interest to operate from RAKEZ. Because of the continuous strong demand from India, we set up an office in Mumbai in 2006. We also have offices in Turkey and Germany, which help us focus on attracting European investors as we also see high demand and enquiries coming from the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What attracts industries to Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>The low cost of production, great location, access to manpower, and government support encourage investors, as they can market their products all over the world at convenient prices. Pricing is one of the most important issues, because it allows the factories to compete with other companies. Here, in Ras Al Khaimah, they can produce at low cost and high quality. It is easy to get a license to open companies, and this can be done quickly, as can connecting the facilities to water and electricity. Everything is much easier than it is in other places. Some companies receive a license in one day, and here at RAK DED you can renew your license in 15 minutes. It is easy to contact the decision makers and explain your future plans. Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, the Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, encourages officials to ease administrative procedures for customers and open their doors wider in order to stay in direct contact with customers, investors, and other interested parties.</p><h4>How has the drop in oil prices affected the export of construction materials?</h4><p>The oil price has affected not only Ras Al Khaimah, but all of the world. However, everyone must still invest in the construction. Construction is an intrinsic part of any country's development, so there will continue to be demand for those products. In times of crisis, companies are given the chance to look for alternatives, to find a new market for example. If returning clients are buying less, we will have to look for additional demand, so there is potential to break out and find new markets.</p><h4>Which markets outside the UAE and GCC offer potential for Ras Al Khaimah's businesses?</h4><p>Asia is one of the best markets as well as Africa. We are targeting developing countries that have large populations and where we can easily take advantage of the low prices of our raw materials and products.</p><h4>You recently received a delegation of Latin American diplomats. How did this visit come about, and what can Latin America and RAK bring each other?</h4><p>There is already some trade between us and some Latin American countries, and there is potential for more. These are still small numbers, but we are trying to increase them. As I mentioned before, during tough times countries have to seek new markets. South America has a large population and many products to export; we are trying to explore new channels of mutual commerce and industry as well as opportunities for re-export. Some of our manufacturers open factories in Latin America because there is good potential, and there are raw materials that we can bring here. Latin America exports all over the world, so why not boost our relations?</p><h4>How do the operations of RAK DED align with the federal government's long-term policies?</h4><p>We are all under one umbrella. The advantage here in Ras Al Khaimah is that we are flexible with our procedures. At RAK DED, we are trying to reduce the number of processes for investors to get a license, and to be closer in tune with investors' concerns. In the near future, we will have new mobile applications available on the Apple App Store and on Google Play. Through this app clients will be able to do many things, like renewing their license or opening a new license. We have already presented this project to Sheikh Saud, and he gave us the approval to start this in Ras Al Khaimah. It will connect all of the people who have licensing in Ras Al Khaimah and this district. It will also have other features such as location services, a job search engine, business networking capacity, and advertising. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Growth Enterprises]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[growth-enterprises]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which regions are you eyeing for expansion and what factors do you take into consideration before entering?</h4><p>The two regions in which we are looking to expand are Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and developing Asia. These regions are emerging as the fastest growing in the world, with overall GDP growth projections over 3%, and in some countries as high as 5-7%, compared to so-called advanced markets, where the expected average growth rate is just 1-2%. Several factors are taken into consideration when we enter a new market—macroeconomic drivers, micro factors, the market opportunity, regulatory and governance frameworks, the impact the business would have on a local level, and the ease with which incoming businesses can navigate these markets. The SSA region, for example, emerged as the second-highest adopter of reforms in the World Bank's 2017 Doing Business report, indicating an improving landscape for investment. Adding to this, these economies are witnessing growing urbanization and digitization, propelled by a youth bulge and a rapidly expanding middle class, which creates real opportunities, not just in consumer sectors, but also in infrastructure, energy, construction, and financial services.</p><h4>Why did Crescent Enterprises choose to expand its port management business to the US, and do you expect to see new opportunities for growth in the market?</h4><p>Over the last few decades, the investment made toward upgrading US port infrastructure has been grossly inadequate. Today, not a single US container port is in the top-15 container ports globally according to the Journal of Commerce. Expanding trade has put severe pressure on the existing system, increasing congestion and threatening US economic competitiveness. The American Society of Civil Engineers in its 2017 report estimates a USD4.5 trillion investment gap over the next eight years to meet the country's infrastructure needs, which includes ports. Hence our US expansion was driven by the glaring need for modernization and upgrading of US port infrastructure. We believe there is a huge opportunity for Gulftainer, which operates some of the most productive ports in the world, to invest in building modern port infrastructure and offer increased efficiency and quick and nimble services that add value to the supply chain. In Port Canaveral, we have successfully commenced operations with a planned investment of USD100 million to revamp the terminal infrastructure, add new equipment, and develop human capital. To add to this, Gulftainer opened a 40,000-sqft. warehouse in the port last year to bolster its on-site logistical capabilities. Building on Gulftainer's success in Port Canaveral, we are keen to expand in areas that fit within our strategy of value creation and long-term development, especially in the medium-sized container terminal segment.</p><h4>Do you think the region's entrepreneurial ecosystem is on the right track? What are the gaps in today's market?</h4><p>It is a source of pride to see the UAE lead in the space, with the likes of Souq.com and Careem emerging as recent champions of the region's entrepreneurial ambitions. However, even as we witness rapid growth in the start-up arena, in real terms we fall behind in areas such as internationalization, start-up skills, and process innovation—aspects that differentiate global innovation hubs as sources of economic value and meaningful change. While profitability and financial returns continue to be primary drivers, we stand a better chance at long-term success by building strong global brands, generating jobs and developing essential skills, and moving from being just a solutions utilizer to a solutions provider. At Crescent Enterprises, we are channeling this approach through CE-Ventures, which is our internal incubation division that follows a social enterprise model of business, one that puts people, planet, and profits into a symbiotic framework and generates a multiplier effect on impact. The goal here is to build responsible, sustainable, and change-evoking start-ups, which are grounded in innovation, and at the same time focus on maximizing stakeholder value creation and generating sustainable opportunities for our youth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you develop the Smart Tower concept in the UAE?</h4><p>Our first project in Ajman was in mid-2014. We bought land in the middle of the desert and decided to develop the first smart tower there. If you have a property in our smart tower, you can control everything in your flat—the lights, air-conditioning, television, curtains, cameras, water heater, and intercom—with a single mobile app. It was the first such concept in Ajman, combining IT with real estate. Within four months, the project sold out for USD32.7 million. The government of Ajman could not believe that we had moved the market while it was in the doldrums. Now, construction is 50% finished and will be completed by the end of 2018. Then, I wanted to build the first smart tower in Sharjah, in the Al Nahda area. We launched the project within three months, with total sales of around USD54.4 million and sold 85%. The project was such a success that the Sharjah government honored us with the Best Developer Award and the Best Project of 2016.</p><h4>You give different concepts to your real estate developments. What other concept buildings are you developing in Sharjah?</h4><p>Our third project in Sharjah is in a prime location, on Jamal Abdul Nasser Street. I decided to include commercial and residential space as well as six floors for parking and four for offices. It is a large project, bigger than previous ones, and the concept was to combine sport with real estate. On top of the building there is a swimming pool, gym, basketball and tennis courts, and a jogging track, all 50m above ground where the air is cleaner and less polluted. That project is now 95% sold out, including all the residential units, and about 20% of the construction has been completed. The project is called Sarkwa Tower, after the old name of Sharjah. We also bought another plot of land in Sharjah next to Afamia I to build Afamia II. That was the fastest project we ever sold, and all 130 apartments completely sold out in two months.</p><h4>You are also developing the Farm and Arts Towers. What makes those projects unique?</h4><p>In Ajman, we bought yet another plot of land next to Smart Tower and Al Hamra to build a third tower. Called Al Mazraa Tower, this is unique not just in the UAE but worldwide. Mazraa means farm. The tower will give apartment owners organic vegetables year-round through a rooftop farm with a hydroponic system. Residents will have 100% organic vegetables grown on site and brought right to their doors. Sales start next month, and the estimated total value is USD81.7 million. The Ruler of Ajman asks me what new projects we have in the pipelines; that is how excited they are. Another project we launched in July 2017 is the Art Tower in Sharjah. There is a famous Emirati artist called Mohammed Al Ustad that has done exhibitions worldwide, and all our leaders know him. I would like to have his work in the lobby and corridors of the hotel, with a gallery and atelier as well. He loved the idea, and 30% of it is already booked, even though we have yet to launch it. Now, we are in talks with the Art College of Sharjah University to bring their students to paint and work. In July 2017, we will launch our first project in Dubai, which is the Smart Tower III. Dubai is not an easy market to crack. However, I remain optimistic and expect it will do well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has SEDD played in encouraging growth in manufacturing and making it attractive for newcomers?</h4><p>Industrial output represents about 18% of the Emirate's GDP. SEDD plays a great role in developing the industrial sectors by identifying investment opportunities, developing industrial indicators, building databases, and undertaking more than 90 visits to factories. The number of industrial licenses increased by 2.35% in 2016 compared to the previous year. This growth was due to significant cooperation between SEDD and our local and foreign partners. In addition to taking an active role in monitoring trends in the sector, developing lines of communication, and encouraging growth, we are continuously developing and improving our industrial infrastructure. We work hand-in-hand with the appropriate government bodies for the external promotion of industry, technical support programs, and to forge bilateral cooperation with foreign countries and businesses.</p><h4>How does SEDD work to attract FDI and foreign entities to bring their commerce to Sharjah?</h4><p>SEDD promotes Sharjah through its participation in local and international economic exhibitions and forums. These are excellent platforms for attracting investors and international attention to Sharjah because of their diverse participation and attendance. SEDD also places great value on developing economic, trade, and cultural relationships between Sharjah and foreign entities. In this manner, we can increase mutual investment rates across all sectors, provide top-of-the-line facilities, and overcome obstacles in international commerce. Sharjah enjoys one of the most attractive and promising environments for investment because of its range of safeguards, incentives, and state-of-the-art facilities. Raising awareness at international conferences and forums is vital to promoting Sharjah's economic and trade comparative advantages, in addition to acquiring expertise and capabilities.</p><h4>What are the most effective methods of promoting and facilitating two-way communication between government entities and citizens?</h4><p>SEDD's customer satisfaction rate of 95% is one of the highest for a public organization globally. This demonstrates the department's level of experience in dealing with the public and service seekers. SEDD's ability to effectively communicate with individuals is based on four criteria. The first is the availability of continuous communication through direct or indirect channels such as e-services like the Tasheel service centers. The second is the effectiveness of communication between the government and individuals, which we evaluate in periodic surveys. Third is SEDD's ability to anticipate people's needs by predicting obstacles or challenges in the market. The last criterion evaluates our efficiency in resolving complaints and addressing the actual requirements of individuals.</p><h4>Sharjah is undergoing great transformations in several sectors. How do you measure the Emirate's growth, especially in relation to the duties of SEDD?</h4><p>Sharjah boasts several unique historical, cultural, social, and infrastructural components, making it a chosen destination for residence and work. The explosive population growth we have witnessed in the last three to four years presented the need for government entities to increase the number of e-services, employees, service channels, and regulatory inspectors, for which we have accommodated. The Emirate's expansion in terms of transport, education, healthcare, and manufacturing are reflections of Sharjah's growth and renewed potential. Sharjah had a 3.5% GDP growth rate in 2016 and increased the number of active business licenses to more than 72,000 by the end of 2016, up 6.1% from the previous year. The economy grew healthily sector by sector as well, by 7% in manufacturing, 6% in construction, 9% in the wholesale and retail, 6% in restaurants and hotels, and 7% in the real estate and business services area in 2016. Furthermore, Sharjah witnessed an increase in general production to AED140 billion (USD38.1 billion) in 2016, a growth of 4%. The volume of fixed capital formation in 2016 exceeded AED25 billion (USD6.8 billion), public investment increased by 5%, and the number of micro enterprises increased by 22.6%. We are very confident in our goals of attracting investment and maintaining customer satisfaction. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main themes of Sharjah's economic vision, and what are the guiding principles of these themes? </h4><p>Under the leadership of Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Ruler of Sharjah and Member of the UAE Supreme Council, Sharjah has been guided by the principle of equitable and comprehensive economic development. This principle articulates the nature of our economic ambitions as well as our direction for the future. We believe that economic activity is not only transactional, whereby goods and services are exchanged and circulated in return for money. We believe that economic activity is a transformational process that integrates social and cultural development, and that all members of society should be part of this process in one way or another. It is a vision based on moving forward all together and not just a few of us who have the means to conduct business. As a result of this vision, Sharjah places its first and foremost focus on the development of human capital because we believe the human being is the source and catalyst of any sustainable economic activity. This focus has led Sharjah to offer world-class education, create support programs for entrepreneurs, empower women and children, host cultural activities that integrate all members of our society, and build sustainable infrastructure that facilitates the implementation of our vision and strategy on ground.</p><h4>At a time of massive global change and regional instability, Sharjah is making remarkable economic achievements. How has the Emirate shielded itself from these economic fluctuations?</h4><p>We pride ourselves in Sharjah on our strict economic diversification philosophy. No one sector represents more than one-third of our GDP. This strategy has proven its worth during the recent crises that shook global markets. While some regional and global markets were struggling or on the verge of collapsing, Sharjah was making steadfast progress in its economic activity with significant stability, which gives investors greater confidence in our Emirate. This strategy also allowed us to move steadily in global rankings on many fronts. For example, we have recently been announced as one of the top cities in the world for connectivity based on internet penetration and the capability and ease of movement of goods. This report, which was managed by FDI Intelligence Magazine, confirmed that Sharjah has established itself as an essential Middle East hub of modern continental trade thanks to its logistics, seaports, and airport capabilities that helped us secure a place among the leading global connectivity cities. In terms of the future, we plan to continue building world-class infrastructure. The 2017 plans reflect our intention to continue spending on our infrastructure with a 7% increase compared to last year. Our total spending on infrastructure represents 30% of our budget this year, and this commitment attracts local and global investors alike as their confidence in Sharjah's economy and future rises. </p><h4>Many governments rely significantly on PPPs to advance their economic agendas. In Sharjah, what sectors do you see PPPs focus on?</h4><p>Fruitful PPPs are essential in the development of any economy and Sharjah is not an exception to that. A PPP is the best solution for the speedy implementation of affordable infra structure development, and as Sharjah continues to grow and expand into new sectors, it is important that we boost our partnership with the private sector, which has the power and resources to be a difference-maker. The speedy growth in population, combined with our economic vision that includes major projects and expansions, places additional demands on infrastructure and the only way to cope with these demands is to partner with the private sector. We expect our PPPs to yield investment in critical infrastructure as well as social infrastructure such as healthcare and education. The environment, transport and logistics, light manufacturing, tourism, and support for entrepreneurship programs are also areas where the private sector is welcome to contribute. The world is shifting rapidly in the context of the fourth industrial revolution. The global economy is changing rapidly and Sharjah is planning to stay ahead of the curve by investing more in technology, education, innovation, and research and development. We see great opportunities in these areas for the private sector to contribute. </p><h4>What are the pillars you will focus on in the future to ensure the competitiveness of Sharjah?</h4><p>One of the pioneers of the internet revolution said, “There is no problem large enough that innovation and entrepreneurship cannot solve." Intellectual ingenuity invents new things that have practical utility, and economic ingenuity finds a profitable way to bring the new products to market. It is a symbiotic relationship that has worked for the greater wellbeing of mankind since time immemorial. The world's leading cities and nations have adopted knowledge-based economies built on innovation and creativity, the key component of which is the people. We will continue our investment in local talent as well as focus on attracting talent from all over the world to ensure continuous innovation in all sectors. We will work tirelessly to ensure excellence of government services and infrastructures at all levels to encourage more FDI. We also constantly review our policies and regulations to make sure that our government plays the role of enabler, not just regulator. We also launched the Invest in Sharjah initiative, which is spearheaded by Shurooq, and our aim is to share the Sharjah success story with as many investors as possible in all markets. Our trade delegations have been active in Europe, China, and North America organizing meetings with potential investors. Their efforts have paid off and will continue to in the future. Our investment outreach program has given us a chance to formulate a positive narrative about Sharjah in the investment circles, which is being translated in Sharjah receiving more investments, thus bolstering our competitiveness.</p><h4>How is the youth of Sharjah empowered through entrepreneurship?</h4><p>Sharjah has all the innate advantages of the region: a young demographic hungry to advance itself, a well-educated and motivated corps of female workers, and centers of academic excellence like University City. It has a business-friendly culture, a secure and supportive environment for small business start-ups, and good infrastructure and access to the booming markets of the Gulf, Africa, and South Asia. That is where projects such as the Sharjah Entrepreneurship Center “Sheraa" initiative come into play. The core of the Sheraa concept is that each one of us is responsible for the future of the region and for the generations that will inherit it. We have built this center around campus because we believe that our students should learn the skills of business and economy as young as possible. The world today is not made for job seekers but job creators, and we in the Sharjah government understand this fact well. This is why we have invested in centers like Sheraa and other programs supporting and encouraging the idea of entrepreneurship. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When du entered the market, it brought a price-balancing element to the telecoms industry. How do you gauge the overall effect that du's entry to the market has had on prices for customers and businesses?</h4><p>When du entered the market in 2007 and started providing our services in mobile, we disrupted the entire ecosystem. This is normal as the market only had one player beforehand. Disruption does not mean simply undercutting prices; it is about looking at price differently. For example, du was the first in the region to introduce the pay-by-the-second billing system. People really feel that this is a much more honest and fair way to price. We also introduced the possibility of having different wallets, one for more time, one for more credit, and one for prepaid access, and choice is continuing beyond pricing now. Customers use technology in different ways, and this applies to individuals, families, friends, SMEs, large corporations, government departments, associations, and even nations. Nations and the behavior of their citizens are changing radically through the evolution of mobile technology along with the explosion of the Internet and social media. We have the perfect storm when you add these factors to the empowerment that will come from big data coupled with artificial intelligence and robotics.</p><h4>The smart city initiatives stem from the capture and analysis of big data across the Emirate. How is du engaging with this aspect to develop the Smart Dubai platform?</h4><p>Dubai, compared to other cities, has a lot of smart applications provided by multiple government agencies in areas such as immigration, utilities, transport, local government, and police. But having a lot of smart applications does not make it a smart city. It starts to become a smart city when all these applications talk to each other, and there is one platform where all this data is aggregated, processed, and treated. Through analytics, that data then becomes knowledge that can be used for better planning and leadership. People will be able to do things differently—more safely and more efficiently. People's behavior will then produce more data that allows the city to cater for its people even more. du had the privilege of being selected as a strategic partner for Smart Dubai. This means we will build and operate the platform for Smart Dubai, and we will contribute to the developments that are needed for this platform. By doing this, we are bringing a lot of partners into the equation with us. This means all the data that exists will be available, and young entrepreneurs will see opportunities to develop new businesses. This will be the fertile ground for innovation and entrepreneurship, supporting the growth of smaller players in the market as well. The world is moving toward ecosystems that are not only multi-dimensional with multiple components, but also have multiple stakeholders.</p><h4>What are your expectations at du for the next 12 months?</h4><p>Through initiatives in the UAE, we are creating momentum. The smart government and smart city concepts, the Blockchain Council, the Accelerator of the Future, the Museum of the Future, and even the hyperloop fast train are beyond the issue of whether one year will be tougher than another in terms of growth. We are extremely blessed with the level of leadership in the UAE, and we are all being pushed to do our best. Despite various geopolitical and economic tensions in the world, the UAE with all its initiatives is continuing along the path to create a new milestone in the history of civilization. I am privileged because I am in a field that is at the heart of this transformation, which is the digital internet space, but in any industry you can feel this happening. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>There have been liquidity issues around construction and real estate, and although no large projects were canceled, there has been a delay in some major real estate and a 92% decline in construction projects awarded in 1H2016. How is the CSCEC maintaining activity in the midst of these issues?</h4><p>Due to the low oil prices coupled with a global slump, government expenditure was reduced. In the Middle East, the construction sector has slowed down to a certain extent and, as a contractor, we have been trying very hard to diversify. From our base in Dubai we are looking after operations in the GCC, which allows us to have some more choice. For example, for the past two years we have been doing well in the Kuwaiti market, which has helped us balance the slowdown in other countries. Over the past 10 years, we have established a reputation and long-term partnership with most of our clients. We are receiving tender invitations and signing contracts from repeat customers that include government developers and major private development companies. We are also trying to bring in project financing and funding to ensure that clients can start projects promptly with adequate backing. Instead of remaining a contractor, we are trying to become a developer as well.</p><h4>What specific sectors, both locally and regionally, look attractive for CSCEC?</h4><p>The real estate market is still quite active, and comparing 2008 to today, there is probably less government involvement in the sector. Private investors remain very active, and there is good reason to believe in the future of Dubai. There is transport infrastructure to be developed here, as well as a lot of additional tourist attractions such as Dubai Park and Dubai Water Canal. Once they start the new airport it will trigger more construction and attract more professionals to the region, the UAE, and Dubai.</p><h4>Of the tourism, general infrastructure, transport, and trade infrastructure sectors, is there a particular one the company will prioritize?</h4><p>As per the Chinese government's initiative for One Belt, One Road, we are very much interested in infrastructure. Megaproject infrastructure like the Etihad Railway, ports, and the airport are one of our core businesses. We have been following this market for many years within the region. Hopefully, with the improvements in oil prices, the government will have the luxury of a deeper budget in order to spark more investment in the sector.</p><h4>A 5% VAT will be implemented in 2018, with full integration by 2019. How will that affect your business?</h4><p>It will have a certain impact the real effects of which we have yet to fully understand. We have a general understanding that the consumer will probably pay for the extra 5% at the end of the day. However, in certain cases, we are likely also the end user, so it is likely that our construction costs will become higher. All in all, it is likely that the end result will be an increase in company expenses. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[alejandro-sisniega-country-manager-cabify-mexico]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the market relevance of Mexico for Cabify?</h4><p>Mexico represents one of the most important market in our operation, meaning we are extremely relevant. For the industry, Mexico City is between the fourth and fifth city most important city in the world.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans in Mexico?</h4><p>2016 was when we decided to expand our operations and we opened in 11 cities that year. Mexico City is our largest operation in the country, though we also have significant operations in Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Querétaro. In 2017, we sought to expand our operations within the corporate sector, where we are leaders in Latin America. In 2018, we will focus on growth within the cities in which we are operating currently. The one problem in Mexico has to do with the regulations. We operate only in states where there is a regulation for such a ride-hailing company; that means there are 22 states that we will not enter until there is a clear picture of what will happen. Because of our corporate users and our contracts with them, we need to be legal in every place that we operate. In Monterrey, there is no regulation, though the government is open to such a company and does not seek to kick us out of the city.</p><h4>How do work in partnership with other mobility platforms to enhance the sector's visibility and advocate for adequate regulation?</h4><p>There are other companies that are relevant in the country and we are the second-most important company in the sector, though we seek to work as a team when working with governments. In 2017, we announced that we would develop a new association and work on government and security issues. We will launch the association soon and will work not only with companies within the industry but also with companies that are related to the mobility environment. One of the main variables that determines the quality of life is mobility. When one has access to several options of mobility, they will be healthier, happier, and more productive in their work. Therefore, it is relevant for the government to have effective mobility policies.</p><h4>How have your expansions been funded thus far? </h4><p>We closed our Series E with USD160 million, with several investors, so we can say that we are well-funded. We have investors from Spain, a huge investor from Japan, and small investors from Mexico and other countries that we operate in. We are not currently planning on launching an IPO and any such plan would be determined by the CFO; however, as a start-up we are always seeking ways to get funding and grow faster. We are growing organically and are in a solid financial position, though the more funds we have, the faster we will grow so we invest significantly in growth. Our largest markets are Spain, Brazil, and Mexico and we have large operations in Peru, Chile, and Colombia as well as smaller operations in Dominican Republic and Panama. Ecuador is also a great operation. We seek to be a large player in Latin America as well as Spain, where we have our headquarters.</p><h4>How would you assess regulations in Mexico City?</h4><p>They are far away at present, though there is a great deal of interest from the government to make things happen. This is the first such regulation in Latin America and the regulations in other countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, and Uruguay will follow these regulations. There are many things that need to be improved; however, it is a truly great start and things are moving rapidly. We need to realize that the government is first of all listening to our recommendations and it is trying to improve what is wrong. Mexico needs a federal regulation as we are currently regulated by states with different regulations and playbooks. In one state, we can seek funding, while in others we cannot. In Mexico City, we can only use vehicles of a certain value while in other states the owner of the vehicle has to be the driver. As a country, we need to have a federal regulation in order to operate better and standardize our onboarding processes and documentation requirements.</p><h4>What impact do Cabify and other route sharing platforms have on congestion in places such as Mexico City?</h4><p>We are key to making the city more efficient in terms of mobility, though we are not the main player. The government and public transportation need to be the main option for users and such a platform and other mobility services in cities should be the last-mile providers. We expect the government to provide an effective and well-organized public transportation system. We are key players because there are places where public transportation is currently nonexistent. In order to have a great mobility service in Mexico, companies need to start working with each other. We want to ferry a passenger from his home to his workplace and need to interact with other options.</p><h4>For 2018 what are your goals and targets?</h4><p>We seek growth. We need to grow by at least three-digit percentages. We managed to grow globally by 500% in 2017, and we need to comply with at least that in 2018. We will focus on technology and want our users to have a better experience using technology and will therefore start with automating most of our processes. We will invest a great deal on safety for our drivers and our users. There are more events of aggression toward drivers so in addition to information on our drivers, we also request customers' names, credit card info, and email addressed, though it is hard to confirm the accuracy of this. Our focus is on ensuring safety at all times.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why are multimodal transport links important for trade, and what has been DP World's role in their development locally and globally?</h4><p>Connecting multi-modal transport, industrial parks, economic zones, ports, and terminals through a focus on infrastructure so that trade is enabled and business can develop is essential. The Jebel Ali Free Zone experience in Dubai is a success due to supportive infrastructure and government policies. Our flagship Jebel Ali Port together with the free zone has become a model for multi-modal transport corridors around the world. We have grown into 'knowledge exporters,' advising governments like Kazakhstan and Indonesia on how to develop local and regional trade. London Gateway and DP World Caucedo are other examples where a business park and a free zone were developed to support trade and business growth. Our experience has also taught us that soft infrastructure is every bit as significant as roads, railways, and pipelines.</p><h4>How have DP World's investments increased over the last two years?</h4><p>The acquisition of Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai and Prince Rupert in Canada were key drivers of our strong results in 2016. Also in Canada, we signed a long-term lease agreement for the expansion and operation of the multipurpose Rodney Container Terminal at Saint John, New Brunswick. We also partnered with Caisse de dépí´t et placement du Québec (CDPQ) to create a co-investment platform of USD3.7 billion. Meanwhile, we now operate the multi-purpose Port of Berbera in Somaliland and have an inland container and warehousing facility in Kigali, Rwanda. We also signed an MoU to develop a logistics zone near the international airport. Elsewhere, we signed a 50-year concession for the development of a greenfield multi-purpose port project at Posorja, Ecuador. We also started the construction of a new and modern logistics terminal in Lurin district of Peru. In Asia, we are involved with the government of Kazakhstan for the development of a special economic zone in Aktau, further boosting trade and logistics in the country. In July this year, we signed an agreement with the Indonesian government and port officials to advise on the development of the Kuala Tanjung greenfield port and logistics zone and Belawan port in North Sumatra. We also provide similar services under a separate contract with Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ) for the development of the Khorgos Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and Inland Container Depot (ICD). We signed an agreement with Taiwan International Ports Corporation to potentially develop Kaohsiung Port's Terminal 7. DP World Limassol, Cyprus was awarded a 25-year concession for the exclusive right to operate the multipurpose terminal. A new modern terminal designed to accommodate the largest operating cruise vessels is scheduled to open in the summer at DP World Limassol port. The new terminal consists of seven pods with an internal area of 7,000sqm. Simultaneously, P&amp;O Maritime Cyprus, a wholly-owned subsidiary of DP World Limited, was also awarded a 15-year concession to exclusively provide a full range of port marine services at the port of Limassol. In Russia, we formed a JV with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to invest in port and port-related assets. In May, we also signed an MoU with the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) to further develop the logistics sector in India. We will seek opportunities in the country worth over USD1 billion over the next few years. This will be aimed at development of port infrastructure of the Sagarmala project, creation of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, river transportation and cold chain storage, and investment in port-led SEZs, free trade zones, ICDs, and cruise terminals. These investments reflect market needs, and we will continue to develop trade solutions where our customers want us to be.</p><h4>What can other markets learn from your experience of developing inland ports and other complementary businesses?</h4><p>Having a dedicated industrial and logistics facility adjoining a port means greater efficiency for business. For example, cargo that requires processing can be handled within hours of arriving at Jebel Ali. The port is at the center of a sophisticated transport network, with excellent land, air, and sea connections. Al Maktoum International Airport already adds enormously to its logistical benefits, and this will only increase as the airport expands. We have also identified ways to diversify our business, which is essential to meeting the demands of changing and emerging markets. We seek to develop end-to-end value propositions for clients. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the implementation of the bankruptcy law attract new business to the Emirate?</h4><p>The new law will induce a more efficient allocation of resources by facilitating the restructuring of companies and supporting troubled businesses, and thus ease the burden of asset erosion in both the corporate and financial sectors. This will lead to a reduction in the risks and cost of doing business in the UAE and give a fillip to investment both domestic and foreign. The new law is especially important to the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) since it will help reduce risks and ease credit conditions that have so far limited SME survival rates.</p><h4>What has been the private sector response to  the Business Dashboard and Saad platform?</h4><p>The Business Dashboard and Saad are two of DED's multiple initiatives designed to accelerate the transition of Dubai into a smart economy. We have also introduced a Hassle-Free initiative, which has streamlined and automated business-registration and licensing procedures, making them more efficient and less time consuming. The Business Dashboard complemented the successful migration of business registration and licensing services in Dubai to a fluid eServices platform through which investors can seamlessly engage with DED. Almost 99% of the business registration and licensing services are now available online in Dubai through the DED website and smart applications. Meanwhile, investors and entrepreneurs can submit their questions to Saad on the DED website in audio format or in writing and receive relevant and up-to-date information on business licenses procedures and fees as well as step-by-step instructions on setting up a business.</p><h4>How will the UAE become one of the most innovative countries in the world?<br></h4><p>The UAE has utilized various elements to drive innovation in the private and public sectors, including an enabling regulatory environment as well as strong information and communication infrastructure, support for R&amp;D and human capital development, and entrepreneurial capabilities and linkages to tap into global knowledge and financing arrangements. Both the Abu Dhabi and Dubai 2021 visions provide the vehicle for becoming a knowledge-based economy. For example, Dubai has embarked on an ambitious smart city initiative focused on harnessing the power of information technology in the provision of public and private services. A key step has already been undertaken as an increasing number of transactions and procedures and a comprehensive information system have been made accessible online. The greater the availability of these services, the more the reductions in the cost of doing business in Dubai will be realized.</p><h4>Dubai Smart Office has shown the link between big data analysis and happiness. How can happiness stimulate investment?</h4><p>Creating the happiest city is a complex challenge. We require state-of-the-art infrastructure, unique opportunities, dynamic customer engagement, and efficient service delivery, to name a few. When happiness becomes the central theme of policies, programs, and services of government bodies, the focus moves toward attracting investment and providing the best experiences for individuals, investors, and enterprises. The objective is a transformation, which requires significant investment but also opens avenues for sustained investment in excellence in the years to come.</p><h4>What made 2016 an attractive year for new licenses despite slower growth?</h4><p>What we witnessed in 2016 was the continuation of a long-term upward trend in issuing licenses. A number of factors are driving this, including the stability and predictability of the macroeconomic environment and the continuous drive to diversify the economy away from oil toward a knowledge-based economy underscored by innovation. In addition to the projects and initiatives contained in the Dubai 2021 Plan, Expo 2020 is attracting increasing levels of interest from the business community, especially in the context of the newly introduced PPP law and bankruptcy law. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With domestic energy consumption rates increasing due to a growing population, will Dubai's production levels be enough to supply the growing demand?</h4><p>At the national level, oil production was estimated at around 3 million bpd in early 2017, which served not just domestic energy needs but also fulfilled the requirements of our trading partners. Dubai's population alone is expected to reach 3.3 million by 2021, jumping from the current 2.5 million, and then peak at 5.2 million by 2030. We are seeing increasing fuel demand for the automotive sector as well as for electricity generation and water production. ENOC Group has a long-term strategy to ensure that energy infrastructure and the value chain under its control can supply the energy and energy products necessary for Dubai's continued growth. Therefore, we are investing several strategic projects designed to bolster Dubai's infrastructure. Our E&amp;P arm, Dragon Oil, produces approximately 100,000bpd and has added a new segment to ENOC's business portfolio, providing a platform from which to pursue growth. Our Jebel Ali refinery capacity expansion will also increase volumes from 140,000bpd to 210,000bpd by 2020 and add several new products. On the retail side, ENOC is expanding its UAE network of service stations by 54 outlets between now and 2020, and we are continuously working on investment programs to ensure the efficient execution of critical projects and building infrastructure to support the energy needs of the Emirate.</p><h4>What are the key trends in the evolution of the retail sector within the oil and gas industry? <br></h4><p>Innovation and technology are key components that will drive the growth of the retail space within the oil and gas industry. Within the sector, we have seen several innovations that have helped speed up the refueling process at fuel stations. ENOC Group has been a keen contributor to the ease of services and launched some innovative payment methods. The Vehicle Identification Pass (ViP) for both commercial and individual use was first implemented in 2014 to speed up the refueling process and enables customers to better manage their accounts at each fueling transaction. Similarly, we recently introduced PIN-less and paperless debit and credit card transactions to our service station network, which was a first in the UAE for fuel retailers. This will significantly reduce waiting times at ENOC and EPPCO service stations. Going forward, we envision self-checkouts in convenience stores to be big very soon. The evolution of Radio Frequency Identity (RFID) will develop into anti-theft, payment, tracking, stock keeping, ordering, and monitoring mechanisms.</p><h4>How are policy and regulatory factors impacting the energy industry?</h4><p>The November 2016 OPEC deal to reduce oil production for the first time in eight years steadied the international oil price. Another factor is the UAE Energy Plan 2050, which was launched in January 2017 to enhance the country's energy security. Dubai's announcement of the Emirate's plans for clean energy to account for 75% of its energy portfolio by 2050 preceded the national plan. As the key energy infrastructure partner to the Dubai government, ENOC has made significant contributions to support these strategies.</p><h4>What are the key imperatives to attract young talent to the oil and gas industry?</h4><p>Emiratization is a key factor in the recruitment process to make the sector attractive to UAE nationals. This is a key priority as a national oil company operating across the international energy value chain. As our portfolio of services and operations continue to grow in Dubai and internationally, we look to ramp up our recruitment efforts to enhance human capital development and facilitate the growth of our organization. Attracting the right talent lies within the fabric of our organization and is a key contributor to driving our success. Emiratization will remain a key priority for us as we continue to pursue new projects in Dubai and beyond and remain committed to reaching 50% Emiratization by 2021. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the chamber implementing smooth and accurate administrative procedures to enable PPP legislation?</h4><p>
	We recently unveiled key objectives and initiatives in our 2017-2021 strategy, which is centered on creating a favorable business environment and improving the ease of doing business within the Emirate. It is a customer-oriented strategy that aims to boost competitiveness and growth within the private sector in line with the Dubai Plan 2021. The strategy is supported by four pillars, which include promoting Dubai as a global business hub, creating a favorable business environment, supporting the development of business in Dubai, and becoming the best chamber in the world. When we consider the ambitious targets of the Dubai Plan 2021 and UAE Vision 2021, it is clear that PPPs are the fastest way to boost competitiveness.
</p><h4>
	What efforts are there within government entities to adopt smart technologies and innovate internally?
</h4><p>
	The UAE has emerged as a global standard-bearer for e-government in recent years. The government was ranked the most tech-savvy in the region. The UAE's National Innovation Strategy will continue to help the country realize its ambition of becoming one of the most innovative nations in the world. The initiative requires all government entities to reduce spending and dedicate savings to research and innovation projects. More than 2,000 government services are mandated to be made available through mobile and electronic mediums, and the majority have already made that transition. The UAE has set a target for 80% of government services to be accessible through mobile devices by 2018.</p><h4>There have been several recent efforts to develop trade with Latin American nations. What role can the UAE play in developing this?</h4><p>
	Dubai's total non-oil trade with Latin America amounted to AED17.41 billion (USD4.7 billion) in 2016, a 29% increase on 2010. Yet when we look at the vast resources that both sides offer, you see the huge potential to expand the volume and scope of bilateral trade. Latin American countries are among the world's top agricultural exporters and stand to benefit from collaborating with Dubai on food security. The expansion of direct flights between Dubai and Latin America has opened the door to new opportunities for economic cooperation. Several Latin American governments have unveiled large-scale infrastructure investment plans to enhance roads, railways, ports, and airports across the region, which are all areas where UAE businesses can provide their expertise and investment.</p><h4>Along with China, the UAE is one of the largest sources of FDI in Pakistan. What impact will the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have on freight volumes and transshipment?</h4><p>
	We expect this initiative to be a game-changer for global trade, mobility, and connectivity. Given our strong trade relations with Pakistan and China, CPEC should positively impact the Emirate's trade with these countries, removing barriers and reducing transportation costs. CPEC is closely related to China's One Belt One Road Initiative, which seeks to link China to the Middle East through Central Asia. The UAE stands to play a critical role as an investment and trade hub along the New Silk Road with strategic access to the rest of the Middle East region, as well as emerging markets across Africa and South Asia. This corridor is also good news for GCC countries, as they will be able to transfer oil and gas to China through a 3,000-km land route rather than a 12,000-km sea journey. The UAE, in particular, is well-placed to benefit from this initiative, by helping China meet its energy needs, while enhanced connectivity is expected to strengthen trade relations between the countries. Dubai Chamber has made China a key focus of its expansion strategy by recently opening a representative office in Shanghai to explore the trade and investment opportunities in China that offer the most potential for its members. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Home of the Talented]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[home-of-the-talented]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the origins of Mohammed V University?</h4><p>At the time of the inception of the university, UAE students were studying at Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco, which is known for being one of the world's most outstanding universities in Islamic studies. However, in line with an emphasis on developing local knowledge and talent in primary, secondary, and, of course, tertiary education, the Abu Dhabi government decided to open a branch of this university in Abu Dhabi to enable national students to continue their studies in their home country, and to enrich the community here. With the opening of a satellite university comes both advantages and challenges. On the one hand, it is vital that we maintain global standards of excellence—not only corresponding to the levels put in place by our colleagues in Rabat, but also worldwide—as well as staying on top of the latest educational developments more generally. On the other hand, we are privileged to be able to mine the deep experience of our colleagues in Mohammed V University Rabat, harnessing the benefits brought by their rich personnel and infrastructure capacity. The leadership of Abu Dhabi gives full attention and support to secondary and tertiary education in order to reach global standards.</p><h4>How does Mohammed V University seek to maintain the international standards of its faculty and student body?</h4><p>Mohammed V University has set up a system to recruit talent and faculty members, enforcing global standard requirements in terms of qualifications and skill sets. On the one hand, prospective teachers are subject to a rigorous selection process overviewed by a specialist scientific committee that collects information from previous workplaces and trains the selected professors to further develop their capacities and make sure they pass the probationary period of one semester to be fully enrolled. On the other hand, Mohammed V University Abu Dhabi seeks to attract good students relying on their eagerness to continue their education in Islamic studies or Arabic literature. And all said, the numbers speak for themselves. The employment rate among Mohammed V University Abu Dhabi's graduates has reached 98%. This result was obtained through specialized research, extensive career counseling, benchmark assessments based on the labor market, a mandatory 100-hour-internship course, and employment agreements with professional parties. There is a strong demand for Mohammed V University Abu Dhabi's graduates as the number of jobs required in the labor market exceeds the number of graduate students. This demand is expected to remain at least for the next decade.</p><h4>Can you walk us through the curriculum of Mohammed V University Abu Dhabi and how the institution positions itself with regards to the educational push from government?</h4><p>Islamic education plays a fundamental role in in Abu Dhabi's educational priorities as the Emirate seeks to convey Islam's accurate message of moderation, tolerance, and openness to world cultures with humanitarian values. Mohammed V University Abu Dhabi thus offers two knowledge fields: Islamic studies and Arabic literature. Both disciplines are presented through modern and general knowledge to contribute to sustainable social development activities. And all of this is carried out in accordance with international standards. Of course, we face the challenge of students being attracted to more traditional programs such as business administration, human resources, media studies, and law. However, I believe that higher education in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi will achieve a great leap in the coming years due to the serious and promising future planning based on best practices, along with the availability of human and financial capabilities. Finally, we have implemented a plan for Emiratization in cooperation with the Emiratization Authority in Abu Dhabi for the 2016-2020 period. In this regard, we have reached a high standard and are continuing on our path to full Emiratization within the next decade.</p><h4>What are the main strategic goals Mohammed V University Abu Dhabi has set for itself in the medium term?</h4><p>A strategic plan for Mohammed V University Abu Dhabi for 2020 was implemented in 2016 in line with the Abu Dhabi 2030 plan. In this respect, we seek to develop a promising generation that contributes to the services of the homeland and society through an active, high-level participation in the labor market and in Islamic affairs services. In order to achieve this, our university needs internally to maintain an efficient financial system and integrated administrative legislation based on distinctive human resource management. Externally, we need to gain a prominent media reputation in order to highlight the wide array of top-level services we offer and our strong social development commitment. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>I believe that higher education in the UAE and at Mohammed V University Abu Dhabi will be improved in the coming years due to proper planning at the top of the Ministry of Higher Education and Mohammed V University. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai continued to lead the region in attracting FDI and climbed up in global FDI destination rankings in 2016. What is the outlook for FDI inflows to Dubai in the current global business environment?</h4><p>FDI plays a vital role in strengthening Dubai's economic sustainability and competitiveness. We remain positive about the outlook for FDI inflows to Dubai in the coming years thanks to high investor confidence and the Dubai Plan 2021, which is transforming Dubai into one of the smartest and most sustainable cities in the world. In 2016, Dubai ranked third globally, after London and Singapore, in the number of FDI projects, which is a clear indicator of a strong diversified economic growth. Dubai managed as well to maintain its leading position in the region and ranked seventh in FDI capital inflows despite the challenging global economic environment. Moreover, in a few years Dubai will host Expo 2020. The mega event has already created new opportunities for both leading global businesses and SMEs to be partners in infrastructure development and service delivery.</p><h4>The bankruptcy law has now been implemented and will presumably boost Dubai's Ease of Doing Business ranking. How does the entity envisage that this will affect the flows of FDI?</h4><p>There is no doubt that improved regulations address investor concerns and indicate maturity and an improved confidence in Dubai's business environment. Dubai has established clear FDI policy leadership and continues to lead with modern regulatory frameworks to keep pace with the economic shifts and new business models. We see a positive impact on FDI flows moving forward, as we work in close partnership with private sector leaders to introduce new future-ready policy levers and create new opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs.</p><h4>Dubai FDI launched Dubai FDI Monitor in 2016. How is accuracy being maintained when investments are taking a more unorthodox form; for instance, with freelance visas, emerging sectors becoming more prominent, and companies based upon intangible assets?</h4><p>Dubai FDI Monitor maps out the investment landscape in Dubai through tracking, validating, and analyzing FDI flows as part of Dubai FDI's data analytics and foresight program. This is the first-ever FDI monitor at a city level and the feedback on the reporting service has been extremely positive. As a service to foreign investors, we support decision-makers who will now be able to analyze FDI trends and opportunities in Dubai by sector, geographic clusters, and source countries. The FDI results and trend analysis reports are based on international classification standards (NACIS) and fDi Markets data as well as our tracking technology and database. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the service provided is accurate and current, taking into consideration that the data is updated in real time. As part of our continual improvement process we are now tracking M&amp;As and new forms of investment, which both reflect the economic maturity of the domestic economic base and allow us to monitor FDI activities of joint ventures, strategic partnerships, alliances, sub-contracting, and license arrangements.</p><h4>Dubai has been moving up the Global Innovation Index and now ranks as the most innovative Arab nation. Which sources and channels of FDI have been particularly pivotal in assisting that move?</h4><p>The UAE National Agenda 2021 is set to drive the knowledge economy contribution to reach 5% of GDP. The UAE Innovation Strategy and the Higher Policy for Science, Technology and Innovation played an important role in galvanizing efforts at the federal and local levels to climb up on the Global Innovation Index ranking. Major global players in the financial and ICT industries today choose Dubai as a regional innovation center. FDI in R&amp;D activities in Dubai was 1% of total capital flows in 2015 and it has improved dramatically to reach 5% in 2016. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	How do you see the role of twofour54 in Abu Dhabi today?
</h4><p>
	twofour54 was established a decade ago to play an instrumental role in developing the media sector in Abu Dhabi. We do this in three ways. The first is that we attract content creators and media companies from all around the world to Abu Dhabi. The second is we support these companies by providing a vibrant ecosystem that offers all the facilities they require to grow their business, and a community of like-minded individuals to collaborate, innovate, and create. The third way we help develop the media sector in Abu Dhabi is through talent development initiatives that offer training, internship and job opportunities for the next generation of media professionals. We are proud that as we approach our 10th anniversary we have attracted more the 460 regional and international companies, while 37% of our partners are Emirati owned and we have contributed to the economy of Abu Dhabi by creating jobs and driving value. Equally, we are proud that the content that has been created in our ecosystem has entertained and opened the hearts and minds of people across the world.</p><h4>How does film production fit into the media strategy of Media Zone Authority - Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>
	Film production is at the core of our strategy. Attracting big production studios and filming blockbusters in Abu Dhabi has a huge impact on developing the media sector. From a positioning perspective, movies such as Disney's Star Wars and Universal's Fast &amp; Furious 7 have put Abu Dhabi on the global map as a versatile and attractive filming location. Indian blockbuster Tiger Zinda Hau alone exposed Abu Dhabi to a staggering 592 million Bollywood fans. There is also the positive economic impact from filming in Abu Dhabi. It has been estimated that for each dirham spent through our 30% cash rebate programme, an average of AED3.1 is returned to Abu Dhabi. Moreover, these film productions attract companies within the supply chain as well as talent, growing the ecosystem even further and supporting it with access to great opportunities.</p><h4>How is the education sector in Abu Dhabi involved in fostering talent in media?</h4><p>
	Everyone understands the important role media plays in our day-to-day life and in business and politics. Many universities and educational institutions in Abu Dhabi have dedicated programmes for media and the creative industries. And we at twofour54 have relationships with all of them as part of our internship programme I mentioned before. We are also working closely with these entities to align the curricula with the rapidly changing needs of content creators as well as change the perception of the industry.</p><h4>How does the media sector fit into the economic Vision 2030 for Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>
	Media is one of the 12 sectors identified in Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030 as the growth sectors that will help the Emirate achieve its agenda of economic diversification. As such, the government has committed to invest in the best technology in the world to ensure the media sector not only flourishes but stays at the cutting edge of innovation. And we are already reaping the rewards from these investments. If we look at job creation, in twofour54 alone we have 4,000 jobs including freelancers. And the economic contribution of the twofour54 community reached AED1.5 billion in 2016. In addition, we are storytellers, creating content that showcases Abu Dhabi and its achievements to the world.</p><h4>What UAE values would you like to see promoted outside and inside the country?</h4><p>
	We firmly believe that the four values the nation is celebrating in 2018, the “Year of Zayed," namely wisdom, respect, sustainability, and human development, should be the foundations for all nations. Respect is a key value of the UAE; many discussions on this issue began when the Ministry of Tolerance was inaugurated. However, for us at twofour54, respect is about more than just a ministry; it is embedded in our genes, and with 200 nationalities in the Emirate, we welcome everyone to call this their home. In our community, twofour54, and the media sector, we always aim to bring people together and create stories about who we are. We need to make our narrative and voice stronger to bring people together. Equally, developing people is a vital part of plans to develop a diverse, knowledge-based economy, and, of course, sustainability is a value everyone on the planet needs to have close to their hearts if we are to preserve our environment for future generations. If the children of today grow up and hear and learn the values of His Highness Sheikh Zayed, we will not only be investing in the future of media, but will be building a stronger world. And let's not forget, none of this would be possible without the wisdom of our nation's leaders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abu Dhabi Ports presented one of its best annual results to date in 2016. What were the major accomplishments for the company's development over this period?</h4><p>Last year we had quite a successful run. At the time we closed our books, our performance for 2016 reflected a 152% increase in our net profit, 15% increase in revenue, and a 90% increase in our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA); our customs contribution jumped to 70%. We contributed 3% to non-oil GDP in 2015, and we expect the number to increase for 2016 once we obtain the results. We handled 1.54 million TEUs in 2016, reaching a total of more than 5 million since the inception of Khalifa Port in late 2012. We handled more than 17.8 million tons of general cargo and bulk, hitting the highest record in the Emirate, with a 16% increase. Cruise passenger traffic is also estimated to grow by 8% in 2016/2017, with over 250,000 cruises from 137 ship calls. We opened a new cruise beach destination in Sir Bani Yas Island and also completed the second phase of the warehouses in Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (KIZAD) by adding an additional 64 warehouses. We leased more than 2.1sqkm in 2016. Furthermore, we continued to put Khalifa Port and Abu Dhabi on the map of global trade through a major agreement we signed with the Chinese company COSCO under the One Belt, One Road initiative, which has selected Khalifa Port to be its hub in the region.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi has its eyes set on the exporting industries as a driver of economic growth. As the manager of the leading export hub in the country, how is Abu Dhabi Ports contributing?</h4><p>Responding to the rising demand from both foreign direct and existing investors wanting to establish and grow their manufacturing and industrial business in UAE free zones, we have launched Khalifa Port Free Trade Zone, the largest free zone in the region with a total size of 100sqkm. We are currently in the process of leasing plots but this will take some time between signing the agreement and having factories up and running. We already signed a couple of agreements that will see 15-20 factories or logistics providers up and running, and when this area is fully built, the real contribution to GDP will be visible.</p><h4>What would you like to attract to KIZAD that could take it to the next level when it is fully operational?</h4><p>The beauty of KIZAD is that we made it in clusters that we defined according to Abu Dhabi's needs and the parameters of Vision 2030. KIZAD has highly targeted sectors coming into its facilities. On top of that, there are some sector-centric enablers such as EMAL for aluminum, Borouge for plastic and polymers, and other companies alike. We have already established the high-end players as anchors for other companies, so we are expecting the middle and low stream players related to these industries to follow suit. The plan is to have sectorial clusters and we are marketing all of these clusters in parallel. All of these industries are part of a bigger vision of what Abu Dhabi and the UAE needs in terms of industry and logistical providers.</p><h4>The popularity of Khalifa Port has facilitated its prompt expansion. What have been the major advances in this regard?</h4><p>The port is fairly new with just about four years of operations, but it has already stirred high demand. We recently expanded it by 1km and are also deepening the channel and the basin from 16.5m to 18.5m to cater to the biggest ships sailing today and in the foreseeable future. We added 1km of quay wall and the adjacent land, which is a substantial area as well. The agreement we signed with COSCO was also a motive for this expansion, as the deal will add 3.6 million TEUs per annum. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SGBL announced in late 2017 the acquisition of KBL Richelieu bank in France and KBL bank Monaco. How does this acquisition fit into SGBL's strategy and how was it funded? </h4><p>We are very excited about this latest acquisition because it enables SGBL Group to offer a complete suite of wealth management and private banking services. It forms part of SGBL's ambitious yet selective international expansion strategy developed by the Board of Directors with the aim of delivering more world-class services and unrivalled connectivity to the leading regional and global financial hubs. Through this acquisition, SGBL is launching a full platform for private banking, wealth management, and asset management that is integrated between France, Monaco, and Abu Dhabi. The platform leverages the valuable experience at our newly acquired entities and the unparalleled access to global markets they provide to bring world-class investment solutions and advice to our Lebanese, European, Gulf, and regional markets. France is a major global financial center and Europe's largest asset management market, with a superb track record of success in managing private wealth, so we are excited to be launching our platform from there. We expect the acquisition of KBL Richelieu bank in France, its subsidiary Richelieu Gestion, and KBL bank Monaco to be finalized in the first half of 2018, subject to approval from the Lebanese, French, European, and Monegasque regulatory authorities. They have a combined equity of around EUR150 million and over EUR3 billion in assets under management, and will operate as part of a newly established entity, Compagnie Financií¨re Richelieu (Richelieu group), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SGBL group. We see immense potential synergies between Compagnie Financií¨re Richelieu's product offering and SGBL's banking services and extensive network in Lebanon, Jordan, Cyprus, and the UAE. In particular, Richelieu Gestion will offer global products that are designed specifically to answer to the unique needs of our clients across the region. Furthermore, we are proud to be opening a new era of development in France and Monaco through our commitment to developing a long-term industrial project for the Richelieu Bank and all of its employees. In terms of financing, SGBL is a highly liquid and well-capitalized bank with a total equity of USD1.8 billion and a capital adequacy ratio of 17.75% as of September 30, 2017, considerably higher than Basel III and Central Bank requirements, so we have significant internal resources we can leverage to fund the acquisition.</p><h4>SGBL also recently launched a new bank in Abu Dhabi. What role does it play within the SGBL network and what services does it offer?</h4><p>SGBL Group's expansion into the Gulf marks another milestone in the group's growth strategy and follows similar moves in the past into Cyprus and Jordan. Liberty International Bank Limited (LIB), which is wholly owned by SGBL, is the first bank to launch operations at the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) financial center. Following the acquisitions in France and Monaco, LIB will operate as Banque Richelieu Abu Dhabi within our new private banking, wealth management, and asset management platform. It will offer corporate, institutional, and private management products and services designed by Richelieu Gestion exclusively for professional clients and market counterparties in the region. We take pride in having received approvals in record time, thanks to our full compliance with the requirements set by supervisory authorities in Lebanon and the UAE. SGBL's impeccable track record and excellent reputation helped us quickly earn the confidence of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the regulator of ADGM, and contributed to the development of a close collaborative relationship between us.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for 2018?</h4><p>Domestically, we are committed to supporting economic development across all Lebanese territories through our extensive branch network and our plethora of innovative products. At the regional and international levels, we are constantly on the lookout for growth opportunities, whether in new markets, new market segments, or new business lines. To that end, we are focused on implementing a prudent domestic and international expansion strategy that leverages SGBL's strong reputation and financial strength. This strategy is designed to help our clients seamlessly connect to global financial markets and more effectively respond to emerging opportunities and risk. The launch of LIB in Abu Dhabi and the acquisition of KBL Richelieu bank in France and KBL bank Monaco thus serve as testaments to SGBL's unrelenting drive to provide its clients an unrivalled banking experience backed by a complete and competitive product lineup. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Every year, the renewable energy world turns its attention to ADSW. What is the impact of this global event, and how has it contributed to positioning Abu Dhabi as a leader in renewable energy?</h4><p>ADSW has played, and continues to play, an important role in positioning Abu Dhabi at the forefront of the renewable energy sector. It is the largest gathering on sustainability in the Middle East, and it has become established as a truly global forum which brings together governments, policymakers, business leaders, and industry experts from across the world. The event addresses a regional and global need for a common platform that tackles a number of critical and interrelated issues. Its aim is to further our collective understanding of the major energy, economic, and technological trends shaping the world's sustainable development. More than that, it is about empowering the global community to respond. The value and importance of ADSW can be seen from its sustained growth into an eight-day event that brings together a wide variety of stakeholders to drive the adoption of renewables and sustainability. The figures speak for themselves; in 2016, we welcomed five heads of state and 73 government ministers to the event, as well as around 1,700 CEOs from different industries. In total, around 38,000 people participated from 175 countries. In 2017, ADSW welcomed major delegations from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and India for the first time, and another 18 countries had pavilions. This very clearly demonstrates that ADSW is a global platform that strongly supports Abu Dhabi's leadership position in renewable energy.</p><h4>Masdar City has become one of Abu Dhabi's landmark initiatives. How has this project set a precedent for other eco-friendly cities around the globe, and how has it attracted global tenants to its facilities?</h4><p>Masdar City is one of the world's most sustainable urban developments and its name is recognized throughout the world. One of the most important factors behind this is that we have kept true to our philosophy that urban development should be based on the economic, social, and environmental pillars of sustainability, with the goal of providing a high quality of life with a low environmental footprint. This integrated approach has enabled us to provide a workable template that others can follow, especially here in the Middle East. Masdar City is today experiencing the most rapid development since it was established, and it has evolved from an entirely self-funded initiative into one driven by partnership. This allows the city to grow at a commercially sustainable pace, while at the same time sharing best practices with wider industry, which is a key part of Masdar's mandate to support the diversification of the UAE economy. </p><h4>What are some of the flagship projects you have invested in abroad, and how are they transforming the energy landscape of developing nations? </h4><p>Masdar has played a central role in deploying renewable energy in the UAE, the wider Middle East, and further abroad. We have invested in renewable energy projects with a combined value of USD8.5 billion over the last decade, of which Masdar's share is worth approximately USD2.7 billion. The gross capacity of these projects, which are either operational or under development, is 2.7GW. We are active across the full spectrum of clean energy projects, from the world's largest utility scale offshore wind farm currently in operation, the London Array in the UK, to a number of small-scale solar home systems. The 117MW onshore Tafila Wind Farm in Jordan was the first commercial utility-scale wind power project in the Middle East. Also under development in Jordan is the 200MW Baynouna Solar Energy Project, the country's largest solar power plant. Our work is truly international, from the Middle East and Africa to Europe, Asia, and the South Pacific. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the development of renewable energy in Abu Dhabi in the year ahead, and what will be Masdar's focus?</h4><p>Through Masdar, Abu Dhabi and the UAE are embracing the huge potential that renewable energy and sustainability offer economies to energize growth, foster advanced R&amp;D, and find solutions to global challenges. In doing this, we are accelerating the development of our industry. Masdar will continue to support the momentum of renewable energy development in Abu Dhabi. We can be very optimistic about the future as we continue to build on recent successes, in line with the double-digit capacity growth that the renewable energy sector is experiencing. Masdar's evolution from being a catalyst for the adoption of renewable energy and sustainability into a market leader will continue. We will see this through our ability to invest at scale, as well as through the diversity of our operations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which economic sectors represent the bulk of FDI and where would you like to see investment flow in the coming years?</h4><p>According to the Statistics Centre - Abu Dhabi, FDI increased by 8% to reach AED95 billion by the end of 2016. Data indicates that most economic activities last year registered positive investment flows, especially manufacturing, construction, IT and telecommunications, financial institutions, and insurance, which was despite the 13% fall in FDI flows in that same year. These statistics reflect the competitive business environment of Abu Dhabi. To create economic diversification, the government of Abu Dhabi is working on bolstering the economy and business climate to merge Abu Dhabi with the international economy by attracting more foreign investment with more focus on the sectors that were specified in Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030. The Abu Dhabi Investment Office, under ADDED, is working on a strategic plan for the Emirate to attract FDI in non-oil strategic sectors. To achieve that goal, the Abu Dhabi Investment Office is working on promoting the Emirate as a global favored investment location and providing value-added services to potential investors. Abu Dhabi depends on FDI coming from Europe, which makes up 14% of the total, compared to 8% from Arab countries, 3% from the GCC, and 10% from Asian countries. In close collaboration with the Ministry of Economy, every year ADDED organizes and participates under the UAE Pavilion at Hanover Messe, in Germany, one of the largest specialized industrial fairs in the world. We also send delegations to Japan, China, Korea, and India, some of the biggest target markets in Asia, in addition to participating in the Annual Investment Meeting Dubai (AIM), an important platform that many countries participate in. The Abu Dhabi Investment Office plans to organize The Abu Dhabi Investment Week in a number of countries that have special economic relationships and large projects with Abu Dhabi in order to promote investment opportunities in the Emirate.</p><h4>How will the new industrial plan propel Abu Dhabi's manufacturing and exporting sectors and what role does the plan play in the Emirate's diversification efforts?</h4><p>ADDED, represented by the Industry Development Bureau, takes into consideration all factors that support the industrial sector and targets specific activities that contribution to Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030. During the upcoming term, Abu Dhabi's industrial strategic plan focuses on providing a supporting environment for the industrial sector in priority areas such as industrial financing, protecting intellectual property, and foreign property laws. The aim is to support investors, bolster competitiveness, and achieve the industrial strategy. The manufacturing sector grew by 0.5% between 2015 and 2016, from AED50.3 million to AED50.6 million. Manufacturing accounted for 6.9% of GDP in 2016, which demonstrates the importance of the sector to the wider economy.</p><h4>What are some of the leading initiatives ADDED supports to foster innovation in Abu Dhabi and promote the funding of SMEs and start-ups?</h4><p>The Takamul program, which was launched in 2011, has implemented many activities since its launch, including supporting patents and enforcing the connection between inventors and concerned sectors, in addition to a continuous effort to improve the services it provides to inventors, universities, and other parties concerned with inventions and managing innovation pockets in many major local companies. Takamul's support for patents starts with registration at the patents office in the Ministry of Economy, where the program pays for the initial registration fee and lawyer fees to handle the details of the invention and respond to appeals against the patent. Takamul has supported more than 200 patents since 2011 and approved 60 patents in 2017. In addition, the program includes many new projects that ADDED plans to launch during 2017, and Takamul has a dependable financing application that includes establishing intellectual property rules, implementing an in-depth commercial value analysis, and building and executing a business plan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What best practices have you adopted from your partners globally to transform the national media landscape in the UAE?</h4><p>The largest area for growth is probably the digital media aspect, where global changes are leading the way. We saw the best practices in different areas and we understand the engagement model. Whether it is Netflix or Amazon, we look at these companies that care deeply about the digital platforms and we engage with them in their ambitions to conquer the local market. Advising on the viability of local content and where the demand might be is part of our engagement with international players. At the same time, we tackle the learning curve for digital media and understand what media represents and how we can use the platforms that are booming at the moment. One of our main objectives is to develop Arabic content and we also want to build upon these partnerships to promote locally developed content, from video and cinema to gaming.</p><h4>How has legislation on national media changed according to the UAE's transformation into a sophisticated, more globally integrated nation in the global arena?</h4><p>One of our major preoccupations is how to bring the legislative framework governing the media in sync with the realities of the digital era. There are many legislative initiatives that we have either completed or are in the process of finalizing—classification of all published materials, including films, according to the age groups they are suitable for, a comprehensive legal framework for digital and online media, and the easing of licensing processes with maximum reliance on online platforms, for example. We are currently reviewing our legislative framework in its entirety to see to what extent it conforms to the realities of a digital era.</p><h4>You support local content and support the readers who would consume that content. What are your strategies to attract publishers and editors, as well as foster readership in the country?</h4><p>The Reading Law was launched in 2016 to foster reading as a habit and improve readership. Part of the initiative of that law is to support the publishing industry, which we are responsible for. At present, we want to help the publishing industry to classify books and to reengineer our processes. We are also revising the licensing process to make it shorter and easier for the publisher to publish more books. We also started an initiative to support publishers who find the costs of printing too high, if their content promotes our local culture and identity, we subsidize the cost of printing. Furthermore, we are currently involved in the process of finalizing some decisive measures to enhance digital and information literacy in the UAE. It will cover a wide range of issues relating to our everyday aspects of digital literacy. </p><h4>The NMC is in the midst of its 2017-2021 Strategic Plan. What target have you set your eyes on for the development of the local media industry?</h4><p>We are now fully invested in providing our online services to the best international standards and we are working on legislation to regulate online and digital media to the highest standard. Our objective is to ensure that the legislative environment for the media sector in its entirety in the UAE is on par with the best anywhere in the world. We will grow our partnership network, such as the MoU we recently signed with Abu Dhabi University to enhance a new generation of competent media persons in the UAE, who are rooted in the local cultural milieu on the one hand and wired to the global scene on the other. We want all of our services to be digitally available and we want all our licenses to be viewable from mobile devices. For the NMC, our strategy is to be up to date with innovative solutions that can provide information to the public to facilitate the UAE's ambitious plans. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are innovation and creativity pushing the country's development, and which sectors have benefited the most from investments in these areas?</h4><p>Ever since the government began laying the foundation for an environment that fosters knowledge and innovation, we have seen higher interest in entrepreneurship as a direct result of SMEs and start-ups getting access to much-needed funding. Efforts for human capacity building, especially among citizens, are ramped up to complement the country's steady modern-day growth. Knowledge and innovation play a crucial role in the country's efforts to diversify its sources of income as well by building an industrial environment fueled by knowledge, innovation, modern technology, and scientific R&amp;D. Additionally, sustainability enablers are empowered through the enactment of important policies aimed at promoting faster industrial growth in line with UAE Vision 2021. All sectors are fully committed to the UAE's bid to adopt a knowledge- and innovation-driven economy thanks to their proven benefits and necessity. At the Ministry of Economy, for instance, we have launched 12 relevant initiatives and 39 projects covering a wide spectrum of creative developmental activities, specialized micro-projects, and manufacturing and research initiatives.</p><h4>With a 16% share of the national GDP, the industrial sector has been positioned as the beacon for economic diversification. What have been the major advances in this regard during 2016?</h4><p>In 2016, we witnessed a high-performing and vibrant local industrial sector on account of a strong economy supported by key government policies such as the economic diversification strategy. The sector's core areas have remained resilient despite global uncertainties thanks in part to this all-encompassing strategy, which also seeks to reinforce the performance and efficiency of the local business community. The UAE is now in fact the third-most efficient market in terms of goods, which could be viewed as the result of our government's efforts to reduce our reliance on oil. The non-oil sector's GDP contributions in 2015 climbed to about 77% at current prices and 70% at constant prices. For our part, the ministry is fully committed to doing its share by continually supporting investment spending on strategic and value-added projects.</p><h4>The newly implemented Bankruptcy Law has raised expectations regarding better practice for indebted SMEs. What is your view of the impact of the law on the SMEs and the national economy?</h4><p>The government has enacted the law and undertaken other measures precisely to fuel the growth of SMEs. Increased incentives, establishment of a common definition for SMEs, and provision of modern facilities and benefits tailored to fit the needs of SME owners and local entrepreneurs have been put in place to initiate growth and development in the sector. The approval of the Executive Regulations to the Federal Law on SME projects to incentivize local businesses and provide them with access to funding has further stimulated its expansion. The Ministry of Economy has forged strategic partnerships with various countries to further invigorate the SME sector, improve its competitiveness, ensure its sustainable growth, and widen its reach by facilitating its entry to new foreign markets, with emphasis on innovation, technology, and knowledge.</p><h4>What are the economic prospects of the ongoing plan to build a vibrant knowledge-based economy in the UAE in terms of job creation, attracting young entrepreneurs, and contributing to the country's economic diversification?</h4><p>All our efforts are geared toward putting the UAE in the top-10 countries on the Global Innovation Index, in line with UAE Vision 2021. The UAE has already achieved significant milestones and progress in its journey towards economic prosperity, as evidenced by its inclusion in the 2016 Global Innovation Index. The Ministry of Economy has also opened the state-of-the-art International Centre of Patent Registration (ICPR) in collaboration with its South Korean partner. The new international center will also conduct a skills development-training program for professionals in the field of intellectual property as well as pursue research on relevant topics. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the mandate of the Space Agency adapted to the evolution of the space sector?</h4><p>The entire UAE Space program has established roots and can be credited to the late Sheikh Zayed's vision in the 1970s, when he started asking questions about space missions. At that time, there was no specific program, though there was an underlying interest in educating people. In 1997, Thuraya Telecommunications Company was set up, the first mobile satellite communications company that now owns and operates two geostationary satellites. Then, the Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology was launched, which later merged with Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre. Mubadala established YahSat in 2007, and the government realized it needed an umbrella in 2014 to oversee all these players, creating the UAE Space Agency, and outlined its mission to Mars as part of its National Space Vision. The significance of this Mars mission is dual in its nature. For the government, the most important thing has been the journey, not the destination; namely, how many people we can inspire, how much we can learn, and how many skills we can acquire. In addition, we try to include a scientific purpose to the entire journey to understand what learning lessons can be transferred on Earth. We need to team up with the international space community to ask big questions not specific to countries, but to humanity.</p><h4>What major learning points is the UAE Space Agency taking from the financial and legal framework being set up for the Mars mission?</h4><p>We were also mandated by the government to create a sustainable space program and to do so we need quality and precision, which requires us to work by the book. People are busy with social and political problems, though we are trying to show our regional neighbors that even in these hard times through science and technology one can regain world respect and demonstrate it is possible. We are working on a Space Law and will be one of the few countries with a comprehensive space regulatory framework. Our space program is for peaceful reasons, and it requires long-term planning, focusing on human capacity, and the next space engineers. This is where we work with universities and research centers, and push for social media and awareness campaigns.</p><h4>How does the UAE Space Agency seek to strike a balance between transferring technology skills and knowledge and maintaining control over its intellectual property?</h4><p>We are hungry for knowledge and cooperating with international space agencies provides a fantastic overlap. We need to work and engage with people in a practical way. We send people to work with international agencies to be exposed to what other scientists are doing and the best practices. We are active; we have signed over 20 agreements and have established an international advisory committee. We want to receive advice from people from all over the world, each with their own sectorial knowledge, within the space industry. We meet twice a year and they help us engage with different stakeholders.</p><h4>What is the best way forward to attract and promote young Emiratis to become space scientists and technology pioneers?</h4><p>The UAE has announced a plan to establish a human space flight program to develop astronauts. These are all big projects that have spurred a great deal of interest from young people. Our regional neighbors are looking on with curiosity at our efforts. Most international space agencies come here because they appreciate what we are doing in this small country.</p><h4>How can the UAE spacy industry develop a solid private ecosystem?</h4><p>We are putting in place the right regulation to attract and protect investment in the UAE space program. The government is funding exploration missions, though we want to see the private sector play a greater role, similar to YahSat for example, in bringing value and assets into the country. I assisted to the launch of Al Yah 3 satellite, which will provide vital connectivity to over 600 million people in Brazil and South America. We are also looking at strategies to attract international investors, working with local governments. We are harvesting the space program to showcase the world our competitive advantage. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the aviation industry in the UAE in recent years, and what opportunities remain? </h4><p>Historically, growth in the UAE has been mostly focused on building capacity in airports and airlines. This has seen UAE national carriers double their seat capacity every few years for the past two decades. Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah have made huge investments in upgrading the runways and terminals at their respective airports. In addition to this, GCAA has undertaken an airspace restructuring project to increase the existing capacity in our skies. This multi-phased project will take some time, but we expect it to result in a multifold increase in capacity in the coming years. MROs and general aviation are the areas where I expect to see the most growth in the future. On our part, we are implementing initiatives to stimulate investment, especially in these particular areas. For example, GCAA will be hosting the 2nd Investment in Aviation Summit this year, and we are confident that such endeavors will lead to tangible outcomes in the near future.<br>Abu Dhabi and Dubai are both becoming international aviation hubs. What strengths do each have to encourage the sustainable growth of local aviation?<br>As HH Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman of Emirates, said, “One-third of the world's population, nearly 2 billion people, live within a four-hour flight from Dubai International, and 80% within 12 hours." This is a natural geographic advantage of the UAE. The country's leadership has an ambitious vision to diversify the economy, and the aviation industry is central to any such effort, whether through trade or tourism. Additionally, industry growth is dependent on the quality of infrastructure. The UAE is recognized as having the best road transport infrastructure globally, and the second-best air transport infrastructure. Our open skies policy is yet another catalyst to enhance connectivity and sustainable growth. Together with stakeholders like national airlines, airports, and academic institutions, we are working on stimulating innovation and creativity that we are certain will yield long-term, sustainable results.</p><h4>With the expansion of airport facilities, air routes, and e-services, what will be the main focus for GCAA to strengthen the sector, and what do you expect in the future?</h4><p>Some of the current changes in the industry relate to technology, while others are related to the policy environment. Drone technology will most likely create a massive shift in the industry. I expect to see a proliferation of that technology for both non-traditional usage such as surveillance or topography, and traditional aviation services such as the transportation of goods and passengers. GCAA is developing a sound regulatory framework to ensure that we stay ahead of the curve. As for policy issues, we occasionally see a tightening in the market, especially in times of economic downturn. We are determined to maintain open skies in the UAE and promote global liberalization.</p><h4>After 10 years of operations, what have been the main contributions of GCAA to the development of the industry in the UAE?</h4><p>In the last 10 years, we have made quantum leaps toward achieving a safe and sound industry. We have worked first and foremost on strengthening our resources both in number and in knowledge. The GCAA created the necessary structures, defined roles and responsibilities, overhauled its regulations, created industry committees, and improved its services to be on par with the best practices in the world. This was attested by the results of the audits we underwent, all of which we passed with flying colors. Furthermore, we have built a strong team of inspectorate staff capable of executing effective oversight and resolving safety issues that is also very customer oriented. This balance between the two hats of enforcer and customer service was very tricky. As such, GCAA has put in place policies and strategies to ensure that neither of the two roles negatively impact the other. We take pride in the excellent relationship we have with stakeholders, which is what has really made the difference. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the ministry's main developments and achievements over the past year?</h4><p>To ensure the highest levels of healthcare, the Minister of Health &amp; Prevention has set up health centers staffed by professional family doctors. The ministry has sought to improve the capabilities of these centers and now has a total of 77 centers in the Emirate. Over the past few years, the medical staff have expanded their services to cover the various needs of the community. In primary healthcare, there have been successes in many programs in areas such as periodic examination, pre-marriage counselling, mental health, health promotion, and continuing medical education. Primary care has been at the forefront of our strategies for the development of comprehensive health programs, the most important of which is the early detection programs for the prevention of genetic disease, including neonatal diseases. This program will help us to establish a national record of congenital malformations and genetic diseases in the UAE. The aim of this program is to protect children from mental and physical disabilities, and to reduce the number of deaths. The program was established in 1999 and succeeded in detecting many of these distortions. In international accreditations, the percentage of international funds for our health centers has increased, and the Joint International Accreditation Committee is continuing to cover the Ministry of Health &amp; Prevention's centers until 2021.</p><h4>Statistically, cardiac and chronic diseases pose the biggest threat to life in the UAE. How is the ministry tackling these issues?</h4><p>Our leadership is committed to addressing this as the biggest cause of death in the Emirates. Our centers and clinics, as well as our partners in the public and private health sectors, have developed an advanced strategy to address non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases as well as risk factors such as obesity. We have carried out several awareness campaigns to the community on the main risk factors, including programs for healthy hearts and the benefits of physical exercies, as well as the danger of tobacco. These programs have raised awareness in different parts of the country and within public and private education institutions.</p><h4>How will Health Mirror transform the approach of patients toward health services and what impact do you expect this new technology have on the sector as a whole?</h4><p>The Health Mirror supports the government's vision of implementing a high-quality health system, and improves disease prevention and mortality reduction for chronic and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and high blood-pressure. This smart sensor will allow patients to learn their weight, height, BMI, and even the weather forecast simply by standing in front of the mirror. The smart mirror will be connected to a medical filing system, which allows the patient to view his or her electronic medical file, book appointments, and communicate with a doctor. This is an innovative way for patients to access the necessary healthcare from their own home, and allows doctors to monitor the condition of their patients quickly and accurately.</p><h4>Smart applications and digital products have been some of the most interesting introductions from the ministry in recent months. How have these features helped you reach a wider audience?</h4><p>The Ministry of Health &amp; Prevention is keen to offer a range of e-services and smartphone applications as part of its ambitions to become a smart service. This is based on the vision of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to ensure access to government services around the clock, and to meet the needs and expectations of citizens via the adoption of services on smart devices. The ministry seeks to spread knowledge about new and innovative electronic services among the customers and employees, to reach a wider audience through a variety of media including its website, social media, and local newspapers. The latest developments in smart services include the Smart Patient Portal, telemedicine, the unified medical file, the Happiness Index, and our smart pharmacy program. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Climate change works on two platforms: devising and implementing government policy and targeting citizens and their attitudes toward sustainability. How are you using media to engage the public and gauge attitudes?</h4><p>In 2016 we established the National Environment Council and insisted that the private sector be represented on the panel, along with media representatives to make sure that we are aligned with the various social media channels and technology at our disposal. We have analyzed how we can utilize those tools and maximize the value that we can bring for ourselves, and also our target audience. We cannot underestimate the role of the media. Now we are working to portray the facts, figures, and the story through the media to make sure that we present the right message to the widest possible audience. Sustainability is not something that is limited to the government, or to the private sector; sustainability is a duty for each member of society and person on the planet. If we are talking about having a sustainable society, it is imperative that we make sure that everyone is contributing to this vision.</p><h4>What is the importance of cooperation with international organizations and communities to your efforts here in the UAE?</h4><p>We have a number of international engagements that fit into the vision that we have outlined in the UAE. Our vision is to be the world leader in sustainability, and part of achieving that mandate will only be achieved through unfettered collaboration with overseas partners and organizations. This includes NGOs, the private sector, and other nations. We as a country cannot do it alone, and we have to engage with the systems already in place; if we do it on our own, from scratch, it is going to take a long time to reach global parity. The global targets can only be achieved through collaboration. We have to observe the international organizations to gauge where the world is, and what its targets are. We are really proud of what we have done within the field of renewables. If we compare where we started almost 10 years ago to the many others that started decades before us, we can understand how we are leading the whole sector. In the last year, we have achieved two world records when it comes to producing power from photovoltaic cells (PV). We achieved 2.99 cents per kWh and the other has not been officially announced yet, but we are looking at 2.45 cents per kWh, which positions us at the top. In terms of IRENA, it helped us to build capacity through devising policy and strategies for achieving our goals. Our vision now, moving forward, is to expand the contribution of renewables in our power sector, and we are looking at what technologies exist in the market to see how we can apply them to our own advantages to further develop the existing infrastructure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>During 2016, oil prices witnessed constant rebounds, adding to better growth rate expectations for the UAE. How have these factors impacted the Central Bank's expansionary policies for 2017?</h4><p>As oil prices nearly doubled from the low levels reached early this year, the concerns that oil prices could fall to the low 20s turned out to be baseless, which was obviously great news for the UAE economic outlook. The Central Bank's estimate is that non-oil activities will continue to grow by about 2.7-2.8% in 2016 and 2017, which is a respectable performance compared to global growth, notwithstanding the impact of the fall in oil receipts on our economy, which we are keen to contain going forward. The Central Bank remains determined to maintain its continued commitment to the fixed peg of the dirham's exchange rate against the US dollar. However, we are keen to increase our capacity to manage liquidity to weather the impacts of external shocks, while adhering to the direction of US interest rate policy. Under these conditions, our focus is on the liquidity needs of banks with a forward-looking agenda. To that end, our research is currently focusing on the scope to activate the macro prudential instruments we have at our disposal and develop contingency plans to weather the adverse effects of global shocks on the domestic economy. This said, it could never be overstated that monetary instruments aim at managing liquidity to maintain resources for private sector activity. However, as experiences around the globe have demonstrated, available liquidity should be coordinated with fiscal and structural policies to boost investors' confidence. The consortium of policies should be growth conducive to enhance our economic prospects to support the non-energy sector in the medium term.</p><h4>How will the full economic diversification redesign fiscal and monetary policy when this target is met in 2021?</h4><p>The UAE has been successful in diversifying its economy away from oil. Moreover, the strategies adopted by the UAE's 2021 Vision, Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030, and Dubai's Strategic Plan 2015 are all intended to attract foreign capital to promising activities, especially export-oriented sectors such as manufacturing, transport and logistics, tourism, telecommunications, renewable energies, and aviation. To support these activities, the government has played a leading role in infrastructure and regulatory developments that have boosted growth prospects in non-oil activities over time. To ensure sustainability in the wake of the recent decline of the oil price, the government has implemented necessary reforms to diversify fiscal revenues while reining in public expenditure in a gradual manner to increase fiscal sustainability. In parallel, policy coordination has necessitated diversifying sources of financing with a goal to reduce reliance on domestic liquidity and safeguard credit growth in support of private sector activity.</p><h4>What are the main incentives the Central Bank currently offers commercial banks to further extend credit to this segment of the economy?</h4><p>Supporting SMEs is a strategic decision taken by the federal government, which has been a priority in the wake of the oil price decline. The first step in this direction was the issuance of the SME Law in 2014, which led to the creation of the SME Council. The Ministry of Economy is taking the lead in this regard and is fully cooperating with us to promote this vital sector. In the particular case of the Central Bank, we are committed to playing a fundamental role in the capitalization of SMEs and startups. We set up a team whose main task is to make proposals on the ways and means the Central Bank could contribute to the implementation the SME Law, in coordination with the concerned stakeholders.</p><h4>What action has the UAE taken to cut its deficit and how does a currency peg signal a positive outlook on the Emirati economy to investors?</h4><p>We agree with the IMF on the need for fiscal discipline in order to maintain fiscal sustainability and ensure the stability of the fixed peg regime. In the UAE, the government of Abu Dhabi took the lead by reviewing water and energy prices in 2014, which reduced the subsidy burden on the fiscal budget. In August 2015, the federal government pressed ahead with the reform of the energy subsidy system, with the aim of aligning local energy prices to international levels, and improving the overall fiscal outlook of the UAE. Reining in the budget deficit requires actions on both the revenue and the spending sides. Reforms have focused on diversifying non-energy revenues. On the spending side, fiscal consolidation aims to strike a balance between growth priorities and ensuring sustainability. In this regard, the UAE could afford to pace fiscal consolidation gradually in light of available sources of financing, including financial buffers accumulated by the sovereign wealth funds. The ample international reserves the Central Bank relies on signify a solid background to our commitment to the stability of the exchange rate peg. Other GCC countries took similar actions albeit at varying degrees, therefore, we remain confident in our ability as GCC countries to keep the fixed peg regime. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE projects a growth rate of 4% for 2017. Which economic sectors will drive this growth and how will this rate contribute to the nation's ultimate goal of diversification?</h4><p>The non-oil sectors will provide the needed impetus to drive the country's economy this year and beyond. As the UAE steadily moves toward reducing its heavy dependence on oil revenues, we expect to see a number of relevant initiatives and programs designed to strengthen vital sectors such as renewable energy, tourism, education, science, innovation, and information technology dominating government policies and regulations. This is clearly evident in the country's Higher Policy for Science, Technology and Innovation, in which more than 100 initiatives worth over AED300 billion have been identified. These key initiatives cover the health, education, energy, transport, water, and technology sectors. As for the UAE's economic performance, its real GDP grew by 3.8% in 2015, with the country more or less maintaining the same pace in 2016. This gives us a clear indication of the competitive and sustained progress of our national economy, even amidst all the challenges and difficulties that have negatively affected many economies worldwide, developed and emerging alike.</p><h4>How have the ministry's efforts to attract investors reflected in capital inflows into the country and what is the UAE's current position in the global trade arena?</h4><p>In terms of FDI, total flows to the country in 2016 amounted to about USD10 billion. The size of cumulative investments, on the other hand, reached about USD119 billion toward the end of 2016. We believe that the policies and legislation that the government is working to enact by 2017 will have a significantly positive impact on raising foreign investment flows into the country. Investment growth was not just limited to inflows, though; the volume of the UAE's outbound investments stood at USD9.3 billion in 2015, up from USD9 billion in the previous year. This made the UAE the largest Arab foreign investor in 2015, with the cumulative balance of its investments reaching USD87.4 billion. The country also maintained its prestigious position as a regional and global capital for foreign trade and an influential import, export, and re-export hub. The UAE's non-oil direct exports grew significantly in 2015, exceeding the previous year's rate by 22%. For the first half of 2016, the UAE's total non-oil foreign trade reached AED790 billion or USD215 billion. We estimate the continuation of this upward trend in 2016 with a growth rate of 5%, and in 2017 with a growth rate of 7%.</p><h4>What have been the main initiatives of the Ministry of Economy to boost the industrial sector in order to reach the target of 20% GDP contribution by 2021?</h4><p>Our initiatives involve providing support on all fronts for young local entrepreneurs and SMEs, giving them unprecedented access to an environment where they can thrive and play a bigger role in the UAE's economic progress. Additionally, the ministry seeks out more key industrial investments to boost the growth of Emirati industrial companies and generate new jobs for UAE citizens. The approval of the Foreign Investment Law reflects the government's commitment to prioritizing value-added projects in industrial sectors, among others.</p><h4>You have been an advocate of the positive transformations the UAE Investment Law will bring about. How will this law foster FDI and the framework for fruitful PPPs in the country?</h4><p>Since the new foreign investment law allows for 100% foreign ownership in government-approved sectors, we expect to see robust FDI and more fruitful public-private partnerships in the near future as a result of its enactment. The law has essentially made it easier for regional and international businesses to enter the local market and this access will arguably lead to an influx of investments from key markets at the regional and global levels. The local industrial sector and other domestic businesses will benefit from higher FDIs especially in terms of increased competitiveness and accelerated development. </p><h4>The UAE has placed non-oil exports as one of its biggest bets for the years ahead. How would you assess the development of this sector and which industries are leading the way in propelling the country's exporting capabilities?</h4><p>We have made significant progress due in part to the government's stronger emphasis on knowledge, innovation, advanced technology, human capacity building, and scientific research given their impact on the overall development process. Our economic diversification efforts have already resulted in high-performing non-oil sectors, which stand to increase their aggregate economic contributions to 4.6% by 2020. The UAE's robust economic, trade, and investment relations with key Asian and African markets, as well as other countries, will drive our non-oil export and re-export activities in the short and long term. The rapid development of the industrial sector saw industrial investments rising from AED127.6 billion in 2015 to an estimated AED130 billion by the end of 2016, which contributed to around 12.1% to the non-oil GDP. Meanwhile, the tourism sector is another important contributor to the national income. It is expected to gain more importance moving forward under the wise leadership's guidance and will further strengthen its role as a major feeder to the national economy and a reflection of the enormous potential and capabilities of the UAE. The country will rely more on tourism during the transition to a post-oil economy given its close association with many other sectors. It is considered to be a main driver for retail, shopping, entertainment, and aviation and plays a prominent role in generating jobs and stimulating investment flows to hospitality and infrastructure development. Moreover, it provides valuable opportunities for the success of small- and medium-sized enterprises. All of these and other efforts and endeavors will bear fruit in the near future and help gain more achievements in national and global economic indicators. The outlook is bright in light of UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan's declaration of 2017 as the “Year of Giving." </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ADNOC Distribution's listing was the largest IPO on the ADX. What does this capital mean for Abu Dhabi's economic environment?</h4><p>The 10% listing of ADNOC Distribution at the end of 2017 was the largest in Abu Dhabi in over 10 years, and the first public listing of an ADNOC company. It represents a tangible step in the execution of our new value creation strategy and demonstrates a clear example of the more proactive management of our portfolio of assets and capital. We have a very solid, focused, long-term business and growth strategy for ADNOC Distribution, executed by a highly experienced management team, which we believe will deliver long-term, sustainable growth and value creation for the company, for the benefit of all shareholders, as well as the wider UAE economy and, of course, our customers. The IPO represented a further step forward in the diversification, growth, and development of the UAE's capital markets and specifically the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, attracting significant demand from both local and world-class international investors, and adding to the profile and liquidity of the exchange in a considerable way. The listing of companies like ADNOC Distribution are important events, as they bring new, large companies to the exchange and help diversify the investment sector offering to investors. The IPO attracted significant FDI into the UAE, with good take up from leading international institutional investors. It was multiple times oversubscribed on the qualified investor tranche, and the original size of the retail tranche was oversubscribed by 22 times. On the first day of trading, the stock rose as much as 16% and continues to trade well since its float.</p><h4>The Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) recently approved ADNOC's plans to pursue international downstream investments for the first time in the company's history. What was the driver behind this decision?</h4><p>Our upstream will always remain a fundamental and core part of our business. However, as part of our 2030 strategy, it is a strategic priority for us to significantly expand our petrochemical production to meet the growing demand for higher-margin products, such as polyolefins, which is set to grow by 150% by 2040. We intend to double our refining capacity and triple petrochemicals production capacity to 14.4 million tonnes per year by 2025, up from 4.5 million in 2016, while adding new products, including aromatics and linear alkyl benzene (LAB) to our mix. As a demonstration of our strategic intent to grow our downstream business, approximately 40% of the USD109 billion five-year CAPEX program that was approved by the SPC and announced in November is dedicated to achieving this important objective. Through a new and ambitious domestic and international investment strategy aimed at taking advantage of the demand from global growth markets, ADNOC will become a leading global downstream player. This will be achieved by building on our already strong foundation in Ruwais, which we will expand to become the largest integrated refining and chemical site in the world. From this site we will refine nearly half of our crude and convert 20% of that portion to chemicals and petrochemicals, which will offer a hedge to oil price fluctuations while allowing us to meet growing global demand for higher value products. Our expansion plans for Ruwais are on a world scale and will contribute to the diversification of the UAE's economy and create thousands of jobs. We see great potential for overseas investment and expansion in Asia, where we are strengthening strategic relations. We recently signed the first concession agreement between the UAE and India, awarding a consortium of Indian oil companies a 10% interest in Abu Dhabi's offshore Lower Zakum concession. This mutually beneficial partnership will help India meet its growing demand for energy and refined products, create opportunities for ADNOC to increase its market share in a key growth market, and build a solid foundation as ADNOC explores potential international investments, particularly focused on downstream opportunities. We see growth throughout Asia. Since 2010, we have achieved a four-fold increase of sales volume into the region. We are therefore increasing our commitment to China to allow us to be even closer to our Chinese and Asia region customers and to develop our relationships with our Chinese and Asian partners further, which will only bring about benefits to both sides. We are confident that our transformative value creation strategy will create a balanced and highly integrated upstream and downstream portfolio to secure ADNOC's long-term and sustainable future for years to come.</p><h4>Aside from Borouge 4, ADNOC holds strategic co-operations with Spain's Cepsa, BP, and Germany's Linde. How does your new partnership model reflect the evolution of the challenges and opportunities in the oil &amp; gas industry?</h4><p>The global energy industry and market dynamic is changing at a rapid pace. Global demand for energy continues to grow—forecasts suggest by at least 25% by 2040—and this demand is shifting from West to East, with non-OECD countries expected to account for more than 70% of the world's demand within this timeframe, and, as I have mentioned, petrochemical demand will grow even more sharply, at more than 150% over the same period. Over the last two years we have taken a bold and ambitious dual track approach in our response to the evolving energy landscape that has helped ensure we are increasingly more resilient to market volatility and well positioned to capitalize on emerging and future growth trends. This dual track approach comprises a rationalization and culture transformation program aimed at maximizing operational efficiency, optimizing our unit costs per barrel, enhancing profitability, and strengthening our overall performance. In parallel, we have launched a bold finance, investment, and partnership strategy that will greatly enhance our capital structure and returns, unlock and maximize value, accelerate our growth and performance, and secure new market opportunities. We seek partners who can help us secure better access to our key target markets and customers, though we also seek partners to bring access to financing, business and operational expertise and knowledge, and technological innovation—all vital factors in ensuring we can create long-term, sustainable, and mutually beneficial partnerships. In upstream we are exploring the creation of new partnership and co-investment opportunities in some of our services businesses, while at the same time looking for value-add companies that may also seek to partner or invest alongside us in other parts of our value chain. We are also developing innovative investment structures and ventures for further selected ADNOC infrastructure assets that might be attractive to both investors and business partners and that will provide compelling investments and returns. In our downstream business, we seek to create a number of new business and investment opportunities with long-term partners to help us drive growth, efficiency, and knowledge transfer to generate greater returns from our assets, while also allowing us to develop and launch a number of new downstream business and product lines. The expansion of our downstream business will create a number of exciting new partnership opportunities in the years ahead.</p><h4>How can the oil and gas industry remain ahead of the technological innovation curve and gain benefits across its whole value-chain?</h4><p>In a world that is being transformed by new technology, we are also focused on attracting different types of partners—not necessarily from the oil and gas industry—who can bring innovation, ideas, and the application of cutting-edge technologies to our business. We have already seen artificial intelligence transforming industries as diverse as manufacturing, retail and finance, and this technology is now being applied to the energy sector, where the possible benefits include minimizing disruptions, reducing costs and optimizing performance. The application of predictive analytics, for example, has the potential to enhance electricity grids by instantly evaluating terabytes of information to anticipate demand peaks and system stress.<br>At ADNOC, we are leveraging the power of big data to augment visibility into our operations both below and aboveground. As part of our ongoing transformation, we are exploring how AI could help further improve efficiency, make us more agile, and drive profitability. We are keen to study how breakthroughs from other sectors, such as mobile technology, might be applied to the energy industry and specifically to ADNOC to help us lower costs and increase efficiency and performance across our value chain.</p><h4>What is the strategy for the UAE to remain at the forefront of driving sustainability efforts across the world?</h4><p>Renewables and hydrocarbons complement each other in a relationship that makes perfect economic sense. The UAE, through Masdar and other initiatives, has been at the forefront of developing and globally promoting a truly sustainable diversified energy mix. Masdar is a key investor in the largest wind farm in the world, the London Array, and around the world we have invested in 1GW of solar power in projects spanning the UAE, Oman, Jordan, Mauritania, Egypt, Morocco, the UK, Spain, Seychelles, and the Pacific Islands. This commitment will continue. In January, Masdar completed the financing for Jordan's largest solar project, Beynouna, which will add 200MW of capacity to Jordan's electricity grid. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Finnish experiences of sustainability, and how can those lessons be translated into a country like the UAE?</h4><p>In 1917 when Finland gained its independence, we were a poor country, hungry from disease and war. In the span of a hundred years, we have emerged from poverty to become a developed country. Things happened fast as they have happened here in the UAE, and we basically focused on three things: education, equality, and openness. Once these facets are prioritized and balance is achieved, then success will develop. Our big success story started at the end of the Cold War in 1989 when we did two things; we opened our economy and joined the EU, which bolstered Finland's promotion of sustainability and sustainable development. My message to the Executive Council was that issues of sustainability are part of the global agenda and the UAE and Sharjah should focus on these. The fourth industrial revolution and technological development will play a big role in this.</p><h4>What are the difficulties in implementing sustainable targets in the UAE?</h4><p>The countries that have adopted the sustainable development goals (SDGs) have been divided into two groups: one half is non-oil producing and the other one is oil-producing. If we look at the targets given to the oil producing countries, they are going to be at a disadvantage from the start in terms of their rankings. The bottom line is that the UAE in a broad sense, less so in the case of Sharjah, has to figure out how to transition from gas and oil toward solar power or other renewables. If it can take a lead on that, then its ranking will improve. The SDGs are intrinsically linked to modern technology, so if the right infrastructure is in place that is already a step in the right direction.</p><h4>What lessons can the UAE learn from Finland in educating and employing their nationals?<br></h4><p>As a former prime minister, I would like to see the rate of people getting a degree and transitioning to jobs increase. The way in which everyone in the world works will radically change through the fourth industrial revolution. First of all, paradoxically, the link between a university degree and a job will diminish, and we will have to keep reeducating ourselves all the time and develop new skills in line with the technology that becomes available on the market. Similarly, our job structures will change; there will be no more nine-to-five because the world today has tools that enable remote access. Thirdly, the link between the physical workplace and work will become further removed. Fourthly, we will not be working for the same employer anymore; we will have many jobs at the same time. Finally, many jobs will be, by definition, global, so one may not only work in Dubai, or the UAE; they might be working around the world, again facilitated by devices. The pace at which computing is advancing is rapid so these developments are only around the corner.</p><h4>What is your impression of the UAE education system, and is there any collaboration between the UAE and Finnish government in the sector?</h4><p>The bottom line is that it is impossible to bring a Finnish school to the Emirates and say this is what and how you should learn. Education has to be tailored to the culture in which it will exist. Three pieces of advice from the Finnish system would be the following; first of all, teachers are respected, and it is not easy to become a teacher as a master's to teach is required. Secondly, teachers should have a high level of autonomy so there is a curriculum but they can teach it as they like, and, thirdly, teachers should be well paid. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In recent years, the UAE has delivered nearly half of the foreign aid budget for developing projects in Egypt. How crucial has UAE aid been in stabilizing Egypt and promoting development?</h4><p>Egypt and the UAE have always shared special and close relations at both official and popular levels. Today, ties between the two Arab nations are developing on all fronts at an unprecedented rate and are considered a model upon which inter-Arab relations should be styled. During recent years, the UAE has become one of Egypt's most important strategic allies as well as a key development partner. Following the revolution on June 30, 2013, a framework agreement was signed between the two countries by virtue of which the UAE supported the implementation of development projects in vital sectors including energy, housing, education, healthcare, transportation, infrastructure, and food security, in addition to industrial staff training and strategic studies. Talks are also underway with the UAE to finance projects implemented under the Sinai Peninsula Development Project. The UAE's support of Egypt's development plans has been useful, and we look forward to continued collaboration and witnessing the implementation of a number of megaprojects aimed at boosting the economy and fostering Egypt's stability.</p><h4>The new Suez Canal opened in 2015. Has Egypt seen interest from the UAE to develop special economic zones near the canal, like Sharjah, which has developed efficient business-friendly centers for industry?</h4><p>The Suez Canal corridor is one of the most prominent projects in Egypt. In November 2015, we launched the first phase of the Suez Canal Area Development Project. The project envisages the promotion of special economic zones and industrial areas. Work is now underway on the infrastructure in the area to turn it into an international investment destination, a global logistics hub, and an industrial center for the new Egypt. As an integral part of this vision, the government is currently reviewing the special economic zones law to improve the tax and investment incentives offered to investors in these zones. The UAE was at the forefront of countries showing interest in this ambitious project, given its commitment to supporting Egypt's comprehensive economic and social development process as well as its successful experience in managing special economic zones. The Emirati interest in the Suez Canal project started early in Phase I, where Abu Dhabi's National Marine Dredging Company was instrumental in delivering the New Suez Canal on time, leading a consortium of four of the world's largest dredging contractors. Momentum has now switched to Phase II of the project, the new special economic zones, which offer a huge opportunity for the UAE, particularly the private sector, to set up industrial parks and logistics hub. I met with several groups of Emirati businessmen and investors over past years and discussed with them the diverse business and investment opportunities offered by Egypt as well as steps and measures undertaken by the government to offer an environment conducive to more investment and to eliminate bureaucratic impediments. They showed great interest and commitment to increasing their investments in Egypt, and we are currently cooperating with them in order to translate this interest into tangible actions and projects that would be of mutual benefit for both sides.</p><h4>How do you envision future relations between Egypt and the UAE?</h4><p>At the bilateral level, Egypt and the UAE will continue to strengthen the political, economic, cultural, and social ties that have been established since the UAE's independence in 1971. There is a large Egyptian expatriate community in the UAE, which has positively contributed to its development and modernization process during the past decades, and many Emiratis have a strong affinity to Egypt, where they have received their education at Egyptian universities and enjoyed some of Egypt's most attractive tourist destinations. The political leadership in both countries is interested in seeing these relations further prosper and flourish to serve their mutual and regional interests. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Quwain collaborate to improve the well-being of their citizens?</h4><p>Citizen well-being is a top priority among all of the Emirates. Our recent visit to Ras Al Khaimah along with our regular visits to other Emirates are in light of our strong historical ties and the strong belief in the efforts of leaders of the Emirates in enhancing bilateral relations to benefit our Emirates and the people.</p><h4>A new resolution has been issued for developing and upgrading the Old Umm Al Quwain. What impact do you expect from this project and what is the timeframe for completion?</h4><p>The resolution came out of the strong belief of Sheikh Saud Bin Rashid Al Mualla, Member of the Supreme Council &amp; Ruler of Umm Al Quwain, to enhance the infrastructure of the Emirate of Umm Al Quwain. His close supervision and directions to improve some of the old areas will commence very soon. Upon completion, which is expected in 2018, the selected areas will transform into completely developed neighborhoods with the necessary infrastructure such as roads and other facilities, which will benefit landlords. Land values are expected to rise accordingly, more developments are going to take place in the areas, and investors will be attracted to invest in these areas.</p><h4>The GCC member states are becoming more committed to waste management. What role is Umm Al Quwain playing supporting this objective in the UAE?</h4><p>Sustainable developments are one of the priorities of the Emirate's strategy. Waste management is one of the issues that the Emirate has tackled. Along with the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, there are four major projects taking place in the Emirate: a sewage treatment facility, the demolition and reconstruction of a waste management facility, a general waste management facility, and the treatment of the current landfill to transform it into usable land.</p><h4>Which economic sectors hold the biggest potential for growth in Umm Al Quwain?</h4><p>We believe that eco-tourism has the greatest potential of growth along with other economic sectors such as heavy and light industries, logistics, and the free zone. We are planning to attract as many tourists to the Emirate as possible to benefit from the great attractions, such as the sandy beaches, archeological sites, desert, and natural islands. New projects are coming up in the pipeline, such as the recently announced project with the major investor SOBHA to develop the island of Seniyah. The project, named Firdous Sobha, comprises a luxury seafront villa community, hotels and resorts, apartments, boutique shops, 18-hole golf course, water sports center, and wellness spa, and this will add a great deal of value to the economy.</p><h4>How has FDI to Umm Al Quwain developed over the last few years?</h4><p>Umm Al Quwain has great potential for investments in many sectors, including tourism, industry, and several other sectors. The Department of Economic Development has reported significant growth in FDI in the past five years, and we are continuing to develop the infrastructure, laws, bylaws, and regulations to attract more investment. The Umm Al Quwain Industrial City Authority has also attracted many investments in various fields, and the government is investing a great deal to develop the areas allocated for the potential investments.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are extremely positive about our outlook for the coming years. As mentioned, many enhancements are being made in terms of our infrastructure, such as re-writing the necessary laws for our government entities to become more efficient and effective. Our focus is on attracting greater FDI and local investments in various areas such as tourism and industry, and we will continue our focus to develop the facilities needed for tourism. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Fujairah Port collaborate with other ports in the region?</h4><p>Fujairah Port, as the main gateway to the UAE and the Gulf states, will benefit from the growth and expansion of Dubai's and Abu Dhabi's ports, all serving the mixed and integrated economy of the UAE. Such cooperation and integration between Fujairah and other major ports in UAE will be achieved through direct delivery, transshipments, and feeder services. Fujairah Port, a multi-purpose facility, has been recognized as a leading hub for the handling of oil and liquid products, aggregate, and dry bulk operations, and is continuously developing capabilities to handle general cargo, Ro-Ro, and passenger operations. The steady growth of the Fujairah economy in general and of the free zone in particular will continue to increase customer bulk for inbound cargo, which will include more shipping lines to Fujairah. The government of Fujairah continues to support future development and investment to expand and upgrade the port's infrastructure and facilities, and overcome any challenges it may face.</p><h4>How has FDI developed over the last few years in Fujairah?</h4><p>Fujairah has been successful in attracting international investment to different fields. Encouraged by the great economic potential, transparent and flexible investment policies, and attractive incentives offered by Fujairah Free Zone and other entities, Fujairah has become an attractive investment base for investors from all over the world, offering a gateway to emerging markets. Fujairah has made rapid strides in social and economic development that made Fujairah a competitive destination for FDI. FDI has contributed to developments of many sectors, including bunkering and oil storage terminals, aggregate and rock bulk handling, mining and manufacturing industries, tourism, training and educational training, as well as health and other complementary services. The Emirate's investment attractiveness increases in share of the rising investments, which mainly target manufacturing and tourism enterprises, education, and healthcare. Having a variety of investments in Fujairah that have been influencing the economy, trade, manpower, and financial movements is a clear indication of the stability of doing business in Fujairah and UAE. We focus on growing steadily toward achieving sustainable development and attracting diversified added-value investments to keep abreast of progress and support Fujairah's Strategic Masterplan Project 2040.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Fujairah compared to the other Emirates?</h4><p>Fujairah enjoys a strategic position outside the Strait of Hormuz from the open seas to the Gulf region that offers a gateway to emerging markets. It is geographically suited for bunkering oil and liquid products, petrochemical operations and refineries, ship repairing, and other trading activities. It is a leading hub for port-related transactions due to the ease of logistics support and business-friendly environment. Tourism is also a vital aspect of Fujairah, and we expect to capitalize on its abundant picturesque coastal scenery and unique historical and urban sites. We had more than 1 million tourists last year and are looking to increase the number in the coming years. The Emirate has promising investments in the rocks, aggregates, and mining sector due to the rich natural resources that have resulted in the development of related industries such as quarrying, cement plants, and other manufacturing and processing activities. The economics of doing business in Fujairah is relatively competitive and lucrative. The government's policies are suited to the interests of business, ranging from petrochemicals to hotel industries. The working of the government machinery regarding licensing, permits, and other legal formalities is transparent and the state permits the full repatriation of profits and capital. The stable currency is another plus point. Investors find it easier to carry out their activities owing to its unique logistic links, especially feeder vessel services to places such as India, Pakistan, Iran, the Mediterranean, Europe, and North America. The authority provides easy accessibility, connectivity, and economic benefits like lower start-up costs and overheads as well as exemption from custom duties and corporate taxes. The policies are investor-oriented, and strong security support is provided to all investors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) is experiencing strong growth both in the tourism and manufacturing/industrial sectors, driven by significant levels of foreign investment. What makes RAK an attractive destination for foreign capital?</h4><p>First and foremost, RAK has a long history of both political stability and social harmony, accompanied by a track record of policy consistency guided by the principles of economic openness, modernization, and diversification. These are vital because they provide fundamental building blocks for development and prosperity, and are the first things foreign investors examine when they choose a location for their business. We continue to build upon these intrinsic strengths of the Emirate by offering an attractive investor-friendly environment with rule of law, no taxes, and an easily navigable administrative system. The World Bank Doing Business study, published in April 2016, ranked RAK the 45th most business friendly place in the world out of 190 countries surveyed, well ahead of all other GCC countries. This is a testimony to the success of our ongoing efforts to create the best physical and legal infrastructure for industries of all kinds to thrive in this Emirate.</p><h4>Looking ahead, where do you see potential future FDI into RAK coming from?</h4><p>Given our geographical location and fundamental institutional strengths, we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of investment inflows from the advanced economies of Europe, US, Japan, the Republic of Korea, as well as from emerging markets in Africa. Investors from developed countries tend to find the aforementioned combination of our low cost base, light administrative burden, and exemption from taxes highly compelling. Investors from the subcontinent and lesser-developed parts of the world are attracted by the rule of law, political and social stability, and high-quality infrastructure. That said, we continue to diversify the economy and are conscious of the necessity of having a diversified pool of investors. From our point of view, Asia is under-represented in the Emirate, and through more highly targeted awareness campaigns, we can attract more firms from Japan, China, and the Republic of Korea.</p><h4>How does the Emirate ensure that young Emiratis are given the opportunity to engage in RAK's economic growth? </h4><p>RAK's economic growth and development is all-inclusive, but at the same time we pay close attention to the needs and conditions of our young population. Education is the key element of our strategy to empower local young people. We have several programs aimed at developing entrepreneurship and raising the level of technical skills, which complement our initiative to develop SMEs. Over the past 10 years a number of educational institutions have been established in the Emirate, such as AURAK and RAKMHSU, and having these institutions here enables local students to obtain tertiary education in a number of disciplines at an affordable price without having to leave the Emirate.</p><h4>Rating agencies give RAK an 'A' level with a 'stable' outlook. From RAK's perspective, which fundamentals need to be focused on for a higher rating? </h4><p>The sovereign rating assigned to us by Fitch Ratings and S&amp;P give due recognition to our many credit strengths: political stability, ease of doing business, track record of fiscal prudence, and a low and declining debt and interest burden. Where we need to improve is in the provision of macroeconomic data needed for economic analysis and forecasting. This coincides with the UAE's push for more accurate and wide-ranging work on big data. We need to be able to provide robust and credible statistics about the Emirate, and to do that, we need to overcome some institutional deficiencies in our data gathering and analysis. We are well on the way to accomplishing that with the establishment in July 2016 of the RAK Statistics and Studies Center. To strengthen our statistical capability, we also need to improve governance, especially as it pertains to the management of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). We have a large number of SOEs, which provide the majority of the Emirate's revenue, and we need to improve policies, processes, and transparency in order to improve oversight over these entities and expand their level of efficiency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mubadala Investment Company, which was formally established on May 1, 2017, brings together an asset portfolio worth USD125 billion. What was the rationale behind this merger?</h4><p>The rationale for merging two of the Emirate's key government-owned investment entities, International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) and Mubadala Development Company, was to create enhanced economic value for the government of Abu Dhabi. As a combined entity, Mubadala Investment Company will realize synergies and growth in multiple sectors, including energy, utilities, technology, aerospace, industry, healthcare, real estate, and financial investments. Mubadala Investment Company has a stronger, more dynamic balance sheet and world-class expertise in a pool of industries vital to Abu Dhabi's growth. As a result, it can contribute more significantly to the diversification of the economy, in line with the Abu Dhabi Plan and the country's long-term vision.</p><h4>What do the two organizations bring to Mubadala Investment Company in terms of heritage and legacy?</h4><p>IPIC and Mubadala Development Company have played leading roles in Abu Dhabi's economic growth and diversification. IPIC was established in 1984 by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, with the aim of directing Abu Dhabi's energy expertise and petroleum heritage toward the creation of a modern, diversified economy. IPIC's first major acquisition was Cepsa and, since then, it has become a global powerhouse in the hydrocarbon value chain with investments in 18 leading companies worldwide. Mubadala Development Company was established in 2002 to advance the Emirate's economic diversification. The company's first project was Dolphin Energy, a groundbreaking joint venture with Occidental Petroleum and Total that directly connects gas from Qatar's North Field with customers in the UAE and Oman, and today meets approximately 30% of the UAE's energy requirements. By 2017, Mubadala Development Company had become an active investor across multiple sectors in more than 20 countries. As a combined force, the two companies form an investment powerhouse that includes partnerships and subsidiaries in more than 30 countries and has a group-wide employee base of more than 68,000 people.</p><h4>Given the significant scale of the new company, how has the business been structured?</h4><p>Committees made up of representatives from both Mubadala Development Company and IPIC worked together over a six-month period to develop a structure that would best serve the mandate given to us by the government of Abu Dhabi. The business has been organized across four investment platforms of significant scale: petroleum and petrochemicals; technology, manufacturing, and mining; aerospace, renewables, and information and communications technology; and alternative investments and infrastructure. These platforms will help accelerate the diversification of the Abu Dhabi economy through strategic investments across critical sectors within the UAE and abroad.</p><h4>What will be the investment strategy for Mubadala Investment Company outside of Abu Dhabi, and how is the company allocating a more varied range of sectors within its portfolio?</h4><p>Mubadala Development Company and IPIC were both highly active globally, and as a combined entity with partnerships and subsidiaries in more than 30 countries, this will continue. Our focus remains helping to fulfill Abu Dhabi's long-term vision for a globally integrated and diverse economy, and operating as a trusted global business that partners with the world's best companies and institutions. Our semiconductor business GLOBALFOUNDRIES' international presence embodies our approach to investing in globally integrated sectors. Through nine fabrication facilities spanning three continents, GLOBALFOUNDRIES has established Abu Dhabi's footprint in the advanced technology sector—a core pillar of the Emirate's diversification strategy. IPIC has brought the new company a significant international portfolio of assets, including stakes in Cepsa and Borealis, one of the largest polyolefin producers in the world. In addition to these established assets, we are also continuing to explore new markets through capital investments and a range of sovereign investment partnerships. For example, we have established relationships with sovereign-backed entities in Russia, China, and France that are creating significant opportunities in a variety of sectors with like-minded partners. In addition, our dedicated financial arm, Mubadala Capital, began in 2017 to manage third-party capital for the first time, following a transaction with Ardian, the independent private investment company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Over 2016, Dubai continued to prove its credentials as a well-diversified economy and raise its global competitiveness, while at the same time reinforcing its character as a tolerant and cosmopolitan city. Over the last year, we continued to reap the fruits of our long-term strategic diversification program, and I believe we are well placed for sustainable growth.</p><p>Our success has allowed us to look beyond the conventional and achieve the exceptional. Sustainability continues to be a key focus for us. We have completed the second phase of the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, an USD13.6 billion investment, which by 2030 will become the largest single-site solar park in the world, able to generate 5,000MW of electricity—enough to power 800,000 homes. </p><p>After taking a deep look at how our government can better fulfill its mission of serving the people, we launched the Smart Dubai Happiness Agenda, the world's first science-based model for measuring and impacting the happiness of a city's residents. We also unveiled the Dubai Data initiative, the single most comprehensive city-wide data initiative for accessing and sharing city data across the public and private sectors. By unlocking the greatest value from data, the initiative aims to benefit all stakeholders, including government departments, private organizations, investors, residents, and visitors.</p><p>By leveraging the latest in technology and customer experience design, together with a culturally aligned, science-based approach to impacting people's happiness, Smart Dubai has brought together two powerful forces for Dubai's transformation. These efforts are driven by our firm belief that the success of a city's government in serving its residents is not measured by swipes or clicks, but by people's happiness. </p><p>Tied to this has been a wider restructuring of the UAE government. Eight new ministers were announced, out of which five are women. I truly believe that the new ministers of the 12th Cabinet of the UAE are the most diverse and dynamic in the history of the country. I am confident they will be able to drive forward innovative ideas that will enhance the UAE's growth and development. </p><p>As a government, we know that a society cannot be sustained without a culture of giving and a sense of community responsibility among both people and organizations. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, declared 2017 as the “Year of Giving." The spirit of giving is embedded in the UAE's heritage and culture, and the government seeks to work with the private sector closely to instill this even more deeply in our social fabric.</p><p>This ethos of cooperation and partnership is what we seek to convey to the world as Expo 2020 draws closer. By then, we aim to welcome 20 million visitors a year to Dubai, twice the number of visitors in 2012. Expo 2020 will be an opportunity to promote synergies between Dubai and the rest of the world under the theme “Connecting Minds, Creating the Future."</p><p>One of the most exciting moments of the year for me was the laying of the foundation stone of The Tower, which, when complete, will stand in Dubai Creek Harbour as the world's highest man-made structure. The Tower is a symbol of our desire to always push the boundaries and create a better future, building on the achievements of our founding fathers.</p><p>The UAE's economic accomplishments bear testament to its spirit of innovation. As we look ahead, we seek to actively include a wide range of stakeholders in building the future of Dubai. Together, embracing our diversity and our potential, we will make Dubai the smartest, most innovative, and happiest city in the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[here-to-regulate]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does FANR play in advancing the country's regulatory environment around nuclear energy?</h4><p>We have established ourselves not only as a functioning regulatory body to enforce safety, security, and non-proliferation for nuclear energy, but also as an organization that supervises hospitals, dentists, and all those institutions that need licenses for sophisticated machines that emit radiation. As outlined by our management board, to become globally recognized as a leading nuclear regulator, we need to achieve excellence in our operations, like most UAE institutions. We are presently reviewing the operating license application for the Unit 1 of the Barakah plant and we need to make sure it is built according to international standards and FANR regulations before we award the operating license. The long length of this concession requires a rigorous process of supervision over safety issues and the consideration to security requirements. Also, the potential impact on the environment is part of the FANR review efforts. Before FANR issues the license to operate the reactors at Barakah, the readiness of the operating organization Nawah Energy Co. to operate the plant safely is also closely checked by our experienced inspectors, and the control room operators need to be certified by FANR. We carry out inspections, at the operator's headquarters, at the nuclear plant itself, and at manufacturing factories in several countries, like South Korea, Germany, and the US to ensure the manufacturing, construction, and commissioning is done according to high nuclear standards and in agreement with our safeguards obligations.</p><h4>What is the estimated economic impact of the Barakah Power Plant on UAE market forces in the context of UAE Vision 2021?</h4><p>This is the first time since 1985 that a new country introduces nuclear power, and the reason for this investment is strategic, as nuclear energy seeks to save the country from oil dependency and reduce the environmental impact of electricity production. In this context, the Barakah nuclear power plant will provide stable and reliable electricity across the UAE and provide a new career path for the economy and youth. In order to be fully operational, a lot of skills are required in various sectors, from basic science, and engineering to legal advising. Initially at FANR, expats such as myself came to set up, mentor, and train, and eventually we will leave this space to nationals. In our efforts to support the Emiratization process, we initially started hiring from the local industry and governmental institutions as well as from universities to train groups of students before moving them in the appropriate departments. Presently we have over 220 staff members, of which 64% are Emiratis and whom we have trained in nuclear and radiation regulation to be able to assume leading expert or management roles in the nuclear sector.</p><h4>What is the importance of building such an integrated network with local and international authorities, and what are the major takeaways from this exchange of knowledge?</h4><p>As the number of countries joining the global nuclear energy community grows, nuclear energy regulatory authorities have witnessed significant advancements in approach, while reinforcing the importance of comprehensive, independent regulation as the key to the success of a nuclear energy program anywhere in the world. In the same way as nuclear vendors and operators have transformed into global players, nuclear regulation has been impacted by “globalization" as well. In line with the need for continuous improvement and to continue to ensure maximum safety of the public, workers, and the environment, we need to strengthen our regulatory programs on nuclear safety, security, radiation protection, and safeguards. Forming international partnerships where information and experience is exchanged between regulatory authorities, as well as increasing support from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), have so far resulted in stronger, more robust regulatory frameworks being set up all over the globe. Likewise for FANR, partnership with local and international entities play an indispensable role. It establishes a platform for cooperation, support and exchange of information and knowledge. Locally, FANR presently has 15 agreements and MoUs signed with federal and local government agencies, which help nurture our mission and provide the means to regulate the nuclear sector. Internationally, FANR has signed 19 agreements and MoUs with international organizations and regulatory authorities of other countries to share technical information, exchange experience and lessons learned, as well help in building national capacity in nuclear and radiation.<br>Thanks to having cooperation agreements, FANR has contributed strongly to the nuclear sector by creating the legal and regulatory framework to be followed, adopting and enforcing regulations for the nuclear industry that are on a high international level, and inspecting the compliance with these regulations to ensure public health and safety and ensuring the peaceful uses of it. The work of FANR and its partners is continuously enhancing the nuclear safety culture in the UAE. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the Insurance Authority and what is its role today?</h4><p>We recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of the authority. Prior to that, the authority was part of the Ministry of Economy. Then, the law that established the authority came in 2007, and we began practicing according to the regulations stipulated in the bylaws. We have introduced many technical insurance regulations for companies, including takaful, for the first time. To help companies adapt their business models, we engage their leaders in designing most of our regulations through consultations before we introduce new laws or make amendments. We cannot force legislation into place. Today, the authority is growing rapidly, hand in hand with the sector. We are number one in terms of premium collection in the MENA region, witnessing an average growth of 10% per year. Demand is high and penetration in every sector of insurance is growing as well.</p><h4>What has been the reaction to the new motor insurance policy?</h4><p>In 2017, we rolled out a new motor insurance policy. Before, we had a regulation in place since 1987 that had not been amended. For five years, we have been reviewing the policy, asking companies how we could improve it to tackle outstanding issues. At the end of the day, our regulations are for consumers and we needed input to add value to these policies. This five-year journey has come to an end, and we finally rolled out our new policy, though our work is not yet finished. In the meantime, we encourage people to shop around at the 48 insurance companies in the UAE until they find a policy that is right for them.</p><h4>How is the Insurance Authority working on introducing technology to streamline the claims handling process and data acquisition?</h4><p>We look at technology, fintech, and blockchain, which are all in our pipeline. Although in our culture it can take time to instill change, currently we are trying to get things done electronically. The new claims technology that we have introduced pushes claims directly to the insurance company, and it has three days to come back to the client before it gets escalated to us. We aim to reduce the amount of time it takes to receive a claim as much as possible. That is why we introduced a loaner car policy, whereby the company has to provide customers with the same type of car or compensate them AED300 (USD82) per day until the claim is settled. Our neighbors may have larger populations than Abu Dhabi; however, we are beating them in terms of technology.</p><h4>What is the competitive advantage of the UAE market compared to other countries in this region?</h4><p>Awareness in our market is higher; we see many investors who think of insurance before they even open a new business. We also have a large amount of compulsory insurance, such as health and motor, which adds value as well. Now, we have been approached by different entities that want other compulsory insurance. We want to get the government involved as much as possible. Insurance will become increasingly dominant in the coming years, as people think even more about how they can insure themselves and companies work to create better products. Typically, the stock exchange is the mirror of the economy anywhere in the world. However, insurance is heading in that direction. Now, we also have to pay VAT, and there will be an impact during the first year, after which everything will run smoothly. We want to reduce the number of complaints from 60 a day to zero—that is the ultimate goal.</p><h4>What are your goals in terms of takaful and how will you achieve them?</h4><p>We need to be number one in the takaful market. We have to examine the entire ecosystem and identify where the “clutch" is. If we can have profitable companies and make them the base contributors, we will experience more growth in takaful. They will then be more credible and more people will start joining. The takaful concept is simple; if one does not make any claims by the end of the year, the insurance company has to pay them back. If we can see how to get companies profitable and more credible on this model and they can return insured entities money back at a percentage, we will see more people getting involved. In the UAE, the investment side for takaful is limited. Trading on the stock exchange is one source, as is sukuk and real estate. One has to search for other opportunities to invest in to expand their range. The national sukuk market is healthy, though the bonds market has not been as liquid. The problem is also getting out of the investment, which is where people lose money.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>Life insurance is the next big thing, as well as making investments. We are working actively to promote life insurance and want to raise awareness. We have drafted new regulations that we are working on and they will come out on the takaful side as well. It will wrap up many loose ends and fix things that are not being done correctly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ajman has witnessed significant growth in the number of commercial and industrial licenses issued. What are the key factors behind this growth?</h4><p>The increased business attractiveness in the Emirate of Ajman is a natural reflection of the government's interest in the infrastructure of the economy and the establishment of the ideal climate for investment. The government is committed to implementing a wide range of new policies that stimulate further investment in the key sectors targeted by the Emirate's Vision 2021. The government of Ajman is keen to further push the development of the economy through the enactment of laws and legislation that are attractive to investment and targets the sustainability of companies, factories, and capital. We have directed all the authorities in the Emirate concerned with economic affairs to adopt policies that are attractive to investment. The main factors behind this growth are primarily the improved business environment across a range of initiatives that have had a significant role in saving investors' time, money, and effort. Such measures included reducing fees for issuing and renewing licenses and facilitating the initiation of business activities in the Emirate with just six procedures and reducing the period required to only six days. There is no doubt that the existence of national competencies and international expertise, the smooth logistics environment, and the advanced systems created a climate that is in the interest of the investor, and that is our first goal. Optimizing technology use for various services for businesspeople and investors has also played a leading role in meeting the expectations of the community in terms of saving time and effort to achieve record processing times both within the Emirate's free zone and other economic entities in Ajman.</p><h4>Which sectors have the greatest growth potential in Ajman?</h4><p>The transformative industries sector is the largest sector with about 35% of the Emirate's contribution to the country's GDP, followed by construction with 15%, repair and maintenance with 13%, real estate and business services with 12%, and government services with 6%. The economy of Ajman enjoys great flexibility and is highly diversified. The annual rate of new licenses granted to businesses in Ajman grows every year. In the commercial, professional, and industrial fields, we exceeded 3,500 licenses annually. This may be one of the simple indicators that reflect the extent of business development and investor confidence in the Emirate's economy. As a result, GPD has doubled to close to AED20 billion while economic activity and sales trade have doubled to over AED40 billion, according to the estimates of 2016. Ajman is known as a large industrial base, and it is the third Emirate in the country in terms of a number of industrial facilities and production units. The tourism and industry sectors are the most attractive in the Emirate, and the government is working to support these sectors without underestimating the importance of the other sectors and providing their necessities. Five key areas are expected to see a boom in the coming period: transformative industries, logistics, subcontracting, media, as well as tourism, where investment has increased significantly during the past year.</p><h4>How has FDI in Ajman developed over the last few years?</h4><p>The past decade has seen remarkable trends in investment in infrastructure, housing, tourism, and industry. The participation of local and foreign investors in the real estate sector resulted in an increase in residential units in the Emirate by more than five fold during the same period. Private investment has also contributed to the expansion of the number of private schools and hospitals. In the tourism sector, Ajman is considered one of the fastest-growing Emirates in terms of restaurants, hotels, and cafes. The government has also developed large tourist complexes, including in Al Khor area, and beautification of the coastline. The government also cooperated with a foreign investor to develop Al Zora Tourism Complex, which is one of the distinguished tourist complexes in its location. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few months, one of the prevailing sentiments in all my conversations with GCC leaders has been this sense that in challenging times, you turn to your oldest and most dependable friends. That is the spirit in which I recently visited the GCC. We have a rich history on which to build. From the very first treaties, the UK has been proudly at the forefront of a relationship between the Gulf and the West that has been the bedrock of our shared prosperity and security.</p><p>As the UK leaves the EU, I am determined that we should seize the opportunity to get out into the world and to shape an even bigger global role for my country, to build new alliances but more importantly to go even further in working with old friends, like our allies here in the Gulf, who have stood alongside us for centuries.</p><p>In accepting the honor of addressing GCC leaders, I seek not just to offer a message of continuity, but to begin to build a bold new chapter in our cooperation; to forge a strategic relationship, a relationship based on true partnership, and an enduring commitment between our countries and our peoples; a relationship through which together we can meet these great challenges to our shared security and prosperity, and grab this opportunity to build an exciting future for the generations that follow us.</p><p>When I think of the growth of this region over the past 50 years, from the transformation of Dubai to the position of the Gulf as the UK's third-largest export market, I never forget that the bedrock of this prosperity and stability has been the relationship between the Gulf and the West. Now, in this period of uncertainty, is the time to recommit to this relationship. </p><p>Already the Gulf is a special market for the UK. Last year alone, trade between the UK and GCC was worth more than GBP30 billion. At the same time, Gulf investment in the UK is helping to regenerate areas from Aberdeen to Teeside, and from Manchester to London. I am determined that we should do everything possible to build on this and elevate our trade and investment to an even more ambitious level.</p><p>Free trade makes us all richer. It creates jobs. It increases investment. It improves productivity. It transforms living standards and creates opportunities for all of our citizens. And nowhere is that more important than here with our friends and allies in the Gulf. I am delighted that we agreed to set up a new Joint Working Group to examine how we can unblock remaining barriers to trade and take steps to further liberalize our economies for the benefit of our mutual prosperity.</p><p>Just as we take every possible step to break down the barriers that are restricting our trade and prosperity, it is also important that we continue the work to bring our peoples together and to ensure that the benefits of greater prosperity are shared by all. We all recognize that there is some way to go before we can say that these economies really work for everyone.</p><p>But I have been encouraged by recent economic and social reforms you have taken forward and by the bold vision set out by all of the Gulf States for more fundamental and lasting change, most recently with Abu Dhabi's vision for 2030.</p><p>This vital strategic relationship between the UK and the Gulf—a partnership steeped in so much history and so full of potential for our future—now demands even more concentrated efforts. That is why I want to continue the hugely positive discussions we had in this first ever UK-GCC dialog at leader level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Ras Al Khaimah is truly blessed. Its topographical diversity makes it a place of natural beauty, where the mountains close in on the sea with mangroves, beaches, terracotta desert, and agricultural plains comfortably arranged between the two. Its geography encouraged human settlement as long as 7,000 years ago, endowing Ras Al Khaimah with a fascinating cultural and historical legacy and its people with a unique and resilient identity of which we are proud.</p><p>Positioned strategically at the mouth of the Arabian Gulf, Ras Al Khaimah was at times during its history an integral part of the trade and communications networks that preceded the era of globalization. For centuries travelers and traders from afar would have stopped, rested, and transacted their business here. The fortunes of its ancient predecessors, such as Julfar, rose and fell many times in those 7,000 years, but it is the transformation that began only seven decades ago that will define Ras Al Khaimah for the future.</p><p>While we benefit greatly from our union with others in a confident and dynamic nation, at the same time the challenge to develop and prosper is one that rightly rests in our own hands.</p><p>Ras Al Khaimah's vision is of an Emirate that offers the opportunity for businesses to grow and entrepreneurs to flourish in an investment climate that compares favorably with our competition; a place where visitors can experience a vacation that delivers authenticity and adventure, and where individuals can choose a residential lifestyle that is both high end and affordable.</p><p>The revolution that my father initiated began with education. He was acutely aware of its ability to transform lives, and through it, he wanted the people of the Emirate to be to be empowered. And with its acquisition came the inevitable transformation of a society wholly devoted to agriculture, animal husbandry, and the fruits of the sea into a modern and outward facing economy.</p><p>Education remains a key focus, and the establishment of the American University of Ras Al Khaimah and the Medical and Health Sciences University, both of which were designed to encourage local participation in tertiary institutions of international standard, are testament to the vision of Sheikh Saqr.</p><p>Just as Ras Al Khaimah's landscape is fashioned from geographical variation, its economic development has been built on diversity and sustainability. Our mineral wealth does not flow from oil but is locked in the mountain rock itself. From the 1960s this asset began to be exploited, to be joined subsequently by two of the Emirate's anchor industries—Julphar's pharmaceutical business and RAK Ceramics, now both leading players in their respective global marketplaces.</p><p>Those early businesses launched a manufacturing sector whose GDP contribution currently stands at over 25%, with representation from a wide range of industries, from nanotechnology to mass and specialist glass production through to vehicle and cement manufacturing.</p><p>Our free zones, RAK FTZ and RAKIA, which contain over 12,000 companies, have been instrumental in growing not only the heavier industrial base but also attracting entrepreneurs keen to benefit from the competitive edge that setting up in Ras Al Khaimah can deliver.</p><p>The topography that was originally so attractive to the first inhabitants has also been important in bringing us tourists in increasing numbers. 2016 saw 10% more visitors over the previous year, and they are also lengthening their stays to accommodate all the experiences and adventures that can now be enjoyed here. New source markets such as India are being tapped into, while existing ones like the UK and Germany continue to grow. The Tourism Development Authority's next target is 1 million annual visitors by 2019, and is on track.</p><p>An efficient and effective healthcare system is a priority for any government concerned not only for the wellbeing of its own citizens, but also keen to attract overseas talent to its shores. The healthcare structure in Ras Al Khaimah combines the strengths of the federal system with the best of the private sector, spearheaded by RAK Hospital, a unit which also has a growing medical tourism operation.</p><p>Underpinning this activity, a transportation and logistics network has been developed that is capable of handling current capacity while being upgraded to ensure that future growth is possible. The 611 national highway is moving north rapidly to link with the industrial areas adjacent to the mountains, and will not only bring a faster, more economical route for the products coming out of the region, but also remove it from our urban areas.</p><p>Our ports system, led by Saqr Port, the largest bulk handling port in the MENA region, also demonstrates diversity in its set of five separate operations that each offer specialist services, from repair to maritime free zone to leisure activity.</p><p>Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch have consistently ranked Ras Al Khaimah as 'A' rated, marking it as an attractive and secure place in which to invest, something reinforced by a 2015 World Bank report ranking Ras Al Khaimah as the 45th most friendly territory in the world in which to do business, putting it in the top two in the Gulf. GDP growth is predicted at a strong 3% for the near future.</p><p>Investors need to be certain that their business is supported by a legal system that is fair, transparent, and efficient. We have worked to improve and develop aspects of our judiciary in order to ensure this. Through a recent agreement with the DIFC, judgments from its English-language courts system, which investors, businesses, and residents can opt in to, will be enacted by the Ras Al Khaimah Courts.</p><p>In addition, a new one-day court system for minor civil and commercial disputes has dramatically cut down procedural times for these cases. These new tools and processes are ones that investors will welcome and add another tangible reason to establishing themselves in Ras Al Khaimah.</p><p>The commitment of our citizens, residents, and investors, along with the progress already made, demonstrates our Emirate's positive and productive transformation. Each day we continue to bring our shared vision closer to fruition. Ras Al Khaimah is truly blessed. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about your drilling expertise?</h4>
<p>In the last five years we have worked on the three largest drilling development geothermal projects with the highest operation and safety standards. One was Pertamina Geothermal Energy in Lumut Balai, Ulu Belu and Sungai Penuh field in south Sumatra, and SOL (Sarulla Operation Limited), operating in north Sumatra. In March 2017, we also won a new project with Supreme Energy in Muara Laboh. We are experienced in oil and gas; however, our expertise includes the requirements for geothermal, which requires high horsepower rig. All our rigs are US-built, and currently two are deployed with Supreme and two with Halliburton. The other three are currently participating in tender processes in Sumatra as well as eastern Indonesia. We are now looking to participate in another project for Supreme Energy Rantau Dadap in south Sumatra, which might start in 1Q2018. Furthermore, we are eying a geothermal project with Medco Power in Central Java, Enel Green Power Optima Way Ratai in Lampung, south Sumatra, and Simbolon Samosir Energy in north Sumatra. We also experienced in integrated project management drilling solutions and we previously handled this for Pertamina Geothermal Energy in several geothermal fields.</p>
<h4>What is your experience with the latest technologies and innovations making drilling less expensive?</h4>
<p>The challenge in geothermal drilling is the loss circulation, releasing the stuck pipes and blind drilling. Without careful management and swift decision-making, sometimes there is a loss of time to release the stuck pipe, loss of mud due to loss in the circulation, and loss in bottom hole assembly, which results in heavy costs for the company. We also need to continue with technological improvements to ensure efficiencies and keep operational costs down. There are now many competitors in the market, and the tender processes are competitive. There are no cost-recovery mechanisms. That is why bidding has become a beauty contest, and the contest is not just about price, but also about the company's track record: rig equipment, operational performance, safety record, management systems, and the ability of working capital. We have to stand out in fierce competition.</p>
<h4>From your perspective, how is the private-public engagement in the sector? Is there a good understanding of the private sector and the government?</h4>
<p>The problem in geothermal is the cost of exploration, and that includes the necessary infrastructure development. For example, in remote and mountainous areas, protected forest permits and road infrastructure are costly. If these investments solely come from private companies, it becomes almost unfeasible, and we thus need the government to come in. Fortunately, there is willingness on its side to collaborate, both in exploration and energy infrastructure. There is a handicap, however, which is the new pricing mechanism. Following the new governmental regulations, PLN has now issued a maximum price on the production cost, as opposed to the previous feed-in-tariff, whereby it would be discussed with PLN after exploration of the potential. This has already been shown to delay geothermal projects and has resulted in certain new companies waiting to understand what the government wants. The new pricing mechanism impedes potential investment in the sector. It is possible that investments will continue in East Indonesia because of the price differences across the country; however, the price in Sumatra is now USD0.0928 per kilowatt/hour, which is unattractive for investors. A new model being similar to what is being used by another geothermal company could be developed. That is to build a small power plant in a location where it drilled three or four wells. Instead of building a large power plant, they built several small plants with capacities of 3-10MW. In this way, operations commenced much faster. A power plant of 55MW needs more than five years before operations start. This model is simple, and this could be the model for the future, given the current governmental regulations. We see opportunities there.</p>
<h4>From your perspective, what is the potential for the future of the energy mix in Indonesia?</h4>
<p>We see enormous prospects for geothermal. Government regulation requires 25% of all energy to come from renewable energy by 2025, of which 20% should be geothermal. In total, there are plans to add 35,000MW to the total power generation capacity. The revolving fund that the government has set up coordinated by PT SMI is a great idea as it could drive more investments in the exploration stage. It lifts the burden from the private sector, and companies will repay the government once they pursue the project after successful exploration. We are pleased to be involved with these government-backed exploration drillings, and will await our deployments.</p>
<h4>Looking to the future, how is your organization gearing up for the projects in the pipeline?</h4>
<p>We have an engineering base ready to operate these rigs and can thus start work immediately. We continue maintaining the rigs to ensure they are ready for operation. Currently, there is a strong backlog of geothermal projects; not all drilling contractors can work on such projects because of the specs of the drill. If oil prices remain low, there will be better opportunities for geothermal. If the oil price remains low in 2018 as well, then we will not do much in that segment, at least increasing exploration. We have not been working much in oil and gas for the last year.</p>
<h4>What are your ambitions for the company looking forward?</h4>
<p>We want to be the drilling expert of choice in this country, and in the private sector, we are already the leaders in onshore drilling in our field. With seven rigs, we outnumber our direct competitors, which typically deploy just one or two rigs. In the next several years, we anticipate more projects as there is a strong public and private drive to develop the geothermal industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Creating a RAK Brand]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ramy-jallad-ceo-rakez-rak-ftz-rakia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures are being set up through RAKEZ to cut red tape for international investors?</h4><p>We pride ourselves on our customer focus and service; any red tape in any organization will affect the end user or customer at the end of the day. We cannot afford to do that. One of our corporate objectives as well as one of our guiding pillars at RAKEZ include customer focus. Everything we do is customized for each customer. RAKEZ was established to be a regulator and to improve the services of the previous entities that we had, which were RAK Free Trade Zone and Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority. When we merged them under RAKEZ, one of our main objectives was to re-engineer all our processes to be customer-centric, remove all bottlenecks and unnecessary transactional activities, and empower our frontline staff who deal with our clients, our leadership, and our managers with the right delegation of authority. They can now do away with red tapes when serving customers and making decisions on the spot. We cannot have a customer-centric organization or a customized approach to investor's packages or proposals when there are red tapes. Another thing is that in Ras Al Khaimah, we act as one team. It is not only RAKEZ that is eliminating red tape; the other government entities that are our stakeholders and partners work with us to deliver the service or approve a service follow the same philosophy.</p><h4>How challenging is it to develop the Ras Al Khaimah brand in comparison to other Emirates?</h4><p>Investing in a brand is a long-term strategy and we have created a strong brand in a short period of time. Ras Al Khaimah has historically been a strong brand for industry and SMEs; however, now it is also known for its value proposition: customization and customer-centricity. At the end of the day, it is how we deliver that brand and our DNA, as each of us may have the same, but we do it differently. The Emirates all complement each other, and we are all focused on the type of industries that we can attract, our enablers, and the services we can provide. Some choose to go to Abu Dhabi or Dubai for the amenities and the livability of those Emirates. Others choose to go for heavy industry that requires more power demands, which are available in different areas. We know and attract investors and customers that fit within our capability and we complement each other. In addition, the Ministry of Industry and the entire UAE are supportive of Ras Al Khaimah being an industrial hub. I do not see it as competition but as complementing and offering the right package for the right investor. Today, investors look at the total package; they not only look at RAKEZ fees, but also the standards of living. We know who we are attracting and we are looking at the contribution to Ras Al Khaimah's GDP and the contribution to the GDP of the UAE. However, to do that, we are also looking at the companies that we are capable of supporting because if we attract an investor that we cannot serve, then that is the worst thing we can do.</p><h4>What value proposition does RAKEZ offer?</h4><p>We focus not on heavy power-intensive industry as the industry is evolving and moving toward clean energy. We focus on industries that have a higher contribution in terms of manpower expenditure because we look at GDP contribution. The industry itself is shifting toward automation and robotics, and we offer a value proposition and services to these clusters of companies. One of our main value propositions is the cost-effectiveness of running a business in Ras Al Khaimah. We have a high standard of living, with seaports, airports, and a highway network that is second to none.</p><h4>How do you balance industrial development with the idea of increasing economic diversification in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>Ras Al Khaimah has been strong in the tourism industry and historically strong in logistics due to our ports. We are actually home to the largest bulk port in the Middle East. In addition, we have a great deal of industry that not many people know about. Many of the top manufacturers that supply construction building materials are located here. We have over 600 manufacturers from small, medium, and large in all industries. As part of Vision 2030, we want to enhance the GDP contribution of manufacturing and other industrial sectors. It is our strength and we should continue to have that strength because of the value proposition and services that we give. They complement each other as we do not only boost the manufacturing industry but we create an ecosystem for living that contributes to the GDP.</p><h4>What role can Ras Al Khaimah play in the GCC to move away from oil-based economies?</h4><p>The great thing is that we were never truly reliant on the oil or carbon industry in the first place. We have always had to rely on being innovative and attracting both a healthy balance between SMEs and industrialists. We are ready to adapt to the industry that we attract, as they are changing as well. We have to look at targeting different types of industry that is evolving and be prepared for it. Everyone today is talking about Bitcoin and blockchain. We have to understand the trends in the market so that we are ready for it two or three years in advance. It is all about strategic planning and what we do today to prepare for the market in three to four years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the current penetration of cloud services in Mexican companies, and what are the challenges or further development?</h4><p>In terms of the IT industry, the principle was to deliver solutions where the complexity remained on the user's side. In other words, as a company when we used to sell products and not services, you used to deliver business solutions where there was a good platform but the complexity of implementing and operating the solution was kept to the customer side rather than the provider side. After this, it was the individual customer's problem, and that is how the industry operated in the past. With the cloud solutions two things happened; one the complexity went away so companies could concentrate on their core business. The other important thing was that the cost dropped dramatically with the cloud because it became easier to advantage of economies of scale. The cloud is growing in Mexico by three digits, as is Oracle. We are making it more accessible to people, and now companies that are part of the middle or lower tier can afford to purchase a solution. The other aspect is complexity; if I compare the adoption rate of cloud in Mexico versus the US or any other large economies, I would say it is exactly the same or perhaps higher, because companies have leapfrogged to the cloud. We are therefore reaching a market that we could not reach before. We improve data security by reducing the danger of losing information or the danger of someone hacking into a system and stealing information. The main constraints were security, as people were afraid they could not have their information at their facilities; however, people are starting to realize that it is much more secure in the cloud than in their own infrastructure.</p><h4>What are your priorities in terms of research and development?</h4><p>Customer experience is one of the main aspects, as the world is changing based on customer experience; every single business will need to have behind its walls the traditional systems and ERP. However, as a customer I want to interact through a cell phone and make a reservation or buy something. The second aspect is big data. With the Internet of Things (IoT), every single device is now connected to the internet and provides information. For example, if I open my phone then it shows my heart rate; this is real time information that is being stored in the cloud as we speak. We need to be able to take advantage of that information by analyzing and getting ahead of the competition by understanding patterns of marketing intelligence. The other important thing that Oracle just announced is that we need to have certain intelligence embedded in the systems so that we can do things before we realize they need to get done. The system starts to learn and that is having artificial intelligence embedded in the technology, which is another big trend currently. The cloud is performing well in Mexico because of these issues. Economies that were more mature are taking more time and economies that did not have much technology are becoming more interested in those solutions. Only a few companies can deliver these box solutions in the arena of changing the customer experience.</p><h4>What new opportunities did the communication reform in Mexico create for Oracle?</h4><p>The reforms were necessary, and one of the main achievements of this administration is the reforms. We are facing a problem, however, with the implementation of the reforms, as they are intended to produce a better industry with more affordable prices etc. Are we seeing the results yet? No, we have not. I believe that those reforms were needed but to implement those reforms we need to have technology. We cannot do this by hand and need to have technology. The reforms were important for this industry and are generating a lot of business. Every aspect the new reforms require companies to do is done through technology. For example, in the telecommunications industry, companies are now required to report how many minutes they were giving if they are the market leader; this was not previously possible without technology. Reforms require a lot of IT technology and are therefore benefiting the industry.</p><h4>What are your short-term growth projections?</h4><p>I predict the industry to grow between 5% and 8%, and our growth is currently double-digit. Therefore, I am extremely optimistic as we are growing much faster than the industry average. What is driving this growth is the cloud. The public sector is not growing as fast as in previous years because we are in a year of elections and power change. Therefore, most IT investments in the federal government will not grow as fast; although, on the other hand, we will be growing in terms of regulators and reforms. I truly believe that the money spent in IT technology will grow no matter what; with or without the public expenditure as it is enabling new business forms.</p><h4>What are the pillars of your corporate social responsibility strategy?</h4><p>Our purpose is transversal to our business. Around a year and a half ago, we thought about what our purpose should be. We came up with a simple purpose and that is we will transform Mexico—by enabling our customers to transform themselves through new technologies. There are many publications that show countries that invest in technology have faster economic growth than others. We can change Mexico by enabling our customers with innovative technology to come up with new business models and new ideas and by being more competitive. For example, we work with a health institution that used to take six or seven hours to help a patient, requiring them to invest half of his or her day in a medical checkup. Now, because of our technology, these visits will only take a couple of hours. This is a transformative—we are transforming the lives of Mexicans. We are focusing not only in growing our business, but also having a social impact.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[oba-adetola-emmanuel-king-chairman-ceo-adron-homes-properties]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the main driver behind the inception of the company?</h4><p>The company was established in 2012, and we were driven to make housing affordable for all with the aim to reach as many Nigerians as possible. We know there is no shortage in the high-end market; the housing deficit is within the low end and middle class. The entire affordability concept is not about housing being cheap; housing is not cheap anywhere in the world. It is expensive. And it is not about houses itself, but the totality of the environment: schools, roads, bridges, hospitals and so on. Therefore, the affordability concept is that if a house goes for NGN10 million (USD27,740), one is able to pay for that over a period of like 20 years. When a client approaches a mortgage institution in Nigeria, they will request collateral which on a larger scale is not available. We came in with the strategy of not going through the bank but providing a flexible payment plan between five to ten years which is payable on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. The daily basis is affordable for most Nigerians, especially those who work in the informal sector. The majority of them earn wages on a daily basis and it is easier for them. There is a system already in operation for years called daily contribution “ESUSU" where a group of people come together in a company, group or a society, and they contribute money on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.</p><h4>How can you contribute to filling the housing deficit in Nigeria?</h4><p>The passion to make impact in the real estate sector coupled with my academic qualifications. Our vision was to reduce the housing deficit in Nigeria by 10% within the first 10 years, translating to 1.8 million new homes. In the first five years, we have achieved over 100,000 subscribers, which means we still have a long way to go. However, that is a landmark achievement and very historical for a company that is just five years old.</p><h4>What sets you apart from your competitors?</h4><p>Our vision set us apart. We are not afraid of competition as we have a clear vision and are not competing with anyone as we are just a focus-driven company with a target, and on a daily basis we increase our land bank and our clientele. We were not impacted by the recession; in fact, in 2016 we experienced tremendous sales. We were not hit because our products as well as our clients were domesticated. Foreign transactions attracted huge costs, and we did not do any foreign transactions, nor rely on foreign products during the recession. Nigeria has a population of over 170 million and over 18 million of them are homeless; that's huge business! We sell everyday and we have demands for our housing products. The lower and middle-class are in dire need of this product.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your plans to build for Nigerian communities abroad?</h4><p>The first phase of our intro into other countries is to have our presence there for Nigerians. We have representation in the UK, the US, Canada, and UAE. We have business executives there marketing our product to Nigerians in diaspora. The second stage is to build Nigerian community estates there; we have our presence in these four countries.</p><h4>What are the current challenges in Nigeria's real estate sector?</h4><p>The challenges are enormous, starting from land acquisition to product conceptualization to product delivery. The land law or land use decree of 1978 is not favorable. When a company acquires land or buys directly from the government, there are other people to deal with in the host community for a seamless acquisition.  Land titles are also a major problem; getting the certificate of occupancy can take months and bottlenecks in land ministries. What should cost a few million ends up costing several million, which adds to the cost of the land or property you build on it. We also have to rely on laborers from the Republic of Benin and other African countries who are often more expensive than our local artisans so this also increases the cost of production. However, with the government's current economic plans we are beginning to see influx of foreign companies setting up production factories in Nigeria, right now we have companies from China producing tiles right here in Nigeria. This is very good for the sector. From inception to completion, the value chain process has enormous challenges.</p><h4>What is your outlook and expectations for 2018?</h4><p>Every year we have great expectations. As a company, before we start a year we look at our shortcomings in the last year, what we have achieved, and what we did not achieve. We will approach the new year with new goals and expectations. In 2018 we will expand more into West African countries, build more houses, and acquire more land to satisfy and delight our clients even more.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[60% of Panama real estate sales below USD120,000]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[diego-vallarino-lewis-executive-presidentceo-grupo-verdeazul]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the company's achievements?</h4><p>Grupo VerdeAzul was founded in 2006 as an investment corporation with a mandate to invest and create world-class projects that have a high socioeconomic impact in Panama. Our portfolio of investments focuses predominantly on the real estate and tourism sectors, and just recently we started investing in logistics and agriculture. We take great pride in the projects we invest in, especially Buenaventura, which has evolved into Panama's premier beach community. The majority of real estate sales for the high-end market in the beach areas are at Buenaventura. It has become an integrated weekend getaway community, with hotels, golf courses, beach clubs, and restaurants. Our next step is to evolve it into a permanent community incentivizing people to live year round, by adding more amenities such as a k-12 school. We started investing in hotels long before Grupo VerdeAzul was founded and have continue to do so as we invest in more real estate projects; capitalizing the synergies between the two sectors. We have had a successful run and the group's name has become associated with quality and high standards. Given the high visibility of the brand we have been able to grow our portfolio of investments and are currently involved in approximately 40 projects. Today, our core business has evolved and we focus our efforts on creating communities anchored around amenities. These are long-term, large-scale projects of 20-30 years, with communities in the thousands of units.</p><h4>How is your marina project at Buenaventura progressing?</h4><p>When we launched our marina project, it immediately had huge acceptance from the local community and generated sales rapidly. Thus far, the project has advanced without delays. We are about to finish the excavation of the marina and will connect the marina to the river shortly. We have already started building the residential units and expect the marina to be operational by YE2018. We will start delivering the units for people to live in by 2019. The marina project has been the tipping point both for creating a community that caters to permanent residents and to focus on the international clientele as it complements the rest of the world-class amenities already in place.</p><h4>What is Grupo VerdeAzul's diversification strategy for the next five to 10 years?</h4><p>We want to diversify our real estate offer in terms of price point while maintaining focus on our core strategy of building communities anchored with world-class amenities. In April 2018, we will launch a project in Santa Mónica, a new city targeting middle to lower to middle-income house buyers, which is the majority of the real estate market in Panama. More than 60% of real estate sales in Panama are below USD120,000. We are excited about this city project because we will change the paradigm and mindset of how to build a community for this market segment. We have discarded diversifying to other market segments as the real estate market vacancies have increased over the last years for commercial, retail, industrial and high-end residential. As an example, the vacancies have gone up five-fold for office properties to 27% vacancy rate. Vacancies have gone up due to the rapid expansion that happened between 2011-2016. During those years, the supply of commercial, industrial and retail more than doubled the market size. For example, industrial went from 350,000sqm to 1 million sqm. There is still room for growth in the residential market, though one has to pick and choose their investments, which is what Grupo VerdeAzul is doing. We are focusing on what we have done well in the past and streamlining processes to be more efficient and preempt the market changing dynamics.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the VerdeAzul Foundation and its main initiatives over these years?</h4><p>The foundation focuses its efforts on education programs around the communities we serve. We had an impact on 50,000 children in 2017 under our different programs. We also focus on technical education for adults. For example, we sponsor a program for indigenous people to continue their traditional Mola sewing craft, but using contemporary designs. We sell this artwork at our hotels and through auctions with all the profits going to the community. We also sponsor programs for children to support not just their academic development, but also social development to stimulate their interests and morale, and allow them to integrate well into society. That initiative has had great results and has just been nominated for an award in Spain. The foundation mainly helps communities through the learning scope, though also with the aim of teaching them to fend for themselves. For example, we donate the materials to build schools, but it is the communities that build and run the initiatives. We do not get involved in a sponsorship if the community is not involved and vested as well.</p><h4>What are the main goals and priorities for Grupo VerdeAzul in 2018?</h4><p>Aside from implementing our diversification strategy, our main goal is to expand our market and reach out to international clientele to attract them into one of our communities. We are creating tailor-made programs and departments within the company to cater to international clientele and facilitate their stay while in Panama. As a company we are embracing the multinationals who have moved to Panama and we look forward to doing more business with them. Our overarching theme will be to reach out to new markets and expand our demand base, while being selective in our investments. This is not a small thing; we are talking about several millions in investment and development going toward this goal of making sure not only Panamanians, but the international market, know about the quality of Grupo VerdeAzul's work.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the reasons for joining RAKIA and RAK FTZ under one single organization?</h4><p>The United Arab Emirates is growing at unprecedented rate. Investors are flocking to this side of the world to set up or expand their businesses and with this, the competition between investment hubs in the country is ever increasing. The reason behind RAK Free Trade Zone (RAK FTZ) and RAK Investment Authority's (RAKIA) joining was to revolutionise Ras Al Khaimah's investment landscape and support the emirate's vision of attracing more investments. The move has brought a major impact in the emirate as it created a hub that offers a broader range of business solutions. RAKIA was successful in supporting industrial companies. On the other hand, RAK FTZ was strong in the SME segment. So with the two under the umbrella of Ras Al Khaimah Economic Zone (RAKEZ), we now have a powerhouse economic zone that is very comprehensive as it able to cater to businesses of all sizes. We remain competitive in the market by offering global investors a platform where they can access wide-ranging premium facility options and first-class services that suit their needs. Right now, we are continuously working hard to provide our tenants a more seamless, nurturing and transparent ecosystem by offering enhanced levels of services. In line with this, just recently, we launched a new one-stop shop called RAKEZ Service Centre — Al Hamra which houses our services from A to Z. Government entities are also on-board with us in the same location for easier processing of government-related requirements. Having all of these in one location helps in the easy and efficient facilitation of processes. For example, if an owner needs a permit from the Civil Defense and wants to apply for membership with the Chamber of Commerce, he or she can accomplish both in one location. We're all about finding ways for our investors to spend less time and efforts doing administrative tasks so they can focus on running their businesses.</p><h4>What were the challenges of the process of joining forces into a one-stop shop?</h4><p>I wouldn't say they are challenges but more of new investments. As we build a new and more comprehensive one-stop shop, we began to understand that there are areas we can improve by adding new technology and manpower. So, we invested a great deal in IT solutions so that our customer service team is able to provide the best support to our clients. We have implemented SAP and Salesforce, as well as CRM which helps us communicate better with our customers, enhances our team's productivity and provides solid analytical data and reporting. We have also added an important department to our team called the Customer Experience Department. This is an arm that ensures that all complaints are sorted out either with relevant departments within RAKEZ or with other entities of the government. I can say that everything went smooth with the establishment of the new service centre as our collaboration with other governmental departments has been very efficient.</p><h4>How do you envisage Ras Al Khaimah further boosting economic diversification?</h4><p>For years, all of our efforts have always been towards further boosting the UAE's economic diversification. Among the reasons for the establishment of RAKEZ is actually for this very purpose. With the best of the best of RAK FTZ and RAKIA joined under RAKEZ, Ras Al Khaimah's position as an ideal investment destination has even more solidified. Right now, we currently have over 13,000 companies from over 100 countries operating in more than 50 sectors, and I am positive that this number will double few years down the road. Of course, more investors means more sectors will boom resulting to strong economic diversification. This is especially, as I have mentioned earlier, we cater to SMEs, entrepreneurs, and industrialists. Our efforts have brought in thousands of SMEs in the emirate and this is very important. The SME community is the backbone of the economy, a strong driving force to enhancing a country's productivity and growth rate as they attract new consumers and new investments. We nurture them by offering cost-effective facilities such as Flexi facilities and offices as well as Easy Payment Plan to help setting up and running a business more manageable. On the other hand, the leadership of the Emirate encourages us to attract anchor industrial tenants because industrial manufacturing represents almost 26% of the GDP. So, we are aggressive in conducting roadshows in our core markets to approach large companies, and the number-one question of these companies is about the cost of living for their employees, which includes schooling, housing, transportation, and so on. We have proven to them that Ras Al Khaimah is very cost-effective. Plus, we are only one hour away from Dubai International Airport, and within a four-hour flight to 30% of the world's population. In terms of logistics, we have seaports, an airport and multilane superhighways. Just recently, Saqr Port has signed with Hutchison Ports to be the new terminal operator. This provides a great added value to our anchor tenants for the container terminal. So yeah, overall, I envision Ras Al Khaimah to remain a strong contributor to the UAE's diversification efforts. Especially now that renowned credit rating agencies such as Fitch Rating and S&amp;P has issued an 'A' rating with a 'Stable Outlook' for the emirate.</p><h4>How can industries be encouraged to set up in Ras Al Khaimah when the UAE market is not that large?</h4><p>When we go on roadshows and meet with potential investors, we tell them not to do feasibility studies on Ras Al Khaimah or the UAE alone; they have to think of Africa, India, Asia, and Europe. At the same time, we encourage them to show us their feasibility so that we can advise them on the type of company they should open. We can prove that it can be more economical to set up a company with RAKEZ and export to Europe, Africa, or Asia. For example, Ashok Leyland produces 3,000 buses a year. This is not only for the UAE market; it also exports to the GCC. Another example is Italfood, which exports 90% of its cheese to the GCC. In addition, we have Dabur International, which is a large exporter.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Beyond Connectivity]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[osman-sultan-ceo-emirates-integrated-telecommunications-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have argued that telecoms have to go beyond connectivity services to remain successful. How are you developing du in this sense?</h4><p>All telecoms companies will be completely different in 2022 from what they are today. The disruption in the telecommunications industry will continue and even accelerate. The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Big Data and other disruptive technologies will increasingly have an overbearing influence on many of the things that we do. We have to be humble and admit that we do not know exactly how all these will work together because it will be beyond our wildest expectations. However, we can be sure that the impact of this 'disruption' will be immense, and this is why we needed to be better prepared and evolve our company beyond our mainstay - the connectivity business. To give you a perspective, we crossed the AED13-billion (USD3.5-billion) mark in revenue for the first time in 2017, of which more than 95% comes purely from the connectivity business. We need to ensure the development on that is all about efficiency, customer experience, and digitalization — which, we believe is natural progression for us. We are one of the two major players in the UAE that enable connectivity. Two years ago we mooted this idea that we can do more for businesses, for example around data. We can host data for companies, manage data for them, put a security layer around it, or create applications for companies that can be used on this space. We are starting to provide illustrations of this in government departments. Within that framework, we are not limiting ourselves to providing connectivity. The more we see cities, nations, and governments moving to become smarter and more digital, we will see greater need for such new partnerships.</p><h4>What challenges and opportunities will these disruptive developments bring about for du and society as a whole?</h4><p>We are delighted to note that our non-connectivity business grew by more than 85% in 2017 and this is our fastest growth track, even when more than 95% of our business comes from the connectivity business. With non-connectivity as the primary growth driver, our main focus on the connectivity side of business is to extract higher efficiency and better margins. These two pillars are on my radar and are tracked on a regular basis. One should expect an acceleration of disruptive developments. Moving forward, with all these discussions of an ultra-connected, super intelligent and digital world, this will not only impact the industry but also society as a whole. There is ongoing debate in the world; however, conversations around the balance between the technologically possible, the economically viable, the societally beneficial, the humanly rewarding, and the ethically compatible are needed. The recent World Government Summit, held in Dubai , was in fact one of the most developed platforms for these conversations at the level of government, industry, and academia, and these conversations need to happen. In the UAE we have a Minister of Artificial Intelligence, which is great to ensure we make full use of the opportunities of technology. We also have a Minister of Happiness, a Minister of Tolerance, and a Minister of Youth, reminding us we need an integral conversation about all this. Another important disruptive development is the move to a decentralized ecosystem. Blockchain, AI, and IoT are recipes for a perfect storm. Some might ask, will this all really be something good for humans? Will it increase divisions between people or will it help people? These questions may seem somewhat idealistic, though they are important to address. We strongly believe that the new opportunities around the 'brave new world' overcome the potential challenges, and that all these technologies can serve the noble ambition of serving people's happiness.</p><h4>EITC develops the Smart Dubai Platform that serves as a central operating system of the city. What features make the Smart Dubai Platform one of a kind?</h4><p>Other smart cities in the world are smart in one or just a few dimensions. They need to solve or enhance a current situation and move into a certain theme. In Dubai, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed has set the target for Dubai to be at the forefront of the transformation of cities and nations and to be the smartest and happiest city in the world. In the Dubai Smart City ambition, six dimensions will be addressed. The ambition is incomparable with any other smart city development in the world as the scope is broader, and having this broader scope means the data connected from these sensors, the IoT, and the multiple government departments that interact will be richer than ever. This will allow capabilities not only for users, citizens, and visitors, but also for the city when it comes to better planning, anticipation, insights, and analytics. Blockchain will also play an important role in this. We are already working with the Smart Dubai Government to have some of the components based on blockchain technology and are discussing with certain government entities to run some smart services based on it. At the moment these are early use cases and the journey will be one step at a time, though it will happen. Overall, Smart City initiatives create innumerable opportunities for generating new business models focused on innovation, cost reduction, sustainability, productivity, efficiency, control, and transparency; and as these opportunities unfold and expand every day, Telcos play a key role in enabling the next-generation technologies that will bring them to fruition.</p><h4>How do you assess the diversification that Virgin has brought to EITC, one year after launching the brand here?</h4><p>We believe that some customers are willing to pay the right price for a premium experience. At the same time, we want to have an offer that differentiates itself. There is a certain customer segment that wants everything digitalized and online. When designing a product with a completely digital infrastructure, without the need to go to physical store, one will attract a certain type of people. Every day we see evidence that the assumptions that we made when we launched our second brand in the market were correct. We live in a world where the ideal situation would be marketing through social media and using the right analytics and insights, and we have a great deal of data on our network. We should know about how a specific user likes to use our services, and we should be able to use this to offer more targeted, customized products, and capabilities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the World Bank's main accomplishments and challenges in Colombia in 2017?</h4><p>In 2017, the World Bank continued to engage with Colombia as one its most important development partners. Over the last year, the World Bank approved four new operations with total commitments of USD1.3 billion. This included financing to help improve the quality of tertiary education with a focus on increasing the enrollment of students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. In addition, the bank expanded its support to Colombia's Pacific Region. As part of the Government of Colombia's “Plan Todos Somos PAZcifico," it approved a project to improve waterway transport and the quality of water supply and sanitation services in some of the poorest municipalities on the country's west coast. Furthermore, the World Bank provided development policy financing for different sectors of the economy, including support to fiscal sustainability and fostering productivity in non-extractive sectors. The bank also supported the government's green growth strategy by establishing a set of policy and institutional measures for green economy and improving environmental quality.</p><h4>What is the role of the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for 2016-2021, and how does the program support Colombia?</h4><p>CPF 2016-2021 guides the World Bank Group's engagement in Colombia taking into account Colombia's historical achievements including the 2016 Peace Agreement with FARC and Colombia's tremendous progress in poverty reduction over the last 15 years. Extreme poverty was reduced by over 50% to 7.4%, and moderate poverty fell to 26.9%. Informed by a systematic country diagnostic and a set of policy notes, the CPF emphasizes three main pillars: fostering balanced territorial development, enhancing social inclusion and mobility through improved service delivery, and supporting fiscal sustainability and productivity. Recognizing the historical importance of the peace for economic development, the strategy has a cross-cutting theme of peace building.</p><h4>How has Colombia's business environment improved in the Doing Business 2018 report? </h4><p>Colombia is still at the forefront in Latin America and the Caribbean region in efforts to improve its business climate, create jobs, attract investment, and become more competitive. Colombia has adopted 34 reforms over the last 15 years according to the Doing Business report of the World Bank, making the country the largest reformer in the region, followed by Mexico with 26 reforms, and Jamaica with 25. However, the reform agenda has slowed in recent years. In fact, Doing Business 2018 marked the first Doing Business report where no reforms were acknowledged to Colombia for purposes of scoring. The country performs well in the areas of getting credit, with a global ranking of two, and protecting minority investors (16). In both areas, Colombia is the regional leader. Colombia scores seven out of eight points on the depth of credit information index, which is above the average of 6.6 points of OECD high-income economies. In the area of protecting minority investors, Colombia receives a score of eight out of 10 points on the conflict of interest regulation index, compared to the average of 6.4 points of OECD high-income economies. It also performs well in the area of registering property, with a global ranking of 60. Today, registering property in Colombia takes 15 days and costs 1.9% of the property value, while in the UK it takes 21.5 days and costs 4.8% to do so. Colombia also outperforms the OECD high-income economies' regional averages of 22.3 days and 4.2% of the value of the property. Colombia underperforms in the areas of enforcing contracts and trading across borders. Resolving a commercial dispute before the Colombian first instance courts takes 1,288 days and costs 45.8% of the value of the claim, compared to 767 days and 31.4% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 577.8 days and 21.5% in OECD high-income economies. In the area of trading across borders, Colombia has a particularly lengthy border compliance process, which takes 112 hours, compared to the regional average of 63 hours and 13 hours in OECD high-income economies.</p><h4>What is the World Bank's outlook for Colombia in 2018?</h4><p>Growth is expected to strengthen gradually over 2018-2020 on the back of stronger private consumption, a gradual recovery of non-oil exports and higher oil prices, as well as a pick-up in the implementation of the 4G infrastructure program. Private consumption is expected to strengthen supported by lower inflation, higher formal employment, and as the one-off impact of the VAT increase on confidence subsides. Ongoing structural reforms are expected to enhance competitiveness and foster diversification, thereby supporting the growth recovery over the medium term. Continued fiscal consolidation efforts are expected to limit growth in government consumption and public investment will remain subdued, but should boost private investors' confidence.</p><h4>What have been the World Bank's main accomplishments and challenges in Colombia in 2017?</h4><p>In 2017, the World Bank continued to engage with Colombia as one its most important development partners.
