		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the ongoing projects for AzVirt in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>AzVirt will carry out a number of road construction projects over 2016, including the reconstruction of the Gala-Pirallahi motorway, Phase II of the design and construction of the motorway from Hasan Aliyev street to the Koroglu metro station parallel to Ziya Bunyadov Avenue, the repair and construction of the Formula One European Grand Prix track, and the construction of the Mingachevir-Mingachevir station motorway. Works within the reconstruction project for the Gala-Pirallahi motorway are carried out in accordance with the state program for the renewal and development of the road network in Azerbaijan. This 22km project is primarily aimed at ensuring easy and safe transport in the direction of the city center, as well as to Mardakan, Bilgah, Gala, and Pirallahi. A 15km-long, four-lane section of the motorway was put into operation in October, 2014. The length of the second, six-lane section is 7km and construction work is continuing as scheduled with the completion expected during 2016. The realization of Phase II of the design and construction of the motorway from Hasan Aliyev street to the Koroglu metro station will provide a route from all directions, which leads to Koroglu Metro Station, the city center, and the Ganjlik Metro Station via Hasan Aliyev Street. Creating easier highway access for vehicles coming from Baku neighborhoods will ease traffic in the city center. The length of this four-lane road is 4km, and we will also construct a 970m bridge within this project. Construction started in November 2015 and has been financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Works related to the project for the rehabilitation of Mingachevir-Mingachevir Station have also commenced. The length of this two-lane road is 16.5km.</p><h4>AzVirt is involved in the production of various construction materials. What are the different kinds of materials produced by your company, and what role does production play in your overall business strategy?</h4><p>One of the fields of activity at AzVirt is the production of road construction materials. This includes different kinds of asphalt-concrete mixtures, crushed stone with various fractions, and activated mineral powder. We do not produce these materials with the intention of selling, but instead to supply our company for the projects that we carry out.</p><h4>Azvirt has expanded to Romania and Serbia, and the Serbian Prime Minister paid a visit to AzVirt in 2015. What were some of the business points discussed in that meeting regarding your company's projects in Serbia?</h4><p>AzVirt is carrying out the construction of highway E763: Belgrade-Juzni Jardan, the Lijig-Prelina section in Serbia, and the reconstruction of the Bucharest ring road in Romania. In April 2015, a delegation led by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Serbia, Alexander Vucic, visited AzVirt. In the meeting, Mr. Vucic was informed about the construction activity of AzVirt in Serbia. We informed him that 20% of the employees on the Serbian project are Azerbaijanis, while the remaining 80% are local specialists. In addition, we mentioned the importance of taking operative measures designed to ensure the completion of the project on time. Mr. Vucic mentioned the government's support for the project and suggested to establish a working group for solving any problems that may arise during the project. The Prime Minister pointed out that this project is important for his country and he hopes that it will be completed by the end of 2016. This highway in Belgrade stands on the South Adriatic, and acts as a connection point between Serbia and Montenegro. It is the shortest connection between Belgrade and its surroundings in the South. The length of the four-lane highway is 40.4km, and the plan calls for the construction of 65 bridges and four tunnels with a total length of 1.7km on the highway. The Prime Minister expressed his intent to cooperate with AzVirt in the construction of a ring road around Belgrade and roads close to the borders with Macedonia and Greece (Corridor 10). His suggestion was highly appreciated by our company, and we will hold negotiations on this topic.</p><h4>How does the laboratory at AzVirt help in delivering your company's high-quality products?</h4><p>AzVirt has a wide production basis, which includes laboratories equipped with the most modern technologies from Germany, Austria, Italy, and other locations. In these labs, we can control the quality of all materials used during construction and for other tasks. The main job for our employees is to build and put into operation roads of the highest quality. Adhering to quality standards is a priority for us. While we mainly use the level of standards applicable to CIS countries, we also follow international standards</p><h4>The Formula One Grand Prix is taking place in Baku this summer. How is AzVirt involved in track preparation or other works for this race?</h4><p>Baku will host the Formula One Grand Prix in 2016, and the track for the race was designed by Tilke's Architecture Bureau. The track, which has an area of 143,000sqm and a length of 6km, will consist of 20 turns—8 right and 12 left turns. The track, prepared to the specifications of the Baku Grand Prix company, has been designed for speeds up to 340km/h. AzVirt will repair two layers of the asphalt cover for the race in many different areas of Baku. Repair works are being fulfilled according to the specifications for asphalt works submitted by Tilke's firm. In addition, a new asphalt layer has been paved with high quality control in Khagani, Bul-Bul, Pushkin, Z. Aliyev street, and half of Neftchilar Avenue. Streets are repaired in sections, taking traffic intensity into consideration. We plan to finish all repair work by May 2016.</p><h4>What are your targets and expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Our target for 2016 is to complete our ongoing projects on time and in a high-quality manner. We want to make a strong contribution to the development of the transport infrastructure of the country. We are also looking to extend our area of activity within the country, as well as in European and CIS countries by taking part in construction projects. For this purpose, we are looking to participate in tenders for appropriate projects in these countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you explain the rise of MilliKart in Azerbaijan from a card-processing center to a company with a unique shareholder structure that consists of 18 banks?</h4><p>MilliKart started as a department of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan to create competition in the card outsourcing market. The only card service prior to MilliKart was AzeriCard. Banks were not satisfied with the service quality or the fees that AzeriCard offered and so, in 2005, the Central Bank created Millikart in association with the World Bank. In 2006, the Central Bank decided to privatize MilliKart, which became MilliKart Group LLC. The company was created by 18 banks, which provided the staff and infrastructure. In 2010, the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) bought a 10% share in MilliKart, increasing our chartered capital by AZN5 million. We are currently the number-two company in Azerbaijan providing multi-banking processing services. We serve around 14 banks, among which are the banks with their own in-house processing centers. In terms of figures, we have 80 employees, 1 million cards served, 600 ATMs, and around 35,000 POS terminals. Two years ago, our business strategy changed to adopt new technologies such as e-commerce, mobile applications, and mobile payments. We are looking to diversify and we have actually changed the structure of the company to focus on three areas. In each area, we provide different types of services not only for banks, but also for retailers, insurance companies, and independent companies that provide payment services. We are focused on fast-growing new areas.</p><h4>What are some of the security measures that MilliKart employs to keep its customers protected during online transactions?</h4><p>Security is the most important factor in our business. Starting in 2005, we have had to meet the security requirements set by international payment companies like Visa and MasterCard. In 2012, all the main players in the market like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Diners Club developed new technology standards for this sector called Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). We were the first company in the Caucasus region to obtain a PCI DSS certificate. Every year since 2012, we have had a PCI DSS security audit as well as separate audits from Visa, MasterCard. An additional audit was applied in 2014 for e-commerce services. At this stage, we have six different audits per year, which is a necessity in this market. We take this issue very seriously, and we have never had a security breach or loss of data in our entire nine years of operation.</p><h4>MilliKart introduced a new mobile service for paying traffic penalties and your company also offers instant issuance solutions. How is MilliKart helping to develop the growth of non-cash transactions in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We provide services with companies like GoldenPay, an online payment provider, and also with E-manat, EasyPay, and ExpressPay, which are the main payment terminal providers. Using their infrastructure, we are working to attract clients to a cashless environment via the internet or mobile applications. Two months ago, we launched our own application, CIB, which enables our clients to put all their cards on to one application. You can make mobile payments and transfers to other cards. We are working on two startup projects in the taxi industry to provide card payment options through a mobile application. M-POS is critical to our strategy, because there are many POS terminals; however, there is a premium placed on mobility in this market. These static POS terminals are quickly being overtaken by more flexible mobile solutions. M-POS is less costly from the point of view of retailers and banks. We also support different kinds of internet portals that provide online payment services to their customers. Starting in 2016, we will have at least three clients that plan to launch e-Wallet applications, so we will be working closely with them. Right now in Azerbaijan, there is no legislation that regulates these kinds of payment services. The Central Bank announced that it plans to adopt new legislation with regulations that cover activities and technologies in the payment card industry by the spring of 2016. The reason global companies like PayPal or Facebook are not here yet is because this industry is legally unregulated in Azerbaijan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>There are plans to connect the railways of Azerbaijan and Iran by the end of 2016. How will this connection bring new benefits to Azerbaijan and the transport sector of the country?</h4><p>In February 2016, President Aliyev visited Iran and 11 agreements were signed. It was announced that a 8.3km section of the railway between the two countries and a railway bridge over the Astara River on the Azerbaijan-Iran state border will be completed in 2016. We are now in the process of designing it, and we have started looking for a contractor, although we may eventually build this bridge ourselves. This connection has many implications for our country and the transport sector in particular. This project will connect the Persian Gulf with Malacca Bay through a multimodal transport system, as well as provide a connection to St. Petersburg and Helsinki through older railways built back in Soviet times. We will be connected to Mumbai Port and Bandar Abbas Port. Current figures indicate that there are 5 million tons of cargo moving between India and Europe and about 7-9 million tons between Russia and Iran. We would enjoy the opportunity to be involved in some of this activity. There is a political will to achieve this and a willingness of the railways to help. In the first year of operation of the new railway, we are planning to transport 2-5 million tons of cargo, with plans to increase capacity up to 20 million tons in the future. This effort will require some renovations and we will need to see the construction of additional facilities alongside some new, technical solutions. This connection will boost Azerbaijan's currency inflow and work to create new employment opportunities for Azerbaijani citizens. If we can handle 2-5 million tons, we will be able to get $50-70 million and create 2,000-3,000 new jobs dealing with railways, maintenance, and so on. Iran also wants to establish a railway connection with Moscow and St. Petersburg.</p><h4>The first freight train recently completed the International Trans-Caspian route from China to Baku. How will this International Trans-Caspian transport route help Azerbaijan's plans to become a transport hub?</h4><p>In this project, we are creating a transport corridor that connects the East and West. It starts off in China, passes through Kazakhstan, the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukrainian ports, Bulgaria, and continues further along the Danube. Over the past 100-150 years, the majority of cargo has been shipped by sea, because it is usually a cheaper option. It is hard for railway transportation to beat sea transport; however, we can compete through the use of air carriers and trucks. It is challenging, but we believe that we will be able to win in this competition. With the new transport corridor connecting Mumbai to Europe, we will soon be able to deliver goods along this route in no more than 14 days at the most. In 2015, Kazakhstan processed 1.2 million tons of cargo from China, while we are just getting started in this activity. We will be working in collaboration with all of our neighboring countries in this capacity.</p><h4>What is the current progress of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway project?</h4><p>In regard to the BTK railway, there have been a lot of obstacles to the project because of the Armenian diaspora and the ongoing situation in that regard. There was an outcry that this BTK project leaves out Armenia, while we, an Azerbaijani company, started building this railway. With regards to the project's technical updates and specifications, we have almost completed 183km of the railway in Georgia; there are only some minor details that we need to finalize. Initially, this railway will handle 5 million tons of cargo and in the future the capacity will reach up to 17 million tons. The Georgian part of the project will be completed by the end of 2016. After the completion of the Georgian portion, the only part left to complete will be in Turkey, and ground works are almost finished there at this point.</p><h4>How can Azerbaijan's railways improve logistics capacity related to the county's exports and become an important source of non-oil revenue for Azerbaijan?</h4><p>It is no surprise that the oil and gas sector continues to play a huge role in the economy, but I believe that we need to diversify and focus on four main sectors: transit transportation, as this will allow Azerbaijan to transform into a transport hub; technologies and innovation; tourism; and agriculture. There is no country that can succeed without having a strong agriculture sector. The increased railway activity in Azerbaijan has the ability to improve the strength of important domestic sectors and can bring positive effects to ordinary people in the country.</p><h4>After transporting nearly 17 million tons of cargo in 2015, what are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The global economic situation is currently characterized by a period of decline. We are doing as much as we can at Azerbaijan Railways. We will continue our efforts to increase the amount of cargo over 2016. In 2014 we handled 21 million tons, mainly inside the country. The decrease in the amount of cargo can be explained by the devaluation of the national currency, decline in the domestic construction industry, and other related factors. The level of imports in the country was reduced as well. We are expecting the amount of cargo to surpass 25 million tons by 2025. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-lte-bite]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nar Mobile plans to present a LTE-A technology during 2016. What advantages does this new technology bring to mobile customers in Azerbaijan? </h4><p>LTE-A is about more speed. The download speeds that are seen in laboratory tests for LTE-A can exceed 200 MB per second, whereas the laboratory speed of normal LTE is closer to 100. We demonstrated this technology at Bakutel in December of 2015 and are finishing the final installation preparations and expect to offer it shortly. LTE continues to be a leading technology and it will take time for this to be broadly used in the market, which is beneficial for early adopters. When LTE is not heavily used, speeds are going to be lightning fast. Unlike our two competitors, our SIM cards have been designed for several years to ensure a smooth switch to LTE. Our competitors have older SIM cards that cannot be transferred to new devices without physically changing the SIM. We launched this service in October and within two and a half months we established ourselves as the leading LTE operator in Azerbaijan. </p><h4>Nar Mobile rebranded over 2015. What were the key initiatives in this effort? </h4><p>A major part of the rebranding was an iconography facelift by trying to alter public perception of Nar Mobile as an old fashioned brand to something more modern, bolder, and contemporary. Research shows that we made dramatic improvements with our new logo and 90% of all consumers that we tested reported high levels of likeability. That gave us a strong foundation. </p><h4>What are some of the specifics of Nar Garden's creative platform? </h4><p>We situated our advertising campaign in the Nar Garden, depicting this Garden as a comfortable, safe place for family and friends, and a place where people want to help each other. This complements our focus on consumer service. The combination of the strong new logo and the background of the creative platform have worked together and helped stimulate our business. The Garden is consistent with a lot of Azerbaijani values such as a welcoming attitude, integrity and honesty, and a feeling of service. We are utilizing “Nar,“ or “Pomegranate,“ because it is the national fruit and we think this combination will help make us a more welcomed brand. </p><h4>As the fastest-growing mobile network in Azerbaijan, how does your company stay competitive in a mobile phone market that has a 110% penetration rate?</h4><p>You will never grow in a penetrative market without innovation. Therefore, we are constantly working on new ways to bring new services and capabilities to our customers. We go out and talk to our consumers, trade dealer partners, and distributors to find out how our products are performing. For example, we decided to drive to Ganja instead of taking a flight in order to visit 15 different cities on the way, stopping at 50 different shops and meeting shop owners. From their feedback we were able to introduce some changes. Providing services that meet the consumer's needs is a key part of how we will maintain growth.</p><h4>What are your main projects and ambitions for this year in particular?</h4><p>We continue to invest in our network, which has now passed the leading competitor in the market in terms of number of base stations. Over the last two years, we have almost doubled the size of network. Our network also has the broadest footprint of LTE and it continues to get more and more 3G stations. We will focus on strengthening our presence in the regions, especially since we have improved our network. We want consumers to return and experience Nar Mobile in a new way. Our second goal is centered around Nar Home, through which we have ambitious plans to bring Nar into the home from a television and internet standpoint. We want to provide single bundles for the home and mobile experience. We have recently acquired a stake in City Net, one of the largest and highest-quality internet providers in Baku, and are working with it to speed up this process. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies has the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security implemented to promote local and foreign investment in the agriculture sector?</h4><p>The government is in the process of implementing both its agriculture development strategy and agriculture investment plan. With the new cycle of government, over the coming five years our development strategy will aim to increase production by expanding productivity in agriculture. We want to consolidate what we have done with products where we have already reached self-sufficiency, such as maize and cassava. We have plans to become self-sufficient in other products over the next five years too, and for that a certain level of public investment will be implemented, particularly related to infrastructure like roads and bridges, as well as investment in energy supply to the emerging agricultural industry. Our key goal is to follow through on a sustainable agriculture development strategy. We have developed a package of fiscal incentives and more favorable duty regimes for agriculture. Most imports of agricultural equipment, such as tractors and pipes for irrigation, will be duty free as part of this policy. Spare parts for those goods will face low levels of taxation, and throughout the six agriculture development corridors we plan to develop agriculture duty free zones to make the country more attractive in terms of investment. We want to transfer that experience to the other agricultural corridors, as investors will be more attracted to investments with low taxation for farming imports and the export of agriculture products.</p><h4>What role are women playing in the agriculture sector and how can they be provided with more access to finance for agriculture?</h4><p>In Mozambique, the majority of people living in rural areas are living off agriculture, and the majority of these people are women. There are different lines of credit for agriculture farmers designed to empower the small farmers, so if a man or a woman applies for credit in a given bank in which we operate the soft loan system for agriculture, the priority will be given to the woman's project. Each year the president gives an award to the champions, and this year's champion was the women's association in Zambezia province. This was the general award; however, we also have a special category for women, youth, scientists, and field extension work. </p><h4>What agricultural commodities hold the most potential for foreign investment in Mozambique?</h4><p>We have three groups of commodities, and 15 commodities that we consider to be strategic for agricultural development in Mozambique, as well as six priority commodities to be developed through a special incentive program and three to four commodities, which we want to re-launch. The priority commodities are maize, poultry, beef, rice, cassava, and vegetables.</p><h4>How would you describe the evolution of sugar and cashew nut production in the country?</h4><p>The sugar industry of Mozambique is advancing rapidly. It is a responsible kind of investment in the country because there is a real smart partnership in which private commercial investors come to invest in sugar and produce sugar cane directly on the farm, but they operate with the local chief and local community on a contract basis who then sell to the industrial interests. It is a successful system, and with sugar there is an incentive as we produce enough sugar for our needs but have a free market system to make sure that our sugar will be competitive. Anyone is free to import sugar as long as they pay the 2.5% import tax, meaning you can buy it cheaper locally. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the country and for the agriculture sector in Mozambique?</h4><p>The biggest expectation for me is to attract more investment. On the infrastructure side of the business this would be in dams for energy, water supply, and irrigation. We also want to attract more investors for agroprocessing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Cagamas met its goals of providing broad-based house ownership and growing the secondary mortgage market?</h4><p>For the last 29 years, we have promoted home ownership among Malaysians and issued MYR290 billion worth of bonds and sukuks, refinancing about 1.7 million houses in the process. In the 1980s, banks were reluctant to provide home loans due to the huge maturity mismatch and liquidity risks. Lending was long term while deposits were short term, which is why Cagamas facilitated the intermediation process, tapping into capital markets and providing such long-term funding to financial institutions. In turn, they could provide loans to house buyers. Banks are doing a great job in asset liability management. As the largest issuer of private debt securities in Malaysia, Cagamas is a regular issuer in capital markets. In terms of funding costs, the yield for Cagamas papers is just a few basis points above the government-guaranteed paper, and the yields are slightly lower than other AAA issuers. We could still go to the capital market, mobilize the fund, and pass it on to banks at a lower cost and they could then pass the benefits onto end borrowers. We act as one of the liquidity providers to financial institutions and provide funding stability for long-term home loans. In terms of promoting greater home ownership among Malaysians, we have been successful and about 25-30% of the portfolios of most banks are currently in housing loans. Currently our banks are actively providing housing loans. We have also helped the government fulfill its objectives in terms of providing affordable housing and helping young adults to get loans from a bank. We do this via two government schemes: the First Home Scheme and the Youth Housing Scheme. One provides home loans for people under the age of 40 while the other is for married couples who earn less than MYR10,000 as a couple or MYR5,000 individually. They can borrow up to 100% from the banks, with the first 10% guaranteed by our sister company, Cagamas SRP. The government of Malaysia pays the guarantee fees. These programs aim to help gainfully employed young people become homeowners.</p><h4>How would you describe the growth of the secondary mortgage market?</h4><p>We issued sukuk and bonds to the market to support our purchases in the secondary mortgage market. To date, we have issued approximately MYR290 billion worth of bonds and sukuk. Even during periods of economic crisis, investors were buying Cagamas papers; in fact, there were more buyers of Cagamas papers than usual, demonstrating the strength of Cagamas. We have never had a single technical default in our history, which is one of the reasons why we received a Moody's rating of AAA in 2013. We have entered the international capital market as we are seen as a market leader in the domestic capital markets. In terms of pricing, other corporate issuers use Cagamas as a benchmark.</p><h4>Malaysia is the global leading sukuk-issuing country. How significant is this for Cagamas' portfolio?</h4><p>About MYR80 billion of our total bonds were sukuks. Sukuks are popular because the Malaysian government, the Central Bank, and the securities commission have put together a complete financial ecosystem, including Islamic banks, Islamic securities companies, takaful operators, and Islamic pension funds, which provide ready demand for sukuk issuance. The demand for sukuk is greater than conventional bonds. Sukuk yields are often lower or the same as corporate bonds, whereas the reverse holds internationally. The Islamic finance ecosystem, the infrastructure, and the tax incentives all contributed to the success of sukuk. In 2015 and 2016, we issued sukuk in Singaporean dollars, the first company to do so. We can issue in any currency, depending on pricing and demand.</p><h4>Your issuances are mostly in ringgit, which devaluated last year but is on an eight-month high against the dollar. How do you anticipate and strategize on currency volatilities?</h4><p>When we issue in foreign currency to fund a purchase in ringgit, we make sure they are fully hedged through a cross currency swap; we would not take on any foreign exchange risks. In terms of foreign currency issuances, there are three variables: the benchmark—for example, for dollars it would be the US Treasury. The second is the spread over the benchmark, which depends on our credit rating and investors' perception of the company and country. There is also the cross-currency swap. When the currency is volatile, the cross-currency swap risk is not favorable because the bank would take a bigger margin to hedge its own volatility as well. If a currency is more stable, it is probably easier to get a cross-currency swap at a more reasonable and competitive price. When the currency is weak, there are a number of foreign investors who come to Malaysia to buy Cagamas ringgit papers. Previously, foreign investors were only buying up Malaysian securities, and not corporate papers. In fact, when Cagamas issued foreign currency bonds in the public issuance in dollars, approximately 70% was allocated to foreign investors, with just 30% going to Malaysian investors. However, foreign investors are now interested in investing in Cagamas ringgit papers too, since they are more familiar with Cagamas's name. The weaker exchange rate attracts them but, when the ringgit is stronger, things may change again.</p><h4>How have SME loans in Cagamas developed?</h4><p>In 2012, we did a strategic review of Cagamas and presented the results to the stakeholders. We said we would continue with mortgages, but also wanted to look at other sectors where we could replicate our success in the housing sector to help the development of the Malaysian economy. We looked at SMEs and infrastructure but chose education and health—people still need to go to university and hospitals reardless of economic factors. Part of our strategic focus is to participate in these areas of development.</p><h4>How does Cagamas tie into the Eleventh Malaysia Plan?</h4><p>Our support for homeowners, SMEs, and infrastructure projects all contribute to the Eleventh Malaysian Plan strategy and are in line with the future development of the country. There is a large funding requirement concentrated mostly on infrastructure projects, and we will look at the developmental needs of sectors that we can replicate using our current model. The Eleventh Malaysia Plan focuses greatly on affordable housing, which is why we are talking to PR1MA, a government-established company tasked with developing affordable houses. We hope to contribute to the government's agenda in that area.</p><h4>What are your goals for the next year?</h4><p>We do expect to do a bit more than 2015 but that depends on the market. We can raise up to MYR20-30 billion in sukuks and bonds, but we need to allocate these funds for purchases of loans. When banks sell us loans, we would tap the market and issue bonds or sukuk. To date we have issued MYR3.4 billion worth of bonds and sukuk. Loan growth among banks is a little sluggish right now, and banks' needs for liquidity have slowed down. We will still be able to do a bit more than we did last year. We issued around MYR6 billion in 2015; this year, we envision about MYR8 billion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Recently you have acquired two companies in Colombia. What is motivating this level of investment?</h4><p>Our company is a German company that has been operating in the Latin American region, with investments in Argentina, Brazil, and a commercial office in Chile. There was a gap in the Northern part of South America, as well as Central America and in Mexico in terms of Knauf products. The company has a precence in North America with Knauf insulation, which is the glass wool that is used to insulate against weather or even fire. Most of the plants for business are in the US; therefore, we began the analysis of potential investment destinations and Colombia was designated as a good opportunity north of Argentina. There are three plants in Colombia that produce this product, two of which we now own. One of the attractions is that the economic environment is better tailored to companies that want to invest and get returns. For example, the market in Ecuador is smaller, while Peru could present a good opportunity if it was not for the fact that we have a plan to start quarrying gypsum in Chile further down the line, and producing there. That was why we chose Colombia.</p><h4>Why did you decide to come to Latin America at this time?</h4><p>The company momentum is targeting Latin America. In March 2016, we bought a gypsum plant in Honduras. We now have three plants in the region and will continue investing. These two companies were producing three of the main gypsum board types, namely standard, the ones used in more humid environments, with the other being for passive fire protection and their final product was joint compound plaster to cover the drywall. The difference with Knauf is that we build and sell systems, rather than just offering basic products. We also look into ventures with locals, and are potentially setting up new production facilities. We are going to establish a joint compound plaster production facility in July in Bogotá to mitigate the high transportation costs in Colombia. The government has made a lot of effort to improve the transport networks, but much remains to be done.</p><h4>What are the next steps for Knauf in Colombia?</h4><p>The first thing we have to do when taking over operations of a local company is adjust the equipment to meet our standards. It is a challenging market that has been developed with imported products managed by distributors; they are strong here and it is difficult to compete. The market does not have regulations and norms like those found in Spain, for example, and there is no standard procedures in the building industry. The challenge is that there are many products coming from different places. Therefore, one of our focuses is to strengthen the technical department, build that knowledge, and train people. We have worked with Camacol and other companies that are part of the dry construction business to develop a guide that illustrates the best practices for constructing buildings in the dry construction segment. The biggest challenge is transfering this knowledge and developing a closer relationship with the builders, the sellers, and the architects. The market here is reluctant to utilize innovative insulation and building techniques, and it is hard to break the building habits. In the end, it is a matter of showing people how these systems work by building demo rooms. Even though it is a challenge, it is possible to overcome this. One of the main benefits is that it takes 80% less time to build this way, and the materials weigh significantly less than bricks or other possible materials. Then, you can introduce acoustic isolation, fire protection, and anti-seismic functionalities, the latter being critical here as we are in the middle of an earthquake zone. The biggest challenge is to change the building culture and begin training people.</p><h4>What kind of construction does the system suit best? </h4><p>The biggest market is housing, which is a little harder than the commercial segment, as businesses will never complain if you can get their office ready quickly. In Colombia, the biggest area for sales at the moment is in ceilings. The internal dry walls market is just opening. At the moment, they place bricks and then a board on either side, and instead of using messy cement, this is a much cleaner and faster method. Right now, our main drivers are malls and hotels, because they need their jobs done quickly and the flexibility of our system is attractive to them.</p><h4>Are you exporting from Colombia?</h4><p>Yes, this is a major driver for our business. Currently, we export around 30% of what we produce and we aim to reach around 50%. The natural market for us is the Andean region, Central America, and the Caribbean, and that is where we are focusing. We are planning to control this expansion into north Latin America from Colombia. We set up in Honduras, but are looking into other markets like Mexico. In Colombia we are on the coast, which is useful. The reason we do not have a plant in Bogotá yet is that there are no gypsum quarries in the area.</p><h4>What are your views on the construction industry in Colombia?</h4><p>It could be a challenging year. There was a 6% increase in licence approvals in 2015 compared to 2014, meaning there are projects coming. The government was investing a lot in housing for lower-income people, but as you know the state budget has been reduced because of oil prices, so that could be a challenge.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-nice-reception]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This year your company celebrates its 10th anniversary. Could you tell us about the achievements of the company during this period?</h4><p>In 10 years, our company was able to become one of the largest cable operators in the South Caucasus and Central Asia region. Our audience includes hundreds of thousands of people in Azerbaijan and dozens of other countries. We provide TV broadcasts through the most modern channels, allowing us to reach a wider audience. The most important achievement of our company is the democratization of cable television in Azerbaijan. Before AG Telecom, this service was extremely expensive and was only available at a premium level. Since our inception, we have managed to offer reasonable prices and meet the huge consumer demand for this service. Our company has made this service affordable to the mass market. We have not only continuously improved our technologies and expanded new services in the field of cable television, but also offered more services and products. The international music channel TMB TV, the Russian-language TV channel TMB for Russia, the radio channel AGFM for Georgia, the national television internet portal Myvideo.az, Call Center 119, and KATV1 internet allow us to operate in Azerbaijan and many other countries.</p><h4>The Myvideo.az television portal is one of the most interesting projects in the region. How did this service manage to achieve such popularity in a short time?</h4><p>The main reason for the popularity of Myvideo.az is the integration of advanced technologies into the website. People can watch any TV program within a 10-day archive. This allows each user of myvideo.az to watch TV shows, sports events, movies, and other TV programs at a convenient time for them. Our SmartBox device, which we recently launched on the market, allows you to connect to our cable TV services from any point in Azerbaijan that has a minimum internet speed of 2MB/s. This device is tightly integrated with myvideo.az and allows you to view on TV more than 10,000 movies, TV series, and cartoons. SmartBox can turn every ordinary TV set into a smart TV. In addition to watching TV channels and video content from myvideo.az, users can also use a variety of applications through the TV set, including Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook.</p><h4>What is the reason behind AG Telecom's interest in regional markets?</h4><p>Our business strategy is to cover regional markets and to develop a variety of services within Azerbaijan. We understand that the Azerbaijani market is too small for our ambitions, and we will sooner or later have to face the challenge of expanding to foreign markets. We started the process of developing regional markets without waiting for the domestic market to become saturated. In the regional market, we perform a social function by promoting the achievements and culture of Azerbaijan. For example, we launched our regional AG Telecom radio channel for our compatriots in Georgia. The same radio channel is broadcast to the whole world via satellite. Our activities at the international music channel TMB TV once again prove that it is possible to successfully enter regional markets. We feel confident in foreign markets and even recently launched a Russian-language version. We have plans to launch another series of projects for the region.</p><h4>Your company has a strong position not only in broadcasting, but also in providing internet services. Why did you choose to enter this competitive and risky field?</h4><p>By developing services for internet access, we were guided by two factors. First, internet services will always be in demand and we do not see a mass infrastructure technology that can surpass the fiber-optic solution in the next 10-15 years. Our company offers not only ADSL, but a dedicated line, which substantially surpasses the quality of ADSL. Secondly, after our successful start in television, we thought that internet services seemed like a good fit for us, as the business model of this service is known and the demand will be permanent. We had to invest in the development of optics in the beginning, which is quite capital intensive. We then tried to attract new customers by stepping outside of our infrastructure network. Thus, the idea of myvideo.az was born, which has no equivalent in Azerbaijan, and we started selling SmartBox. Today, our target audience is the entire population of the country, not just those within the area of our infrastructure network. We are creating new markets and are actively engaged in diversification to keep up with market demands.</p><h4>AG Telecom is also known as a company that supports interesting initiatives to create internet TV channels. What was your reasoning behind this approach to development?</h4><p>We maintain our dynamism as a company by developing new projects from innovative startups. Our approach is already known outside Azerbaijan and other companies come to us with different business initiatives, including Western European companies. In terms of international cooperation, our company is an active participant in many conferences, forums, and exhibitions. We are also active in cooperating at the level of industry associations. I am the head of the Association of Cable Operators of Azerbaijan and within the framework of this organization we were able to regulate the interaction of Azerbaijani cable TV operators with foreign channels, as well as win a strong position in the Eurasian TV area. Today, our national cable industry is respected and cited as an example for countries that have problems between operators.</p><h4>In the period of low energy prices, the interest in other segments of the economy has increased significantly. How is the ICT sector able to lead the development of the non-oil sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The field of high technology has long been one of the most interesting segments of the economy. We saw this potential 10 years ago when we created AG Telecom and launched one of the largest cable operators, KATV1. We started as a cable television operator, but now we are essentially a multidisciplinary high-tech company that is able to solve complex problems. The whole ICT sector is going the same way and I can confidently say that Azerbaijan has a real chance of becoming a leader in the Trans-Caspian region in the field of technology.</p><h4>AG Telecom also supports such recognized cultural events as TURKSOY and other similar projects. How does AG Telecom promote Azerbaijani culture?</h4><p>AG Telecom is actively involved in various projects to support Azerbaijani culture abroad. The international TV channel TMB, which we run, is a long-time information partner of TURKSOY, which is engaged in the promotion of Turkic culture. The interests of Azerbaijan are supported by an international TV channel, increasing respect for and loyalty to our country. In the digital era, Azerbaijan cannot be limited by physical boundaries. The world is changing and, according to these trends, we have to change our actions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azercell demonstrated its Express Office at Bakutel 2015. What are some of the services offered through this Express Office model? </h4><p>At the latest BakuTel event, Azercell surprised its customers and all the visitors of the international exhibition with an entirely new retail concept and approach that they will see in all company stores in the near future. The new concept of the stand allows for one to be comfortably acquainted with our products and projects, provides a handy testing environment of the innovative solutions, and offers services for digital lifestyles. At BakuTel 2015, our stand demonstrated how Azercell products can solve common customer problems. The main goal was to inspire the consumer by offering tailored solutions. Each separate space had its own style, mood, and content. Interactive displays and features were intended to make customers learn and engage in a communal experience. Interactive elements were also developed to create tools that focus on providing the best telco examples. Shortly after the pilot demonstration at BakuTel 2015, we successfully launched our first new concept Azercell Express office at the 28 May Street Baku city center. The comfortable environment and professional personnel help the customers in their choice of any products or mobile devices. Furthermore, according to our one-stop-shop concept, subscribers are able to make payments for their phone bills, use the full range of customer services, and buy a new phone or number. Azercell Telecom was the first mobile operator among CIS countries to introduce such services to its subscribers by launching the first Azercell Express office in Baku back in 2004. Constantly expanding its network and coverage, Azercell now has 15 Express Offices operating in Baku and 35 in the regions. We also have four customer service centers in Baku and six in the regions. In general, AzEx offices in Azerbaijan have reached 50 in number. In addition, Azercell provides customer centers at Asan-1, Asan-2, and Asan-3 service centers, as well as at the service centers for Taxpayers under the Ministry of Taxes. Azercell will continue to increase the number of its Express Offices in the new concept all over the country in order to provide our customers with prompt and top-quality services.</p><h4>How is Azercell looking to get involved in the Formula One Grand Prix that is coming to Baku this summer and what are your expectations for the event?</h4><p>With the utmost confidence in my company, when any local or international large-scale event is held in Azerbaijan, Azercell has provided the highest-quality mobile communication services in line with world standards. This was the case during the First European Games of 2015 held in Azerbaijan, and also during the 2012 Eurovision Song contest held in Baku. Thus, our successful experience will be expanded and strengthened during the Formula One Grand Prix as well. I believe that the Azercell network will perform the best across all areas of the Formula One event. Having a reliable and strong network is our priority and the core of our business. Azercell also continues to be the largest investor in the non-oil sector of the country. In 2015, the company invested about AZN68 million in the development of telecommunications in Azerbaijan. Azercell is also a leading company in the field of technical achievements. Currently, the company owns the first and the largest LTE (4G) network in both Azerbaijan and the region. Our internet, accessibility, and customer services will be as speedy as a Formula One car.</p><h4>With the largest market share in mobile operations for Azerbaijan, how has Azercell evolved as e-commerce and mobile applications play a larger role in the lives of Azerbaijanis?</h4><p>Today, 4.5 million people in Azerbaijan choose Azercell. We account for 48% of the local telecoms market, and we are persistent in sustaining our leadership position. According to official statistics, smartphone penetration in the country is now 30.7%. This figure is growing directly proportional to indicators such as the economic wellbeing and IT literacy among the population. Approximately 3 million people per month use mobile applications in Azerbaijan. In order to let e-commerce and mobile applications play a larger role in the lives of Azerbaijanis, everyone in the country needs easy access to mobile internet. Making high-speed mobile internet affordable for everyone is one of our major targets, as well as increasing smartphone penetration, especially in the regions. Thus, over the past year alone, Azercell has provided up to 55% discounts on internet tariffs and held a range of smartphone campaigns and bundles. Azercell already started moving from a SIM-card selling culture to a solutions providing culture, always anticipating customer needs. Azercell is the widest provider of M2M solutions among mobile operators in Azerbaijan. M2M services are popular among individual customer groups of the company. For example, tens of thousands of energy meters for the Baku Electricity Network Company use Azercell SIM cards. We provide similar services to more than 300 companies throughout the country, amounting to over 130,000 SIM-cards. I am proud to add that we will continue our innovations in this field. In addition, the Barama Innovation and Entrepreneurship center operating on the initiative of Azercell produces a number of local applications for smartphones and it is growing every day with the involvement of new developers. At Barama, we provide young specialists with all the opportunities to create and develop their technological ideas and even organize their own business. Currently, more than 200 start-ups have applied to our center, over 60 of them have been working at our office, and more than 30 have successfully launched businesses. In addition, the first locally developed M2M technologies have been produced at our Barama Center. This includes the Sumaks system, which enables the control of various daily household processes remotely, and the recently presented Avtomaks, the first local GPS navigation service based on M2M. We have always been at the forefront of M2M technologies. My favorite app, Bookmate, was presented by Azercell in 2015 and has already attained wide popularity. It allows for access to half a million titles of literary works at any time through a mobile phone or tablet. The Bookmate app hosts more than 100 titles of Azerbaijani authors and offers classical and contemporary literature in Azerbaijani, English, Russian, and Turkish languages.</p><h4>What are some of Azercell's different social projects aimed at furthering the development of education in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>It is important to support corporate citizenship and responsible business. Azercell has always followed a distinct corporate social responsibility direction. We know that one cannot lead a healthy business without contributing to a healthy climate around it. Over the years, the company has supported a range of projects in health, education, sports, culture, and environmental protection. Education has always been one of our prioritized fields in our corporate social responsibility efforts. In addition, Azercell partners with the country's leading educational institutions and provides instrumental support through technological innovations. Above all, by focusing on the continued improvement of social welfare projects in our country, our new social responsibility strategy is designed to stimulate technological progress, develop young entrepreneurs in this sector, and utilize mobile technologies in education and in the application of innovative services. In this regard, the efforts and projects of the Barama Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center are of great value. In cooperation with the British Council, we have realized professional training for technical colleges across the country. Every year we organize extensive English language and professional media training for journalists. We pay special attention to students from Baku and the various regions of Azerbaijan. Every year, dozens of students receive honorary scholarships and get internship opportunities at Azercell. Over 1,200 students from different universities in Baku, as well as in the regions, have applied to these programs so far. The Student Bursary Program aims to provide support to successful students in their development as future specialists. This project, held under the sustainability strategy of Azercell, will help to strengthen the company's corporate social responsibility activities and contribute to the welfare of our society.</p><h4>The Parliament of Azerbaijan held successful elections in November 2015. How can this election help continue government support of innovation in the ICT sector of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Governmental support is important for SMEs and also necessary for the big businesses of the country. The State Fund for the Development of Information Technologies, operating under the Ministry of Communications and High Technologies, is an important body that stimulates the ICT field and provides financial support for the expansion of scientific research. We are glad that this foundation makes the necessary efforts to attract investments that provide for the production and technological cooperation between domestic and foreign companies operating in the ICT field. Also, the organization of conferences, seminars, exhibitions, and other international and local events is valuable. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year 2016, the 20th Anniversary of Azercell?</h4><p>As the most preferred mobile operator in Azerbaijan for the last 19 years, Azercell will aim to provide superior-quality mobile communication services in the country, maintain a high level of professional customer care services, introduce the latest technologies, and ensure access to high-speed and affordable mobile internet for everyone. Experience shows that there is not a big difference in timing between the application of the newest technologies in developed countries and Azerbaijan. For example, the launch of 4G in Azerbaijan by Azercell in 2012 was far earlier than in many of developed countries. The future is in mobile internet. Thanks to this technology, a number of new solutions will emerge in everyday life that will change the way businesses are managed. Azercell will stay faithful to our strategy of bringing world-leading technologies to Azerbaijan and continue pleasing our customers in the most beneficial way in 2016. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>AZAL reduced its prices for economy class seats on international flights by 20-30% in the summer of 2015. How does this new strategy help promote a vision of a more affordable airfare in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We have taken several important steps in accordance with President Ilham Aliyev's instructions to reduce air ticket prices. Since August of 2015, Azerbaijan Airlines has applied a 20-30% discount to the minimum existing tariffs for economy class travel to all international destinations for all passengers. The number of tickets sold at this tariff makes up 30% of all seats. It is necessary to note that economy class services are preserved for all passengers. AZAL now offers low-budget passenger transportation lines for the most popular flights of Baku-Antalya, Baku-Istanbul, and Baku-Moscow. The final sale price of tickets for the flights does not exceed ‚¬99 one-way. Unlike standard low-cost models, AZAL provides a number of advantages in its low-cost directives; for example, there is no additional registration fee or fee for choosing seats in the cabin. AZAL is keen to reduce prices for international flights. Recently, a new budget promo tariff was introduced on the Baku-Moscow flight, which does not include luggage. We also plan to open a new budget flight to the resort town of Alanya. The list of budget flights will continue to expand over the summer of 2016.</p><h4><br>Joining the ranks of companies like Emirates, Lufthansa, and British Airways, AZAL was recently awarded a prestigious four-star rating from international audit company Skytrax. What are the different qualities measured by Skytrax that go into this rating?</h4><p>The rating of airlines by Skytrax is measured on a scale ranging from one to five stars and is recognized by the aviation community as an unbiased and indisputable criterion in service quality rating. According to the current rating of Skytrax, a total of 37 airlines are registered at the rating of four stars. By receiving the four-star rating, AZAL has joined well-known global carriers such as Emirates, Air France, Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines, KLM, British Airways, Japan Airlines, and others. Skytrax auditors virtually evaluate all aspects of airline activity, from the process of buying a ticket to the service and comfort offered on board. The total criteria measured for the airline rating exceed 800. Skytrax pays attention to each indicator, ranging from the airline's website functionality, passenger registration, comfort in business lounge, assortment on menu, to the state of the aircraft. At the same time, a detailed assessment was made into the cabin's condition, its design and cleanness, onboard entertainment, crew uniforms, crew treatment of passengers, and operating efficiency. I am also glad that the Azerbaijani national carrier was nominated for the Skytrax award of World Airline Awards in the global category of “World Airline that achieved most progress," taking its place of honor among such global carriers as Air France and Delta Air Lines. Skytrax conducts audits and assessments of airports as well, awarding the Heydar Aliyev International Airport a four-star rating, putting it among such hubs as Heathrow London, Frankfurt, Abu Dhabi, and others.</p><h4>What are AZAL's plans for increasing the number of foreign airlines that fly to the regions of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is interested in attracting foreign air carriers to fly to the country's regions. We hold appropriate negotiations with airlines, including low-cost airlines. These flights promote tourism development in our country. Azerbaijan has many beautiful places that foreign guests will undoubtedly enjoy. In addition, the maintenance of regional airports is much cheaper and ticket prices can be lower than similar flights to Baku.</p><h4>The first successful Baku-New York-Baku flight with the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner took place for AZAL in November of 2015. As this is set to be a regular flight for AZAL, what is the importance of this route for AZAL?</h4><p>The first regular flight from Baku to New York was carried out on September 24th, 2014. The flights were operated by comfortable Airbus-A340 aircrafts, which are designed for long-haul flights. Direct non-stop flights to New York became a landmark event in the modern history of AZAL and marked a transition to a higher level of development. After a transatlantic flight test on November 7th, AZAL operates regular Baku-New York flights with the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, one of the most modern aircraft that excellently combine the latest technical advances. Due to the use of the latest technology, the aircraft meets the highest safety standards and is advantageous for this operation. With a convenient schedule for direct passengers of New York flights and for those who use Baku as a transfer point, the flight turned out to be attractive to travelers from Tbilisi, Tehran, Tel Aviv, and other cities.</p><h4>With an enormous international fan base, how is AZAL preparing to accommodate the influx of visitors in anticipation of the Formula One Baku Grand Prix that will take place in the summer of 2016?</h4><p>In recent years, we have gained good experience of major international events held in Baku. Baku hosted the popular music contest, Eurovision, in 2012 and the First European Games at a very high level in the summer of 2015. Heydar Aliyev International Airport experienced unprecedented passenger numbers and volumes of baggage during and after the First European Games. The passenger traffic of Heydar Aliyev International Airport exceeded 280,000 people, including over 228,000 passengers of international flights. In this period, over 28,000 foreigners visited Azerbaijan. Not only did the airport face unique challenges in transporting large numbers of athletes and their baggage over a short period, it also had to ensure that business as usual continued undisturbed. It was the dedication, enthusiasm, spirit, and hard work of every stakeholder involved in the program that enabled Baku to deliver such a truly remarkable and unforgettable Games. The latest scientific and technical achievements used in international aviation are applied in the new terminal with a total area of 65,000sqm in order to ensure flight safety. I am sure that during Formula One, as well as the Islamic Solidarity Games scheduled for 2017 in Baku, AZAL will ensure a high level of safety, comfort, and quality service for the passengers.</p><h4>How will the new parliament following the November 2015 elections help to continue improving the national vision for the domestic aviation infrastructure of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Since the day Azerbaijan gained independence, the country's government and parliament have provided continued support to civil aviation. Legislation in the field of civil aviation has been brought into line with international standards and legal norms. I am confident of even closer cooperation with the Azerbaijani Parliament in its new composition. </p><h4>AZAL has been steadily increasing the number of flights every year. What were the main challenges for your company in 2015, and what is your outlook for the year 2016?</h4><p>The main problem the airlines around the world face is the financial crisis. The difficult economic situation in many countries has led to a decrease in the purchasing power of the population, in many cases making them save on expenses such as vacations abroad. Many private companies are also trying to minimize their costs. Therefore, launching low-budget transportation to the most popular destinations was a very important step for us. As mentioned, we plan to work in this direction in order to present the most favorable and flexible terms in our pricing policy. In parallel, we will continue negotiating with our international colleagues to operate flights to new destinations and conclude code share agreements. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is being done to develop the space industry in Azerbaijan, and how would you gauge the importance of the country's telecommunication satellites? </h4><p>The establishment of the space industry in Azerbaijan in 2009 ushered in a new era in the development of the country's ICT sector. In particular, the state program for the establishment and development of the space industry in the Republic of Azerbaijan was approved by President Ilham Aliyev in August of that year. It signaled the start of a revolutionary strategy for the formation of new, large-scale ICT infrastructure in the region. It was a huge step in the direction of developing telecommunications. At the same time, it presents another promising non-oil sector for the national economy. Satellite communication plays a major role in the country's telecommunications infrastructure. The presence of satellite communication in mountainous countries like Azerbaijan is important for high-quality and relatively inexpensive communication systems. From this perspective, Azerbaijan's first satellite, Azerspace-1, has eliminated the country's dependence on other countries, enhanced information security irrespective of the availability of aboveground infrastructure, and enabled quality communication services at any time and in any location. Covering a third of the planet, Azerspace-1 plays an important part in linking more than 50 countries. Works on the manufacturing of the Azerspace-2 satellite are currently under way, with plans to put it into orbit in 2017. Another interesting project is associated with the production of nano-satellites. Azerkosmos and the National Aviation Cooperation have started cooperating in this direction and have begun the implementation of a student satellite project CanSat. Another important issue is the training of national personnel. I am delighted to note that the Azerspace-1 satellite is being successfully operated by local specialists. In general, it would be safe to say that all aspects of this relatively new segment of our economy are developing and satellite services have been organized in Azerbaijan quite successfully.</p><h4>How would you assess the establishment of electronic government services in Azerbaijan and what is being done to expand this initiative?</h4><p>The central objective of the modernization policy in the country is to create an advanced system that serves the interests of our citizens in every sphere. E-government is a crucial component of such a system. There is a great demand for electronic services. Work in this direction began when the President of Azerbaijan initiated the Electronic Azerbaijan State Program. In an effort to expand the use of electronic services, the e-government portal was established on the basis of the “one window" principle. E-government represents a quick and easy form of communication between state bodies and citizens because online services mean zero bureaucracy. The Azerbaijani government is interested in developing this form of communication. Such a mechanism serves the interests of the government, citizens, and businesses. As the operator of the e-government portal, the Ministry of Communication and High Technologies cooperates closely with other government agencies to further develop this infrastructure. To date, more than 300 electronic services have been integrated into the e-government portal and the number of people using online services is increasing by the day. Some 3 million people have applied to the portal as of February 2016 and around 80,000 electronic signature cards have been issued.  Azerbaijan is a civilized country, and we are working hard to provide our people with the best level of service. We are introducing technological innovation with the intent to improve the living standards of our population and the steps we are taking in this direction are bearing fruit. Even those living in the most remote villages can use the online services of government agencies. This is a huge source of pride for us. </p><h4>Considering the fact that President Ilham Aliyev views ICT as a priority sector, what does the Ministry do to encourage innovation among students and entrepreneurs?</h4><p>The announcement of ICT as a priority sector in Azerbaijan is underpinned by specific decisions and projects. Necessary mechanisms are being put in place to stimulate the production of competitive goods and expand activities in the sphere of new technologies. A favorable environment is emerging for the development of knowledge and innovative activities. Younger business people are taking advantage of this, as they tend to be well versed in new technologies. We are also working hard to develop scientific research in the area of advanced technologies to bring benefits to the real economy and increase investment in innovative activity. To do this, in addition to mobilizing state resources, we encourage other sources to invest in scientific research and innovative projects. I can say from my own experience that competitiveness, an improved business landscape, and access to financial resources are the keys to achieving successful results for ICT projects. The State Fund for the Development of Information Technologies established within the Ministry is doing important work in this direction. The Fund has already created a reliable platform that allows young business people engaged in innovative activities to materialize their ideas. Of 461 project ideas submitted to the Fund, it has financed 62. Also, several banks have been authorized by the Fund to provide low-interest loans to business people. In addition, the favorable conditions created at the Business Incubation Center and the Advanced Technologies Park have played an important role in the implementation of innovative ideas.</p><h4>How would you assess the achievements of the business incubation centers and the goal to encourage the development of startups?</h4><p>We should always aspire to research and innovate, and I believe that there is no future without high technologies. We would like to see Azerbaijan among the world leaders in this area. The role of business incubators in the development of startups around the world is undeniable. The work being done to develop business incubators provides immense support for the formation of a knowledge-intensive economy. It also helps establish an innovative ecosystem in the country. Resulting from international experience, the first business incubation center in Azerbaijan was established at the Ministry's High Technologies Park. This center, called Pi campus, is well suited to providing new companies with the required support for their innovative ideas and projects. Thanks to the center's efforts, several startup projects have developed into businesses. Interesting and promising projects are designed and developed at the business incubation center. When you visit the center, it seems as though you suddenly find yourself in the future.</p><h4>Hot on the heels of the inaugural European Games, Baku is now set to host the Formula One European Grand Prix. What is being done to conduct the Formula One competition at a high level from an ICT standpoint?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has earned a reputation for hosting prestigious international events. Our country has actually set a certain standard. To conduct each new event at the level of this standard and to excel beyond this will require a new approach. The First European Games, the Eurovision song contest, and similar events provide excellent experience for our country. We hope to be able to benefit from organizing the Formula One European Grand Prix as well. The organization of such major events requires large-scale preparation. When it comes to the level of telecommunications services during the competition, I should note that a working group has been set up to look into the technical opportunities available and provide a reliable system. A sustainable mobile communication system will be created to ensure uninterrupted transmission of information. High-speed and reliable internet services will also be organized. At the same time, all modern resources, including the Azerspace-1 satellite, will be used to facilitate the broadcasting of the competition to the world. Radio frequencies will be allocated to ensure the high quality of the broadcast. New media has a much broader audience than traditional media outlets and the demand for online viewing is huge. Taking this into consideration, there are plans to provide high-quality internet broadcasts of the competition. We do hope that participants, organizers, and tourists will be pleased with the level of telecommunications services. </p><h4>As the country continues to develop, what are your expectations from the ICT sector?</h4><p>The global economic recession is taking its toll on our country. Many countries have revised their economic policies in favor of non-oil sector development. Azerbaijan embarked on this process several years ago. The head of state has personally declared the sector of communication and information technologies as a future priority. The Azerbaijan 2020: Outlook for the Future development concept identifies future goals for the ICT sector as an important contributor to the national economy. As part of the national strategy, comprehensive measures are being taken to develop communication and advanced technologies. The scope of satellite services is expanding. We will continue work to increase the number and improve the quality of electronic services. The projects we are implementing to create modern telecommunications infrastructure will enable every consumer to benefit from the highest level of services. We do hope that the new technologies will serve peace and prosperity not only in Azerbaijan, but also in the whole world. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>At a time when automobiles account for a large share of imports to the country, how does the Ganja Automobile Plant help to substitute imports with domestic production?</h4><p>Azerbaijan used to import almost all types of automobiles until our enterprise commenced operations in December 2004. The Ganja Automobile Plant currently manufactures 20 models of MAZ, six models of KAMAZ, three models of URAL trucks, and eight models of Belarus tractors. In addition, at the end of 2015 we launched the experimental assembly of two models of MAZ buses. The production of these automobiles in Ganja also led to a reduction in their imports. The hardware manufactured by our qualified specialists meets all applicable standards and is in great demand. This can be inferred from the numerous orders placed with the company by the state, business people, and companies. In 2015, our company achieved the highest result in its history by assembling 948 units of hardware on the basis of different models of Belarus tractors, 354 MAZ automobiles, 10 KAMAZ, 23 URAL trucks, eight HALLER public work trucks, and five Belarus trucks. The production of these automobiles in Azerbaijan certainly prevents the outflow of foreign currency from Azerbaijan, thus contributing to non-oil sector development. The Ganja Automobile Plant is currently working on exporting this hardware to foreign countries. In 2015, we succeeded in selling 10 units of hardware to the neighboring Republic of Georgia. The company's marketing and service department is in talks with a number of countries regarding the exporting of our products. We intend to launch the production of 72 and 102-seat MAZ buses in the near future. These models meet the most stringent comfort requirements and fit very well into the domestic market. We look forward to seeing these buses in Azerbaijani cities and districts in the coming years. This production will enable our company to compete with similar bus models imported to the country.</p><h4>You have been awarded the Order of Glory from the Government of Belarus in recognition of your contribution to the strengthening of Belarusian-Azerbaijani relations. How would you assess the level of cooperation between the Ganja Automobile Plant and Belarusian companies?</h4><p>Cooperation between the Ganja Automobile Plant and Belarusian companies was launched in October 2006 during an official visit of President Ilham Aliyev to the Republic of Belarus. It was during that visit that an agreement was reached to establish economic relations between the two states, including collaboration between the Ganja Automobile Plant and Minsk tractor and automobile plants. Following the visit, as agreement was signed with these plants and a new assembly line was installed in our facilities. The cooperation between our enterprises stems from the friendly relations between President Ilham Aliyev and President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko. It is thanks to this warm and sincere relationship that the First Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan, Yagub Eyyubov, and myself were awarded the Order of Glory from the Government of Belarus in October 2015. I am grateful to the heads of both states for this prestigious award. Our bilateral agreement paved the way for the assembly of eight models of Belarusian tractors in March 2007. A total of 6,294 tractors and 134 special purpose tractors were assembled by our plant from that date until January 2016. Of this machinery, 5,737 units were handed over to AgroLeasing OJSC on the basis of a state order, while the remaining 497 units were acquired by farmers and business people. In April 2007, our company started manufacturing MAZ vehicles called “Ganja“ and “Pahlavan.“ As of January 2016, we assembled a total of 2,578 MAZ trucks of 20 models. Our relationship with Belarus is not limited to that. According to an agreement with the Belarusian plants DorElektroMash and Smorgon Aggregate Plant, the assembly of suspended equipment on the basis of Belarus tractors began in September 2007. To date, 82 MUP, 36 DEM excavators, 11 asphalt laying machines and snow removers, and five loading machines have been assembled and commissioned. An agreement was signed with the Belarusian MogilevTransMash OJSC in 2009 and a total of twelve 25-ton auto-cranes have been assembled. In 2010, a trilateral agreement on the assembly of public works machinery was signed between the Minsk Automobile Plant, the German company Haller, and the Ganja Automobile Plant. To date, 47 units of such vehicles meeting the Euro-4 standard have been manufactured. In 2013, a bilateral agreement was signed with the Minsk wheeled traction vehicles plant. According to this agreement, our plant commenced the production of wheeled traction vehicles in 2014. We have already assembled 30 such vehicles. According to an agreement signed with the Belarusian Bobruysk plant of spare parts and equipment in May 2014, we have started the production of MTZ 422 and MTZ 622 mini-tractors. So far, we have manufactured and commissioned 68 units of this machinery. In February 2015, the Ganja Automobile Plant and MTZ Holding, under the umbrella of the Minsk Tractor Plant, signed a long-term partnership and cooperation agreement. This has led to the assembly of Belarusian tractors and MAZ automobiles by our plant.</p><h4>The president of Tatarstan visited the plant in 2015 to inaugurate the opening a line for the assembly of KAMAZ automobiles. How would you evaluate the progress in the production of KAMAZ vehicles at your plant?<br></h4><p>The Ganja Automobile Plant follows the motto “Step by step towards new successes.“ Our plant continuously looks for new innovations, projects, and partnerships. A growing number of major companies are interested in cooperating with our enterprise. In February 2015, a delegation led by the director of Russia's automobile giant KAMAZ, Sergey Kogogin, visited Ganja to become acquainted with our plant. KAMAZ managers were very impressed with our plant and the overall professionalism of our team. An agreement on the assembly of KAMAZ vehicles was signed between the two companies. A production area of 3,500sqm has been created at the Ganja Automobile Plant and a new assembly line fitted with lifting mechanisms and ball bearings has been installed. Our enterprise is currently engaged in assembling KAMAZ trucks. In April 2015, a ceremony was held to unveil the KAMAZ 43114-053-15 full transmission passenger and cargo automobile. The ceremony was attended by the President of the Republic of Tatarstan, Rustam Minnikhanov, and other senior officials. The assembly of these automobiles is well under way now. According to this long-term agreement, we intend to assemble about 30 models of KAMAZ vehicles at the initial stage. As of January 2016, our plant assembled 10 models of KAMAZ automobiles. KAMAZ vehicles are well known not only in the Russian Federation, but also in the whole CIS for their impressive carrying capacity. We are very proud to assemble these automobiles in Ganja because there is a great demand for them in Azerbaijan. We look forward to these trucks reaching the customers both in and outside Azerbaijan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Currently, Embawood has a presence in 10 countries. What criteria do you focus on to gain footing in foreign markets and are you considering expanding your scope of activity in the future? </h4><p>Yes, we have ambitious targets. We have recently introduced the SalesForce program as a special Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to better know our customers, their wishes, and their needs. We have found solutions through our 2020 program to improve the quality of our production by reducing the net value of the product. The key criteria that we look for to enhance our presence in foreign markets includes customer-orientation, mutually beneficial cooperation with our partners, and the opportunity to gain a vital foothold in the economy of every country in which we operate</p><h4>As Embawood is a company already involved in sport in Azerbaijan through sponsoring the First FIP Arena Polo European Championship, what are your expectations for the Formula One Grand Prix event coming to Baku this summer?</h4><p>Azerbaijan already has a wealth of experience in the organization of prestigious international sport events and I hope the Formula One event will be held at a high level this year as well. Apart from the contribution to the improvement of international cooperation in sports, this event has economic and social benefits for Azerbaijan, as well as a positive impact on the development of the domestic tourism sector. I must also note that multiculturalism has already become a way of life in our country and the year 2016 has even been declared "the Year of Multiculturalism" in Azerbaijan. The high-level organization of such events makes major contributions to the tolerant traditions and intercultural values of our country. </p><h4>Embawood concluded a memorandum of cooperation in the field of employment with the Azerbaijan University of Architecture and Construction (AUAC). What is the value added of this memorandum to your company?</h4><p>Following the conclusion of the Memorandum, students from AUAC will be able to gain practical knowledge and the teaching staff will get an opportunity to closely familiarize themselves with the production process. A plan is in place to conduct joint scientific research works and realize student-teacher exchanges within the framework of this memorandum. Issues such as cooperation opportunities and the development of joint education programs have been discussed and negotiations were held regarding joint staff preparation and the development of scientific research projects, which will assist in the development of future professionals in Azerbaijan. </p><h4>As an Azerbaijani company, what importance do the parliamentary elections of 2015 hold for your business and the country at large? </h4><p>Elections are key indicators of a modern democratic society. This key tool safeguards society from the threat of injustice and dictatorships. The transparent election process works to reflect the will of the Azerbaijani people. It is also a sign of stability and positively influences the dynamic development of entrepreneurship and society.</p><h4>What are your company's prospective targets for 2016, given that this year marks the 20th anniversary of Embawood?</h4><p>Considering the current macroeconomic factors at play in the markets where Embawood is present, we have set a target to assess the maximum export potential level for our products in 2016, our 20th Anniversary. We believe our market classification policy will be successful in this regard. The export activities of our company will enhance our goals and improve the national export market. By getting closer to consumers in the countries where we are present, we will further promote our goal of building a positive image of our Azerbaijani brand and product. As a company, we will continue to stand close to our consumers and meet their wishes and needs at the highest level in 2016. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Our monthly production of cables is 2000 tons, for example. Adding to the list of our accomplishments, we were also the first manufacturer in Azerbaijan to produce KEMA-certified cable, which is a special Norwegian universal certificate awarded for production quality. This means that we are now able to meet the export standards of Europe. Furthermore, we were the first company in Azerbaijan to receive a license from Germany VDE in 2002, which is a laboratory that issues quality certificates. These certifications pave the way for my company to work with large, international corporations, which fits perfectly with our targets for growth. We are looking to play a larger role in the national development of the non-oil sector through exporting our goods on the international market. We have plans to export our products to Europe for the first time, in addition to our usual export partners of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Georgia. In the past, we exported $17 million in cable products to Turkmenistan.</p><p>In the production of cables, we only use high-quality raw materials that are known for their excellence, such as RUSAL aluminum. We also use copper from the largest government-owned producer in Uzbekistan and receive PVC and technical materials from Borealis, a European company. We use these specific materials to maintain our exclusive focus on the quality of our products. To keep our staff highly professional and capable of carrying out complex works, we invite special teams to hold trainings at our company. These trainings are specifically designed to keep our staff informed of the high skill levels that our international certifications demand. In this capacity, each month we organize a training meeting with the staff and the technical department. We have also invited certain people with important positions in major companies to come in to offer training to help us meet our organizational needs. These trainings ensure that my employees are working at the peak of their abilities.<br>As part of the Baku Electrical Group, we played a central role in the successful implementation of the 2015 European Games in Baku. We were responsible for providing electricity to all of the stadiums in the Games, which included all generators, cables, and switchboard panels. We were the main contractor for the electricity and the installation of cables for every stadium involved in the Games as well. As a result of our work, this event was held at the highest level and was met with massive international acclaim. Thus, we played an integral role in the national hosting effort of the European Games. </p><p>Goknur is growing significantly and we are looking to have exports boost our company operations to the extent allowed by the wider political and economic environment. As an illustration of our significant growth, our factory today stands at 35,000sqm after completing a 15,000sqm upgrade. As stated, our main priority is to increase our level of exports. To this end, we will remain open to serious foreign investment opportunities from international companies. In particular, we are looking for strong partners from highly professional European companies to help us organize our exports. We look forward to working with European companies and believe the resulting experience would be very fruitful.</p><p>Always keeping an eye on the future of the sector in Azerbaijan, our core objective is to become involved in all of the key projects within the domestic market. Above all, we want to introduce a future that is characterized by a marked increase in our level of exports. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As aluminum demand continues to increase each year, how important is this industry to Azerbaijan as the country looks to diversify away from a reliance on oil revenues?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a country of oil. Within the borders of the internal and external politics of our Republic such an important factor is masterly used to strengthen its stunning power. At the same time, non-oil sector development has become one of the main aims of the economic direction of our state. Thus, in terms of the economic factors indicating the development of our country, during the last 13 years the share of the non-oil sector has increased over 7-8 times. The creation of the Detal Aluminum Complex is the visible result of works done in the stated direction. The critical landslide of oil prices in the world oil market has made the state pay great attention to the aluminum industry and such industry development has become one of the priorities of the state's economic politics.</p><h4>In terms of ongoing projects for Detal, what further measures need to be taken at the Detal Aluminum Complex' electrolysis plant to raise the production capacity up to 200,000 tons?</h4><p>It is true that in oil-producing countries huge infrastructure and construction projects are realized thanks to oil profits. Thus, the fall in oil prices has had a negative influence on aluminum and aluminum products. Detal Holding has mobilized all of its resources and modern world experience to minimize such negative influences.</p><h4>Detal works with China Non-Ferrous Metals Processing Technology Co as one of its main contractors. What are the benefits of working with this company and what factors does Detal look for when you are investing in international partnerships?</h4><p>The main aim standing before us in our company's strategic plan for the next five years is the provision of local resources used to organize the manufacture and provision of final products through the extended production of semi-finished products. Therefore, Detal Holding relies upon the high productivity of reforms carried out by the head of the Republic. A great network of small and medium entrepreneurial enterprises engaged with the manufacturing of aluminum products will be created around Detal's Ganja Aluminum Complex. Detal is ready to support such businesses in the manufacture of aluminum products.</p><h4>Your company plans on reconstructing the Sumgait Aluminum Smelter according to the latest technologies. How big of a role does technology play in keeping Detal Holding competitive in this industry?</h4><p>Nowadays, Detal is engaged with the export of goods to over than 17 countries all over the world. These products are: aluminum bullions, aluminum rolls, and aluminum sheets, as well as different kinds of final products. Those semi-finished products are used in the manufacturing of final products applied in construction, packaging, industrial products manufacturing, automobile contraction, and so on. At present, our Republic imports a great majority of such products. It is possible to manufacture a great number of them from our products.</p><h4>The Aluminum Semi-Final Production Project created around 300 jobs. What are some other ways Detal Holding engages the local community?</h4><p>Nowadays, the increase of semi-finished products manufactured is a great priority for Detal. We try to focus on the manufacturing of some semi-finished products, especially painted and not thick rolls because of their high sales prices. The manufacturing of those products requires higher technological knowledge and proficiency. In this work, Detal has confidence in its professional engineer-technology team and provides them with strategic resources. The marketing of our products created through new know-how continues successfully.</p><h4>What has allowed Detal to build up the list of countries it exports to?</h4><p>In the first year of semi-finished products manufacturing activity at the Aluminum Complex, Detal sold only to Russia and Belarus. Our high level of experience, European standards, ISO standards, and other international certificates have allowed for the export of products to leading European countries. Nowadays, 99% of products manufactured at the Complex are exported abroad and 45% are exported to EU countries.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the company in 2016?</h4><p>Aluminum is a widely applied metal. Considering the increase in need for aluminum in construction, the manufacturing of vehicles, and packing sectors year by year, we prefer the manufacture of aluminum types used in these fields. Especially so, we believe that the manufacture of a new generation of cover materials used in the construction sector will be profitable. Aluminum is a widely applied metal and its potential uses will only increase. Detal intends to use this potential effectively and in this effort relies on the high support and solid legal and business environments created by the Azerbaijani state. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>CMS struck a $34 million deal with Austal to build a 70m fast crew boat. What are some of the added benefits this acquisition will add to your fleet?</h4><p>In 2015, we received the delivery of the first fast crew boat, capable of carrying up to 150 passengers offshore, which, at the time, was unique in the world. It is the first vessel of its type to be fitted with DP2 and the Ampelmann (walk to work system), which is a gangway mounted on the back deck of the ship that allows the vessel to connect to an offshore platform. It is like an inverse flight simulator, where the module stays still and the vessel moves about underneath it. That vessel was delivered in early 2015 and then, in June 2015, we also signed a contract with BP for a second vessel, which is being constructed with Austal, in Freemantle, Australia. It will be a sister ship to our current fast crew boat, and we expect delivery in October 2016. We have fixed five-year contracts for both vessels, which is very good in the current market.</p><h4>What was the reason for opening an office in Astrakhan, Russia, and what are some other markets that you are looking to expand your operations?</h4><p>The office in Astrakhan is already up and running, and it is part of our decision to start expanding outside of the region. While we predominately work in oil and gas, we also now own three cargo vessels in Azerbaijan outside of our offshore support fleet. We are looking to do the same with the Astrakhan office. At the moment, we are an OSV company; however, we are willing to expand outside of that sphere of operation. The vessel we sent up to Filanovsky is being looked after by the Russian office. At present Astrakhan is only an office without any assets or a fleet: it is more a management system for us at the moment, but the idea is to grow and find business opportunities in Russia. Soon, we are also going to Iran. We see it as quite an exciting area of growth. There is a lot of potential down there, both on the Caspian side and the Persian Gulf side for us as a company. We do not have an office in Kazakhstan; however, we are going to an oil and gas show in Atyrau soon to see what the market is like in the region.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges to running an offshore company in the Caspian region?</h4><p>Local supply is a considerable challenge. Most of our vessels have Caterpillar and Mercedes-based engines; hence, getting the supplies and materials in the country is a challenge because everything is imported. Everything revolves around timelines and customs clearances, for example. We have to be careful in our stock and material management because it can take a long time to wait for parts to arrive. Also, the only way to bring ships in to the Caspian is through the canals. This is not only a size restriction, but also a time constraint because the canal completely freezes in Russia during the winter. Other challenges we face involve the crewing of our vessels locally and regionally, as the salaries are not as high as they are in certain other regions. However, we offer great benefits like a 28-28 day rotation, so employees have a clear idea of when they are going to be home. As a company, we are about 99% nationalized. Out of 640 staff, there are four expatriates here. In 2014, we made a conscious push to nationalize our offshore staff and our crews now operate at the highest levels. Our biggest clients, BP and Saipem, do not require us to have expatriate staff on board, for example. The challenge comes for us to keep a fully nationalized crew of 550 staff and maintain a high skill level.</p><h4>How would you assess the competition in the Caspian region?</h4><p>It is a fairly closed market here and we have limited competitors in the region. The ability to bring assets into the country is limited now with all new assets needing to be built locally; therefore, companies cannot simply bring in new ships. There is definitely a competitive nature, but because it is a closed market, it is easier to manage with ourselves and our competitors in the region. A closed market is good for us because it gives potential stability, but it does not necessarily offer the benefits of the major peaks in market rates as seen in other outside regions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Encotec grown and evolved into the company it is today?</h4><p>Encotec has been in the market for about 15 years, having started with a small team of about five people. We wanted to establish strong engineering standards above all else, and we did not want to grow until that was achieved. Today, we have about 150 employees, but we are limited by the market size of our niche. We expect more demand in the market soon; therefore, we will continue with our system of training. The style of engineering in the Soviet Union was different to what Western markets require; hence, after independence we had to work hard to understand those requirements. We have demanding standards and employees have to pass many exams to work at Encotec. We do this to stay competitive, as our competition, partnership engagements, and alliances include up to tier-one Western engineering companies, such as Fluor and Worley Parsons. Our main client is BP, which is why we aim to serve it to the required standards, both technically and in terms of project controls. We have now completed more than 500 projects, big and small. We have expanded operations with offices in Georgia and Kazakhstan. In Georgia, we target BP. We expect new projects in Kazakhstan in the near future, but for now it is dormant.</p><h4>What has been your biggest and most challenging project in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The construction of the Baku shipyard was one of the biggest and most challenging. It was a huge project in terms of volume and capacity, covering 60ha. We did detail design and project management, and spent overall about 500,000 man-hours. There are perhaps 100,000sqm of shops altogether, with office facilities covering 7,000sqm and eight power substations. The transfer slab is 30,000sqm with a capacity to bear loads of 150,000kg per sqm. We passed all state approvals without fail, completing the project within 22 months. It was fast, efficient, and well organized. We are proud of that project. We worked with a number of construction companies, among them two Turkish contractors with a lot of experience, and it went smoothly.</p><h4>How has Encotec evolved over its years in operation to offer services to companies outside of the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>We are doing more works for industrial facilities. The Baku shipyard was an example, and we have also been involved in a fiber cement factory as well. We created the concept and detail designs for the cement factory, although the project's location was then moved. It is hard to find local clients because it is a small market overall and the clients generally prefer Western companies and contractors. However, with oil prices low, they may be opting more for local companies like ours</p><h4>This year is your 15th anniversary. What is your outlook and what are some of your objectives for the year?</h4><p>The majority of the large engineering companies are going through a lot of redundancies. All industries are on the down around the world, and also in Azerbaijan. We will continue doing what we are doing, going ahead with our plans for growth and development. We will talk to BP to discuss how we can grow, and what we can do in Azerbaijan. We also have plans to work with SOCAR, seeking to leverage our Western standards and experience. We are looking forward to the year ahead. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the technical specifications for the waste-to-energy plant?</h4><p>The Baku waste-to-energy plant is a project initiated within the framework of “The Complex Plan of Measures for Improvement of the Ecological Situation in the Republic of Azerbaijan,“ approved by Ilham Aliyev, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, in August 2006. The plant was designed, constructed, and is now operated according to the contract signed between Ministry of Economy on behalf of the government of Azerbaijan and CNIM S.A. (France). The construction of the plant was coordinated and commissioning was controlled by Tamiz Shahar. The plant is being currently operated by CNIM Azerbaijan. It is the largest in the CIS region, and the third largest in the whole of Europe. The plant is specified to burn up to 500,000 tons of municipal solid waste per annum. There is also a clinical waste treatment facility where medical waste from hospitals can be incinerated, too. Normally, the plant accepts common household waste and non-toxic industrial waste.</p><h4>What role does the plant play as a power supplier in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The plant is capable of providing 231,500MWh of electricity to the grid on a yearly basis, which corresponds to the production of renewable energy. For comparison, I would like to mention that the energy we produce can meet the demand of the population of Ganja, the second biggest city in Azerbaijan. Energy is generated by burning the waste received in large boilers, which generates steam from the heat recovered and is then transformed into electricity through a steam turbine.  The principal intention of the plant is really for the alternative disposal of waste in Azerbaijan by minimizing the initial volume of the waste to a very small volume of by-products; however, the production of electricity is also a large advantage.</p><h4>Is the waste collected and incinerated at the plant solely from Baku or does it draw from other regions as well?</h4><p>At the moment, the plant only receives waste from Baku and its suburbs. As said, the plant is capable of incinerating a half million tons per annum; in 2015, 509,000 tons was burnt, which shows that we run the plant at full capacity as it was designed and planned.</p><h4>As this plant demonstrates its value to Baku, what are some potential areas of growth within the plant's operations?</h4><p>The plant is equipped with two incineration lines, one steam turbine and a flue gas treatment system. During the design phase we took population growth into consideration and realized that there could be a need for capacity expansion in the future. Therefore, the space for the third line was considered and third technological line can be constructed in future as per request of the client. By launching the third line, we can increase the capacity of the plant to 750,000 tons per annum, as soon as the third line is constructed and put into operation.</p><h4>What are some of the environmental challenges facing Baku?</h4><p>Waste coming to the plant is an alternative to landfill and the facility participates in the preservation of the environment and prevents possible pollution of ground water tables where the waste is dumped illegally. We also contribute by decreasing the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere with filter systems equipped at the plant. Otherwise, the waste will be dumped or incinerated in open air, which will release methane and carbon dioxide gases in large quantities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the major international projects in CPC's portfolio?</h4><p>Over the last 10 years, CPC has participated in the implementation of a number of noteworthy international projects. These include the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli, Shah Deniz, Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan and Chirag projects. CPC has also been involved in many local projects as well. SOCAR and BP/AIOC have been our major clients for 13 years. CPC participated in, and successfully implemented, the Kashagan project in Kazakhstan in 2009 for EUPEC France, which was our first experience working overseas. The scope of services provided by CPC during these projects depended on the customer or project requirements. It ranged from applying anti-corrosion layers or concrete coating to pipes, performing internal and external blasts, anode installation, and the load-in/out and storage of pipes.</p><h4>CPC signed a contract with ShawCor Nederland B.V. as part of the Shah Deniz II project. What were some of the upgrades at CPC's plant that took place as a result?</h4><p>In August 2014, CPC signed a contract with ShawCor Nederland B.V., an operator of the SOCAR-ShawCor Nederland B.V.  Alliance for the implementation of the anti-corrosion and concrete weight coating works within the scope of the Shah Deniz Stage II project. We carried out the scheduled upgrading of equipment at our anticorrosive and concrete coating shops, constructed new rail lines, and performed the necessary infrastructure work. Pipe coating works were launched in March 2015 and the completion of anti-corrosion and concrete weight coating of 16' and 32' pipes of about 150km is planned for the end of 2015. The load-out works will be completed in 2016. The joint slogan in this project "One Project - One team" is successfully reflected during the project implementation.</p><h4>What kinds of logistics services does CPC offer to clients?</h4><p>Being situated in the industrial zone of Baku, CPC enjoys a convenient geographic location for the implementation of onshore and offshore pipe coating projects. CPC's yard is 260,000sqm in size, including a railway system that is capable of receiving 45 railcars simultaneously. CPC also has a 150m long port on the Caspian Sea, designed to carry out the efficient load-in and load-out of pipes and containers. This dock allows for the handling of cargo operations and the modern lifting and transporting of technical facilities. It also allows the company to provide logistics services to clients with high international standards. We have road infrastructure that enables us to carry out the highway transportation of various goods. In addition to performing inspections related to the coatings on main pipelines, CPC also offers loading and offloading services of pipes, containers, and large loads from railways, ships, or trucks. CPC provides for the storage of these loads as well, in open or sheltered warehouse facilities.</p><h4>What is the production capacity of the several workshops under operation by CPC?<br></h4><p>The production capacity of the anticorrosive coating plant is between 70-120 pipes per shift. The total output depends on various factors such as the size, diameter, and thickness of the pipes as well as the type of coating that we will apply. The production capacity of the concrete weight coating plant is between 50-140 pipes, again depending on those same factors. </p><h4>What are your main goals for 2016?</h4><p>We have a couple of goals in mind for 2016. Our first goal is the successful provision of services for the three-layer anti-corrosive coating and concrete coating of pipes as part of the Shah Deniz II project. Our second goal is to increase and further develop the loadout of pipes by marine vessels. This will be an overriding priority for CPC in 2016, as well as looking for new opportunities and projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of the directives over the past years that helped spur advancements in the important areas of environmental and ecological protection?</h4><p>Fast economic growth, the improvement of the welfare of the population, the protection of the environment, and the effective use of natural resources have always been the main focuses of our President. The 2016 Environmental Performance Index, compiled by researchers from Yale and Columbia University, evaluated how nations protect their ecosystems and human health. Azerbaijan placed 31st among 180 countries. The report looks at nine different factors that measure a country's performance in areas such as the health of residents, the state of water resources, sanitary standards, nature, and the environment. Azerbaijan has greatly improved, jumping 32 ranks since 2014. This biennial report showed that our country has made significant progress over the last 10 years by scoring 83.78 points this year and leaving behind all other CIS countries. The report put Azerbaijan into second place among Eastern Europe and Central Asian countries, eclipsing Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. Moreover, the country also ranked second in the climate and energy category, reducing gas emissions from 73 to 51 million tons since 1990. All these factors are the result of a purposeful environmental policy implemented by President Aliyev. As a result, tangible progress has been recorded in the improvement of the environmental situation. </p><p>The preservation of biodiversity is one of our main activities. The size of specially protected nature areas has nearly doubled since 2003, reaching 10.3% of the total area of the country. There are specially protected nature areas currently covering 893,000ha, including nine national parks, 11 state nature reserves, and 24 state sanctuaries. Special attention has been paid to the development of infrastructure in specially protected natural areas as well. For example, routes were created in the Goygol National Park, an eco-tourism destination, and more than 65,000 tourists visited the park shortly thereafter. </p><p>Elsewhere, and more than 625,000 people now have access to quality drinking water in 384 settlements as a result of the establishment of modular water treatment facilities. This program covered large areas in a short period of time and yielded tangible, positive results. A facility for 20,000 cubic meters of sea water desalination, with a pilot stage daily production capacity of 1,000 cubic meters, has been created as an effective solution to a possible water shortage problem that may occur in the future. The construction of additional equipment to double the production capacity of the desalinization factory will soon be completed. This factory is the largest desalination facility in the Caspian Sea. The water from this factory will be used for the irrigation of greeneries in the surrounding areas. Large-scale projects were carried out in Azerbaijan for the reconstruction of centralized sanitation systems, with the modernization and building of new waste water treatment facilities. A total of 17 stations, consisting of modular treatment facilities with the total capacity of 6,400 cubic meters waste water per day, were established by the Ministry in Mardakan, Buzovna, Bilgah, Nardaran, Pirshagi, Novkhani, and along the coastal lines of Sumgayit city, which had no centralized sanitation system. To modernize the hydro-meteorological surveillance system, we have set up relevant equipment to allow us to follow the Kura river's fluctuations and flood streams on the Kish river in real time, which strengthens our control over disastrous hydro-meteorological events and improves forecasts and early warning systems. The comprehensive hydro-meteorological and ecological research scientific center, which is the highest mountainous facility in the Caucasus, was created and three automated meteorological stations were established to study the Bazarduzu-Shahdag-Tufandagh ecosystems. In 2015, 10 automated weather stations in Azerbaijan were put into operation and 39 AMS were equipped with solar panel power supplies. </p><h4><br>As Azerbaijan expands its industrial complex, what role does the Ministry play in evaluating the ecological and environmental impact of these activities?</h4><p>Fast economic growth rates necessitate a modern and flexible management of the environment. Large-scale infrastructure projects are being implemented in the country, which require the application of an environmental impact evaluation. The creation of new ventures and the expansion of industrial complexes have an inevitable impact on the environment. In the wake of these rapid developments, the Ministry faces a challenge to preserve the balance between economic development and the environment. The Ministry adheres to the principle of sustainable development when evaluating the environmental impact of feasibility studies, estimations, and designs related to construction, re-construction, expansion, the provision of new technologies, and the termination of industrial facilities. These evaluations determine the possible negative environmental impacts and consequences of business activities. We study the compliance standards of industrial facilities to ensure they are built to environmental and ecological requirements. The Ministry also focuses on the effective use of natural resources and achieving power efficiency while using alterative, non-traditional sources of energy. This leads to less pollution in the atmosphere, soil, and water resources. The Ministry also supports enterprises in the effort to optimize their business operations and improve waste management.</p><h4>What measures has the Ministry taken for the protection and growth of wildlife?</h4><p>The Ministry focuses on the preservation of biodiversity and the protection and study of rare plant and animal species. The Red Books play an important role in the observation and registration of rare plant and animal species in the country. The Red Book of Azerbaijan, which was published in 1989, covered 140 species of flora and 10 species of fauna in need of conservation. The second edition of the Red Book of Azerbaijan was published in 2013, covering 300 species of plants and fungus, as well as 223 species of animal. Granting special protection status to the areas with rare species is one of the most effective methods of preservation. As of 2001, there were 14 reserves and 20 sanctuaries in the country, covering 478,000ha. Measures implemented over the past years extended the protected areas up to 893,000ha. Moreover, activities aimed at the preservation of rare species in the country include public awareness raising and educational campaigns for different demographics of the population, an increase in fines for the destruction of rare species, imposing stricter punishments, and re-introduction measures for increasing the number of rare species. Some species in the country—for example, the Caucasus leopard, striped hyena, crested porcupine, chamois, and gazelle—are of high importance. Ensuring the effective protection of the leopard, creating necessary conditions enabling their harmonic existence in the natural ecosystem alongside human beings, and providing for their populations while preserving of their means of food is of a great importance. Up to the 2000s, the existence of the leopard in the country was in question. In following years, the Ministry enacted strict control of migration routes in the areas of leopards and sanctuaries were created (Hirkan and Zangazur National Parks). In March 2009, the First National Strategy and Action Plan on the preservation of leopards in Azerbaijan was approved, covering comprehensive measures in this direction. Together with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), works are underway to prepare a new National Action and Strategy Plan for the next five years. Measures were also taken aimed at increasing the species of gazelle in Azerbaijan. In the Shirvan National Park, the largest gazelle population in Europe has been increased from 3,000 to 7,000, and the living area for gazelles has been significantly increased. In addition, a project has also been launched to reintroduce gazelles in areas where they historically lived, but were uprooted due to human activities. The project is implemented by the Ministry with the support of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, IDEA Campaign, and WWF Azerbaijan Office. On December 24, 2010, President Aliyev and First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva took part in the process of reintroducing a herd of gazelles to the Priakashkul settlement of the Absheron region, their historic home. In total, 26 gazelles have been released to the Gobustan-Jangichay area and they have collars equipped with satellite transmission devices. Gazelles have been gradually introduced to the Aghgol National Park, Gobustan-Zangichay valley, Ajinohur-Sarija lowland, and Korchay reserve, and more than 150 gazelles have been returned to their historic lands. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of the reasons behind creating AZFEN J.V. as a joint venture between SOCAR and Tekfen Construction?</h4><p>In 1994, Tekfen and SOCAR signed a Protocol of Intent for a local construction company that would work on projects in the oil and gas sector. The agreement was made official in 1995, and AZFENJ.V. was officially registered and began operations in 1996. AZFENJ.V. was created to be a local company that was capable of procuring, engineering, manufacturing, constructing, and installing all aspects of oil and gas projects. AZFEN J.V. would provide the necessary resources and local competencies needed to take on these tasks.</p><h4>What are some of the major projects currently in progress for AZFEN J.V.?</h4><p>AZFEN J.V. won a contract in 2014 as part of an Alliance with Saipem to construct an expansion to the South Caucasus Pipeline. This project is expected to be completed in 2017. The length of the pipeline is 487km, with 424km in Azerbaijan and 63km running through Georgia. On this project, AZFEN J.V. works as an equal partner with Saipem as part of a consortium. We carry out all aspects of the job together as one team. AZFEN J.V. won another contract for the Shah Deniz II project. We are part of a consortium that includes AZFEN J.V., AMEC, and Tekfen (ATA). This is part of a huge project that we started in 2002 at our major construction yard in Bayil, which is close to the Caspian Sea. We have already constructed three oil and gas production platforms, the CWP, PCWU, and the COP platforms. As part of ATA, we are working on two platforms with a total weight of 30,000 tons at the same time, which is challenging. One platform is for production and the other is for living quarters. We will also build a bridge that connects the two platforms. In the construction of the previous platforms, all engineering work was done outside of the country. For these projects, all engineering work has been carried out by AZFEN J.V. engineers at the work site. Besides the South Caucasus Pipeline and platforms construction projects, we have a third project that we are doing in partnership with Tekfen, a gas terminal construction project within the Shah Deniz II contract. We are primarily using Azerbaijani workers, technicians, and engineers. The beginning of this project was the Early Infrastructure Works Project, and AZFENJ.V. was named the single source contractor on that. We successfully completed this project, adhering to the high standards expected by the company.</p><h4>What are your plans for fostering growth outside of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We have been working on projects abroad since 1997, mostly in Georgia. Some of these projects include the Supsa Terminal, Baku-Supsa Pipeline, and pump stations. Today, we are involved in the SCPX project with Saipem, and want to use this experience as a platform to expand to other countries. Tekfen is interested in working with AZFEN J.V. outside of Azerbaijan as well. SOCAR is also supporting these initiatives. These are all future plans, because right now we are still very busy with many projects in Azerbaijan. Twice a year, we have formal meetings with our shareholders, Tekfen and SOCAR, and in those meetings we have started to form our strategy for expansion outside of Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2016, which marks the 20th anniversary of AZFEN J.V.?</h4><p>We anticipate that 2016 will be a special year for AZFEN J.V., marking its 20th anniversary, which is certainly a cause for celebration. We will recognize this accomplishment and celebrate the contributions and efforts that everyone has made to create the success of AZFEN J.V. over the last two decades. It will be unforgettable. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Shah Deniz Stage 2 and South Caucasus Pipeline Expansion projects are progressing significantly. What is the status of these projects?</h4><p>Shah Deniz 2 is a giant investment project consisting of several major programmes covering marine and subsea, offshore, and onshore sections. This project builds on two decades of BP's experience in developing oil and gas in the Caspian Sea. The success of the Shah Deniz Stage 1 development, the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG), and Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan operations, gives us the confidence and know-how to deliver this project, which is expected to provide 16 bcm per year of Caspian gas to millions of consumers along the Southern Corridor countries and into Europe. The project continues to move ahead with a number of milestones successfully achieved.  In Azerbaijan and Georgia, over 22,000 people are involved in construction activities across all main contracts. Thus far, nine wells have been drilled out of 26, enough to deliver the first gas. Execution activities are well underway in Azerbaijan and Georgia, including fabrication of jackets, decks, and subsea equipment, upgrades to offshore vessels, and construction of mainline pipe and compressor stations. Overall, the project is making strong progress and is on schedule. Just one example: in 2015, to support the site plans we delivered 35 river ships of materials and equipment that was too big for road transport.  This was an outstanding achievement. The South Caucasus Pipeline Expansion (SCPX) project activities also continue along the pipeline route across Azerbaijan and Georgia. In Azerbaijan, mainline construction has continued to ramp up with approximately 71km of pipe welded. Trenching, lowering, laying and backfilling activities commenced at the end of November 2015 and are progressing. Stocks of pipe have been building up at the pipe yards along the route with the most part of the pipe needed for the Azerbaijan section already stored at Mugan, Kurdamir, Yevlakh, and Qazanchi pipe yards. The first horizontal directional drilling site at Agsu Canal has progressed well. In Georgia, main construction works continue for Compressor Station 1 and have commenced for Compressor Station 2 and Area 81. Pipe stringing has continued and preparations for commencement of trenching, lowering, and backfilling continued with the start of this activity expected later this year. Overall, the progress is significant. The project is over 66% complete in terms of engineering, procurement and construction, and remains on target for first gas delivery to Turkey in 2018 and supplies to Europe expected in 2020.</p><h4>What are your plans for oil production in 2016?</h4><p>I would like to start with our 2015 results, which we believe were excellent in all aspects of our operations including safety, environment, efficiency and asset reliability, drilling and production. In 2015, the ACG field continued to safely and reliably deliver stable production. Total ACG production for the full year was on average 634,000 barrels per day which is equal to 31.3 million tons in total. In 2016, we will continue to focus on the optimization of existing wells as well as working to make our drilling activities more efficient. Other focus areas in our operations will be sand management, water and gas injection, and delivering our maintenance programs safely and efficiently. We believe doing these, as well as continuing to deliver world-class plant efficiency, will ensure another good year of delivery for ACG. </p><h4>How would you assess the prospect of searching for additional oil in Azerbaijan, with three-dimensional seismic surveys taking place in the waters of the Absheron Peninsula later this year and the plans to drill an exploration well at the Shafag-Asiman field? </h4><p>As Azerbaijan's long-term and reliable partner, we remain committed to investing in exploration activities in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian. We look forward to working together with SOCAR to ensure the long-term future for Azerbaijan's oil and gas production through exploring new opportunities. We believe there are great exploration opportunities here and have signed two exploration contracts with SOCAR. We are committed to moving these projects forward; we have extensive experience in responsibly exploring and developing oil and gas fields in other parts of the world and we also have world-class expertise based on the best technology available in the industry. The Shafag-Asiman production sharing agreement is BP's first direct contract with SOCAR and it was signed in Baku in October 2010. The most important activity that BP has undertaken as an operator in the contract is the 3D seismic acquisition, which we completed in 2012. This is the first 3D seismic ever conducted on the contract area. We acquired good data using the Gilavar seismic vessel—one of the best built for this purpose. We then processed the data through 2013 to early 2014. The processing of this amount of data was believed to be the largest 3D survey ever processed in Azerbaijan. With the completion of the dataset interpretation in 2015, work has commenced on planning for the first exploration well. The other exploration project is the one that we signed with SOCAR in December 2014 to jointly explore for and develop potential prospects in the shallow water area around the Absheron Peninsula (SWAP) in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea. This is an important project for both Azerbaijan and BP, as it marks the beginning of a new era of our cooperation in the shallow water areas of the sea where exploration activities have never been conducted before. This agreement was ratified by the Parliament of Azerbaijan in April 2015, enabling us to move forward with our commitments. Since that time, we have started to plan our short-term activities using our experience and advanced technology solutions from other shallow water areas around the world. These have included the planning of two seismic surveys in the contract area—a 2D seismic acquisition, which was conducted and completed in November-December 2015 and a 3D seismic programme, which we plan to commence in March 2016 and complete by the end of this year. We have just completed public consultations for the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment of the 3D seismic acquisition activities and expect its approval by the government in March before we commence the programme.  </p><h4>With the Formula One event coming up in Baku, what was your role as an official partner of the European Games last year? </h4><p>As a good corporate citizen, we have supported a number of development areas in Azerbaijan. Our social investment projects are set to support education, cultural heritage, local enterprise development, community development and the development of national sport potential. I am, in particular, proud to highlight our support for Azerbaijan's National Olympic and Paralympic Committees and for a group of high potential national athletes. There are a group of Paralympians whom BP has selected as its ambassador athletes and we continue to support them as they prepare for Rio 2016. We are also proud to have been an official partner of the first European Games held in Baku last year. We were delighted to be able to support Azerbaijan in preparation for and during that grand sporting event. We believe the Baku Games presented a unique opportunity for the country as it makes efforts to become a greater center for sporting excellence. This was also a unique opportunity for hundreds of enthusiastic young Azerbaijani nationals to develop new skills and knowledge, adding to the country's international events delivery capability. Therefore, last year we also supported the Games Academy initiative, which presented an excellent opportunity for enhancing Azerbaijan's overall capability-building efforts, and which we believe will leave a strong legacy of project delivery. As a company, we will continue to invest in building local capabilities in support of Azerbaijan's efforts to achieve even bigger results.</p><h4>With the decline in global oil prices, what are your targets in Azerbaijan over the year 2016? </h4><p>The oil industry is currently experiencing a challenging environment. Similarly to other oil and gas companies, we are taking actions to respond to this situation. This requires remaining focused on improving our competitiveness. We continue to look for opportunities to ensure that we take the right actions to remain competitive. With this in mind, we will continue to take action to remove unnecessary complexity and increase efficiency, including in our upstream business worldwide and in the Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey region. In doing so, safety will continue to remain our top priority and will not be compromised in delivering our business objectives.  We believe all these efforts will allow us to make our business more competitive while maintaining safe and reliable operations in the Caspian. Having said this, I would like to highlight that our projects in this region are long-term and very important to us and to the country. We remain committed to the region and to the projects that we operate here. I am pleased to be able to say that our projects are moving ahead and will continue to move ahead in accordance with our plans that we have agreed with the government and partners. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some recent key milestones for SOCAR?</h4><p>Azerbaijan stands among the world's leading countries in the pace of its economic growth. The historical significance of the new energy strategy, which comes from the political determination and wise far-sightedness of our National leader Haydar Aliyev, and which is successfully continued under the wise leadership of President Ilham Aliyev, is clearly more visible as time goes by. Work has commenced on the development of the Shah Deniz field's stage II development and its execution is in line with the schedule and budget. We have also implemented the Southern Gas Corridor project designed for the delivery of natural gas to Turkey and Europe and worked on a new sixth-generation floating drilling rig, brought about the realization of the Absheron and Umid gas-condensate fields' development projects, and reorganized the production areas of the Haydar Aliyev Oil Refinery and Azerikimya Production Union. Other milestones include the construction of SOCAR Polymer as part of the Karbamid plant, an Industrial Chemical Park in Sumgait city, the continuation of work on a new Oil and Gas Processing and Petrochemical Complex project, the modernization of Petkim Petrokimya Holding A.Åž. complex, the construction of the STAR oil refinery in Turkey, and the establishment of SOCAR sales networks in Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, Romania, and Switzerland.</p><h4>How would you assess the current level of gas production in Azerbaijan and what is your assessment of doubling gas production by the year 2025?</h4><p>I believe that we will be able to accomplish this objective and bring the production of gas across the country to this level or higher. We will need to focus on new and already developed fields. In the development of the ACG fields block, the recoverable reserves are estimated at around 1 billion tons of oil and 350 billion cubic meters of gas. In 2015, 31.2 million tons of crude oil was produced from the ACG fields block. Overall, the cumulative oil production on the ACG project between 1997 and 2015 made up 385.5 million tons. The oil volume produced here so far represents only 38% of the fields' overall reserves. Primary reserves of the Shah Deniz field, which is one of the world's largest gas-condensate fields, are estimated at the level of 1.2 trillion cubic meters of gas and over 240 million tons of condensate. Stage I of this project (Shah Deniz I) is under way. Within this stage, 67.7 billion cubic meters of natural gas and 17.1 million tons of condensate were produced from Shah Deniz between 2006 and 2015. In 2015, 9.9 billion cubic meters of gas and 2.3 million tons of condensate were produced from this field. The Southern Gas Corridor Project came up due to demand for the construction of a new gas transmission pipeline through which the natural gas to be produced within Shah Deniz stage II can be exported. This project plans to transport the natural gas from the Shah Deniz gas-condensate field to the Sangachal terminal through an underwater pipeline, and further across the territories of Azerbaijan and Georgia through the South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) to the Turkish-Georgian border, and onward to Turkey and Europe via the Trans-Anatolian (TANAP) and Trans-Adriatic (TAP) transmission pipelines. In the coming years, the necessary steps will be taken to raise the annual gas output at Shah Deniz stage II up to 16 billion cubic meters. In addition, the estimated hydrocarbon reserves of the Absheron field are evaluated in the volume of 350 billion cubic meters of gas and 45 million tons of condensate. The first gas from the field is targeted for 2022. For SOCAR, the Absheron project will add additional export potential for the Southern Gas Corridor project and will be one of the sources of raw materials for a gas processing plant as part of a new oil processing and petrochemical complex to be built in Garadagh. The development of the Umid field will also have an impact on the increase of future gas production in Azerbaijan and 337.8 million cubic meters of natural gas and 55,000 tons of condensate were produced in this field in 2015. This year we plan to complete the construction of the new sixth-generation floating drilling installation. This installation is capable of drilling at a depth of 12,000 meters and will enable us to carry out drilling works on the Absheron, Umid, and other new oil and gas structures situated in the deep-water part of the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea.</p><h4>What affect will the SOCAR Polymer joint venture have on the petrochemical industry of Azerbaijan? </h4><p>The SOCAR Polymer investment project is the first of its nature and scale in the past 40 years in Azerbaijan's downstream oil and gas industry. The Polypropylene and High Density Polyethylene plants of SOCAR Polymer are being built within Sumgait Chemical Industrial Park territory. Set to be operational in 2018, SOCAR Polymer will produce 180,000 tons of polypropylene and 120,000 tons of high-density polyethylene annually, increasing current polymer production by four times. SOCAR Polymer's main objective is to replace imports and increase the export potential of the country. Approximately 30% of the production output will be directed toward the local market and the remaining 70% will be exported to Turkey and other European countries.</p><h4>Scheduled to be operational in 2018, how would you characterize the progress of the STAR oil refinery in Turkey and what are the advantages of operating a refinery in that country?</h4><p>This will be the first oil refinery to be built in Turkey in over 40 years. Our refinery will also be the first privately built refinery in Turkey, as the only existing refinery was developed by the state in the 1970s. The STAR refinery is being built as an EPC turnkey project by a consortium of globally reputable companies. With a project cost of $5.7 billion, this is the largest FDI project in a single location in Turkey. Also, the biggest and the longest-term project financing loan agreement in the history of Turkish real sector was signed as a result of this project, at a value of $3.3 billion. The world-renowned Hydrocarbon Processing magazine announced the STAR refinery as the best project of 2015. Works for this project are proceeding in line with the plan and approximately 60% of the overall project has been completed. The project is expected to be finalized in April 2018. Developing an oil refinery in Turkey has tremendous benefits. First of all, the Project represents the key pillar of SOCAR's long-term strategic objective to establish itself as a fully integrated player in the Turkish energy sector. This project will assist the development of Petkim's existing Aliağa site into a world-scale integrated refinery-petrochemicals-energy-logistics-distribution hub. STAR is a strategic project for Turkey, as it will reduce its dependence on imports and decrease the current account deficit. In summary, this project is clear evidence of SOCAR's commitment to enhancing its revenue generating abilities downstream as an addition to its successful upstream operations.</p><h4>As one of the biggest and most important current projects for SOCAR, how is the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC) project progressing?</h4><p>The Southern Gas Corridor is SOCAR's biggest project and will allow us to deliver huge volumes of natural gas from the Caspian Sea to European markets. The construction work on this $45 billion megaproject is successfully underway. While we are all dealing with a depressed oil price, we remain fully committed to the Southern Gas Corridor and highly value the strong partnerships we have with all the host governments, consortium companies, and the many stakeholders that are dedicated to seeing this project to fruition. Over 26,000 people are currently employed across the Southern Gas Corridor construction works. Great progress continues in Azerbaijan and Georgia, where over 60% of the project is nearing completion. In Turkey, TANAP is moving forward with precision and keeping to budget and time. In addition, the necessary permits and approvals are being granted and progress continues toward the realization of TAP in Greece. The groundbreaking ceremony of TAP is planned for May 2016 in Thessaloniki, Greece. We also appreciate the great support of the Albanian government and the commitment from the country to see TAP and the Southern Gas Corridor realized. Italy is the final point of this project and we must continue to work closely with the government and our partners to ensure challenges are met and progress remains on track. In the short run, we expect the signing of all the remaining contractual agreements in the framework of TAP, representing a final component of the SGC project. I believe 2016 will be a significant stage in realization of the SGC project. This project is a key part of the EU's energy policy and a strategic project for Europe, diversifying the energy mix and providing a new, secure supply of gas to Europe for decades to come. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azerbaijan signed a MoU with the Asian Development Bank worth $1 billion for the modernization and reconstruction of the energy system of the country. In which parts of the energy infrastructure of Azerbaijan will you focus these funds?</h4><p>The effective use of energy resources at our current stage of development and making timely energy consumption payments are among the top priorities of the government. Energy efficiency primarily boils down to the restoration of old electricity networks. This will improve the reliability of the energy supply and reduce losses at the stage of distribution. The electricity sector is currently facing financial constraints. While the existing retail price of electricity is sufficient to operate the network, it is not adequate for its restoration and expansion. Therefore, the investment program on expanding Azerbaijan's electricity network, to be jointly financed by the government of Azerbaijan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is expected to cover all Azerbaijani districts. There are plans to build 110 and 35-kilovolt substations and integrated transformer stations, 110, 35, and 10-kilovolt transmission lines, the installation of insulating cables and meters, the provision of consultation services, and other activities. The total value of the project is $1 billion, of which $750 million will be financed by the ADB and $250 million by the government.</p><h4>With the oil and gas sector struggling on the international market, what are some of the ways the Ministry of Energy is working to maximize energy efficiency in Azerbaijan, including the use of renewable energy sources?</h4><p>The fourfold decline of the oil price on international markets has had an adverse impact on oil producing countries like Azerbaijan. It has led to a significant reduction of oil revenues and has undoubtedly affected the pace of development. At the same time, Azerbaijan's sustainable development model has secured the growth of other sectors of the economy, helping to preserve its position as an energy state. President Ilham Aliyev has initiated reforms and the national economy has embarked on a process of adapting to new challenges. The Ministry of Energy is also working to enhance energy efficiency. It is often seen as the most effective and tangible way of resolving economic problems. Energy efficiency bolsters competition, improves the energy supply to consumers, lays the groundwork for sustainable economic development and the transition to a green economy, as well as promotes environmental protection and the production of competitive industrial and agricultural goods. Although the abundance of energy carriers in Azerbaijan has overshadowed the need for efficiency for years, this area has now been receiving significant attention. As indicated in the Azerbaijan 2020: Outlook for the Future development concept, our main objective is to ensure a sustainable supply of electricity to consumers by 2020. To achieve this goal, serious measures are being taken to reduce losses at the stage of production, transmission, and sale of energy, increase the efficiency of power stations, and reduce the consumption of conditional fuel. The encouragement of energy efficiency activities, the application of innovations in this sphere, the attraction of investment to the energy sector, the integration of new technologies, the promotion of private enterprise, and closer involvement with businesses required the establishment of the State Fund for Effective Use of Energy. With this aim, a draft presidential resolution on the establishment of an out-of-budget state fund for effective use of energy within the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Azerbaijan and other regulatory acts have been prepared and submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan. In addition, the Ministry of Energy has identified priority directions for the strategic long-term development of the energy sector. The objective is to effectively utilize all of the energy resources available in the country (natural gas, electricity, water, solar, wind, industrial and domestic waste, for example), ensuring that these resources contribute to the country's energy balance and undergo rapid economic development. Another direction in the field of improving energy efficiency was the preparation of a draft state program on effective utilization of energy resources for end users (2015-2025).</p><h4>How has the Ministry of Energy participated in the socioeconomic development of the regions, especially with regard to improving the gas supply in villages?</h4><p>Consistent steps are being taken to implement the state program on the socioeconomic development of regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan in 2014-2018 and the state program on the socioeconomic development of Baku and its suburban settlements in 2014-2016. Major upgrades of the gas supply system throughout the country are under way. As a result of the measures taken, villages and settlements that had not received gas for many years are now provided with blue fuel. Taking into consideration that there was no gas in the districts in 2004 and we imported gas until 2007, immense work has been carried out over the years. As a result, the level of gasification in Azerbaijan as a whole has reached 90%, including 80% in the countryside. We are continuing to work on the complete gasification of the country. In 2015, a total of 430 settlements were gasified and 104,309 were registered as new gas consumers. As of January 1, 2016, there are 1,811,309 consumers of natural gas in Azerbaijan. In other words, Azerbaijan is able to meet the demand for energy and ensure its energy security.</p><h4>The country held parliamentary elections in November 2015. How will the new parliament help the Ministry develop the energy sector of Azerbaijan moving forward?</h4><p>In addition to addressing the demand for fuel and energy, the development of the energy sector also requires the application of a management system aligned with the market economy.  The road Azerbaijan has covered as an energy country and the experience it has gained illustrate that in the absence of advanced methods of governance, continuous attention to technological innovation, and an adequate legal framework, it is impossible to move the fuel and energy sector forward, produce competitive goods, and deliver them to the end user without losses. Therefore, in order to ensure the effective management of the energy sector, the existing legal framework should be continuously renewed, necessitating effective cooperation with the country's legislative body. The application of the best international practices, the introduction of changes to existing laws, and the adoption of new laws would certainly be impossible to achieve without the parliament. Therefore, the Milli Majlis and the Ministry of Energy maintain close cooperation. </p><h4>How will the Ministry support the Formula One European Grand Prix that is coming to Baku this summer?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has regularly hosted prestigious sporting events in recent years. All state bodies act in a well-concerted manner in organizing such competitions because they enhance the country's reputation around the world. Baku hosted the inaugural European Games last year and Azerishig carried out large-scale work in this respect. The old substations around the Olympic stadium were replaced with new ones. All venues of the games were provided with an uninterrupted and reliable power supply. The Formula One European Grand Prix to be held in Azerbaijan for the first time is another in a series of such events. As announced, the races will start and finish in front of the Government House, which is where the Ministry of Energy is based. An F1 camp is established in the city prior to the competition and Baku will have several of these camps. As was the case in the First European Games, the power supply of all competition facilities will be provided at a high level.</p><h4>How would you assess the progression of the reconstruction efforts related to the petrochemical industry in Azerbaijan? </h4><p>Azerbaijan is also noted for its achievements in oil refining and the petrochemical industry. The measures being taken in refining help the country address the domestic need for oil products and mitigate adverse environmental impacts. New projects have been launched to modernize the processing facilities at Heydar Aliyev Oil Refinery and AzerKimya Production Unit to increase their production capacity and expand environmental activities. In addition, preparations are under way for the construction of a new Oil and Gas Processing and Petrochemical Complex. The new complex will consist of a gas processing plant, an oil refinery, a petrochemical plant, and a power station. It will operate around 40 process installations. The Gas Processing Plant will have a capacity of 12 billion cubic meters per year, while the annual capacity of the Oil Refinery will be 8-10 million tons. To process the C2+ hydrocarbons produced by these plants, a complex comprised of a Petrochemical Plant and a Heat Energy Center will be put in place. This will enable the country to address its domestic demand for oil and petrochemical products and align the quality of local products with advanced European and world standards, in particular the Euro-5 engine oil standard. In February 2016, SOCAR and Italy's KT-Kinetics Technology S.p.A signed an agreement on a project to reconstruct the Heydar Aliyev Oil Refinery. The objectives of the project are to increase the refinery's annual capacity from 6 million to 7.5 million tons in a short time, to increase the capacity of the catalytic cracking facility from 2 million to 2.5 million tons, build and commission a number of new installations, and launch the production of oil products meeting the Euro-5 quality standard. The plans to overhaul the plant also include construction of a new facility to produce sulfur. Azerbaijan is also heavily involved in the development of the refining and petrochemical industry outside its borders. In particular, the products manufactured by the Petkim petrochemical complex cover about 25% of the Turkish market. The new investment projects planned by the Azerbaijani side are intended to increase the capacity of the enterprise and to build and commission a new STAR oil refinery with an annual capacity of 10 million tons. Thus, Azerbaijan has embarked a path of building a post-oil economy and the energy sector is doing its best to adapt to the new challenges. </p>]]></richbody0content>

The university earned: accreditation for its Adnan Kassar School of Business from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB); accreditation renewal from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) for 10 years, the maximum period granted; and accreditation renewal for our School of Pharmacy from the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) for the maximum period, making it the only ACPE-accredited school outside the US. Also, we made significant advances in our five-year strategic plan, which is 90% complete now. The initial goal was to raise $100 million dollars and we raised that a year before the deadline. We are now looking forward to our third strategic plan, which builds on the current one that ends in September.</p><h4>You have been carrying out new projects at both of your campuses. Can you tell us more about them?</h4><p>Providing our students with an environment that stimulates ideas and innovation is important to us, and is in line with our current strategic plan. As a result, we are completing a major facility for engineering labs that will be ready by autumn, and we have started construction on a new library at our Byblos campus with a $25 million investment, which should be completed in 18 months. Werecently acquired the surrounding land to our Byblos campus with an investment of $50 million, raising the total size to 300,000sqm. At our Beirut campus, we are planning to refurbish our Gezairi Building to house the headquarters of the School of Architecture and Design, and we are also planning to build a new facility for our School of Arts and Sciences, which will comprise two towers of around six or seven stories each. We have an investment plan of $333 million dollars for the following five years for a series of projects we will carry out at our Beirut campus.</p><h4>How is LAU applying technology and innovation to its programs?</h4><p>Embracing technology to improve education and innovation are core values actually. In this spirit, LAU was the first university in Lebanon to be wireless and we have made all our classrooms smart. Now, all our staff and students can access the internet at any time, using any Wi-Fi enabled device. We understand that it is no longer possible to have a proper education without technology, so we try to keep up to date in every possible way. Plus, we provide training to our faculty and staff to make sure they know how to use the technology.</p><h4>How do you foster an entrepreneurial mindset among your students?</h4><p>We instill in our students the skills, knowledge, and values they need to succeed in life, which certainly gives them a strong basis to become entrepreneurs. Above and beyond that, we offer special programs through the Adnan Kassar School of Business that provide the opportunity for students to learn how to become entrepreneurs and to take calculated risks. The Adnan Kassar School of Business is one of the oldest and largest schools of business in the area, and our graduates have been doing exceptionally well. Indeed, we encourage our students to become entrepreneurs, but for those who want to gain experience as an employee, we have a strategy to connect our students with companies that can become their potential employers, allowing students to know them and evaluate their performance. Providing the skills to become an entrepreneur are important, but so too is the development of students' social intelligence and we need to make sure that, when they graduate, they land on their feet.</p><h4>Lebanon is facing a brain drain problem. How is this affecting the country?</h4><p>Moving abroad has been part of the Lebanese psyche for a long time. Many of our graduates have left the country and succeeded abroad in a varied number of areas. Having said that, it is important for our leaders to create more and better jobs for our graduates, so they keep contributing to the transformation of the nation. Lebanese people abroad have created an idea of a nation that somehow does not really exist, and yet that keeps them connected to their motherland. We need to build a better society so Lebanese people here or elsewhere identify with it.</p><h4>How are Lebanese expatriates contributing to the improvement of society?</h4><p>Between $7-8 billion enters Lebanon every year in the form of remittances from places as varied as the US, Canada, the Gulf, and Latin America. As I mentioned, there is an attachment to an idea of what Lebanon is but that does not really exist. Lebanese expatriates represent the country in their respective destinations and that alone is a great contribution.</p><h4>Can you talk about your international links and exchange programs?</h4><p>International links are one of the most important assets we have. As an American university with a New York charter and a headquarters there, we are truly international with faculty, staff, and students from all over the world. We certainly understand the value and importance of international connections. As such, we link our institution in order to provide opportunities for our faculty and our students to go abroad. We have so many opportunities available including ones through a program with a school in Paris, as well as courses held through our academic center in New York, which gives students an invaluable experience. We are always looking to broaden these opportunities. In fact, I just signed a memorandum of understanding between LAU and the University of Chicago, which will facilitate the exchange of students, ideas, and faculty. The idea is simple: we have no other choice, but to establish linkages with other institutions, and give our students the opportunity to have a foreign experience, or we will relinquish and our students will carry the burden.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2016?</h4><p>We have more plans than we have room to explain here, but to make it concise: our goal for the year is to see that our plans are executed in order to maintain our excellence and continue to be the leading university in Lebanon. To go into detail, however, we have a capital pool of $333 million that we need to allocate over the following five years; for that we need a new strategic plan, as the current one is about to expire. We have a committee composed of five panels looking at that. The first panel assessed our intellectual capital and how we can use it to continue to improve the university. The second panel was about pedagogy and how teaching has changed dramatically and how we can embrace these changes. The third panel was on tuition and the sources of revenue the university can use in order to alleviate the pressure of tuition. The fourth panel focused on innovation, which is crucial for our students to continue growing intellectually. The final panel explored shared governance and how the different components of the university can participate in the decision making process. Through these five important panels, we have been able to structure our plan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AZSIGORTA is celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2016. Could you tell us about some of the company's milestone achievements?</h4><p>We started as an insurance company in 2006, and have grown considerably since then. We have expanded to about 400 employees working across eight branches in all parts of Azerbaijan except for Nakhichevan. We mainly focus on the retail segment of insurance. Our company portfolio is balanced, and we offer compulsory third-party liability insurance (OSAGO), fully comprehensive motor vehicle insurance (KASKO), as well as health and property insurance. In 2015, we became the most profitable company in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How has AZSIGORTA worked to be more flexible with clients, including the use of online services and the recent expansions of your representative office base?</h4><p>We have the largest branch network in the country. We have a fully operational branch in every region of Azerbaijan with a director, accountant, and economist. Each branch is a miniature copy of the company. We also have our own emergency representatives. Our strategy is to reach out to every person in the region because awareness is low. Even if there is an available digital service, it is still necessary to have someone who is be able to explain it. Our offices work to explain the benefits of insurance. The future belongs to digital technologies. We are now working on a new project; it will either be a website or an application that offers a paperless insurance policy. This makes us more mainstream. We adapt our approach and systems to benchmarks set by the government.</p><h4>In addition to offering compulsory insurance services, what are some of the other types of insurance that AZSIGORTA offers to clients?</h4><p>We offer KASKO, OSAGO, and voluntary medical insurance. We also provide a unique product in deposit medical insurance. We insure construction risks and water transport. We do almost everything apart from oil and energy sector risks, as this is the area of expertise of PASHA Insurance. Last year was an extremely difficult year for Azerbaijan. There were a lot of natural disasters including an earthquake in Sheki, a flood in Lankaran, and a fire on an oil rig in the Caspian Sea.</p><h4>How do your partnerships with leading international insurance companies and domestic institutions help strengthen AZSIGORTA?</h4><p>In terms of reinsurance, we work with A+ companies such as Swiss Re, Hannover Re, and SCOR, among other international institutions. We also work with neighboring countries in this regard, including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. We closely collaborate with PASHA Insurance for several reasons. We share similar values, both develop the internal market, and are involved in reinsurance. This partnership has been fruitful. Insurance is not about competition, but cooperation. As for working with various public companies, we have a deep history of collaboration with ASAN Xidmet, which is a promising and effective partnership. We also closely collaborate with the Ministry of Finance and the State Body for Supervising Insurance. We have been given clear information about the various incentives, such as the shift toward digital services, implementation of new products, new standards, and liabilities, for example. We work in close partnership with the Ministry of Emergency Situations, especially in the regions, regarding raising awareness. We are the biggest taxpayer in the insurance sector, which we are proud of. Last year, we paid almost AZN7million in taxes. We are the only insurance company in Azerbaijan that received a Fitch rating, proving the high quality of our work and our reliability. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main developments in the capital markets of Azerbaijan over the past year?</h4><p>The capital market situation in Azerbaijan underwent substantial changes. There has been pressure generated by the state of the commodities market, which naturally led to the decrease of traded value on the BSE. There has been a substantial capitalization of existing players, coming partially from the state and partially from commercial enterprises taking out loans at the BSE, as well as companies simply expanding their businesses. The state continues to play the role of the main investor. It is clear that the companies are unable to play this role at the moment; the state invested its fixed assets in the economy, particularly in the country's infrastructure, and this financial redistribution transpired through the tools of the capital market. The decrease in state profits lead to fiscal consolidation and a decrease in state expenditures, putting pressure on the national currency. Adding to this is militarization and unrest in the region. All of these factors lead to cautious behavior from internal and external players. Nevertheless, our year-end report shows the traded volume on the BSE decreased only by 10-12%, a result of a replacement in the product structure. Along with the traditional instruments, such as stocks and bonds, investors redirected their attention toward hedging their risks with currency tools. The currency tools began to play a larger role in the BSE product structure and comprise around 70% of the total traded volume at present. In 2015, 2016, and partially into 2017, we are going to pay close attention to infrastructure projects that have to do with the market, the institutions, and the tools of the capital market.</p><h4>In May 2015, the President signed a law calling for reconstruction of the stock market. In what ways will this new law affect the BSE? </h4><p>The law “On the Securities Market Law“ was enacted this summer. It is a central part of what we at the BSE call a three-step normative reform. The first step is the legislative act itself, which includes provisions for almost all aspects of the capital market development. The second step is about 30 regulatory acts that cover the professional activities of all the participants in the capital market. The licensing in the securities market is becoming much more transparent. The key points of this legal reform also include the protection of the investor's rights through special funds and more disclosure of information. The third step is the operating rules for the BSE and the National Depositary Center, the two central institutions. The process of subscription and placement, including IPO, is being aligned with international standards following the law's pragmatic approach. The law cements new listing rules and requirements for the BSE and creates conditions for developing new markets and tools within all three markets: the specially regulated government security market, the corporate instruments market, and the derivatives market. This strengthens the trade, post-trade, and intermediary infrastructure.</p><h4>How can the capital markets become more appealing to the companies in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Over the next decade, the capital market will somewhat change its main function. The previous 10 years saw the intensive growth of state and corporate revenues made during an era of booming commodities prices and the capital market had the function of offering a fair redistribution of revenues and channeling them into the economy. Now, the capital market and all its institutions will have a new function. The key mission for the next decade will be boosting growth in the non-oil sector, attracting more savings of companies and households, and transforming them into investments on the BSE. For the last three consecutive years, the non-oil GDP of the country has been growing two times as fast as the oil sector, and we see it as having big potential for the capital market institutions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AtaBank gave preferential loans to entrepreneurs to the amount of AZN26 million in 2015. As a member of the National Entrepreneurship Support Fund, how does the Bank use concessional lending to help develop Azerbaijani businesses? </h4><p>The development of SMEs is one of the main targets of the socio-economic development of the country. AtaBank, being one of the leading commercial banks in this area, has taken part in supporting local entrepreneurs already for many years. AtaBank was among the first commercial and financial organizations to take part in periodic financial fairs dedicated to the support of SMEs. AtaBank carefully selected interesting projects and financed them via the National Entrepreneurship Support Fund. The Bank has created the proper corporate structure and appropriate committees to evaluate the businesses that apply for lending. All SMEs, including private businessmen, submit necessary documentation including the proper business plan and forecasted profit and loss information. During the lending process, AtaBank's specialists, who are highly qualified in appropriate areas of the industry, can also offer advice to the businessmen to help them lead their firms on the correct path and stabilize their income over the long term. We plan to expand our activity in this direction over the upcoming years, thus creating a more developed platform for SMEs in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>As the first bank to issue the Visa Electron Vertical cards in the CIS region, what advantages do these cards offer to your customers and what are the different types of vertical cards are available at AtaBank?</h4><p>AtaBank prepared this idea a long time ago. This product was also the newest for Visa payment systems in CIS countries, so we had to pass some necessary technical issues before launching the project. Confirming our image as an innovator, AtaBank has commenced the issuing of vertical cards for the first time among CIS countries. Visa granted AtaBank with the appropriate certificate for the issuance of these cards, making the product special and remarkable. The Visa Electron Vertical is a card with an absolutely vertical design on the front side. The name and surname of the cardholder as well as the card number (PAN) and expiration date are also applied vertically. AtaBank offers two types of vertical cards, which have their own style and décor. There is a flame placed on one of the Visa Electron Vertical cards designs, which represents Azerbaijan as the “Land of Fire.“ This card was designed for the cardholders leading active lifestyles, similar to the nature of a flame. The other card is designed in stern tones and is intended for Visa cardholders leading a more relaxed lifestyle. Visa Electron Vertical cards are issued for several directions: deposit, salary, and debit. Customers can request cards in any branch or section of AtaBank in several currencies, including AZN and USD. From a technical point of view, Visa Electron Vertical cards are similar to the ordinary horizontal cards.</p><h4>How does your 3D Secure service help AtaBank stay competitive as online payments and e-commerce become increasingly popular throughout Azerbaijan? </h4><p>AtaBank pays critical attention to security measures and prevention efforts related to fraudulent transactions in its overall activity. Taking into account that e-commerce has become popular among cardholders in Azerbaijan in foreign and domestic markets, and also through analyzing the best practices of the Visa and MasterCard international payment systems, AtaBank made the decision to implement the 3D Secure service for all its cardholders. AtaBank recently migrated from a static to a dynamic authentication method. By using the dynamic authentication method, the cardholder receives a one-time password every time the cardholder tries to make an online transaction if the e-merchant also uses the 3D Secure system. In accordance with the rules of international payment systems, if an e-merchant does not use the 3D Secure system on the acquiring side, it will be responsible for all chargebacks received from the issuers. Thus, the 3D Secure system is the most modern tool to secure all online transactions from fraudulent use and it reduces consumer risk. Cardholders receive periodic information updates about the development of the 3D Secure service. For example, all cardholders of AtaBank who are connected to the SMS-notification service are automatically connected to 3D Secure updates.</p><h4>Parliamentary elections took place in Azerbaijan in November 2015. What is your outlook on the financial market of Azerbaijan as the country moves forward with a new parliament? </h4><p>The financial market in Azerbaijan is part of the world capital market and the aggregate supply and demand for capital lenders and borrowers of different countries. Azerbaijan has achieved great results in the finance industry as a country. By attracting more and more international tourists, constructing new roads and buildings, and opening new world-renowned hotels and companies in Baku and in other big cities around the country, we will see the strong impact of economic growth on the overall development of Azerbaijan. Holding international events such as the Global Youth Forum, Mugam Festival, International Music Festival in Gabala, First European Games 2015 in Baku, Islam Solidarity Games 2017 in Baku, Football European Championship 2020, Formula One Grand Prix, and many others brings Azerbaijan to a higher level of development and modernization. All of these factors provide an attractive platform for international investments into the country's economy. Thus, the financial market has taken a huge step forward over recent years. Unfortunately, two rounds of devaluation for the national currency in 2015 slightly slowed down the development of the financial market. The end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 was marked by cutbacks and economic stabilization attempts in the financial sector particularly. We assume that the year 2016 will proceed as the stabilization period and promote a new level of development in the financial sector, alongside assistance from the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan.</p><h4>With the Formula One Grand Prix coming to Baku this summer, how does hosting this large, international event contribute positively to the financial sector of Azerbaijan? <br></h4><p>The Formula One Baku Grand Prix contract is the result of the proactive development of our country. Starting in June 2016, this immense project will begin in Baku and continue over the next 10 years. Formula One is the number one motorsport event, recognized all over the world. During this period, there will be great attention given to Azerbaijan from the world media and fans. We assume a significant tourist flow of Formula One fans will visit from some neighboring countries such as Turkey, Georgia, Iran, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Moldova, some Asian countries, and beyond. The increased flow of tourists will positively affect the national economy. The tourist-driven economic contributions will stimulate new construction, the development of internal infrastructure, increase the state budget, and will lead to the signing of more and more interregional and intraregional contracts. Financial institutes will be called to support these endeavors. In this regard, the financial sector will improve in quality as well as in figures.</p><h4>As one of the largest banks in Azerbaijan, what are your targets and objectives for the year 2016?</h4><p>As of December 31, 2015, AtaBank's total assets were AZN607.2 million, which is 4% higher than the previous year. Our credit portfolio at the end of 2015 was equal to AZN530.4 million and liabilities including current accounts are equal to AZN534.0 million, also including our deposit portfolio of AZN443.5 million. Our time deposit portfolio of retail customers is equal to AZN260.8 million and our aggregate capital is AZN53.7 million. AtaBank ended the 2015 financial year with a profit of AZN1.4 million. As always, AtaBank plans the future development of 2016 in accordance with the strategic plan and bank's policy. By making some slight strategic changes in business development perspectives, AtaBank plans to expand its activity in several directions: plastic cards and contactless acquiring activity, corporate lending, business credits, mortgages, and fund transfers. Being the largest acquirer in Azerbaijan, AtaBank plans to expand its POS-terminal network, implement new technologies like mobile application payments, expand cash-in and payment terminals network, bring to the market some new kind of deposits, and continue the stimulation process of non-cash payments. AtaBank plans to develop the second release of internet and mobile banking systems, continue the bonus and loyalty programs, develop CRM, and pay critical attention to customer care. AtaBank also plans to confirm its stable FITCH rating. Being the Principal Member of Visa and MasterCard, we also plan to receive the Principal Licensee from the China UnionPay international payment system for the issuing and acquiring of UnionPay cards until the end of 2016. AtaBank is planning to be among the most stable financial institutions in Azerbaijan, as it is at the moment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures have been taken so far to implement the decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan regarding the privatization measures at the IBA?</h4><p>The government of Azerbaijan has taken a series of measures to meet the objectives stated in the decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan on stabilization measures and preparation for the privatization of the state share in the IBA. In fact, measures in this direction are still being taken. The decree identifies the removal of problematic assets from the bank's management and their transfer to a specialized agency as one of the top priority issues. Several tranches totaling AZN3 billion were allocated to the Bank in 2015 with this aim. The bank removed a portion of high-risk assets from its own management and transferred them to AgrarKredit. Thanks to this state support, the volume of IBA's high-risk assets has been substantially reduced, enabling the bank to acquire a fairly large volume of liquid assets. It is also worth noting that when problem assets were removed from the Bank's balance-sheet, their balance value was adopted as the selling value and the interest accrued on problem loans was added to it. This represents tremendous state support for the bank. The state has also taken into consideration the risks that the International Bank of Azerbaijan may face in the aftermath of the shift to the floating currency rate in December 2015 and increased the Bank's capitalization. The general assembly of shareholders of the International Bank of Azerbaijan decided to increase the Bank's registered capital through the emission of new shares in the amount of AZN500 million in February 2015, bringing it to a total of AZN1,141.3 billion. This step will contribute to the bank's viability and credibility and mitigate the risks associated with the exchange rate of the manat in relation to other currencies.</p><h4>What is the IBA's agenda regarding the restructuring of its arrears to international financial institutions?</h4><p>The bank's meetings and negotiations with foreign partners will continue as planned. Discussions are also underway with international financial institutions and investors. The goal of this is to update foreign partners on the positive developments at the bank and identify directions of potential cooperation. Another important objective is to strengthen the bank's financial sustainability by lowering the interest rates on financial resources attracted from foreign sources. This has been possible in respect to several partners. In particular, by attracting resources with low interest rates, the bank managed to repay a portion of its arrears with a higher interest rate. As of August of 2015, the IBA repaid its arrears to foreign financial institutions in the amount of $550 million. In addition, IBA-Moscow's arrears of $140 million have also been repaid by the IBA. Thus, the bank has cleared its foreign debt of $700 million over the course of five months. Thanks to the reduction of the bank's foreign liabilities, our market risks have decreased and financial sustainability improved.</p><h4>The IBA attracted a ‚¬50 million loan from the European Investment Bank last year. How will this loan support SME development in Azerbaijan, as well as the capitalization of local companies?</h4><p>This loan agreement between the IBA and the European Investment Bank was signed in September 2015. The funds will contribute to SME development in Azerbaijan. They will be channeled into priority business projects in this sphere. Economic diversification and an increased share of small and private enterprises in GDP represent key directions of the country's strategic development policy. From this perspective, the loan agreement signed between the IBA and the European Investment Bank will contribute to this policy, facilitate the successful implementation of business projects on the ground, and improve employment opportunities and living standards of the population. We believe that a partnership with such an authoritative international financial institution will ease the access of small and medium-sized Azerbaijani businesses to financial resources. This will particularly benefit those engaged in the non-oil industrial and service sectors. Another important aspect of this agreement is that, in addition to contributing to the economic diversification of Azerbaijan, the credit resources will also invigorate the IBA's standing.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the country's economic development given its relative slowdown in the aftermath of the global recession?</h4><p>The economic development expectations were stated in the article of President Ilham Aliyev headlined Future of the Azerbaijani Economy, which was published on the website of the Davos World Economic Forum in January 2016. Despite the deep economic and financial recession in the world, Azerbaijan is trying to safeguard itself from the implications of the downturn. The economic successes achieved to date are evidence of that. The fact that oil prices have plummeted under the impact of political factors has led to a reduction of hydrocarbon revenues in oil producing countries, urging them to revise their economic priorities; yet, having foreseen such a necessity several years ago, Azerbaijan embarked on economic diversification to reduce their dependence on the oil price. These developments were enshrined in various state programs, in particular the Azerbaijan 2020: Outlook for the Future concept approved by President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev in December 2012. If we look at the strategic objectives and specific tasks identified in this document, we can see that Azerbaijan has braced itself for a period of new economic realities. Under such circumstances, we do not think it will be too difficult for Azerbaijan to turn the new challenges into opportunities. The country's financial and banking sector is expected to play a major role in this. Banks are perhaps the most important partner and instrument for the development of the real economy. The main mission of the banking sector at the current stage is to switch from an aggressive development strategy to one of sustainable growth, restoring people's confidence in banks.</p><h4>What objectives has the IBA set to achieve these goals? </h4><p>The IBA is a backbone bank, contributing to economic diversification and financing private-sector development. Our main goals are to protect the bank's positions in key business directions. Financing the real sector of the economy, supporting entrepreneurial projects, and contributing to the implementation of a number of important state projects are of particular importance to us. The process of restructuring banks in the country has entered a qualitatively new stage. Measures to stabilize banks possessing high-risk assets, consolidate several banks, apply new regulatory procedures to provide insurance for bank deposits, and expand the market for mortgages and securities attest to the fact that the country's financial sector is on the eve of a major transformation in the near future. The IBA is working hard to protect and further enhance its market positions in the new environment. One of our strategic priorities is to work as a team and develop a corporate culture. In addition, we see the optimization and effective management of business processes as issues on the Bank's agenda for the coming years.</p><h4>Azerbaijan will host the Formula One European Grand Prix this summer. How can this sporting event contribute to the attraction of foreign investment to the country? </h4><p>The environment of stability and development has allowed Azerbaijan to assert itself as a sporting nation. Our country has already hosted numerous international events, including the inaugural European Games, which were held at the highest possible level. It would be appropriate to view Azerbaijan's reputation for being a sporting nation through the prism of its successes in the area of tolerance, intercultural dialogue, and multiculturalism. It is no coincidence that 2016 has been declared the Year of Multiculturalism in Azerbaijan. The Formula One Grand Prix to be held in Azerbaijan this summer and the Fourth Islamic Solidarity Games due in 2017 will make an important contribution to this policy. These international events also serve as an excellent opportunity for Azerbaijan to introduce its investment environment to the world and to attract the attention of foreign investors. The influx of tourists to the country in the run-up to these major events also triggers the development of banking and service sectors in Azerbaijan. Sport holds a special place in the IBA's corporate responsibility agenda. We have sponsored a number of important sporting events and intend to carry out this mission in the future as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Support for SMEs in Azerbaijan is an important way to achieve growth. What are the ways in which the Ministry is working to create more favorable conditions for SMEs within Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The private sector plays an important role in the development and diversification of the non-oil sector of the economy, with the development of entrepreneurship is one of our priorities. In line with the strategic quote from President Aliyev, “the development of our country depends on the development of entrepreneurship,“ special attention is paid to the private sector for the stimulation and development of entrepreneurship. As a result, the share of the private sector GDP exceeded 80% while maintaining 73% in employment. According to statistics, more than 660,000 people are engaged in entrepreneurial activities. Over the past years, procedures and rules regulating entrepreneurial activity were liberalized, the mechanisms for state financial support for entrepreneurship were improved, effective mechanisms were established for the protection of the rights of entrepreneurs, state registration procedures of businesses were simplified, and electronic services were expanded. Moreover, foreign trade transactions and the registration of real estate rights became simplified and amendments were made to the legislation regarding the issuance of construction permits, optimization of corporate governance, protection of investors' interests, and bankruptcy. In addition, inspections of businesses were suspended for two years in October 2015, administrative procedures in the fields of licensing and customs were simplified, the number of business activities requiring licenses was significantly reduced, licenses became permanent, and the amount of state fees for the issuance of licenses was reduced twice in Baku and four times in the regions. These licenses are issued by the Ministry of Economy via the ASAN service centers and an Electronic License portal was created. In accordance with the amendments to the law on public procurements, discounts of up to 20% for local entrepreneurs will increase the opportunities for them to win tender projects and will provide additional support for the expansion of domestic production. Tax and customs privileges applied to investors with a view of investment promotion will lead to the further development of entrepreneurship, attraction of foreign investments, an increase in non-oil exports, and the development of the non-oil sector as a whole. Thus, entrepreneurs are exempted from customs duties on machinery, equipment, and devices imported for investment purposes in priority areas of the economy for 7 years. Moreover, a certificate of origin is issued to businesses in a single day, simplifying export procedures. Measures aimed at the development of entrepreneurship in the country are appreciated by international organizations. Azerbaijan has risen from 80th to 63rd place, improving its position by 17 points and becoming one of 24 countries that carried out three or more reforms in Doing Business 2016. According to Global Competitiveness Report 2015-2016, Azerbaijan ranked 40th among 140 countries, and keeps its leading position among the CIS countries for the seventh consecutive year. In general, comprehensive state support measures pave the way for rapid development of the private sector, especially SMEs, which are of particular importance for achieving the targets set in the Development Concept Azerbaijan-2020: Look into the Future.</p><h4>Political stability in Azerbaijan is an important condition for foreign investment. How does this help promote investor confidence as the country looks to attract new funds amid a decrease in domestic expenditures?</h4><p>It should be emphasized that the political and economic stability in Azerbaijan and the protection of the rights and interests of investors are important indicators of the business and investment climate of the country. Furthermore, the geographical location, hydrocarbon reserves, rich raw resources of precious metals and building materials, and a favorable climate for agriculture and tourism create many opportunities for local and foreign investors. To increase the efficiency of transit and logistics operations, the Coordinating Council was established to regulate the transit of goods. Cargo transportation tariffs were also reduced, creating favorable conditions for increasing the transit cargo transportation capacity of the country. Within investment promotion measures carried out in 2015 alone, AZPROMO organized 261 events, out of which 177 took place in Azerbaijan and 84 abroad. These events showcased investment opportunities in the country to local and foreign businessmen, promoted Azerbaijani products for exports, and saw export contracts signed with foreign partners. Exemplifying Azerbaijan's investment attractiveness in the world, in 2015 alone over $20 billion was invested in the country's economy. In total, during the period of 1995-2015, investments in the Azerbaijani economy totaled $220.4 billion, about half of which came from foreign investments. In addition, there are more than 7,000 foreign- invested companies currently operating in various fields.</p><h4>How does the hosting one of the large sporting events in the world, the Formula One Grand Prix in Baku, work to have a positive impact on the overall economy of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is considered a sporting nation throughout the world. Organizing the Formula One Grand Prix in Azerbaijan after the first European Games in 2015 is the result of political and economic stability, the international reputation of Azerbaijan, and the country's experience in holding major events and competitions. This event will have a significant impact on sport development, it will contribute to the economy, and the increase in the number of visitors will stimulate the tourism and service sectors. In addition, the positive image of the country will be highlighted and long-term investments will increase. The athletes and guests taking part in the competition will have an opportunity to get acquainted with the country and observe the successful development model of Azerbaijan</p><h4>Industrial parks have greatly increased non-oil sector activity in Azerbaijan and added to the socio-economic development of the regions. What are your plans and areas of focus for developing additional parks in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Work is under way to establish industrial zones, industrial parks, and industrial estates. These will create new industries alongside traditional industrial areas, strengthen the industrial capacity of the regions, and maintain the development of industry on the basis of innovation. In accordance with the policy of industrialization, we continued to provide support for the establishment of industrial parks and estates. In addition, up to 270 industrial enterprises, including technical equipment, metal structures, concrete products plants, and textile factories commenced activity. The construction of new important industrial facilities began through- out the previous year. Work to establish the Sumgait Chemical and Industrial, Balakhani Industrial, Mingachevir, and Garadagh Industrial Parks, and the creation of infrastructure in Neftchala Industrial Estate has been proceeding intensely. The first phase in building the infrastructure for Sumgait Chemical and Industrial Park is almost completed, and five residents plan to invest more than $1 billion. Azertechnoline, a resident of the Park, has already signed an agreement to export 60,000 tons of pipes worth $45 million. The building of the external infrastructure at Balakhani Industrial Park is almost completed and more than AZN10 million is planned to be invested by four residents. Now, work is continuing on modern technologies in the field of shipbuilding in Baku Shipyard, a resident of Garadagh Industrial Park. Azerbaijan Investment Company (AIC) is one of the main shareholders of Baku Shipyard. Moreover, the establishment of a specialized industrial park for the steel industry in Ganja is planned. Consistent and systematic measures in the field of industry, the establishment of enterprises based on advanced technologies and best practices, have all had a positive impact on increasing the country's self-sufficiency and import-replacement efforts.</p><h4>What are some steps that Azerbaijan can take with a view to ensuring economic growth against the background of a decline in global energy markets?</h4><p>I gave information about the works done for ensuring economic growth in the new economic conditions. Systematic and durable measures for further improvement of business environment, development of entrepreneurship, stimulation of export, the state programs of rural development pave the way for non-oil sector development. Along with other fields, the agriculture sector is of great importance for the development of the non-oil sector. The development of this field is one of the country's economic priorities in terms of employment and the food security of population. As a result of the work done and state support for the agricultural sector, food production and the country's self-sufficiency rate has increased. In the coming years, targeted measures will continue to build necessary infrastructure for the storage of agricultural products, apply tax concessions, grant subsidies and soft loans, and organize leasing and agricultural services. In addition, logistics centers within the country and abroad look to boost the country's export potential and accessibility in foreign markets. The first logistics center of Azerbaijan has already been established in Aktau, Kazakhstan. This logistics center, which will serve for storage and sales of agricultural products and other food commodities, provides a number of opportunities and advantages for entrepreneurs, especially for exporters. Moreover, a number of large-scale projects are being implemented in order to increase the transit potential of Azerbaijan. The commencing of operations at the Baku International Sea Trade Port, Baku Shipyard, reconstruction of Baku-Boyuk Kesik Railway, construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway projects, as well as the construction of international airports, North-South International Transport Corridor, all further expand the transit potential of our country and strengthen the transport infrastructure of Azerbaijan. In the rapidly growing ICT sector, the launch of satellites into orbit, the organization of high-technology parks, and new e-services have created additional opportunities. Actions have been taken for the development and promotion of the tourism potential of the country. The number of tourists visiting our country and the revenues gained from this sector have considerably increased. Attracting local and foreign investment in the tourism sector, further improving the quality of services, and hosting international sporting and cultural events provide additional stimulus for the development of tourism. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Azerbaijan benefit from the forthcoming Formula One Grand Prix?</h4><p>Massive worldwide coverage is the first thing that comes to mind. That is one benefit Azerbaijan will get for sure. I also hope that eventually a lot of people from all over the world will visit. It is surprising to see how word gets around. I personally did not know much about Azerbaijan until I went there myself. I did not quite understand the country before I went, but I was able to find out what it was like during my travels. This is what it means for the country and this is what we are hoping to be able to do: let people from around the world have a look at Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How will the Grand Prix affect the economy of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>It opens people's eyes and minds; eyes that would have never seen or minds that would have never thought about this country. Many large companies are involved in Formula 1. They travel with the circuit and they will be there in Baku. People could look and explore what is good for them.</p><h4>How does bringing a race to Azerbaijan fit within your global strategy and how did Baku get the privilege of hosting the return of the European Grand Prix?</h4><p>We are a world championship, so I see no reason not to bring it to Baku. This is a part of the world that I am interested in making sure that F1 is exposed to. When the discussions were initiated, I did not know whether Azerbaijan was considered European and I wondered how many other people would know that the country is part of Europe. I think a lot of people will be very surprised when they find out. That is why we are calling it the European Grand Prix, to pass the message across to everyone. Azerbaijan is part of Europe, isn't it? They would not have been able to call it the European Games in 2015 if it was not. </p><h4>After successfully hosting the 2015 European Games, how would you assess the ability of Azerbaijan to host this event?</h4><p>This is what Azerbaijan is trying to do; host big events in order to get the country known worldwide. This is the reason why the government wanted to host the European Games. With that said, F1 will give a lot more coverage to Azerbaijan than the European Games did. The global reach of F1 on television and across digital and social media is huge, cutting across languages, cultures, religions, and different age groups as well as demographics. All teams and drivers are also very good at marketing themselves, so it is true to say that all the stakeholders in the sport contribute strongly to the huge reach and engagement of F1. Thus, Azerbaijan will be the focus of attention for F1's worldwide audience and I am sure it will acquit itself brilliantly.</p><h4>What are the challenges you foresee for this Grand Prix?</h4><p>It will surely be very, very interesting, as it is going to be a street race in parts of the old city. I think everyone is going to be impressed in the same way I was impressed. Baku is a beautiful city. Some streets are narrow so we have had to do a little bit of work on laying out the best possible build for the circuit, but it will work well and it will look great on TV. Street racing is an integral part of F1 and its tradition. It adds a different kind of challenge, and therefore excitement, to the Grand Prix. Cars, teams, and drivers have to adapt to the different conditions. Baku will offer a new dimension to F1's long and glorious history of street racing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook on bilateral relations between Latvia and Azerbaijan over your four-year term?</h4><p>Although cooperation between Latvia and Azerbaijan has deepened in recent years, there is still huge potential for further expansion, especially in political, economic, and cultural areas. I am confident that we will continue our contacts at the highest political level. Latvia is interested in expanding cooperation with Azerbaijan in the field of education. We are delighted to see that the number of Azerbaijani students in Latvian universities has increased in recent years, and we hope that this trend will continue. We also have good cooperation between Latvian and Azerbaijani experts at the local government level regarding the issues of healthcare, education, and migration, and we hope to facilitate this cooperation even more. Seasonal direct flights are another important connection that brings our countries closer and increases our people-to-people contacts. Additionally, the Azeri community in Latvia serves as a bridge between our two states and has become an integral part of Latvian society.</p><h4>Trade turnover between Latvia and Azerbaijan currently sits at $28 million. What are the main pillars of trade between Latvia and Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Trade statistics in 2014 show a positive trend—the turnover for trade in goods between our countries has increased by 8.8% reaching ‚¬26.57 million, while the turnover for trade in services has reached ‚¬6.33 million. Latvia's major commodity groups for exports to Azerbaijan included livestock and animal production (mainly dairy produce like cream and yogurt, for example), food products (alcoholic beverages and preserved fish), machinery and electrical equipment (centrifuges, monitors and projectors, and telephones), and the chemical industry and its related products (pharmaceuticals) in 2015. Latvia's major services for exports to Azerbaijan are related to computing and information services, financial services, tours, and transport services (rail transport services). The major commodity groups for imports from Azerbaijan included food products (alcoholic beverages above all), and machinery and electrical equipment (mainly telephones), whereas the major services imported from Azerbaijan were transport services (rail transport services above all), other business, and financial services.</p><h4>An Azerbaijani company recently invested ‚¬40 million in the construction of a freight logistics terminal at Riga International Airport. What is the current level of cooperation between the two countries in the transportation sector?</h4><p>Beyond the Riga Internatonal Airport project, there is still much potential. The container train project ZUBR is one of the best practical examples for our further cooperation in this field. The ZUBR project could serve as a connector of transport systems between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. We find that the development of this project into a functioning transport corridor will be made possible with the participation of the Nordic countries and the Black Sea region.</p><h4>What are some areas of future economic growth between Latvia and Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In addition to already existing fields of cooperation, which account for the major volumes of bilateral trade and investments exchange, I would like to add metal processing and machinery, IT, life sciences, healthcare, the timber industry, green technology, and the food industry. I consider the promotion of Latvian franchise companies in the fields of cosmetics and fashion, such as Stenders, Dzintars, Madara Cosmetics, Lauma Lingerie, Attirance, and Rosme, in the Azerbaijani market as a promising prospect of economic cooperation.</p><h4>How does Latvia view Azerbaijan as a partner in the South Caucus region?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is an important partner of the EU in the energy and transit sectors. We highly value the role of Azerbaijan in the implementation of the Southern Gas Corridor and the ongoing work on the expansion of the South Caucasus Pipeline, the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP), and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). Latvia, as a firm supporter of strengthening the relations between the EU and Azerbaijan, believes that the cooperation in the framework of the Eastern Partnership should be continued. Enhanced mobility of citizens in a secure and well-managed environment remains a core objective of the Eastern Partnership. Latvia welcomes the progress to date in the implementation of the EU and Azerbaijan Visa Facilitation and Readmission Agreements. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>PASHA Bank is the first Azerbaijani private bank with subsidiaries in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. What was the strategy behind positioning yourself as a regional bank?</h4><p>We are indeed the first and, for the time being, the only Azerbaijani bank with a fully fledged presence in the three countries you mentioned. Our geographical expansion­­ stems from PASHA Bank's overall strategy—we follow our clients in their business endeavors, as we strongly believe that PASHA Bank is more than a bank. PASHA Bank is the business partner that will be by its client whenever he needs it. PASHA was established in 2007 solely as a corporate bank with no retail arm. We render banking services to companies operating in the non-oil sector in Azerbaijan. As our economy developed, we observed the growth of local enterprises and their expansion into neighboring countries, with Georgia and Turkey being on the top of their investment destinations. The trade triangle between Baku, Tbilisi, and Istanbul has intensified and we saw this as an excellent opportunity to support the business flow between these three countries. It was an exciting opportunity for PASHA Bank to enter new markets with advanced and very competitive banking sectors in both Turkey and Georgia. In order to succeed, PASHA Bank has chosen a good niche: we  work with companies that do business within these three countries. It is not only about Azeri business in Georgia and Turkey, it is also Turkish companies doing business in Georgia and Azerbaijan, and Georgian companies in Turkey and Azerbaijan. Tough competition in established markets is the great challenge for us. However, we see this competition as an excellent opportunity for us to position ourselves as a regional partner of choice, strengthen our competencies in new markets and, very importantly, share our experience and knowledge with each other.</p><h4>PASHA Bank recently launched a new platform with the Oracle FLEXCUBE. What advantages does this new platform offer to your company?</h4><p>The change was dictated by the rapid growth of our business. Over the last eight years, our portfolio grew to $700 million with half of this growth occurring within the last two years.  Therefore, our core banking system no longer met our current needs from a functional perspective. Oracle's FLEXCUBE solution is one of the best systems in the world for financial institutions as it gives us numerous opportunities to bring new products to the market. As our business grows locally and internationally and, as we expand into new markets, we have to keep abreast of innovations and technologies and be highly efficient from an IT perspective to be always at the cutting edge of new technologies.</p><h4>PASHA Bank has a history of supporting sports and cultural events in Azerbaijan and is well known for its CSR initiatives, recognized by many awards, both domestically and in Europe. What is PASHA Bank expecting from the Formula One Grand Prix to be held in Baku in 2016?</h4><p>The Formula One Grand Prix is going to be an exciting event for Azerbaijan and for the region. Whatever PASHA Bank can do to support and promote our country, we are happy and honored to do so. In fact, we are the official financial partner of Baku City Circuit, the company operating the Formula One Grand Prix in Baku. As a regional bank, the reputation of the country is important for us, and we are happy to support these initiatives because they place Azerbaijan on the map of significant international sports and cultural events. PASHA Bank is committed to the development of the youth, investing in human capital as the future of our country. We attach great importance to nurturing talent in various professions, because 10, 15, or 20 years on from now they will become PASHA Bank's potential employees, or potential customers, or just good citizens. These will be the PASHA Bank stakeholders who will share our love of our motherland, our faith in our country as a key regional player, and our passion to make it an even more prosperous place to live and to work. I believe in the power of corporate entities contributing to the development of country and society through well structured and a thoroughly thought out CSR mandate and let me assure everyone that PASHA Bank will remain one of the most enthusiastic CSR contributors in Azerbaijan's corporate sector.</p><h4>The Azerbaijan Microfinance Association has awarded PASHA Bank with the “Participant of the Year" and “Leading Company Promoting Gender Equality" awards. What have been some of the steps PASHA Bank has taken in the microfinance sector since 2014?</h4><p>PASHA Bank's core business is focused on the corporate and SME sectors. Although micro lending is not within PASHA Bank's business mandate, we partner with non-banking credit organizations (NBCO) that are involved in microfinance lending directly. We open credit lines for NBCOs for their microcredit projects and we will continue doing so no matter what the economic situation is, because we believe that partnerships are not reserved for good times only. As the best partner, we will be with our customers on both sunny and rainy days. As concerns awards we won in 2015, we are very proud to the best company promoting gender equality: half of our managerial staff is a representative of the better half of the humankind.  Moreover, two out of our five executive board members are women, too. Individuality and equality are the internal values of our Bank: the personality, competence, and contribution of our people in the ultimate goal of PASHA Bank is what is the most important. The “Participant of the Year" award has been the recognition of our contribution in the development of the microfinance sector—within our CSR program, we fund the capacity building program for participants involved in the microfinance sector.</p><h4>After the parliamentary elections of November 2015, what is your focus for the banking sector in Azerbaijan for the medium term?</h4><p>We had successful parliamentary elections in November and, looking at the recent changes we have seen, I expect that our economy will undergo many reforms in 2016. These reforms will definitely support the further diversification of the economy of Azerbaijan and development of the real sector. As a financial institution that has built its core business outside of the oil and gas sector, we are looking forward to seeing and contributing to the thrilling changes that 2016 will bring. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What helped İDEAL to become the leading company in this sector, and how do you maintain this leading position? </h4><p>There is a phrase, “All roads lead to Rome." In Azerbaijan, it is a fact that all thoughts about cosmetics and perfumery lead to İDEAL. In our 17 year history, we enjoy a 55% market share, have 140 global and local brands suiting every taste, a wide retail chain presented both in Baku and the regions, and the largest retail emporium within the territory of Caucasus. Our entire work is based on a well-targeted strategy, which simplifies every customer's choice and brings profits to each of our partners. Working with 140 brands means that every shopper will not leave without a purchase. Also, our beauty consultants work with all clients regardless of their earnings, lifestyle, or problems. We offer cosmetic and perfumery products for every wallet, skin, and event. We know that a satisfied customer means a satisfied business partner. Our extended retail chain makes us available at every part of the city. No matter where you live or work, there will always be an İDEAL store not far from you. You will not need to spend half a day to come to the city center. Being present in all regions of Baku, including even the furthest regions, helps us to attract all segments of the market without focusing on only one. This guarantees us success even when the market is going through hard times for reasons that are beyond our control.  As a result, we have both satisfied customers and partners. If that does not make the best success formula, then what does?</p><h4>You always surprise your customers with novelties, even though Azerbaijani customers are considered to be conservative. Do you think this is the right strategy?</h4><p>The right strategy is when your customer is assured that you know about the product more than they do. Our customers can spend their time on their family or favorite sports, while we collect, approve, and present all the information about cosmetic and perfumery products to the market. The İDEAL store at 28 Mall is the biggest store in the Trans-Caucasian region, and this is not only in terms of size. This store repeats the format of the famous Apple Store, the difference being that it sells cosmetic products. This is not a stereotypical cosmetics and perfumery shop where you can pop in for a few minutes to quickly buy something. This is an interactive store where you can build individual relations with a brand, which means you have an opportunity to see, try, choose, and get acquainted with each product separately. This is not a place to use, but to enjoy cosmetic products and perfumes. This way, we present beauty products and perfumes as a lifestyle. Just like bibliophiles admire books, there are thousands of women in the world who are in love with aromatic bottles, jars, and tubes of various gels and creams. Our partners also appreciate that we do not position ourselves as an intermediary company, but as the owner of the market, constantly seeking for new ways to communicate with customers. It is this constant search for new and more convenient ways to please customers that brought us to introduce the electronic order system. Taking into account the internet penetration level of Azerbaijan, this decision might seem premature. We took this step not only for those who do not have time or do not want to go to the store, or those who, for example, appreciate an opportunity to order a gift for a friend during lunchtime. We did it because internet is the future and, fast or slow, our market will also move to this end. </p><h4>With talk about an economic crisis in Azerbaijan, what is your strategy for 2016? <br></h4><p>Every businessperson lives in the constant condition of crisis and mobilization. At the beginning of the road, it is the crisis of keeping faith in your project in spite of the given prognosis. Then, it is the constant crisis of business optimization followed by the crisis of becoming a leader and, in the end, the crisis of keeping the leadership position. For that reason, there have not been any significant changes for me or our company. İDEAL Kompani has been functioning for 17 years. We have had enough time to study the market and our customers' wishes and needs. We have numerous effective strategies that help us maintain our leading position. Like all other companies, we will maximally improve the service quality to enhance relations with our already existing customers and make our stores a place to be recommended to friends. It is said that ideal service is when every customer gets individual consultation. This is exactly what we are aiming for right now. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Synergy Group diversified its business lines into healthcare and banking in 2015, both competitive sectors in Azerbaijan. What is the value that Synergy Group can add to these areas?</h4><p>Since our establishment in 2010, Synergy Group has been active in construction, agriculture, ICT, tourism, services, and education. In 2015, we further diversified our portfolio into healthcare and banking. In Ganja, we launched the Ganja International Hospital. Classified as an A+ hospital, it applies the latest international standards in the field of medicine. The main purpose of this multidisciplinary medical enterprise is to provide high-quality healthcare services from highly qualified foreign and Azerbaijani professionals through the use of advanced technology and knowledge. With a 120-bed capacity in total, the hospital currently provides 63 beds to ensure high-quality service and a comfortable stay. This includes 26 single-beds, nine private, and two VIP wards, as well as 26 beds for reanimation and intensive care, post-operative observation, neonatology, and other purposes. In addition to the traditional medical services at Ganja International Hospital, we provide high-tech cardiovascular surgery, interventional cardiology, interventional radiology, bone marrow transplantation, and plastic surgery. The outpatient and inpatient capacity of the hospital is 300-400 patients per day. The Ganja International Hospital was also constructed as a smart building. The existence of modern ambulances and transport facilities enable us to provide urgent medical services on the way to the hospital from other cities of Azerbaijan. We believe that the opening of Ganja International Hospital will be an important step to improving the quality of healthcare services rendered to the population of Azerbaijan, as well as neighboring countries. In the banking sector, we are active in this market through the Caspian Development Bank. Based on our long-term vision and strategy, we have provided not only standard financial services, but we have also innovated and created new services. These include our comprehensive payment cards, mobile banking, e-payment methods, and virtual offices, for example. Our portfolio of services serves effectively for both individual customers, as well as the corporate sector. We provide a wide range of loans with a customized approach. At the same time, deposits, payment cards, money transfers, bank cells, and other services are provided at the highest level of quality and based on individualized expectations. As part of our customer care and HR philosophy, we understand the importance of an individualized approach for each customer and we train our employees to be target oriented. Committed to our slogan “Towards a Sustainable Future," we are keen to provide further services with modern technology and know-how.</p><h4>Synergy Group applied state-of-art-technology at Zayam Technologies Park (ZTP), which provides greenhouse structures for agricultural businesses. Could you provide us with additional information about your contributions at ZTP?</h4><p>In recent years, Synergy Group has invested heavily in the manufacturing sector. One of our successful subsidiary companies in this field is ZTP. Modern technologies from European and Asian companies have enabled us to produce greenhouse structures with all the internal components. It is important to highlight the importance of this business from various angles. First, our greenhouse system (glass, poly-carbon, polyethylene, and combi greenhouse) is the most advanced and environmentally clean. The steel construction used for the installation of the greenhouse structure is galvanized and protected against long-term corrosion. The production cycle covers external steel parts, as well as the instillation and manufacturing of modern irrigation sparkling systems, dropping, and rain-drop for the farmers. At the same time, specific components for modern greenhouses, such as fan systems, lifting facilities, high-pressure boilers, and humidifying cooling systems are produced. Modern milling, tube bending, tank pipe welding, and metal structures cut under angles are installed in the factory. In addition, the ceiling is designed to withstand heavy snow and winds of 120-130km/h. These statistics prove that our greenhouses are the strongest and most durable in the market. Secondly, thanks to modernization initiatives, we have increased the number of employees at our workshops. Now, more than 100 people are directly employed in various business cycles. It is important to mention that most of the employees are from the Zayam village or Shamkir region. Herein, we contribute to increasing employment in the region, as well as enhancing the social welfare of citizens.Third, a growing trend in the agriculture sector of Azerbaijan is a move toward increased specialization. Using cutting-edge technology, we respond appropriately to the needs of our customers. Currently, one of our largest customers is the Shamkir-based AgroPark. ZTP offers greenhouse structures and installation services on the construction site. Thus, the existence of a full production cycle for the installation of greenhouse structures at Zayam Technologies Park creates room for us to meet the expectations and needs of our customers and creates a comparative advantage in the market.</p><h4>Synergy Group is one of the local investment companies that is active in sports. In this regard, what is your contribution to cycling in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Synergy Group is carrying out a wide range of CSR activities. One of these projects is financing the Synergy Baku Cycling Project, which is the first Azerbaijani cycling team as of 2012. Our main objective is to promote cycling in Azerbaijan as a mode of ecofriendly transport as well as a way to contribute to a healthy lifestyle. We are proud that, within a short period of time, we have achieved high results. For the first time, the Synergy Baku Cycling Project team is composed of mostly Azerbaijani riders. While Maksym Averin and Elchin Asadov are mature riders with many achievements, the younger riders receive benefits and positive influence from the experience of the veterans. This enables our team members to achieve high results. Our team members also received a license for the 2016 Rio Olympics. Furthermore, Synergy Group is one of the sponsors of the international cycling competition the Tour d'Azerbaidjan, which has been organized since 2012. In 2015, the Synergy Baku Cycling team got the first prize in team competition. Members of our team also participated at the first ever European Games. Within this competition, we showed our support for the further promotion of cycling in Azerbaijan and we broadcast the event through various international TV channels. Overall, with continued enthusiasm and support for cycling in Azerbaijan, we are sure that we can enhance the reputation of Azerbaijani cycling in the world. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>AtaTechnology is the local partner of Cisco Systems and the gold partner of Oracle. As the ICT sector grows in size and importance in Azerbaijan, how is AtaHolding interested in expanding its role in this sector?</h4><p>The information society is growing rapidly in Azerbaijan. E-government and ASAN Services operate successfully and the application of e-government solutions is constantly increasing. The establishment of technology parks, the application of advanced technologies to education, and state support for innovative investment projects have contributed to the overall development of the high-tech sector both in the country and region. Active on the market for more than 10 years, AtaTechnology cooperates closely with renowned ICT brands such as Microsoft, Oracle, HP, Cisco Systems, and others. Partnerships with these companies are developing quickly and our goal is to take advantage of the products these companies offer to meet the ICT demands of our customers. We continuously put forward new and innovative projects. In order to achieve further development, one of the goals at AtaTechnology has been the training of qualified professionals. AtaTechnology is also currently working on the development and application of ICT software. We are assessing market needs and plan to develop specific products to fill in possible gaps. We hope to eliminate the dependence on imported software, and we intend to export our software products as well. Thus, we are interested in expanding our activities and investment portfolio in order to meet these objectives.</p><h4>AtaHolding cooperates with a number of international companies in different sectors, especially banking and insurance. What synergies does AtaHolding look for when entering into partnerships with international companies?</h4><p>Local companies operating in the country have started cooperating with foreign companies not only in the spheres of trade, production, construction, and IT, but also in the area of financial services. The international cooperation of banks and insurance companies is worthy of special mention. This cooperation is expected to result in the emergence of new banking and insurance products on the Azerbaijani market and will enhance the quality of services provided, elevating the financial services market to a qualitatively new level. At the same time, a large number of syndicated credit operations are carried out during the financing of major national and regional business and infrastructure projects. This is a strong example of mutually beneficial international cooperation and synergy. Cooperation in the insurance sector, in particular its re-insurance segment, will contribute to more professional risk assessments and improved risk management standards on the local market. We can say with full confidence that the level of knowledge and competence of Azerbaijani specialists is fully consistent with international standards thanks to the international exchange of experience. Major banks and insurance companies operating in Azerbaijan are expected to expand their outreach to foreign markets and enhance their export potential.</p><h4>In the last several years, AtaHolding has expanded its operations into the tourism and hospitality sector, establishing the Excelsior Hotel Baku and AtaTravel. Do you believe that Azerbaijan has the capacity to become an international tourism center?</h4><p>The Excelsior Hotel Baku was launched in 2005 and the AtaTravel travel company in 2011. AtaTravel offers numerous travel opportunities to many countries around the world, including travel opportunities to Azerbaijan. The company specializes in hotels, transfer, air tickets, tour reservations, insurance, and visa services. Our goal is to expand our contribution to the development of tourism every year. The government attaches great importance to the development of tourism in accordance with international standards. This also contributes to developing the non-oil sector, as tourism accounts for a significant share of the non-oil economy. The government has implemented a number of infrastructure projects in order to facilitate the development of this sector, such as continually building numerous hotels that meet the highest standards in Baku and the regions. Thus, a competitive tourism business is being created. In addition, the diversity and originality of travel opportunities make our country rather exceptional in comparison with many other countries. The availability of beaches, sun, sea, spa resorts, winter activities, and other types of recreation are evidence of that. The government is pursuing a long-term and sustainable tourism policy to achieve successful results and beat the competition. It is also important to pay serious attention to issues such as security, quality of service, attractions, prices, and so on. One of the key factors in turning Azerbaijan into a globally attractive travel destination is the training of qualified personnel. The number of competent, knowledgeable, and experienced people working in the tourism sector must increase. It is also necessary to make use of the experience of the world's leading countries and to enact proper advertising.</p><h4>In November 2015, parliamentary elections took place in Azerbaijan with high voter turnout. What will this election do to usher in new opportunities to the people of Azerbaijan in the future and what are the expectations of AtaHolding in 2016? </h4><p>The parliamentary election held in Azerbaijan in November 2015 was held in a situation of complete democracy, transparency, and fairness, which demonstrated the position of our society, citizens, and voters. It showed that Azerbaijan's choice of secular and independent development was correct. The election symbolizes a victory of our democracy and law-governed state. Voter turnout was high and international observers also expressed their satisfaction. I am confident that the new parliament will work tirelessly to secure comprehensive development of our country, including the adoption of laws that would facilitate economic reforms. The most important aspect of the parliament's work for entrepreneurs is the adoption of regulatory acts that will secure the interests of business people. I have great hopes for the realization of our plans and expectations in the years to come.</p><h4>AtaHolding provides support for the development of sport in Azerbaijan. What impact will the Formula One Grand Prix have on the country's further development?</h4><p>AtaHolding is proud to contribute to the development of sport in Azerbaijan. At present, we are the main sponsor of the International Wrestling Federation. The athletes representing the AtaSport club have won numerous medals in Olympic Games, world, and European championships in wrestling and other sports. We are committed to continuing our support for the national development of sport. The fact that Azerbaijan has been honored to host the prestigious Formula One event represents recognition of the country's outstanding track record in hosting such competitions. In general, all spheres of sport have seen impressive growth in Azerbaijan in recent years. In 2015, Baku hosted the inaugural European Games at the highest possible level. The work carried out in the country in anticipation of the European Games, as well as the entirely new sporting infrastructure built specifically for the Games, left many visitors from Europe and the world awestruck. Our country has accumulated extensive experience, competence, professionalism, and a strong reputation for conducting such high-profile events. Therefore, the Formula One European Grand Prix will certainly attract the attention of the world. People watching the competition around the world and visitors of Azerbaijan will see the beauty of our city with their own eyes. This is an excellent opportunity for promoting Baku to the world. Formula One is also the most watched sporting event in the world and about 11,000 foreign fans and tourists are expected to come to Baku to watch the competition, which is also an important factor. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<title><![CDATA[All the Upsides]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[all-the-upsides]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>PASHA Holding is involved in essentially every major sector of the economy. How do you go about organizing such a multi-faceted holding group?</h4><p>Currently, that is at the top of our agenda. From 2006 to 2012, we worked in an opportunistic way, trying to capture as large a market share as possible. After 2012, the situation changed in the region and the large markets that surround Azerbaijan were affected. We started thinking about optimization and improving corporate governance in terms of trimming costs and removing inefficiencies. Previously, we were loosely running the corporate agenda from the center of PASHA Holding; however, we realized that we needed some stronger controls to prepare ourselves for the economic slowdown. In 2014, we started to talk to McKinsey &amp; Company in order to shape our strategy more efficiently and create an organizational structure that would yield a more efficient management model. We completed the project at the beginning of 2015, and now we are actively implementing this new corporate governance model, leading to the creation of more units, such as a banking group at the corporate center level. In the banking sector in Azerbaijan, we own two banks and we also expanded to own two regional banks, PASHA Bank Georgia and PASHA Bank Turkey. The need for further coordination was clear. The model we used was sophisticated by international standards, which required us to raise our capacities to meet these international levels. Now, we are much better equipped to deal with an economic slowdown. When business development is lagging, it is a good time to look internally to minimize costs and optimize the processes. That was the main purpose of this project.</p><h4>How do the private equity services provided by PASHA Holding foster growth and competitiveness as a method of alternative financing for potential firms in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We were pioneers in experimenting with this; however, it requires a certain level of sophistication from the other side as well. There are certain issues we are still dealing with—the penetration of the banking sector into the economy is still limited, corporate governance standards are not adopted, and there are also some issues with basic financial management in local companies. We have developed a model through which we can assist these companies via our private equity investment fund, rather than our banks. Because this is a risky model, we have also required some of our candidate clients to make some reforms in terms of financial management and corporate governance. For this model to be successful, there has to be capital markets, which are limited in Azerbaijan at this stage, and strong strategic sponsors, which we are helping to develop. We must also have more active participation from foreign investors, which the government is working to support. I would like private equity to become a pillar of business for PASHA Holding because the upside is enormous. We are the first; no one has even experimented with it yet. On the private equity side, we are incurring all the risks, but could potentially gain all the upsides.</p><h4>Are there any sectors of the economy in which PASHA Holding is looking to expand?</h4><p>We are looking at tourism as a potentially booming sector going forward, and we are initiating a couple of pilot projects in agriculture. We believe the next boom in Azerbaijan will be agriculture. Almost all of Azerbaijan has fertile soil and the markets are close. However, the nearby Arab and European markets demand we certify our agricultural products. Certification is one of the elements of the chain that is not yet in place. To enter other markets and export in a systemic way, our producers need to upgrade their capacity in many ways. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of your Ministry's key achievements?</h4><p>The Republic of Azerbaijan is recognized worldwide as an example of safety and stability. The main goal of our government is the prosperity of the Azerbaijani people. One of the main preconditions for this prosperity is the safety of our citizens. From this perspective, the establishment of the Ministry of Emergency Situations by an executive order of President Ilham Aliyev in December 2005 attests to the importance our state attaches to the safety of its people, as well as the protection of its population and territory. Over the past 10 years, according to the instructions of the head of state, the Ministry's management structure has undergone major transformations. The material and technical infrastructure of the organizations dealing with safety has been significantly improved and their facilities have been upgraded in line with contemporary requirements. In order to ensure the timely and adequate fulfilment of the Ministry's responsibilities in the country's districts, nine regional centers have been set up, the unserviceable depots, offices, and technical buildings of the Ministry's organizations were overhauled, and new facilities commissioned. As a result of the commissioning of the Ministry's Crisis Management Center and the 112 hotline, important work has been done to prevent potential emergency situations and eliminate the consequences of natural disasters. The different tactical drills carried out in our country in recent years, in particular the Khazar-2009, Khazar-2010, Khazar-2013, and Khazar-2015, have contributed to enhancing the Ministry's material and technical infrastructure, personnel preparedness, emergency response, search and rescue capacity, and identified areas for a further improvement. In the last decade, our personnel have repeatedly displayed courage and professionalism. Our workforce has worked tirelessly to mitigate the consequences of earthquakes, floods, fires, landslides, other natural and manmade disasters, and conduct search and rescue operations. According to the Integrated Action Plan on Improving the Environmental Situations in Azerbaijan, the premises of the Baku Iodine Factory and the Neftchala Iodine Bromide Factory have been refurbished. A park covering an area of 6ha has been established in Sabunchu District of Baku. In order to implement these projects in line with international standards, the Ministry of Emergency Situations invited experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Ministry is also successfully accomplishing the important mission of conducting awareness campaigns in respect to the prevention of emergency situations. In order to educate children and teenagers about emergency situations, a national competition called Emergency Situations Through the Eyes of Kids is organized every year. The national and international contests Young Rescuer and Firefighter and Young Rescuer organized jointly with the ministries of education and youth and sport, have been instrumental in communicating our safety messages to children. In order to improve the competence of our personnel, agreements were signed with educational institutions in several countries, including Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. These agreements have allowed our people the opportunity to expand their knowledge and skills. In addition, according to an executive order signed by President Ilham Aliyev, the Academy of the Ministry was established in 2008 to ensure specialized training of Ministry personnel, expand their qualifications, and conduct scientific research in the field of emergency situations. The training process at the Academy is organized in accordance with European Credit System requirements. There is a modern campus with sophisticated educational infrastructure and state-of-the-art equipment. In an effort to expand international cooperation, steps have been taken to increase collaboration with relevant institutions of several countries, including a number of authoritative international and regional organizations. Over these years, we have established and maintained relations with similar agencies of more than 60 countries and international organizations. These reciprocal visits, meetings, and agreements have allowed us to strengthen our assets and resources, study best international practices, and build up our personnel. The Ministry has been involved in eliminating the consequences of calamities in different countries and delivering humanitarian aid to disaster-affected places. The Ministry of Emergency Situations has provided assistance in dealing with the forest fires in the Russian Federation and the State of Israel, the floods in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the earthquake in Van province of the Republic of Turkey, the floods in Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan Republic of the Russian Federation, the earthquake in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the torrential rains in the north of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and the floods in the Republic of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have also extended assistance at the level of the Azerbaijani government to eliminate the consequences of the earthquake in Haiti and the hurricane in the Philippines. The Ministry has provided financial assistance to eradicate famine in Somalia. Humanitarian assistance has been provided in the aftermath of devastating earthquakes in Osh province of Kyrgyzstan and Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region of Tajikistan. The planes of the Ministry of Emergency Situations were involved in the emergency evacuation of the Azerbaijanis fleeing from armed confrontation in Egypt and our countrymen stranded in the epicenter of a powerful earthquake in Nepal. The work the Ministry has been doing to create a high level of safety and security in the country and prevent potential emergency situations is evidence of the fact that we are taking the right steps to live up to the expectations of the country's leadership.</p><h4>What can you say about the prospects for the construction sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In general, construction is one of the leading sectors of the national economy. Linking many sectors, it contributes a lot to the overall development trend. The dynamic development observed in the country's construction sector in the years of independence was preconditioned by its high profitability, the increased demand for the construction of various buildings and facilities, and the successful implementation of state programs. Thanks to the support of President Ilham Aliyev, the role of the construction sector in overall economic development has significantly increased. Against the backdrop of a global economic recession, President Ilham Aliyev issued instructions to maintain the current pace in the construction sector. Documents signed in recent years have paved the way for more robust business activities. The new edition of the Code on Town Planning and Construction signed into law in January 2013 established a deadline of 20 days for expert examination of draft construction documents. This period can be extended only for complex construction, potentially hazardous, or similar facilities. In addition, according to the new Code, all construction facilities have been divided in three groups: those not requiring a permit, those requiring a permit, and those requiring a notification. The facilities requiring a construction permit are subdivided into those requiring expert examination of construction projects and those not requiring it. As a result, Azerbaijan advanced by 17 steps in 2014 and by a further 36 in 2015 in the construction permits ranking of the Doing Business report. Construction companies, including business entities, have to embrace new opportunities. The favorable investment and business environment in the country, the liberal town-planning and construction laws, and a flexible system of governance are opening up extensive opportunities for those engaged in construction. There is still a lot to do in the construction sector, with many neighborhoods and settlements in Baku alone that are not on the master plan of the city. It is time to remove the obsolete and rundown buildings that are already in emergency condition and build modern settlements with sophisticated infrastructure. With this aim, a new concept has been designed to construct modern buildings in micro-districts of Baku and landscape these areas. With the “one window“ principle, and bureaucratic obstacles eliminated, we believe that this should serve as a basis for business people to expand their activity in construction. The realization of this concept will also lead to the expansion of the housing market, which will inevitably improve the well-being of our population, contribute to greater employment opportunities, and align construction activities with modern requirements. We hope that both construction organizations and individual entrepreneurs will make their contribution to the implementation of complex construction and architectural ideas and the establishment of unique buildings and structures, thus helping the country's construction sector to enter a qualitatively new stage.  </p><h4>What is the Ministry's safety agenda in the run-up to the Baku GP?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a country capable of conducting major events safely. The Eurovision 2012 song contest, the 2012 U17 Women's Football World Cup, and the inaugural European Games held in Baku in 2015 were tremendous successes. The Formula One European Grand Prix will be remembered for its proper approach to safety matters. The Ministry started preparations far in advance for this high-profile event. Permanent representatives were appointed to the Baku Circle Operating Company in October 2015. A working group comprised of the Ministry's executive office and relevant organizations has been set up to organize safety issues at the proper level. The number of the Ministry's firefighting and rescue personnel, as well as units of relevant hardware and equipment for the Formula One European Grand Prix, has been determined. According to our initial expectations, four fire trucks and 12 units of emergency rescue hardware will be deployed for the Formula One European Grand Prix. Our personnel, firefighters, and rescue machinery was also deployed in the entertainment event organized by the Baku Circle Operating Company in the National Seaside Park in December 2015. In addition, employees of the Ministry's Fire Safety Service will be on standby in the makeshift building to be constructed outside the Government House, at the Media Center, the areas for spectators, the National Seaside Park, and the hotels where teams will be staying. The Fire Safety Service is currently examining and monitoring public catering, recreation, entertainment facilities, hotels, guesthouses, and similar institutions across the country for their compliance with safety standards. The State Agency for Monitoring Safety in Construction exercises state control over temporary buildings and structures; the State Agency for Regulating Nuclear and Radiological Activity conducts radiological safety monitoring; the State Agency for Industrial and Mining Safety is responsible for safe installation of potentially hazardous equipment and facilities. According to an approved plan, the Ministry's personnel and resources will operate in a robust security regime during the Formula One European Grand Prix. Therefore, we will do our best to conduct the Formula One European Grand Prix in Baku in full accordance with safety requirements. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With an active Austria-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce in place in Baku, what is your assessment of the current level of economic relations between Austria and Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Economic relations between Austria and Azerbaijan can be qualified as well established and on a solid base. Azerbaijan enjoys a significant trade surplus with Austria due to its exports of oil, which comprise over 90% of exports. This economic data illustrates the high dependency of Azerbaijan on one export commodity. This dependence has increased Azerbaijan's vulnerability in times of crises, as 50% of GNP and 97% of exports stem from the oil and gas sector. Austria appreciates that Azerbaijan, under the leadership of President Aliyev, is trying to introduce reforms and diversify its economy. This is a difficult and long-term process, especially as most countries in the region are facing similar problems. Bilateral trade has increased nearly tenfold in the last 10 years. In 1H2015, Austria was Azerbaijan's fifth most important import partner. In 2010, the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber opened an office in Baku, with the aim of contributing to the development and expansion of bilateral trade relations. Last year, two business missions with more than 30 Austrian companies from various industrial sectors were organized. In addition, the office of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber supported the activities of individual businesses and entrepreneurs.</p><h4>More than 45 Austrian companies are currently operating in Azerbaijan. What role can Austrian companies play in assisting the development of Azerbaijan's technical and technological sectors?</h4><p>President Aliyev has mentioned his eagerness to improve and diversify the Azerbaijani economy several times. Austria is ready to work together with Azerbaijan in this endeavor. Many Austrian companies are engaged in the planning, architecture, and construction business. As a supplier of high-quality machinery in the field of oil and gas, Austria has contributed to the technological development of Azerbaijan. This is also true for the pharmaceutical sector, which is an important Austrian export to Azerbaijan. Furthermore, there is ongoing cooperation in the field of education. The strengthening of university and academic cooperation in the technological field would therefore be beneficial.</p><h4>Which areas offer the most potential for Austria and Azerbaijan to increase mutual cooperation efforts moving forward?</h4><p>Azerbaijan and Austria in many respects share similar features. Our countries and population are of approximately the same size, we share similar climatic zones, especially mountain ranges and forests, and geopolitically both countries are placed between large and powerful neighbors on essential trade routes. As the focus of Azerbaijan is shifting to the diversification of the economy, Austria would like to be a substantial partner. The Austrian Tourism University of Krems closely cooperates with the University of Tourism and Management of Azerbaijan and Austria is working in close cooperation with the administration of the Old City of Baku on the restoration of several monuments. We were successful in restoring the Maiden Tower, and now we are working on the restoration of the Baylar mosque and a grave in Shirvanshah palace. Another important field with huge potential for cooperation is the agricultural sector, from production to the promotion of products. Another area of cooperation could be an exchange of expertise in the area of mountain farming, as substantial parts of both our territories are covered by mountains. In addition, the areas of machinery and plants (in particular in the oil and gas industry as well as in food processing) and the renewal of the energy infrastructure offer significant opportunities for Austrian companies. Last but not least, I would like to underline that Azerbaijan, as Austria, is a country on an important international trade link. We are following with great interest Azerbaijan's endeavor to position itself on the crossroads of the silk and spice route. I believe that Austrian know-how in the road and railway sectors could be beneficial for Azerbaijan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures have been taken to ensure the sustainability of Azerbaijan's development against the backdrop of an ongoing international economic crisis? </h4><p>The year 2015 will be remembered as one of successful development for the economy of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan's GDP saw growth of 1.1%, while industrial production grew by 2.4% and the non-oil sector by 8.4%. Timely measures concerning the development of the non-oil sector taken by President Ilham Aliyev worked to minimize the impact of the global crisis. Azerbaijan's tax legislation is not only being used for fiscal purposes, but also to develop the economy to stimulate the growth of various fields and attract investments and new technologies, while also supporting the social sector. The Ministry of Taxes conducts important tax-budget analyses in order to expand the taxable base and to use the tax potential of Azerbaijan more efficiently. The Ministry focuses on the expansion of taxpayers' rights, the reduction of tax burdens, the improvement of tax administration, the increase of budget revenues by strengthening the fight against tax evasion, and the development of entrepreneurship. It particularly encourages the expansion of SMEs.</p><h4>The legislative documents on amendments to the Tax Code have already been approved under the decree of President Ilham Aliyev. What were the main amendments and what made them necessary?</h4><p>The amendments made to the Tax Code aim to reduce the tax burden and simplify the tax administration, creating a more favorable business environment. According to the amendments, taxpayers with a monthly income up to AZN2,500 and annual income up to AZN30,000 will be eligible for tax relief. Simplifying the tax administration, the amount of taxable turnover that requires an obligation to apply for VAT registration has been increased from AZN120,000 to AZN200,000. The increase will allow the taxpayers with turnover less than AZN200,000 to continue their businesses within the simplified regime of taxation. Also, people engaged in trading and catering activities are entitled to be registered as simplified taxpayers, regardless of their turnover. The mechanism of taxation of income from the sale of real estate has been further simplified and the tax burden in this area has been significantly reduced. Winnings from sports betting are now subject to withholding tax as well, which will lead to an increase in non-oil sector revenue. Moreover, the list of VAT-exempted priority import areas has been included into the Tax Code. This list can be changed only after being discussed in the Milli Majlis (National Assembly) and approved by the President. To assist in this, the Azerspace telecommunication satellite and new participants in this market, satellites, and other spacecraft, have been exempted from property tax.</p><h4>2015 saw several structural changes related to the improvement of the tax administration in Azerbaijan. What was the necessity for creating new structures and are any steps expected to be taken in this area in 2016?</h4><p>Overall, 2015 saw a number of structural changes in the Ministry of Taxes aimed at improving the control functions of the tax authorities. This brings it more in line with modern requirements, strengthens organizational measures in tax collection, and increases the effectiveness of measures taken for shaping the tax culture and discipline of the population. We prioritize factors such as management quality, efficiency, and the balancing of the interests of the state and taxpayers. Thus, the Ministry has undergone structural changes to collect taxes more efficiently, improve the work in the field of fighting against tax violations and crimes, ensure the full and timely fulfillment of obligations of taxpayers who have debts to the state, increase the effectiveness of control over the regional tax offices, ensure full and timely payment of taxes, and increase control over the consideration of citizens' appeals.</p><h4>The Republic of Azerbaijan has made a considerable achievement in attracting FDI to the country. What tax reliefs are in place in Azerbaijan for foreign corporations that help promote FDI and enhance investor confidence?</h4><p>The attraction of foreign investment to the economy is an important component of the foreign economic policy of Azerbaijan. The total volume of investments attracted in the last 20 years exceeds $190 billion, about half of which was from foreign investors. The active involvement of foreign investors in Azerbaijan stems from the attractive investment climate in the country. According to the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum, Azerbaijan stands at ninth in the world for the stability of the macroeconomic environment. Azerbaijan is ranked 40th out of 150 countries for global economic competitiveness and has been first in the CIS region for seven years. The inflow of FDI has led to an increase in the export capacity of the country, growth of production, integration of modern market relations in the field of entrepreneurship, import of new technologies into the country, and rebuilding of the national economic infrastructure as a whole. One of our goals is to attract foreign investors to the country through the creation of a favorable tax environment. A number of international agreements have been signed, covering the promotion and protection of investments, the avoidance of double taxation on property and income, and transport and loan agreements.</p><h4>How do tax relief practices for certain domestic industries fit into the Ministry's general development strategy for the country?</h4><p>Among the factors boosting the dynamic growth of the non-oil sector, the introduction of tax reliefs and the formation of a favorable tax environment are of significant importance. Exempting agricultural products from taxes has had a positive effect on the development of regions, employment, and securing the food safety of the country. Income tax exemptions of the population's bank deposits and dividends on securities expands the resources of banks by encouraging the turnover of free cash and further developing the securities market. These reliefs protected the national finance and banking sector from the adverse effects of the global crisis. We have exempted industrial parks from taxes for seven years to restore the industrial capacity of the country, increase the share of this area in GDP, support the manufacturing and export of products in the non-oil sector, and create new jobs. The Ministry of Taxes constantly focuses on ensuring a transition to an active tax policy from a passive tax policy, optimizing tax rates, creating equal and fair conditions for taxpayers, ensuring efficiency, competitiveness, and transparency.</p><h4>How do you assess the importance of international events that have been held in Azerbaijan in recent years and those that will take place in 2016?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has hosted a number of international events in recent years. These events promote Azerbaijan as a sporting country and also add huge support to the development of our economy as a whole, in both tourism and investment. Realizing Azerbaijan's tourism potential fits our country's policy of expanding the capacity of the non-oil sector. The 2015 Baku European Games was a celebration of Azerbaijan. For important events such as 2016 Formula One Grand Prix, Chess Olympiad 2016, Islamic Solidarity Games 2017, and four matches of UEFA Euro 2016, the infrastructure is also important to promote our national economic potential. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the effectiveness of hosting large-scale international events, like the 2016 Formula One Grand Prix in Baku, in terms of drawing foreign investments to Azerbaijan? </h4><p>As the result of the great attention of the Head of the State, sport is rapidly developing in our country. Azerbaijan is known as a sporting country and our successes in this field are also well known. It has become a tradition to host international competitions in our country. Numerous World and European championships, as well as other competitions, are held in Azerbaijan every year. Holding the Formula One European Grand Prix in Azerbaijan in the year after the first European Games in 2015 is evidence of increasing international interest in Azerbaijan. This event will significantly contribute to the development of sport and it will also help boost the economy and increase long-term investments. In this context, the 2016 Formula One Grand Prix will bring the latest technology in motor sport and manufacturing to the streets of Baku. It will demonstrate to key potential investors that Azerbaijan is open to developing its high-tech sectors. The sharing of technical knowhow with local people will make Azerbaijan more attractive to companies looking to invest in talent. I recognize that patience and determination are important to convert this increased international interest into sustainable benefits for Azerbaijan. Investment promotion is a long-term game. Our team is committed to helping investors increase their knowledge and understanding of Azerbaijan as a place to invest.</p><h4>Foreign investments in fixed assets of the country increased by 40% in 2015. To what can you attribute this phenomenal growth? </h4><p>According to the State Statistical Committee of Azerbaijan, the volume of investments in fixed assets by foreign institutions was AZN7 billion in 2015. Foreign investors take a long-term perspective. They are not driven by short-term speculation for short-term gain, but by the long-term prospects of a country. Despite current challenges, this figure is a vote of confidence in the long-term future of Azerbaijan. This confidence comes from a broad range of countries like the UK, Norway, Russia, Iran, the US, Malaysia, and Japan. The Shah Deniz II project has driven much of the investment in the construction and engineering sectors. When I meet these investors, they tell me they chose Azerbaijan for a number of key reasons. These include our strategic location and proximity to regional markets, our improving infrastructure and logistics, an increasingly skilled workforce with an international outlook, and continuous improvements in our regulatory and business climate. These are long-term determinants of investment into Azerbaijan, which help to ensure we can attract investment through challenging periods in the short and medium term.</p><h4>AZPROMO recently organized a well-attended Azerbaijan-Iran business forum. In light of the impending removal of international sanctions against Iran, what is your assessment of the new economic opportunities that this could bring to Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The Republic of Azerbaijan and the Islamic Republic of Iran share a close cultural and historic bond. There is a close affinity between our peoples. I witnessed this at the Azerbaijan-Iran Business forum. Over recent years, the international sanctions have made it so that this strong cultural bond did not translate into strong trading relations. In 2014, bilateral trade between our two countries was only $186 million. This is well below the potential of our economic relationship. With the lifting of the international sanctions, we should see bilateral trade and investment reaching its natural level. The strategic location of Azerbaijan means it is a convenient base for foreign companies to access the large Iranian market through Baku. Iranian companies will also be able to access the CIS markets through Azerbaijan.</p><h4>Non-oil sector investments in agriculture, tourism, and service industries increased almost five times in 2015. With increased volatility in the oil sector, what role are non-oil sector investments playing in the growth of the country? </h4><p>Today, the main task of Azerbaijan is economic diversification. The development concept in “Azerbaijan 2020: The Vision of The Future" describes the objectives for the development of the non-oil sector in Azerbaijan. In 2015, progress was made toward this goal. While the GDP of the economy grew at 1.1%, the non-oil sector grew by 6.4%. Today the non-oil sector is about 70% of the economy. Our country has great natural resources for the development of non-oil sectors, particularly in agriculture and tourism. We have a wonderful climate and ancient history. We played an important role in the development of the Silk Road. Azerbaijan is a bridge between East and West, which gives us a good strategic location for international business. For years, foreign investors have put their investments in the oil sector of Azerbaijan, which has contributed to the growth of the country. Over the next years, I expect foreign investors to also play a similar role in the non-oil sectors. To maintain this growth of the non-oil sector, Azerbaijan is currently working to improve the investment climate in the country. One of the key functions of AZPROMO is to organize a dialogue between the public and private sectors. In this year especially, we need to find answers to the questions of improving business efficiency in our economy. This is important for the sustainable growth of the non-oil sectors of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Thus, non-oil sector investments are playing an important role in achieving balanced economic growth and stimulating competitiveness in the country. This is in line with the vision of our President.</p><h4>As new parliamentary elections recently took place in November of 2015, how does the continued tradition of stable governance in Azerbaijan assist in attracting FDI? </h4><p>Since independence, the government of Azerbaijan has recognized that investors prefer stability and certainty. The government knows that investors take a long-term perspective and require stability when making investment plans for the future. A stable political environment gives an investor some certainty that improvements in the business environment will not be chaotic and will be conducted in a manner that encourages the safety and security for the country, its citizens, and investors. Azerbaijan's stable international trading relations have given confidence to international companies and reduced their perception of risk and the costs of doing business. Azerbaijan maintains trade relations with over 160 countries, and has been involved in intensive trade relations with Italy, Turkey, the UK, Indonesia, Germany, the US, Russia, Israel, France, Japan, and many more. As a result, Azerbaijan has a good track record in attracting FDI in all sectors. Flows of FDI into Azerbaijan reached almost $50 billion from 2006 to 2015. Of course much of this was in the oil sector, but a substantial proportion was in the non-oil industries. Naturally, the world changes, and we cannot avoid change. We respond to change in a way that will maintain our stability. Since the fall in the oil price and subsequent devaluation of the manat, the country emphasized the need to accelerate structural reforms and to diversify its economy. Stability is required to make necessary improvements in the business environment, to expand the tax base, and to strengthen the banking system. We understand that investors require stability and a clear action plan to respond to the changing environment and economic challenges in the world.</p><h4>With Azerbaijan rapidly developing into a regional hub in many different respects, how does AZPROMO promote the country's exports on an international level?</h4><p>We know that Azerbaijan must have more companies becoming exporters and that our existing exporters must be exporting more. AZPROMO is developing a strategy to increase the promotion of non-oil exports on an international level. For companies that have never exported, we are developing programs and holding workshops to improve their understanding of export practices and procedures, international marketing, and sales disciplines. For example, receiving certifications and creating marketing plans will reduce the risks of exporting and increase the ability of companies to enter the challenging world of exporting. Also, for companies that do not have specialists in exporting activities, we help with the training of people, as well as in the creation of export departments. For our existing exporters, we assist them to export more in their existing markets by improving their understanding of the barriers to exports, such as improving the knowledge of foreign customs procedures and providing trade information. We assist them to export to new markets through the provision of market and sector specific research to identify prospective markets. We also assist them in the participation in international trade fairs and business forums to identify the right buyers. In foreign markets, we are seeking to increase the demand for Azerbaijani goods through the promotion of our national brands through attending exhibitions, advertising, and other international events. We believe this coordinated approach to exporting will assist in the promotion of Azerbaijani exports. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Ganja has been selected as the European Youth Capital for 2016. How has this been achieved and what activities will be conducted in this regard?</h4><p>On November 21, 2013, an authoritative international jury of the General Assembly of the European Youth Forum, the most prominent platform of youth organizations of the continent, passed the decision to declare the city of Ganja the European Youth Capital of 2016. Thus, during 2016, Ganja will be the focus of European youth. This will create opportunities to promote the history and culture of Azerbaijan, the traditions of multiculturalism and tolerance inherent in our society, and communicate the truth about Azerbaijan to the European public using the example of one city. At the moment, our city is preparing to host many international and local projects and activities. The Action Plan includes 43 projects (25 international and 18 local), and covers topics such as the elimination of unemployment among young people, the active participation of young people in society, volunteering, education, and social equality. The projects will mainly be carried out in the form of training, workshops, conferences, forums, exhibitions, and competitions. For the time being, the team of volunteers of the "Ganja-European Capital of Youth 2016" organization includes over 300 young people from all over the country. During the year, Ganja will host a number of activities of international and national significance: seminars and training courses on digital and social media, e-citizenry, first steps in volunteer activities, volunteering for the environment, youth camps for interreligious dialogue, and others. Job fairs for the youth and exhibitions of handwork items will be conducted as well. A variety of projects will be implemented, most of which will bring together young people from all over Europe. These include projects such as "Join the sport," "Ganja-a city dance," "European caravan to Azerbaijan through Georgia," "Thematic conventions on youth policies," "European voluntary service," "Social network for my city," "Activation of specialized school No. 45 of Ganja for disadvantaged children," "Women leaders," "A living library," "A culinary fair," "Model of secondary education for the youth of European capitals," "Models for studying human rights in secondary school," "Social entrepreneurship," the "European youth award," "Youth career bus career," and more. There will also be other projects of relevant ministries, the Youth Fund, as well as local and international youth organizations. In addition, the city will play host to the European Youth Festival, the International Festival of Youth Conventions and Relations, the European experience of volunteering in the Caucasus region, the "Story of volunteering," the First Ganja forum for young researchers, the International Conference of the Youth Research Fund, the Fine Art International Exhibition, an international marathon competition, the international “Europe and Ganja: a crossroads of cultures," festival, and more. I think that all of this will contribute to the further development of Ganja and raise the credibility of our country as a whole.</p><h4>As the host of an international airport, how does Ganja work with different airlines for the development of tourism?</h4><p>On the initiative of President Ilham Aliyev, a modern international airport was built in Ganja in 2006. It can receive aircraft of all makes and sizes, including multi-ton cargo planes. Using these opportunities, different foreign airlines operate regular and charter flights with a stopover in Ganja. This creates favorable conditions for the many tourists traveling to and through Ganja. This not only contributes to the development of tourism, but also enables the guests of Azerbaijan to get acquainted with our country in Ganja.</p><h4>There are different companies operating in different spheres of life in Ganja. As we know from the state program on the development of districts, there are plans to set up a technology park in Ganja. How will that benefit the city?</h4><p>Indeed, Ganja is one of the biggest industrial centers in Azerbaijan, where textiles, food, metallurgy, engineering, and other industries have developed for years. Over the last five years, industry has grown 3.3 fold. The gross domestic product of Ganja has doubled over this period. This is excellent performance. The state program on the development of districts envisages the establishment of a major technology park in Ganja. It will be set up with Det.Al Aluminum in mind and a future steel plant. The Executive Authority of the city has already allocated land for that. The commissioning of the technology park will lead to the creation of hundreds of jobs, which, in turn, will improve the wellbeing of thousands of households and fetch additional revenues for the city budget. There are also plans to resume the operation of one of the largest industrial centers of the city: the Alumina Company, which will offer 1,200-1,500 jobs to those living in and around Ganja.</p><h4>How does Ganja benefit from the inaugural European Games held in Azerbaijan last year and the forthcoming European Grand Prix and other international events?</h4><p>As evidenced by the First European Games held in Baku, numerous tourists and fans not only watched sporting events, but also traveled to Ganja to pay tribute to the great Nizami Ganjavi, who is known far beyond the borders of our country. At the beginning of this year, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, during a visit to our city, inaugurated Imamzade, a major religious and cultural complex that represents a valuable monument of the entire Muslim world. All this, as well as the 4,000-year history of Ganja proper and its numerous architectural, historical, and cultural monuments have always attracted, and I am sure will continue to attract, even more tourists attending various international events in Azerbaijan. I am sure that participants and fans of Formula One and other upcoming international conferences and festivals will also travel to our city. As a result, Ganja is getting closer to the world.</p><h4>How does Ganja influence the development of the Azerbaijani regions?</h4><p>First of all, I should note that Ganja is the center of the western region of the country, which is the biggest region in Azerbaijan. At the same time, it is one of the major industrial centers. The city is a concentration of enterprises producing aluminum and steel, automobiles, textiles, and food and employs not only the people of Ganja, but also residents of surrounding districts. In addition, Ganja is an educational and scientific center in the field of agriculture. This is where the Azerbaijan State Agrarian University is located. Its graduates now work in the Ministry of Agriculture, various research, agricultural, and technological institutes, as well as farms across Azerbaijan. Also, Ganja is a major medical and educational city in the western region: we have three universities, four colleges, and several regional specialized medical centers.</p><h4>What are your objectives for 2016?</h4><p>Today, we are implementing activities according to President Ilham Aliyev's strategy that "the development of the country depends on the development of entrepreneurship." It aims to improve the business environment in the country. As part of the state program on the socioeconomic development of Azerbaijani districts in 2014-2018, all conditions are being created in the city to develop private enterprise, create social and infrastructure facilities, and increase investment in business development. In 2016, the city will complete a number of projects. The religious complex Imamzade, the Park Bulvar center, a housing compound comprised of 14 high-rise buildings, a student campus of the Azerbaijan State Agrarian University, a major city hospital named after Abbas Sahhat, and other facilities have already been commissioned. This year we embarked on the construction of the Ganja State Philharmonic Hall, a seven-storey hotel called Majestic in the city center, and a shopping center covering a large area, and the reconstruction of the Caravanserai hotel complex built in the seventh century. Work is under way on the construction of schools, kindergartens, and other social facilities. Also this year we will celebrate the 875th birthday anniversary of the great Azerbaijani poet and thinker Nizami Ganjavi. During the year, more than 5,000 people will visit Ganja from abroad. The main objective of the Executive Authority is to expand on the progress made in the socioeconomic life of the city, facilitate the sustainable and consistent development of Ganja, and further improve the lives of our people. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>As Azerbaijan experiences some domestic economic difficulties, what are the pillars of Azerbaijan's foreign policy that support the country on an international level?</h4><p>Over the years, the foreign economic policy of the Republic of Azerbaijan has been guided by five pillars, namely strengthening trans-regional energy, ICT, and transport connectivity, attracting FDI, and the preservation of economic security, effectively integrating local SMEs into global value chains and increasing the exports of national competitive products to foreign strategic markets. By acknowledging the role of international trade in achieving sustainable, balanced, and robust growth, our national development strategy is based on the improvement of trade legislation, trade facilitation, simplification of customs procedures, expansion of bilateral, regional, and multilateral cooperation, the diversification of our export structure, and the promotion of non-oil exports. We are working on developing a policy that facilitates trade, simplifies non-tariff barriers, and increases the competitiveness of local SMEs. Recognizing the importance of trade facilitation, we have recently established the Transit Cargo Coordination Council to elaborate a uniform, efficient, and transparent tariff policy in rail and maritime cargo transportation and to facilitate the process of cargo shipping. We believe that these measures will significantly contribute to boosting trans-regional trade. During the past 10 years, the number of our trading partners reached 150, we signed more than 60 bilateral trade and economic partnership agreements, the country's external trade increased by 4.3 times, including six fold in exports, and by 2.6 times in imports. Over the past decade, the poverty rate has declined in Azerbaijan from 50% in 2001 to 5% in 2015. Our unemployment rate today stands at 4.9%. Azerbaijan is implementing a number of industry and trade-related measures aimed at promoting a more favorable environment for local and foreign businessmen. In 2015, we registered a positive economic performance and economic growth in the non-oil sector stood at 8.4%. </p><h4>In your address to the UN General Assembly in September 2015, you spoke about Azerbaijan in the context of the global economy. How has Azerbaijan's role in the international arena expanded as a result of transnational pipelines and other infrastructure projects like TASIM and the BTK railway?</h4><p>Integration in the global economy has been at the core of Azerbaijan's foreign economic policy. Azerbaijan is committed and is currently the only country producing for the establishment of the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC), which will play substantial role in the diversification of natural gas suppliers to Europe. Two important projects, the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), are now being implemented within the framework of the SGC, which has the potential to meet up to 20% of Europe's gas needs in the future. Energy infrastructure projects have significantly strengthened Azerbaijan's relationship with our close partners and intensified the regional cooperation with Turkey and Georgia, which has yielded remarkable results in other fields as well. Azerbaijan also actively participates in the advancement of important transcontinental transport corridors by investing in the transport infrastructure projects, such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway and the New Baku International Sea Port. The BTK railroad, which is expected to be commissioned by the end of 2016 or early 2017, is designed to enhance the transit capacity of Azerbaijan and increase trade flows across the region. The BTK railway will be another step in positioning the South Caucasus as a major transit route between Europe and Asia. In addition, Azerbaijan has initiated the Trans-Eurasian Information Super Highway (TASIM) as a major regional initiative aimed at the creation of a transnational fiber-optic backbone, targeting primarily the countries of Eurasia from Western Europe to Eastern Asia. This project envisages building a major new transit route from Frankfurt to Hong Kong, contributing to the creation of an open information society, increasing internet speed, and developing new internet services. Azerbaijan has been continuously proactive in its promotion of equal and mutually beneficial cooperation among partner countries by initiating and supporting all potential projects aimed at the development of not only Azerbaijan, but the wider region as well.</p><h4>With the current tension between Russia and Turkey, how important is it to Azerbaijan to maintain strong relations with both countries?</h4><p>Relations are being dynamically developed in almost all fields of cooperation with both Turkey and Russia, and Azerbaijan places a particular emphasis on deepening its ties with both countries. Azerbaijan's relationship with Turkey, as a strategic ally, and with Russia, as a strategic partner, has historic roots and the volume of signed documents, as well as regular mutual visits, is further proof of strong relations. Regrettably, the fighter jet incident has negatively affected the relations between the two countries. The current state of the relationship between Russia and Turkey is in no way desirable for Azerbaijan. Needless to say, both Turkey and Russia play an important role in maintaining the security and stability in the South Caucasus region and beyond. Azerbaijan remains interested in enhancing its relationship with both countries by all possible means. We hope that, as a result of joint efforts, the relations between Turkey and Russia will be normalized through dialogue and mutual understanding.</p><h4>Following your visit to Panama and Costa Rica's announcement to open an embassy in Azerbaijan, how would you characterize Azerbaijan's relations with Central America?</h4><p>The development of relations with Central America, and in a broader context Latin America, is of significant importance to Azerbaijan's foreign policy. The political relations with Central and Latin American countries have been rapidly developing over the last few years. Cuba, Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, and Mexico have recently opened their embassies in Azerbaijan. Along with our embassies in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Cuba, we have recently established diplomatic missions in Columbia, Peru, Uruguay, and Chile. Further proof of good political relations, Azerbaijan obtained large support from Latin American countries when it became a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. My visit to Panama, the visit of Costa Rica's Foreign Minister, the visits from Deputy Foreign Ministers of Argentina and Uruguay last year, and the announcement by Costa Rica to establish an embassy in Azerbaijan are all vivid examples of the intensification of relations between Azerbaijan and the countries of the region. Trade and economic cooperation are paramount in our relations. The trade turnover between Azerbaijan and Latin American countries was approximately $300 million in 2014. Azerbaijan will continue to work closely with its Latin and Central American partners toward the further promotion of friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation.</p><h4>How does hosting large-scale international events like the Formula One Grand Prix help advance Azerbaijan in the international arena?</h4><p>We consider our country's cultural diversity as a strength and advantage, which gives us ample opportunity to contribute to the promotion of intercultural dialogue and understanding. Sport plays a vital role in this respect, uniting people and countries. More than 300 international sport events have been held in Azerbaijan in the last 12 years. In 2015, Azerbaijan successfully hosted the First European Games and we earned 56 medals in total, finishing in second place after Russia. These games, as well as the IV Islamic Solidarity Games, which will be held in Baku in May 2017, demonstrate Azerbaijan's promotion of the ideas of cultural diversity, tolerance, and peace as the universal principles of sport. It is not a coincidence that our country was selected as a host for the next Formula One Grand Prix. We are proud of hosting such a prestigious tournament and will do our best to ensure it is organized and conducted at the highest level. We hope that the race participants, guests, and tourists will be able to familiarize themselves with our beautiful country, its ancient culture, history, and tradition, and enjoy our hospitality. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>Baku has become a favourable platform for discussion of significant issues happening in the world and in the region, Nizami Ganjavi International Center transformed into a world scale international institution. The guests who participate at the forum contribute with their valuable thoughts and ideas to the cause of peace, security, predictability in the world. I think that every international forum, its level mainly depends on the list of participants. We have among our guests more than 50 acting and former heads of state and government, prominent politicians, public figures, experts. </p><p>The situation in the world has changed over the past year. We have all witnessed that and, unfortunately, the changes are not in the positive direction. The world didn't become more safe and secure. On the contrary, it became more dangerous. The situation in our region also changed dramatically. Existing conflicts still remain unresolved. But we have now new conflicts, new areas of confrontation and threats. Therefore, I think that our main goal is to play our role as countries, as governments, and as politicians, in order is to try to reduce the tensions, in order to try to create the grounds for cooperation, mutual understanding, and mutual respect. Otherwise, the situation will continue to deteriorate.</p><p>The situation in the Middle East, situation in parts of Europe, and refugee crisis - these are all realities of the recent years. Therefore, I think one of the main objectives of the 4th Global Baku Forum is to address these issues. Especially, taking into account the level of participants and their contribution to the world affairs, their experience, knowledge, that may help to find a way out from the existing situation.</p><p>We are all united in one objective to promote cooperation, mutual understanding, stability, and peace because we are all inter-related. Sometimes it may seem that the dangerous events we see on TV are happening on another planet. But it is just next door. And the crisis of refugees showed that we are all inter-related and every action, every step, and every interference in internal affairs of other countries will definitely result in difficulties for those who interfere. </p><p>So, I think, that is the main lesson of today's reality. We all need to respect each other; we need to respect our choice, our territorial integrity, and our plans for the future. We all need to interact because the main goal is to reduce tensions and diminish existing threats. </p><p>This year, in 2016, Azerbaijan will celebrate the 25th anniversary Anniversary of its independence. In the early years of independence, we suffered from a civil war, from a humanitarian crisis, from occupation, aggression, economic difficulties, and actually economic collapse. Azerbaijan became a target for terrorist attacks. Armenian terrorist organizations committed numerous acts of terror against civilians in the beginning of 1990s. The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, unfortunately, is has not been not resolved.</p><p>Azerbaijan achieved a lot of success during the years of independence, and today is developing as a modern, stable, predictable, and self-sufficient country. However, the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict still needs to be resolved. It needs to be resolved in order to allow a million refugees of Azerbaijan to return to their homes, needs to be resolved as well as to stop the violence and establish peace in our region because without that all the countries will suffer. Armenia, which continues to occupy illegally the historical and legal part of Azerbaijan, did not benefit from that. The economic difficulties, isolation, migration, poverty are the result of that aggression and occupation. Nagorno-Karabakh is a historic part of Azerbaijan, legal part of Azerbaijan. All international community recognizes Nagorno-Karabakh as an integral part of Azerbaijan. As a result of the conflict one 1 million Azerbaijanis became refugees and internally displaced persons. We were a subject of ethnic cleansing, while the, occupation of almost 20% percent of our territory continues. International organizations, particularly the UN and its Security Council, adopted numerous resolutions demanding unconditional and immediate withdrawal of Armenian troops from the territories of Azerbaijan. Unfortunately, these resolutions are not resolved, they are not implemented.</p><p>Of course, the mechanism of implementation of resolutions of Security Council of United Nationsthe UN, I think, should be also a special topic of discussions. In some cases, resolutions of Security Council are being implemented within hours or days. But in our case it is more than twenty 20 years that the resolutions of the UN Security Council have not been implemented. That shows that there is a lack of political will, especially of those countries which that have adopted these resolutions.</p><p>Today, the negotiation process continues without any successand the main reason for that is that Armenia doesn't want peace. They want to keep occupied territories under their illegal control, they want to keep status quo unchanged. But this is not possible, status quo must be changed and the countries which are chairing the negotiation process—the three permanent members of United Nations Security Council—on numerous occasions have publicly spoken about that, saying that status quo is unacceptable and must be changed. To change the status quo, Armenia needs to leave the occupied territories. In the 21st century Century, it is absolutely abnormal from all points of view—political, legal, and humanitarian—to occupy illegally the territory of a neighboring country and block the negotiation process.</p><p>Everything is destroyed on the occupied territories. OSCE has sent twice sent a fact-finding and field assistance mission to the occupied territories and they reflected the real situation, and we know that. All our historic monuments, graves, our mosques are have been destroyed. Today, we have many TV reports about the destruction of historic monuments in the Middle East. Twenty years ago, the same happened in occupied territories of Azerbaijan. The difference is that at that time international community and media didn't pay attention to or probably didn't have access to that information. But it's the same;. The the same story, and the same approach. And this is dangerous,dangerous; this is dangerous for the future peace and security in the region because if the aggressor is not punished, then they will plan another scenario.</p><p>Despite this situation and also humanitarian crisis which we faced in the beginning of 1990s, Azerbaijan successfully develops. By the way, we had the highest per capita number of refugees at that time. One million people became refugees and internally displaced on their own land. At that time, the population of Azerbaijan was something more than eight 8 million. So we know how to deal with humanitarian crisis.</p><p>At that time Azerbaijan was different from today's Azerbaijan. It was a very poor country, just a newly-independent state, its economy was ruined, and industry had collapsed. There were no prospects for the future. So our main goal was to establish a state, to create a strong economy, to open the country for foreign investments and to become part of world market economy.</p><p>And that happened. Today,  the country is stable, and we continue reforms. Political and, economic reforms go in Azerbaijan in parallel, while all the fundamental freedoms are provided—freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, religious freedom, and media freedom;, we have free internet and, no censorship for almost 20 years and with more than 70% percent of our citizens are internet users. Political freedoms are supported by economic reforms.</p><p>We were among the countries which received one of the biggest amount of per capita direct foreign investments primarily into oil and gas sector. Now our goal is to attract investors to non-oil and gas sector. Reduction of dependence on oil and gas was part of our reforms. As a result of these reforms today oil and gas makes only something more than 30% percent of our GDP and about half of our budget revenues. So the target is to completely reduce dependence on oil and gas. For Azerbaijan the post oil period already started. Not because we reduced the production but because the price of oil collapsed four times. Therefore, it is absolutely new situation. No country in the world was prepared for that. Nobody could even imagine that it will be so dramatic and the oil prices will fall four times. And it happened within one year. So we had to work very actively and efficiently in order to reduce negative impacts of this situation. Now our financial situation is again stable, predictable. Our budget is based on the price of oil of $25 dollars per barrel, which is a kind of a guarantee from any kind of economic complications. We have a substantial amount of reserves in our oil fund and that allows us to find a way out from this situation with minimum risk.</p><p>At the same time, this situation forces us to be more efficient with reforms., and theA big package of reforms have, which is already introduced, by the way, which have been is supported by the International Monetary Fund. We are dealing now mainly with the issues of diversification of economy, finding the new areas of economic development. One of them is transportation infrastructure. We already work in this area for many years, but it is new for international community. We are building the transportation network, which will allow Azerbaijan to have a strong position in this region in the future. </p><p>Our geographical position is very preferable. So investments in transportation infrastructure including railroads, airports, and seaports allow us to be a crossroad of transportation infrastructure. The East-West transportation corridor has already started to work, and hopefully this year we will finalize the connection of railroads between Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. Thus Europe and Asia will have a new, the shortest transportation route. The first container train from China to Europe already passed through Azerbaijan. This is a new Silkroad with a modern infrastructure, and we made a proposal to our partners to have single tariffs in transportation in order to make this route attractive.</p><p>Another transportation route which that we are actively working on with our neighbors and partners is North-South transportation route. This will allow cargos to be transported from Pakistan, India, Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia, Northern Europe. Azerbaijan is investing in the modern infrastructure and hopefully very soon this route also will be in operation. So all these routes are crossing our territory and, of course, this increases the geopolitical importance of our country. This will generate additional revenues, which we will use for development of our country in the future.</p><p>Of course, energy sector remains very important for our economy and now more important for energy security. On February 29, 2016, we had in Baku the second meeting of the Advisory Council of the Southern Gas Corridor, which we call a project of the 21st Century. It is a mega project, one of the biggest infrastructure and energy projects in Europe initiated by Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan plays a leading role in that project as the initiator, organizer, and investor. This is a project of $45 billion dollar investment. We established a strong team of countries and companies.</p><p>The purpose of having this Advisory Council was to coordinate our efforts and to meet the targets of implementation of this project because it will be implemented in stages. Southern Gas Corridor is a project of four elements. That will allow us to connect Baku and Italian ports with a 3,500 km long pipeline.<br>Of course, it's it is a huge investment and at the same time this project needs coordination. So on February 29, eleven countries plus European Commission signed a declaration, which underlines the key and strategic role of Azerbaijan as a main enabler of the implementation of the Southern Gas Corridor. We really established a team of countries. I will name the countries in accordance with the route of the pipeline: Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, and Italy are members of the Southern Gas Corridor project. We have two more signatories to the declaration—Croatia and Montenegro, which, I am sure, will join the team in coming years, and also the high representatives of the governments of the US and the UK and the vice-president of European Commission. So we have 12 signatories, which actually shows that the Southern Gas Corridor is already a reality.</p><p>This is a project of energy security, energy diversification, and free competition. I think this is how energy projects should be implemented. Our main goal is to implement the project and to treat it as a commercial project. Sometimes issues related to energy security are too much politicized and we are against of that. Politics and energy should be separated. Energy should not be used as a political tool. At the same time, political instruments interfering into the business development also sometimes create complications.<br>Therefore, for Azerbaijan this is a project allowing to be able for decades ahead to explore its natural resources to diversified markets. For Europe, it means an additional source of gas, which Europe will need, because we all need the demand of European consumers. Though today, we see the economic difficulties in the world, and this is temporary. The price of oil will not remain at this low level. Economic growth will generate activities. Therefore, the demand for natural gas in Europe will only grow. And there will be enough room for everyone. I think that the producers also need to coordinate their efforts in order to avoid unnecessary competition because producers have their own goals and consumers have their own goals.</p><p>I think that in the project of Southern Gas Corridor we managed to provide the balance between producers, transit countries and consumers. So it's a win-win situation. That's why it develops successfully. To implement such a huge project with so many participants in a short period of time, at a time when the oil price is down and you have to spend billions, is a serious challenge. Energy security will definitely dominate the political agenda. I think the example which we show in the Southern Gas Corridor demonstrates that when energy and politics are separated you can achieve success.</p><p>This year is a year of multiculturalism in Azerbaijan. For centuries people of different nationalities, ethnic roots, and religions have lived in Azerbaijan in peace and dignity. We are proud that during the years of independence these positive tendencies became only stronger. Multiculturalism, religious tolerance is a state policy in Azerbaijan. And at the same time, this is a reflection of the mood of the society. And that's important because the state policy and general atmosphere in Azerbaijan in this respect is not different. <br>In 2008, we launched Baku process when we invited the ministers of culture of members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to participate at the meeting of the ministers of culture of members of the Council of Europe for the first time. Now, Baku process became a reality. We organize numerous events in Azerbaijan, promoting the values of multiculturalism—World Religious Leaders' Summit and, several International Humanitarian and Intercultural Dialogue forums. In a month, this April 2016, we will hosted the 7th Global Forum of Alliance of Civilizations organized by UN.</p><p>Azerbaijan's experience in this area is highly appreciated by leading international organizations, international community, and it demonstrates that multiculturalism is alive, it has a future. But politicians, those who can influence on public opinion, including media representatives must be more responsible. Of course, I think that the role of the media in this respect must be more positive because unfortunately, what we see in the news mainly is pictures of confrontation, refugee crisis and difficulties in that regard.</p><p>This leads only to alienation. We cannot afford alienation because we are all interconnected, we are all living on the same planet and the distance between Europe and the Middle East as we all see is not very far. And even if it is far, it does not prevent people from finding or trying to find shelter and save their lives and, lives of their families. Therefore, I think concentration on the positive examples of multiculturalism and promotion of these values will help all of us because no country, no nation can live in isolation. We are all interconnected. Absolute majority of the countries of the world have multi-ethnic, multi-religious population. We must be proud of that.<br>In early 2016, we were celebrating the inauguration of Imamzade religious and historic monument after restoration, renovation, and new construction. It is one of the sacred places in the Muslim World, which situated in Ganja, the motherland of Nizami Ganjavi, and which a place Azerbaijani people have protected since the 8th Century. The new mosque was build built there, and I invited all representatives from all the regions of Azerbaijan and at that ceremony along with myself other speakers were leaders of traditional religions of Azerbaijan, including the leaders of Azerbaijani Muslims, the leader of Azerbaijani-Russian Orthodox Church, the leader of Azerbaijani-Jewish community, and leader ofthe Catholic Church. They not only participated, but spoke in front of the audience. Then, we jointly moved into the newly-built mosque, and were there together. This is how it works in our country. That was a message to our society, that was a message to our people, and that was a message to our the world.</p><p>A couple of months earlier, in one of the biggest mosques of Azerbaijan, Shia and Sunni Muslims prayed together. It was named a Unity Namaz (Prayer) for the first time. This also demonstrates the real situation here, where there is no distinction neither inside the Muslim community, nor inside our society. And this is a reality of Azerbaijan, this is probably one of our biggest assets and this is a main guarantee for successful development because without this consensus, without unity we cannot achieve success. And we want to achieve more success, we want to continue to modernize our country and only based on these common values of friendship, multiculturalism, we can achieve that.</p><p>Last year, in 2015, Azerbaijan hosted the inaugural European Games, in 2012 we hosted Eurovision Song contest, and Baku was announced the capital of Islamic culture and next year we will host Islamic Solidarity Games. Azerbaijan is a member of Council of Europe, member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. It is a bridge between cultures, between traditions, between religions. This is our responsibility. We play this role first of all in order to ensure successful development of our country and also in order to create most stable and predictable situation in the region. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>SOFAZ recently announced changes in the structure of its portfolio, allowing more investments in equities and real estate, for example. How will this structural change offer new benefits to SOFAZ?</h4><p>We are constantly reviewing our investment strategy in line with the risk/return profile of our stakeholders to further optimize our investment portfolio and increase the Fund's long-term returns. We have substantially increased our equity (both private and public equities) and real estate allocation to 15% and 10%, respectively. In public equities, we will continue our passive management strategy by replicating well diversified global indexes both in-house and through our external managers. In private equities, in addition to our IFC asset management investments, we are plan</p><p>ning to further expand our investment universe by adding new funds allocated to new geographies and different strategies. As for real estate, since 2012 we have managed to build up a portfolio made up of prime commercial properties in key gateway cities of Europe and Asia Pacific, in excess of $1.5 billion. Going forward, our plan is to build around this core portfolio by focusing on diversifying across various sectors, geographies, as well as different investment styles. This includes new sectors such as hospitality, logistics, and other alternative real estate and value-adding investment strategies.</p><h4>SOFAZ recently sold $200 million on the FX market in Azerbaijan to local banks. How does selling foreign currency fit into your strategy to improve the domestic financial market of the country?</h4><p>The main rationale behind the creation of SOFAZ has always been two-fold: the preservation of macroeconomic stability and the transformation of finite hydrocarbon reserves into financial assets able to generate perpetual income for current and future generations. As such, currency intervention is not part of our objectives. The goal of our FX operations in the local market is to obtain a sufficient amount of manat to cover the fund's total expenditures, which includes state budget transfers, direct project financing, and administrative costs. During previous years, SOFAZ was conducting local foreign exchange operations with the domestic commercial banks; however, starting from the beginning of 2016 this has been carried out in auctions conducted by the Central Bank. SOFAZ contributes to the development of the domestic financial markets mainly through bringing world class asset management principles and practices into the country and by creating an environment for the development of the local asset management industry. </p><h4>Since 2001, SOFAZ has invested in improving the social conditions of refugees and internally displaced persons. As the 15th anniversary of starting this project, how do you assess the progress you have made in this field? </h4><p>The territorial integrity of Azerbaijan was violated during the Armenian-Azerbaijani Nagorno Karabakh conflict and 20% of Azerbaijani lands, in particular Nagorno Karabakh and seven adjacent regions, were occupied by Armenian forces. As a result of this aggression, more than 1 million Azerbaijani citizens have been expelled from their homes and forced to move to other cities and regions in Azerbaijan. Since 2001, SOFAZ has been allocating money for building housing and improving the socio-economic conditions of the refugees and internally displaced persons in many regions of Azerbaijan. These financial resources were used to build 154 buildings, more than 30,000 houses, 132 schools, music schools, and kindergartens, 54 hospitals, primary healthcare units, ambulance and medical stations, 108 community clubs, and administrative buildings in order to settle refugees and internally displaced persons in the different regions of the country. More than 30,000 families, equivalent to more than 126,000 citizens, were settled in these houses. In the 2001-2015 period, SOFAZ allocated AZN1.903 billion to this project. As a consequence of the realization of this project, a large amount of jobs were created in the different regions of Azerbaijan, playing an important role in decreasing the poverty indicator from 46.7% to 5% in the last 15 years. The main achievement of this project was the substantial improvement of the standard of living of refugees and internally displaced persons and their full integration into society.</p><h4>Parliamentary elections took place in November of 2015. As SOFAZ frequently works with parliament on budgeting issues, what are your expectations moving forward?</h4><p>As the custodian of national wealth, we pride ourselves on our transparency and accountability. Our interaction with parliament is one of the most important avenues for our dialogue with the Fund's stakeholders. Manifestations of this dialogue include the representation of the Vice-Speaker of the Parliament in the Supervisory Board of SOFAZ and the active participation of the parliament in approving the Fund's budget, which is an integral part of the state budget. Furthermore, our accounts are regularly scrutinized by the Parliamentary Chamber of Accounts. We are very much looking forward to working closely with the newly elected parliament on any matters related to our activities.</p><h4>With the success of the First European Games last year, what kinds of new investment opportunities will the Formula 1 Grand Prix event bring to Baku? </h4><p>In preparation for the First European Games held in Baku last year, we substantially upgraded our infrastructure, which allowed us to organize the world class event and put Azerbaijan once again on the global map. Hosting a widely watched and popular sport tournament such as the Formula One Grand Prix will be another good opportunity to promote the country, which will have a positive impact on the domestic economy. With millions of TV viewers across the world, the Formula One Grand Prix will generate longer-term benefits for the country, such as business linkages, foreign investment, and community involvement.</p><h4>Given the economic turbulence prevalent in the international economy with regards to the oil and gas market, what is your outlook for the year 2016?</h4><p>The plunge of oil prices since the second half of 2014 is mainly explained by global supply and demand conditions. A surplus in oil supply is caused by an increased share of unconventional energy resources, such as shale oil, shale gas, and oil sands in the global oil supply. Furthermore, OPEC, which controls nearly 40% of the world market, has failed to reach an agreement in production curbs, further exacerbating the situation. On the demand side, fears in the global economy, primarily in emerging economies, have been the main drivers of the decline in prices. In addition, the surging US dollar has also played a role in this process. It is difficult to precisely forecast the price level, however recent trends, including the return of Iranian oil to the market, makes us to believe that the price will stay under $50 per barrel in the medium term. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<url><![CDATA[excellent-friendly]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the current pillars that characterize the economic relations between the two countries?</h4><p>Bilateral relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Azerbaijan are excellent and friendly. Over the past six years, our cooperation has expanded in many fields, especially in economic relations. I cherish the memory of the friendship and warm hospitality extended to me during my official visit to Azerbaijan in October 2012 and I look forward to hosting President Aliyev in an official visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a direct result of our discussion, in 2014 Azerbaijan invested ‚¬40 million in the construction of a plant for the processing of fruits and vegetables in the city of Doboj in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which will be opened this year and provide direct employment for 300 workers and engage around 1,000 subcontractors. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Azerbaijan have concluded many important bilateral agreements with the aim of further strengthening and developing our relations. I would like to emphasize the agreement for the avoidance of double taxation, as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina's decision to lift visa requirements for Azerbaijani citizens. Negotiations on the agreement on trade and economic cooperation between Azerbaijan and Bosnia and Herzegovina are under way, and I am confident that this mutually beneficial agreement will be concluded soon, paving the path for further expansion of our economic relations. The recently concluded bilateral agreement on cooperation in the field of education provides a good framework for exchanges between educational institutions in our countries and, combined with our visa-free regime for Azerbaijani citizens, presents opportunities to Azerbaijani students to study at public and private universities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p><h4>Bosnia and Herzegovina has lifted its visa requirements for Azerbaijani travelers. How would you assess the current level of tourism between the two countries?</h4><p>The current level of tourism between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Azerbaijan is low, but has great potential for growth, especially considering the friendly relations between our countries and the visa-free regime for Azerbaijani citizens. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Azerbaijan are very attractive tourist destinations. Bosnia and Herzegovina has recently been ranked as the world's sixth-fastest growing tourist destination, with a 28% increase in the number of visitors each year according to the United Nations World Travel Organization. Our capital city, Sarajevo, had over a million recorded overnight stays last year. We have to do more to promote our mutual tourist offers to our citizens. Tourism is not only about the travel industry, holiday, or leisure, but also about knowing each other better and about meeting each other more often. It is about sharing our values. Bosnia and Herzegovina offers not only pristine nature and breathtaking views, but also many valuable lessons in history and culture.</p><h4>In which areas of trade between the two countries do you identify as having the most potential for future growth?</h4><p>Bosnia and Herzegovina is centrally located and our proximity and good connectivity via road, rail, air, and sea gives us direct access to the EU market. Bosnia and Herzegovina also offers distinctive investment and business opportunities across a variety of sectors, especially in transport infrastructure, energy, agriculture, wood processing, and tourism. Our government has an ambitious plan for transport infrastructure development across the country, including hundreds of kilometers of motorways, railroads, bridges, tunnels, and river ports, all of which present an excellent opportunity for construction companies from Azerbaijan. We have a long tradition in mining, metal processing, forestry, and automotive industries. Our labor force is highly skilled with competitive wage levels. Our administration has been creating a more favorable climate for FDI by conducting an accelerated economic reform process over the past years. Foreign investors in Bosnia and Herzegovina now have the same rights as the residents of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are open and ready for business, and I cordially invite Azerbaijani companies to take advantage of the lucrative opportunities our country offers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sharjah Media Centre (SMC) is adapting to the Emirate's rapid evolution. What are the main new developments at the Centre?</h4><p>The government established SMC five years ago. Today, it has emerged as a single-window, unique platform that anyone could approach to know anything and everything about Sharjah, its government, institutions, the economy, government procedures, media, education, history, landmarks, or any other area. We have branded the Centre with a new logo and have a team of more than 100 qualified, well-trained professionals. We are also constantly looking to empower our staff by providing them with training and new skills so that they give their best in serving the Centre. We are in touch with other contact centres in the UAE and the region to help us with this. The Centre is also responsible for the PR and media coverage of His Highness the Ruler of Sharjah, both in the UAE and abroad. We have a dedicated social media account for the Ruler covering all of his events and engagements. In 2014, His Highness the Ruler of Sharjah inaugurated Al Majaz Amphitheatre, on an island created in the heart of the picturesque Khalid Lagoon. Al Majaz Amphitheatre also functions under the Centre and we hold a lot of our activities, cultural events, and world-class music concerts at Al Majaz, especially from September to May. We hosted the closing ceremony of the recent International Government Communication Forum (IGCF) at the Amphitheatre. FunFest, a 14-day sports festival for families, was also held there. With such events, we get to maximize the number of people using the Amphitheatre and they, in return, get to enjoy the facility and its impressive architecture. During the holy month of Ramadan, we organize the hugely popular Ramadan Majlis, involving a number of interesting sessions on culture, sports, media, and social media. We are currently working on the 2016 program. By the way, the Centre also runs the Sharjah Events website <a href="http://www.sharjahevents.ae">www.sharjahevents.ae</a> using an app to showcase all the interesting activities, events, and happenings in the Emirate. We also act as the official media arm and spokesperson of the Sharjah government, and help with press and media interaction of its various departments. The Centre also hosts the Sharjah Press Club, which offers numerous facilities and services to members of media fraternity in the Emirate.</p><h4>The Sharjah Media Center is the media arm of the government of Sharjah, and aims to promote the Emirate. How is the Centre working to achieve that?</h4><p>We have built a good and rewarding relationship with other government departments and agencies in the Emirate and are constantly working with them toward the objective of acting as the media arm and platform of the government. For example, we liaise with the Sharjah Commerce and Tourism Development Authority to publish various statistics about the industry, such as the Emirate's tourist numbers and museum visitor data. If the number of tourists visiting a particular area or attraction is seen as dwindling, then the Centre could focus on promoting it. We also showcase Sharjah and its journey of excellence and progress by sending out media releases to targeted markets overseas, from time to time. Of course, we are constantly working to strengthen our partnership with other stakeholders and present a positive image of the Emirate through our media interaction. Since the inception of the Centre, especially with the launch of the IGCF, which is attended by more than 2,000 world leaders and media personalities, there has been a clear, positive, and perceptible improvement in the way Sharjah is seen around the world and across the region. Sharjah 24 <a href="http://www.sharjah24.ae">www.sharjah24.ae</a>, which is the official news website for Sharjah, is also part of the Centre, keeping an eye on and reporting all that is happening across the UAE, the region, and the world in current affairs, politics, arts, and culture. The website is in Arabic and we are now working on its English version. Later, we may think about serving in other languages as well.</p><h4>This year Sharjah hosted the 5th International Government Communication Forum with the slogan “Citizens for Prosperity." What were the main highlights of this year and how would you rate its results?</h4><p>The IGCF is all about enhancing government communication and this year we focused on improving communication from the citizen to the government. As His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasemi, Member of Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, said in his opening address at the 2015 edition of the Forum, communication needs to be two-way, not just one way, from the government to the people. As part of this theme, we discussed various aspects of communication involving government and people, including in areas as different as aviation and culture, with experienced speakers from both the public and private sectors running the sessions.</p><h4>What are your priorities and goals for 2016?</h4><p>Every year we set ourselves certain objectives and activities that are aimed at supporting and working with other government departments. We need to take the next step now and have one centralized media entity in Sharjah. We are planning to meet with every media team of every government department at least every three months to see what their problems and concerns are and how to address them. We are working to produce one coordinated media calendar for Sharjah. We need to streamline the system. We also need to improve our call center so that it is open and accessible 24 hours. We need to make the Press Club more attractive and accessible to journalists as well by providing more services and benefits. We also need to expand the scope of the Ruler's PR and media coverage beyond Arabic and English to other languages, especially when he travels abroad.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company expanded from distribution services into manufacturing cargo and catering trucks?</h4><p>As a seller of trucks in the northeast of Thailand, we figured that it was difficult to meet the needs of our customers because there were no factories offering cargo bodies in this region. Therefore, my father decided to offer the cargo body. While I was growing up in Thailand, cargo bodies were often just a wooden box or a basic steel body, sometimes even a small cement trailer. Today, we have developed a number of new products, catering to several industries and sectors around the world. To illustrate, most of our exports are to the Middle East, especially the UAE and Oman, and more surprisingly we are serving airports. In Abu Dhabi and Dubai, for example, we supply 100% and 70%, respectively, of all catering trucks used at their international airports. The company manages these exports by itself, meaning we have to market ourselves in these markets. Furthermore, we export to the end user; we don't use a middle company. We also export to India, New Zealand, Australia, China, Korea, and across ASEAN, with several major airports using our products. And, of course, back to our roots in Thailand, we serve all of the airports.</p><h4>What trends are you noticing in the local industrial engineering sector?</h4><p>In Thailand, it is difficult to say precisely, but an obvious global trend is that we are moving into a digital economy. Both the logistics and the industrial engineering sectors are becoming more digital, whereby the use of robotics and automation are crucial for everyday business practice. We have a small training centre in the company, where we train our people how to utilize robotics and how to use the necessary software for manufacturing. We try to train our own people in-house. How digitalization will ultimately affect this complex industry remains to be seen, but it is certainly here and we know we have to be on-board.</p><h4>How do you think the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) will impact your company?</h4><p>In ASEAN, we will achieve a stronger position in the market because we have a history of exporting. We export all over the world, and we are good at it. We are international in our approach, which means we are ready for ASEAN. It will have a positive impact on us. Of course, there is a chance that other competitors will come into our area, but we will stay strong because we are well-established.</p><h4>What is your expectation for 2016?</h4><p>In 2013, we decided on a 10-year growth strategy, Cho 2023. It is important for the company to bring in all of our ideas from across the management teams on how to do business and how to grow together. We have grown rapidly over recent years and, therefore, it is important to know where we are heading. We are listed on the stock exchange, have around 600 permanent staff, and in 2014 had revenues of approximately THB1.5 billion. Without going too much into the details of what our internal strategy includes, we make sure to meet for seven days every three months, exchanging information and assessing the core competencies and weaknesses of the company. Continuing with this strategy for the fourth year and acquiring new clients and partners will be our aim for 2016.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What brought you to Kazakhstan and what do you expect to achieve within your role as CEO?</h4><p>I have experience working in many countries, but Kazakhstan is the one that I like the most. This is a country with a great history, amazing culture, beautiful nature, and wonderful people. SANTO is a leading pharmaceutical company in Kazakhstan in monetary terms according to IMS Health data for 2015. We want to maintain this position and ensure our primacy by gaining a more substantial share of the market. Currently, we are in the process of doubling our business over the next three to four years. This means doubling revenue, the size of the company, and the size of our facilities. We are also working to modernize our portfolio by adding new products and registering a number of modern products while concurrently improving the position of traditional Kazakhstani brands, like Mukaltin, which people believe in. One of our best sellers is Mukaltin, which is a traditional cough remedy. We are strong in sterile antibiotics and pediatrics, and these are our other biggest areas of business. Thanks to these new products and the portfolio that we are developing, we have become the largest supplier to the government healthcare system. It now recognizes that the pharmaceutical sector is one of key industries and that it should support local business to ensure that they have quality pharmaceutical production. We are also going to enter complex therapeutic fields such as oncology biosimilars, as modern treatments are moving in that direction.</p><h4>SANTO is investing more than $100 million into the modernization and construction of new facilities. What are your main projects in this regard?</h4><p>As of September 2011, SANTO is a part of international pharmaceutical company Polpharma Group, which has an investment project in Kazakhstan amounting to more than $100 million. The main purpose of the investment project is to modernize the operation facilities within GMP quality standards. This project will significantly reduce the costs of the healthcare system in Kazakhstan and ensure access to high-quality and affordable medicines for more patients in Kazakhstan. SANTO has already obtained GMP quality certificates for the production lines of liquid sterile dosage forms in a new unique ampoule-infusion workshop where more than $40 million was invested. Currently, we are in the process of realizing a new shop aseptic antibiotics powder filling, which is scheduled for completion in May 2016. Many companies usually opt for tablet production because they are less expensive and easier to deal with, so we will be one of the few, or maybe the only company, to offer all pharmaceutical types, including sterile and tablets. There is an opportunity for us to take these products and market them for larger players. </p><h4>In 2016, within the Eurasian Economic Union, new regulations in the pharmaceutical industry will be implemented. As a company that exports to five countries, how will this affect your business?</h4><p>As always, it is both a threat and opportunity. The threat is that opportunities will arise for lower-quality manufacturers from other countries, i.e. members of the Eurasian Economic Union. At the same time, it may be an opportunity as the Eurasian Economic zone will be a key market and we may be given priority and preference as a local supplier. We are not afraid and see the situation as more of an opportunity than anything else. If we make smart moves, we stand to benefit from the situation. We are a local Kazakhstani manufacturer but we are part of the international group and our production is set on its investments and experience. We are heavily involved in Kyrgyzstan, where we will double our operations next year, and we have penetrated the Turkmenistan market by being accepted as a Kazakhstani manufacturer. We consider this a huge success because it only accepts European manufacturers. Once again, Russia remains the main market that we plan on entering. We are working heavily to move into Russia as a Kazakhstani manufacturer. The Kazakhstani market is 10 times bigger and we have the best manufacturing plant in the Eurasian region. By capitalizing on these strengths, we will become international. We want to be an important regional player, and aim to sell at least one product in Europe. By doing this we will prove that our products meet international standards. I would like to create additional manufacturing facilities in our factory in Shymkent.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Burger King® performed since opening its first restaurant in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We opened our first restaurant in May 2012 in the Mega Alma-Ata shopping center in Almaty. Since then, we have been able to grow exponentially and now have 27 restaurants operating in Kazakhstan, including five Drive Thrus. Now we are the fastest-growing international fast food chain in the burger segment in the country and, in a number of regions such as Karaganda, Pavlodar, Aktau, Atyrau, and Aktobe we are the first international fast food brand to open restaurants there. In terms of actual guests, last year we had over 6 million visitors to our restaurants compared to 4 million the previous year. It means that everyday more than 15,000 guests visit our restaurants across the country. In terms of total sales, we reached $22 million at the end of last year for the full year. We have been able to expand quite aggressively over the past couple of years by opening 27 restaurants in less than four years and will continue to grow. Of course, that was in a certain economic climate. Regardless, we think that it is important to continue to grow. On April 15, 2016 we unveiled our first restaurant in Uralsk, which is the eighth city that now has a Burger King® restaurant. So it marks a big milestone for the company because Kazakhstan is a large country and being able to grow and expand is challenging due to logistical issues and the great distances between cities. Today the company is also one of the biggest employers in the sector. As of February 2016, 550 people are employed at Burger King® restaurants. By the end of 2016 the plan is to increase this to 650 people. Annually the company provides jobs and career opportunities for 100-120 people, especially for local young people.</p><h4>What is your business strategy given Kazakhstan's current unstable economic situation?</h4><p>Our strategy is to ensure that guests keep coming back to our restaurants. Providing excellent customer service is a pillar of Burger King®. In addition we continue to offer guests our King Savers value menu that we rolled out two years ago to make sure we are always affordable for customers and also to meet and exceed guests' expectations, which means being able to provide the best quality food with great service at reasonable prices. That's what a good business is all about.</p><h4>What are the company's priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will focus on further developing service quality so as to exceed our customers' expectations. To achieve this goal, we will soon launch the BK University, which will provide educational programs for our restaurant managers so as to improve skills and knowledge in management. We will also continue to expand on the market and plan to launch about six new restaurants in 2016, including four Drive Thrus. Our aim is to introduce the Kazakhstani people to the Drive Thru format and promote it as a convenient way for drivers to order food without needing to get out of the car. This year we will launch a Drive Thru at a filling station in Almaty. In late 2015 we launched the first such Drive Thru in Aktobe, which is operating successfully and serves more than 3,000 cars per month. Such a format is quite popular in other countries worldwide; for example, Burger King® is planning to open 150 fast food areas at petrol stations all over Spain by 2018 and such a format has already been developed significantly in Germany and South Africa. Offering a large range of complementary services for customers stopping off to refuel is a fairly successful strategy. Additionally we are working to further develop our delivery service across Kazakhstan and continue progress with the King Savers value menu platform. We are also developing our offering for children by introducing a birthday package and iClick interactive game zones in our restaurants. This year we are organizing and participating in a number of CSR projects. One of the most exciting upcoming projects is a scholarship program for Kazakhstani students. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Americana Group and its operations in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Since its inception in Kuwait back in 1964, Americana Group has grown into one of the largest and most successful corporations in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia region. Americana Group's main lines of business are operating food and beverage outlets, as well as manufacturing food products. With a network of over 1,550 outlets, it is not only the largest operator of restaurant chains in the region, but also one of the most successful franchise operators in the whole world. We commenced our operations in Kazakhstan in 2008 with the purchase of an existing fast food company called Rostik's, which consisted of two stores in Almaty and Astana. Rostik's was a fried chicken brand and, in 2010, we re-branded it to KFC. In 2009, we had also brought Pizza Hut to Kazakhstan for the first time with our restaurant in Almaty. In 2011 we brought Hardee's to Kazakhstan, and then we introduced Costa Coffee in 2012. Today, we have almost 50 restaurants and nearly 2,000 employees. We have worked mainly in Almaty and Astana. In 2015, we are opening in two new cities in Karaganda and the Pavlodar Provinces, and in 2016 we intend to open stores in Aktau and Atyrau.</p><h4>Four out of the 12 brands that Americana Group operates internationally are present in Kazakhstan. Do you think there is demand for more brands to come here?</h4><p>There is a huge opportunity for new brands, as Kazakhstan is still a virgin market compared to the Gulf. There are hundreds of international brands in the Emirates now, while there are less than 10 global brands operating in Kazakhstan's food industry. This provides a huge opportunity for growth. The Kazakhstani customer is unique. They had few choices and ate a limited range of products during Soviet times. There is now an opportunity for businesses to provide customers with something novel and desirable. We estimate that the influence of price on a customer's decision to return to a restaurant is less than 13% in Kazakhstan. In fact, our research indicates that Kazakhstani customers are the least affected by price across all of our market segments. They care more about service and quality, and new market players should focus on these two factors.</p><h4>As a Kuwaiti company, Americana Group is listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange and you have also become established locally in Kazakhstan. What potential do you see for other GCC investors to establish operations here?</h4><p>There is a huge opportunity here for GCC investors and several have come in recently. Four years ago, the Zara and Massimo Dutti brands arrived. Now we have heard that Starbucks is coming via a Kuwaiti company. We have also seen a lot of investment in Astana coming from the Abu Dhabi government. There is considerable interest from GCC countries in Kazakhstan and it is continually growing. Many companies in the agricultural sector are also planning to launch operations here soon. This is because the government has recently been putting in place new procedures to attract foreign investment. These incentives include low-rate loans, reproducible returns on investment as high as 30%, and available infrastructure for all companies to utilize.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>It looks like 2016 will be a challenging year because of the economic situation and because of added competition entering the market. However, our expectation is that we can make significant progress and improvements in the company itself. We are still focusing on being the number one brand for quality and service, for which we won an award in 2014. We invest a great deal in our people. We have already started to expand outside of the traditional boundaries of Almaty and Astana, presenting us with an opportunity for significant growth in an area that could be called a virgin market, with little to no existing competition. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the recent achievements of Zhailjau Golf Club?</h4><p>We opened as a golf resort in 2006. We were inaugurated by the Arnold Palmer Design Company. He himself was a legendary golf player, but he is currently designing and building new golf clubs, and our golf resort is built according to his framework. Since then, we are constantly asking ourselves what we are achieving. First of all, we were providing services to those who want to play golf and also offering restaurants. Step by step, we are developing our project and now we have opened a luxury boutique-hotel on the grounds, as well as a fitness club and a swimming pool. This year, we also launched a spa center. </p><h4>How have you been attracting visitors to Zhailjau Golf Club, and how will you continue boosting the presence of the Club?</h4><p>The most important event we host is the Kazakhstan Open, a prestigious competition on the European Challenge Tour. For us, the goal of the Kazakhstan Open is to make Kazakhstan recognizable abroad. The second target is to attract amateur golfers. Last year was the 10th jubilee of the Kazakhstan Open, and we were well prepared with our promotion through different media channels. This year, we are seeing results from that event, because there are a growing number of amateurs coming here to play golf. We even see an increase in the number of international visitors from countries like Korea, Japan, and Europe who have seen our golf course featured on international television. We are in the process of negotiating business partnerships with clubs in Dubai and Turkey to develop our local golfing capacity.</p><h4>From where do most of your international visitors arrive?</h4><p>In terms of our visitors coming from abroad, there are two sources. The international championships that we regularly arrange are a big draw, and our President is working diligently to popularize every sport in Kazakhstan—not just golf—and to make us recognizable abroad as a sporting country. People coming here for the Expo are interested in visiting two of our cities. Almaty is considered the cultural capital and Astana is the financial capital, so any visitors in Astana or Almaty that have spare time would like to see both cities. If they come to Almaty, we are a part of the things-to-do, and they often pay us a visit as well</p><h4>Why are sports emerging as a major industry in Kazakhstan today?</h4><p>Around 10-15 years ago, our country was still young and our government did not have the time or means to make a concerted effort to develop sports in Kazakhstan. Today, there is a strategic initiative being executed by both the government and the private sector to invest heavily into school sports and teams. Sports can be very representative of a country. There are sometimes iconic athletes that mark a significant milestone or break a record in a sport, and everyone then knows about the athlete's country of origin. Because of that one athlete, suddenly a country will be celebrated and popularized around the world. This mechanism works well, and our officials believe in this as well. </p><h4>What are the expectations for 2016?</h4><p>In 2016, we have to understand and consider the current economic situation. It may not always be bright, but we still hope to keep the number of guests and visitors as it is. The best scenario is to increase these numbers, and we are looking to the Expo 2017 to help boost our tourism figures. Apart from that, we will collaborate with Almaty hotels in order to inform their guests about our range of services that they may use. We receive sponsorships from some companies and work closely with airlines and travel agencies. In that way, we hope to maintain and even increase the number of visitors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was Europharma's performance last year and what opportunities do you see for the company in the medium term?</h4><p>We are growing faster than the pharmaceutical market in general. Average growth for us is approximately 45-48% per year. In 2013, we grew by 53% YoY, though this year is a bit problematic and our growth will be around 28-30%. In January 2016, we will implement our new five-year strategy that we created with the Boston Consulting Group. In 2012 we had around 90 pharmacies, and we have since nearly doubled that number to around 160 pharmacies. In the pharmaceutical business there are three directions, namely post sale, retail, and government. We currently focus on one direction, and are developing the retail segment. We are currently the number one retail company in Kazakhstan, and for the next five years we want to expand. Our plans are to open 30-35 pharmacies every year. We want Europharma to be the industry's benchmark. Our benchmark is American pharmacies, like Walgreens or CVS pharmacies, and we have projects with these pharmacies. The system in Kazakhstan is a holdover from the basic Soviet Union-era pharmacies; we are the first company to implement American-style pharmacy markets that are like a supermarket and in addition to pharmaceuticals sell cosmetics, baby care products, home care, and other similar products.</p><h4>What is your assessment of pharmaceutical legislation in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We have conservative legislation in Kazakhstan, but it will be changed to adapt to the new Eurasian Custom Union between Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Russia. There will be many legislative changes that will create problems in the short term, but it will stabilize after one or two years. </p><h4>What strategies have allowed you to create and maintain your partnerships with international pharmaceutical companies, and what partnerships are you looking for to strengthen the business?</h4><p>Europharma currently has direct contracts with around 200 foreign manufacturers. We are an emerging market, and in an emerging market we can earn a lot due to the high potential profit margins. We are creating a company that can meet the expectations of our Western partners in America and Europe. Out main goal is to be an Eastern company with Western standards. At Europharma, the top managers have to know English. We also have many employees that speak Turkish, Spanish, and German. My goal is that any of our partners in America or Europe will be able to call our company and be able to communicate in their country's language. Beginning in this year we also launched the new standard for good distribution practices (GPD), and starting from next year we are launching a good pharmaceutical practices (GPP) initiative. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the eight settlements of the Great Silk Road located at the territory of Kazakhstan, recently added onto its World Heritage List?</h4><p>The Silk Roads were an interconnected web of routes linking the ancient societies of Asia, the subcontinent, Central Asia, Western Asia, and the Near East, and contributed to the development of many of the world's great civilizations. The Chang'an-Tian-shan corridor (China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan) is one section of this extensive overall Silk Roads network inscribed on the World Heritage List in June 2014. Extending across a distance of around 5,000km, it encompassed a complex network of trade routes extending to some 8,700km that developed to link Chang'an in central China with the heartland of Central Asia between the 2nd century BC and 1st century AD, when long distance trade in high value goods, particularly silk, started to expand between the Chinese and Roman Empires. It flourished between the 6th and 14th century AD and remained in use as a major trade route until the 16th century. Thirty-three sites from China, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan were included in the inscribed serial World Heritage property. They include capital cities palace complexes of various empires, trading settlements, Buddhist cave temples, ancient paths, posthouses, passes, beacon towers, sections of the Great Wall, fortifications, tombs, and religious buildings. The inscription of the Silk Roads: Routes network of the Chang'an-Tianshan Corridor on the World Heritage List promotes inter-cultural dialogue, the notion of shared heritage, and regional and international cooperation in the world. Eight sites of the serial transnational World Heritage property are located in the Almaty Province and Zhambyl Province of Kazakhstan. These sites are: Kayalyk, Talgar, Karamergen, Aktobe, Kulan, Ornek, Kostobe, Akyrtas. Most of the sites are former trading settlements. A combination of agriculture and trade led to the development of prosperous towns and cities that persisted over many centuries and brought together different peoples such as the Saka, Ousun, Turks, Iranian, Khitan, Mongolian and Han Chinese. This serial property has been inscribed on the World Heritage List because it fulfills four criteria for outstanding universal value in accordance with the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention.  The Chang'an Tian-shan corridor is an extraordinary example in world history of how a dynamic channel linking civilizations and cultures across the Eurasian continent, realized the broadest and most long-lasting interchange among civilizations and cultures between the 2nd century BC to the 16th century AD.</p><h4>During the 38th session of the UNESCO General Conference, Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev proposed the establishment of an International Academy under UNESCO, for maintaining peace through the implementation of the UNESCO Culture of Peace Concept. What opportunities do you see in this regard and what other initiatives will be taken in order to maintain peace in this region?</h4><p>In propagating the “International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures" in 2010, which subsequently became a UN Decade (2013-2022), Kazakhstan has, and continues to play, a key role in promoting intercultural dialogue, which is crucial for fostering mutual understanding, inclusiveness and peaceful coexistence. As a catalyst for new ideas, UNESCO stands ready to support all initiatives aiming to reinforce a culture of peace, including Kazakhstan's initiative “The Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions." Kazakhstan has also shown interest in establishing an International Center for the Rapprochement of Cultures under the auspices of UNESCO, which is an initiative that should be welcomed. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has Zepter accomplished since it entered the Kazakhstani market?</h4><p>We started here in 1995 and in November 2015 we celebrated our 20th anniversary. Zepter is an international company that produces, sells, and distributes exclusive, high-quality consumer goods around the world, principally through its own sales network and through high-end stores. Since its inception, Zepter International has established high-quality standards and become an essential part of the lives of millions of people around the world. Zepter International owns eight factories, in Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy and has over 350,000sqm of space in the world's best locations. Zepter has been in Kazakhstan since 1995. At that time, it was trying to get set up in all of the former USSR countries, including Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan. Our operations have grown rapidly. We started here in Almaty and subsequently opened bureaus in the 14 regions of the country. In 2001 we bought our own building and each year develop our facilities. Zepter is part of one of the biggest industries in the world—the direct sales industry—and our representatives are a part of the 89.7 million individuals around the world representing such companies.</p><h4>What products are the most popular in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Every year we introduce new products. We started with pots made from high-quality stainless steel. We also have drinking sets, cutlery, porcelain, air and water cleaners, as well as Bioptron Light Therapy systems and cosmetics. Our sales are mostly attributed to our pots, and the core of our sales are in the country's major cities of Almaty, Astana, and Shymkent, as well as good sales figures in the western regions in Aktau and Atyrau. We sell all this through our own network, with our sales representatives. It is a direct sales business and offers the best opportunity for those who realize the limitations that come with an office job. We sell our products only by presentation, because Zepter products are the best on the market, so to get all advantages of our products and correctly know how to use them, the client has to listen a presentation, where our representatives provide customers with all necessary information. At the moment we have about 2,000 people working as sales representatives. In the past this figure reached as high as 5,000. Generally, our representatives are happy working with us and enjoy the opportunity to share in our work ethic and philosophy.</p><h4>What are your main goals and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Everybody knows there is a crisis in the global economy, and also in Kazakhstan. However, people will always want to eat, and in general people are becoming more aware of healthy eating and cooking practices. They wish to cook in quality pots to live healthily, drink clear water, and breathe without air pollution. All of these problems can be solved by Zepter products. Our business has slowed to some extent recently with the devaluation of the currency. While this is the case at present, we are positive about the future. We want to share our philosophy of good health and good life with the people. The industry and the company we work for become even more relevant in times of economic crises. Our market is being affected by currency devaluation and reduced purchasing power. But those who are knowledgeable of history will know that the direct sales industry was born in the middle of the great depression in America, after the fall of the stock exchange, as the most resistant and most adaptable form of business. In harsh times when other industries are laying off their staff and reducing costs through other means, our jobs are secure and earnings stay above average. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Eight settlements on the Silk Road were recently named UNESCO World Heritage sites. How is the Ministry further promoting Kazakhstani culture and history worldwide?</h4><p>We have many sacred places related not only to the history of Kazakhstan as a nation, but to human development at large, which were not included on the UNESCO list. We currently have three properties inscribed on the list, namely the Mausoleum of Khawaja Ahmed Yasawi, the Tamgaly petroglyphs, and the eight cities that form a section of the Silk Road. We also have eight remnants of Buddhist culture, many sacred sites of Zoroastrian gatherings, and assorted other historical places of a similar nature. The whole world would be thrilled to find the placement of Genghis Khan's grave. The eldest son of Genghis Khan, Jochi, was buried in the Ulytau district of the Karaganda region. Essentially, we have many unique sites that can be considered the common heritage of mankind, but which have still not been included on the UNESCO list. To this end, we are working on opening the UNESCO Center in Kazakhstan, for which we are providing all the requirements for funding and construction. Recently, we had a UNESCO committee meeting here to discuss the possible inclusion into the list of the next segment of the Silk Road. The first step in our current plan is the joint production of a documentary film (a collaboration of groups from Italy, Kazakhstan, and China), based on a book by Marco Polo. It is fortunate that we have a first-person account of the Silk Road from Marco Polo.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the Winter Universiade 2017?</h4><p>The new President of the International University Sports Federation recently paid us a visit. It is necessary for the countries of Central Asia to work together on these larger-scale sports events. It is a pity that such events have never been held in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, or Mongolia. We are confident that hosting these types of events will be beneficial not only to Kazakhstan, but to the whole region. It would be a great way to improve the overall international reputation of countries with the “-stan" suffix in their names. We have a strategic plan, and as the leader of our country has pointed out, three important factors lie at the basis of any successful state. These are that the nation should have established moral and spiritual values, its citizens should be health-conscious, and it should form a happy society. That is why the state is generally interested in the advancement of sports. We are lucky to have a leader who takes the initiative to bring new sports into the country.</p><h4>What are your primary goals as Minister of Culture and Sports for this year and beyond?</h4><p>Our foremost sports-related goal for 2016 is to successfully participate in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Over the past 24 years, we have fostered our own talented sportspeople, born and bred in Kazakhstan, who will now represent the nation internationally. With regard to culture, in May 2016 the National Academy of Choreography will be opened. It will be an institution where students will be able to study the art of dance from primary school to the PhD level. It will be a unique establishment, funded not by the state, but by oil companies that operate in Kazakhstan. During the Soviet era, we had only one opera theatre—the Abay Opera House in Almaty. Recently, we have opened the second one in Astana, and another in Shymkent city. There are also dancing groups active in all of the country towns. We have to train a pool of dancers to fill the demand. Traditional Kazakh culture coexists with the European culture in our country. We will also spare some funds to build opera houses, temples of arts, and athletic venues. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With many companies tightening their budgets, what is changing for your business?</h4><p>Chagala was a first mover in terms customer base diversification in 2014 and 2015. One of our major customers is the Kashagan oil field, which has embarked in the budget tightening exercise since the end of 2014 until today. Based on its move, we anticipated a change in the landscape and we tighten our budgets following our customers earlier. Given that we provide in general the best value for money solution in the markets that we operate in, with the new round of cost savings, we have not seen a major impact yet. There is an ongoing adjustment due to the exchange rate fluctuation of the tenge because our operating currency is the tenge and our reporting currency is US dollars. If anything we will see an increase in business because of our best value for money principle and customers abandoning expensive options in favor of cost continuous, fit-for-purpose ones. Our core clients—people who stay at our properties—are generally those who work in the office, not in the field. Given our long-term relationship with our customers that want the customized kind of service we provide, we have not had to put emergency plans in place. However, we work closely with our customers and we believe there is a general consensus that if crude oil price drops below $20 for a sustained period of time, we will have to resort to swift effective measures internally to allow our customers to stay with us on a sustainable basis.</p><h4>Chagala is focused on the needs of international and domestic oil companies. After this unstable year, is your client portfolio the same? What strategy are you following to retain them?</h4><p>Chagala has always focused its efforts on serving the international oil and gas industry. In Kazakhstan, this means western Kazakhstan, which is why our assets are so concentrated in the Atyrau, Mangistau, and West Kazakhstan regions. Our facilities in Aktau, Bautino, and Atyrau are focused on offshore projects such as Kashagan and onshore projects such as Tengizchevroil. Our properties in Uralsk and Aksai are heavily weighted toward the Karachaganak project. So this accentuates the fact that oil and gas is a target for us. This is the key industry in these locations and the group delivers quality accommodation solutions on a value-for-money and fit-for-purpose basis to its clients. We are opportunistic investors inside and outside Kazakhstan, and we are currently actively looking in places like Egypt and Turkey.</p><h4>What are your goals for the year ahead?</h4><p>I believe people underestimate the difficulty of staying in business in an environment that faces increasing costs and stagnant or diminishing sales. Competition is tough in all our operating markets, so surviving with dignity is no small feat. If we can do that, our next challenge will be to expand outside of Kazakhstan. We have dedicated resources into looking at this since the beginning of 2016 and we have already made some inroads with clients for whom we will be operating hotels or residences. We aim to focus more on serviced apartments rather than on hotels, but we value all opportunities under the same light. 2016 is also the year when the bonds issued on the KASE by one of our subsidiaries in Kazakhstan come due and we are in the process of refinancing them. Due to currency exchange movements, refinancing has become easier for us as it now represents a smaller part of our balance sheet liabilities. Nevertheless, like with any refinancing, we take this process seriously as the Group remains committed to repaying its debts. Lastly, the successful completion of our latest development in the West Kazakhstan region in 2016 will mark the start of a new operating model in that region for us—an important development as the process has taken 20 years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-lap-of-luxury]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What sectors is MG Holding involved with and what is the company strategy? </h4><p>MG Holding is a young company compared to other leading companies, especially in our sector. Movlatgiri Mestoev, the founder of the company, is an experienced and successful businessman. He has been involved in a number of different business ventures and started MG Holding in 2012 as our umbrella brand. Under MG Holding, we currently have three companies, the most active being MG Development, which I am the Chief Executive of. The company operates in two of Kazakhstan's fastest growing sectors: commercial real estate development and large-scale infrastructure development. In addition to MG Development, we have MG Construction, and we are establishing MG Sports, which is working to bring some exciting sports and fitness brands to Kazakhstan and the CIS region. Our strategy is to keep MG Holding as our umbrella brand and create dedicated companies under it when we expand into a new sector where we see opportunities that are complementary to other group activities. The way we execute a particular project is to bring together the most appropriate and experienced national and international teams on a project-by-project basis. Accordingly, we have a strong international mix in our business and it provides a structure that can expand wherever there is an attractive opportunity or need. We are focused on projects in Kazakhstan, where we have considerable experience, as well as other CIS countries.</p><h4>The St. Regis Astana Hotel and Residences brings a well-known and reliable brand to MG Holding. How did partnering with Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts come about? </h4><p>First impressions last forever. Therefore, we discussed what brand would best reflect MG's values and vision. As this is the first project we have launched and implemented, it was critical that it set the tone for the overall image of MG Holding and MG Development. After reviewing potential brand partners, St. Regis emerged with strong values consistent with ours. Globally, it is a limited and exclusive product compared to other brands. St. Regis began in the early 1900s in New York with a concept of being more of a members club than anything else, and that is very much the essence of the Astana Residences. Over the past century, the St. Regis brand has evolved from a single property to become one of the most internationally revered names in the hospitality industry. The success of the St. Regis brand is a result of commitment to delivering an unrivalled setting and bespoke service to each resident or guest, from arrival to departure. As our discussions progressed and we got to know the St. Regis team, we found our vision and values were aligned, and we welcomed their enthusiasm to enter the Kazakh market—St. Regis wanted this to be one of their top two or three new projects worldwide. As we worked through plans together, we were delighted to confirm our initial sense that we shared common values and a similar approach to business. Within a short period of time, we finalized our agreements and announced the project in July 2014. The St. Regis team has proven to be a good partner and has been involved in every stage of development—from the concept to the engineering to the interior design. We both believe the project should be executed to best international standards, including environmental standards. We are proud that the project is the first BREEAM certified development in Kazakhstan. For those not familiar with BREEAM, it is the world's leading sustainability assessment method for master planning projects, infrastructure and buildings. BREEAM inspires developers and creators to excel, innovate, and make effective use of resources. The focus on sustainable value and efficiency makes BREEAM certified developments attractive property investments and generates sustainable environments that enhance the wellbeing of the people who live and work in them. The project is located in Astana Central Park on the river and will have 120 rooms, up to 50 St. Regis Residences, and commercial space for entertainment and retail. We are planning to have a soft opening of the development by December 2016 and a full opening in the first quarter of 2017</p><h4>The St. Regis project will introduce a new level of luxury to the region. Will this make Astana a more international tourist destination?</h4><p>Our mission is to make the development the ultimate solution that combines lifestyle with real estate and sets a new standard of luxury living in Kazakhstan, while also staying true to the legacy of the St. Regis brand. We are confident the project will make Astana more attractive to visitors, and there is no question about Astana's potential. As the capital of Kazakhstan, it continues to grow significantly, with a population that has increased from 275,000 to nearly 900,000 over the past 16 years—forecasts suggest that by 2019, it will reach 1.5 million. Kazakhstan is, of course, the largest economy in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Central Asia, and enjoys an enviable position on the Silk Road between the East and West, bringing attractive international trading opportunities. With the changes that have been made to visa and customs processes, Astana is becoming a more and more popular destination, and next year's Expo 2017 will boost the country's profile and reputation. Accordingly, we are expecting many of our customers to be business travelers, who will be attracted by the facilities at the St. Regis and want to combine business and leisure during their visit to Astana. </p><h4>What are the main challenges in doing business in the region?</h4><p>If I found Kazakhstan seriously challenging, I wouldn't have spent 15 years of my life here with my wife and family. All of our designs are created by leading foreign architects and engineers and in all our activities we adhere to the BREEAM certification standards. As we are pioneering these standards in Kazakhstan, there are no benchmark projects to compare to, making proper feasibility studies and evaluation difficult for potential investors and partners. On the other hand, it is a exciting environment and there are many new opportunities waiting for us. Not only do we have the chance to open a new chapter in real-estate development in Kazakhstan, we will also set the standards for other companies, making our own projects future benchmarks. For local and international investors, we want our projects to be the baseline—we see setting high standards as part of our social responsibility to the country and people of Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What are your targets for 2016?</h4><p>For now, our main target is to complete the St. Regis project on time. In connection with this, we recently opened a sales office in Almaty. We have also appointed Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a leading global commercial real estate services company to commence sales of St Regis Residences. Within the MG Group, we are hard at work on a number of further initiatives, including in the sports and fitness market, and expect to announce two or three new projects before the end of 2016. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What policies have been adopted by the Ministry to stimulate growth in the local agricultural sector?</h4><p>According to the Committee for Statistics of the Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the GDP share of agricultural products was 4.4% in 2014. The volume of gross agricultural output has increased over the past five years by a factor of 1.7. Crop production during this period has doubled to KZT1.3 billion ($4 million), while livestock production has increased by over 150% to KZT1.2 trillion ($3.6 billion). The volume of total food production for this period has increased by a factor of 1.6 to KZT103.5 billion ($300 million). To further establish the conditions necessary to improve the competitiveness of the agro-industry, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Akimats of the region are implementing the Agro-Industrial Complex (AIC) Development Program in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2013-2020, known as “Agribusiness-2020." This program provides for an increase in the volume of state support for AIC by a factor of 4.5, which will attract about $40 billion in private funds to the industry. As late as 2015, the amount of subsidies for the development of the industry amounted to over $500 million, which is twice that of 2013, when it stood at KZT88.7 billion. Along with the existing subsidies for resources and activities in crop and livestock production, the Program contains a number of new tools to support the industry, such as financial restructuring, reduction of interest rates on loans and leasing, and subsidies for costs to guarantee and insure loans. During the immediate implementation of the Program, it is planned to increase the physical volumes of agricultural production by 150% by 2020, to raise labor productivity per person employed in agriculture by a factor of three, and to increase the amount of state support for agriculture by subsidizing agribusiness entities by a factor of 4.5. Ultimately this will achieve an increase in export earnings from the sale of agricultural products by 20%.</p><h4>How are current market conditions impacting export volumes?</h4><p>The state of the Kazakhstani economy has until now been directly dependent on the global economy. The introduction of a free exchange rate in the country for Kazakhstani agriculture will largely be a surplus, and domestic products will become more competitive. In this context, the need to support domestic goods producers, both financially and in an administrative capacity, is of particular relevance today. As far as AIC exports are concerned, for the first nine months of 2015 these have decreased by 27.4% compared to the same period in the previous year, and amount to $1.4 billion. However, due to changes in monetary policy, based on a free-floating exchange rate of the tenge, the alignment of prices for imported and domestic food products is expected. This will ultimately have a positive impact on the recovery of domestic products in the market. Exports of agricultural products to foreign markets will be resumed.</p><h4>How much will joining the WTO increase the capacity of the Kazakhstan's agricultural sector?</h4><p>With the right approach, Kazakhstan's admission to the WTO would only contribute to the further development of the agricultural sector. Among the advantages of accession to this organization would be attracting new investment, the possibility of resolving disputes in international courts, and the chance to form international trade regulations. Domestic goods producers will have access to a unified international legal space, wherein they will acquire protection against trade discrimination and gain freedom of transit for their products. Conditions for accessing the AIC domestic products to foreign markets will be improved, while additional conditions to improve product quality and competitiveness will be created. The major task of the agriculture sector is to ensure the efficient production of agricultural products in sufficient quantities for the domestic market. Moreover, there are also planned global agribusiness subsidy reforms to further automate the process of subsidization. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[moving-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Globalink performed over the past year?</h4><p>It has been a somewhat challenging time. We have been preparing ourselves for this situation since the last economic crisis in 2008. After what happened in 2008, there was no quick fix and every business needed to become more sustainable, which meant that we had to look for the worst-case scenarios. We have prepared ourselves, and the difference this year is that we are investing much more than we were previously. We serviced the gold mining sector when the price was $300 per ounce, and later when the prices rose up to $1,800 per ounce. I do not expect the oil industry to invest in expansion in the current climate, and of course we have to adjust the scale of the services we provide to this particular sector for the time being. In the transport and logistics sector, it is extremely important that we follow market trends, and one of the principles of Globalink is that we have built our business model on integrated service strategy. Our company really covers nearly every segment of the transportation, logistics, and mobility industry. We refer to ourselves as a one-stop-solution for global logistics and mobility services.</p><h4>How do you see the logistics sector developing over the coming two to three years?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is a huge mineral resources and raw materials exporting economy, which is not extremely appealing for the transport and logistics industry. It is attractive when an industry has a robust small- to medium-sized production segment. In Kazakhstan, the current commodity market stress means that the government will have to start redirecting some of its investment support away from the oil and energy sectors and start supplying industrial production. At least this sector is able to cater for domestic demand and export volume. If you look at the market today, while the imported goods price has doubled because of devaluation, you can still buy local products for more or less the same price as before. This proves that domestic production is the only solution for withstanding any currency fluctuation, and that is good news for our business because more domestic production means a stronger supply chain and more distribution. Because of that we are investing in many different areas in the company to prepare ourselves, because we cannot afford to wait until the market builds.</p><h4>What priorities and goals do you have for 2016?<br></h4><p>The number one priority is to reduce costs, which is not about reducing staff numbers. We have not fired people, but rather improved practices to help us all workforce more efficiently. We are trying to reduce fuel consumption by investing in a modern truck fleet, which will allow us to save a lot more, and pass the benefit on to our clients. The investment we made in this new fleet is definitely the right move, as it sends a positive signal to the market that we are still open for business. We are not downsizing; we are expanding. This of course has given a lot of positive synergy to our clients and to ourselves. We are also building a new logistics centers, closer to the city center for distribution services, and my aim is to design a warehouse that reduces our carbon footprint by half. It is the right time to undertake such investments because, if you want to restart the economy, you have to spend money. The last thing I want to do is sit idle and wait for the good times to come. We are making a lot of investments and I expect some positive developments over the coming year as a result. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the landmark achievements of Airport Management Group since the start of operations in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>In 2015, AMG attracted two well-known leaders in ground services, Swissport and Gate Gourmet, to the company. Since October 2015, these companies have started to provide services at the capital airport, in accordance with international norms and standards. Attracting international companies will contribute to the development of Astana airport as a major transport hub, as well as the formation of a positive image of the capital of Kazakhstan and the World Financial Center. One of the priority goals of the company is the aviation security management system and flight safety implementation. AMG took the initiative and now there are 12 manuals being introduced, with instructions and technologies regarding aviation security and flight safety in accordance with international standards. Previously, there were no such documents. AMG experts are also working to improve the legal framework related to issues of further development of airport activity. The company is gradually solving issues regarding improvement of the quality of the facilities, the transfer of best practices, standards, and technologies, including aviation safety management systems and quality control programs, in accordance with ICAO international standards</p><h4>By 2020, investment in airports in Kazakhstan will amount to KZT167 billion. What will these investments entail?</h4><p>It is clear that investments are necessary to provide compliance with national and international standards of quality and safety, and to provide expected growth of air traffic in state airports. We are planning a few construction projects, such as a new passenger terminal at Astana and the reconstruction of the runway, and the installation of lighting equipment at Petropavlovsk. In addition, there will be runway reconstruction at Kostanay airport, the construction of new passenger and cargo terminals at Shymkent, and the construction of a new passenger terminal at Kyzylorda airport.</p><h4>How is Shymkent's airport project progressing?</h4><p>In line with the project plan, the new terminal will be integrated with railway and bus stations as well as a transport logistics center, which is going to be commissioned presently. In Kazakhstan, such a model of airport development will be used for the first time. The implementation of this project will be divided into two stages. The first stage will be the construction of a new passenger terminal of 18,000sqm in area, and a capacity of 600 passengers per hour. The second stage will involve the expansion of the terminal by 16,000sqm more, which will allow for a capacity of up to 1,200 passengers every hour. As a result, passenger traffic at the new terminal may reach 3 million per year by 2030. The creation of an air hub in this region and the improvement of city's infrastructure will positively impact development of the economy and social spheres, as well as the south region of the country in general.</p><h4>How do you assess the future of the aviation sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Global demand for air transport is growing steadily, especially in “developing markets“ such as China and Southeast Asia. The location of Kazakhstan in between the major trading partners of China and the EU dictates the main challenge for the development of a transport-logistics system in the country. At the same time, it is expected that, with the development of the economy, air travel will become increasingly preferred. According to a forecast from Lufthansa Consulting, passenger traffic at the 11 holding airports in 2030 will stand at 22.6 million passengers. With stable growth of the aviation industry, airports should be ready to serve increased number of passengers, baggage, and cargo. It is necessary to pay more attention to international standards of airport services, safety, and security. Based on these goals, in international practice, some airports are combined in holdings for optimal use of infrastructure, special equipment, and the use of common servicing standards. Such holdings already exist in many countries, for example in Russia, Poland, Estonia, Germany, England, and Malaysia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe KazTransCom's evolution since it entered the Kazakhstani market?</h4><p>KazTransCom was founded on the basis of the state oil holding company's communications agency Kaspiy Munay Bailynaz (KMUB). It rendered technical services to the communication structure that ran along the oil pipeline in western Kazakhstan. In 2001, there was a merger of the telecoms operators in the oil and gas sector. AktyubNefteSvyaz in Aktyubinsk merged with KMUB in Atyrau. By 2002, we had affiliated with Kazakhstan's entire telecommunications structure of gas pipelines. In 2004, the number of staff in the company reached 1,500, and the turnover was approximately $30 million. That same year we issued bonds for $20 million and started actively building fiber-optic networks throughout Kazakhstan. From 2005, the company began to grow rapidly as one of the leading telecommunications operators. We built a backbone in Astana, Atyrau, Aktau, Aktyubinsk, and Uralsk that runs through every major city of Kazakhstan. We are represented in seven large cities, covering almost 80% of the telecommunications market. Our market share in the B2B oil and gas sector of western Kazakhstan is more than 30%. Today, we see B2B and corporate clients as our main strategic market segment. The company continues building its own cable routes, and by the end of 2016 we plan to connect seven cities. It will basically be a transit route going from China toward Russia and Europe. We also have our own satellite network, comprised of more than 300 satellite communication terminals. Our competitive strength is in our highly skilled professionals, who are located  every 200-300km along the oil and gas pipelines. Because of that, we are able to promptly respond to any emergency and offer high-quality service to our clients. Our strategy today is aimed at an individual approach to every customer. Unlike our competitors, we create the right, effective solutions for the corporate segment that are adapted to every client.</p><h4>What are your development and investment plans in the short to medium term?</h4><p>According to the latest marketing surveys, we have jumped from fourth to third place by market share (fixed telecom market) in the ranking of Kazakhstan's operators. Our plans include the construction of a countrywide fiber-optics network. We will focus on the international market, making use of Kazakhstan's transit potential and creating transit channels with other countries. Right now, we cover 20% of the wholesale internet market in Kyrgyzstan. We also provide telecommunication services in Tajikistan, by the way of Uzbekistan. We have major plans for the development of the corporate segment, Almaty being one of our major targets. Almaty represents about 50% of the telecoms market in Kazakhstan. It has the most competitive market, with over 20 active operators. But thanks to our strategy and the new services that we plan to launch this year, we will easily increase our share. We plan to reach 15% of the Almaty market over the next five years.</p><h4>What investment plans do you have for 2016?</h4><p>The year 2016-2018 will be a pivotal year, as our entire cable network will be finished. We will bring our major project to an end. Today, we are the only company with telecommunications projects of this scale for 2016-2018. We are basically building a network that will stretch from the East to the West of Kazakhstan, thus providing commissions to construction companies and giving jobs to people. Our strategy is that in a down economy you need to build infrastructure, which is what we are doing. As of today, we have the lowest construction prices for this cable route. We see the crisis as a great opportunity to win ourselves a market share: we supply the business with sound, effective solutions, which makes us more attractive to clients in the time of crisis. In 2016 our Main City Net (MCNet) project will be completed, connecting all the major cities. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What activities are the company involved in?</h4><p>We have well-established offices in Kazakhstan and Georgia and have several years of experience operating in the Central Asia and Caucasus regions, so we are well versed in how the local market, including developers and investors, functions. We have access to best-in-class professionals, in-house expertise, and a global platform to provide high quality consultancy services. Recently, our global partner Cushman &amp; Wakefield merged with DTZ to become one of the largest commercial real estate consultancies in the world, with combined total revenues of over $5 billion, 43,000 employees in more than 60 countries, more than 4.3 billion square feet under management, and $191 billion in transaction value. This merger has increased our client database significantly and our company international desks have seen a tangible increase in the referral workload. </p><h4>Kazakhstan is the hub for your operations in Central Asia. What were the main challenges that CW|VB had to face when you entered the market?</h4><p>When we opened the firm, we started on the basis that we would always try to be the best in the market, not necessarily the biggest, but the “preferred" real estate services company across the regions where we operate. It took a lot of hard work and a challenging recruitment process to find the right people. We approach business with discipline, consistency and transparency; this vision drives all that we do. Cushman and Wakefield is renowned in the industry for being very particular about which companies it partners with. We went through a rigorous inspection process before it was decided that we were the right people to be their partner. We are now in the sixth year of our partnership with Cushman &amp; Wakefield, and the relationship is as strong as ever.  </p><h4>What are the main projects that CW|VB is currently working on in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We have been engaged by the Astana Expo 2017 organizers to help with retail brokerage and development consultancy, we have recently been appointed to provide retail brokerage, on an exclusive basis, for the Abu Dhabi Plaza project, a $1.6 billion mixed-use development in Astana, and we are also exclusively engaged in the luxury St. Regis project also in Astana.    </p><h4>What major trends do you foresee for the coming two years?</h4><p>In Kazakhstan, there is obviously a lot of emphasis on the upcoming Expo 2017, which will be heavily weighted toward retail, leisure, and F&amp;B, and we are assisting with the legacy of the Expo to ensure that the event will play a positive role in the longer-term development of the country and, in particular, Astana.  There is a lot of uncertainty in the market at the moment. The tenge was reported to be the most volatile currency in the world, a fact that does not give investors much confidence. We are in the midst of a downturn but I think this is going to be short-lived, I foresee an upturn within 18 months. </p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>Taking into consideration the country's promising real estate prospects, we are seeking to increase our personnel and commit to new projects with enhanced service lines. The regions where we operate have always been active, however, we are seeing increased levels of interest in neighbouring countries as well, especially in Ukraine and Mongolia.  Considering our strong presence in Kazakhstan and due to our extensive, long established relationships with Kazakh investors, we see great potential in attracting cross-border investment to the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Astana Motors Company's main developments and achievements in recent years?</h4><p>Astana Motors Company experienced a rapid rise during the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s. For the last four years, we have been focused on developing an effective business model. We try to grow faster than the market, and in crisis years shrink promptly to avoid damage and the ability to react to the market changes. Due to the hard work of the company, we saw excellent results for 2013-14: We sold 20,000 cars each year, increased our dealer network by adding more than 19 partners, built new dealerships, and saw the highest level of customer satisfaction so far. As a result, even in spite of today's situation in automobile industry, the company has been able to hold a market share of 17% since 2015. </p><h4>You are the representative in Kazakhstan for international carmakers such as Hyundai, BMW and Subaru. Are you looking for the new brands? </h4><p>We cannot say we are actively searching for new partnerships. However, we are open for any offers from potential partners among the world's top players as a strategic way to develop the company further. Such partnerships would, of course, allow us to increase the infrastructural power, receive new technologies, and to enhance own team. </p><h4>Have you noticed any trends in the national automobile market?</h4><p>A primary trend today concerns the domestic car industry, in particular the production of commercial vehicles. Kazakhstan has focused on the development of its own automobile production. Astana Motors Company has successfully realized this idea along with Hyundai. We have also been the representative for FAW's heavy commercial vehicles since 2015. This sector is popular in our country. However, Astana Motors Company is not planning to stop with just heavy commercial vehicles; we have made progress in producing small-class buses and are now considering developing long-distance buses, as there is a need in the country to update the entire bus fleet, no less than 50,000 per year. We will also see a growth in interest in Chinese products. Chinese vehicles have not been popular in Kazakhstan because there were many quality alternatives from European and other Asian brands. Now, however, the quality of products has improved consumers in Kazakhstan have responded positively. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>Despite favorable conditions, market reclamation will take a while, as we are recovering from a serious fall. There are many forecasts today, most of which depend on the price of oil, which is the main factor that influences the tenge exchange rate. The premium segment is unlikely to be affected. Customers have a higher demand for new cars than for used cars, which are imported. This demand will ensure the sector will continue to develop. We expect the market will improve only minimally in 2017, while the real growth occurs in 2018-19. But again, everything will depend on the price of oil and other macroeconomic factors. In order to be competitive, it is necessary to improve constantly by adding new services and bettering quality. Our market has always been a spontaneous one and hard enough to forecast market disruption, as there are many factors that contribute. We look at the situation in the future with optimism. The Kazakh car market has great potential, and Astana Motors Company has a portfolio of good brands, professional personnel, and clear management policy. For the medium term, we want to enlarge our activity in the internal market, introduce new products and services, and develop exports for commercial vehicles. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2015, your plan was to double the volume of cargo to Europe; to what extent did you manage to reach these goals?</h4><p>Today, there is a difficult situation in Kazakhstan, the CIS, and Europe, and there are some sectors of our business that the crisis has affected. Despite this situation, we managed to make progress. If you compare the clean income in 2014 to that of 2013, there is growth of 20%. I have been managing this company for five years now, and if you look at the income from the last four years, it has increased four-fold, while profit has increased six-fold. We are developing all the transit projects on the New Silk Road. In comparison to the same period in 2014, we have doubled the number of container trains. We have also cut down delivery time: In 2010-2011, delivery took 16-18 days between Europe and China; today, this has been reduced to 12-14 days, and we are planning to reduce the time of delivery further to 10-12 days.</p><h4>Have you seen an increase in China-Russia trade, and to what extent are you serving this direction? </h4><p>Since November of 2014, the governments of three countries—Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan—decided to create the United Transport Logistic Company (UTLC). We are part of this trans-continental company because trans-container is part of UTLC. In November 2015, we started working on the key factors in the unique technologies area to unify the containers and wagons in operation. We are combining all our operational power to reduce the cost of freight forwarding, because we do not have a balance in transportation compared to China-Europe. Having these unique technologies gives us the ability to reduce rates in transportation. When there was no United Logistic Company and we were an independent company, we had to send cargo from China to Europe or Russia, and then send the empty wagons and pay the incurring costs. Today, having the UTLC as part of our company enables us to be involved in the more sophisticated logistic routes and has helped us to reduce the costs. We have launched two or three container trains to test, and we plan to run four trains per month from China to Russia. This includes a route we have launched from China to Moscow, which would double the volume of freight.</p><h4>How is the logistics sector finding its foothold in the current market conditions?</h4><p>The devaluation of the currency was a shock for the local economy. Nonetheless, with this complicated situation in the market, we are offering competitive rates and different projects to our clients. Exports have started increasing in both Kazakhstan and Russia, but we are focusing mostly on transit projects. We understand that all the transit projects are in foreign currency, and the devaluation gave us the opportunity to increase our volumes. When the transit project was initiated through Kazakhstan, it made up only 5% of our business, yet today this has increased to 12% and soon it will be up to 50%. We can see the perspective of volume growth in two directions from China to Europe, and China to Russia. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the company for 2016?</h4><p>We would like to maintain the dynamics of the income and activities of the Group. We are also working with Temir Zholy to build a tunnel, and connect Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey by rail. In regard to 2016, we will work to maintain the progress we have achieved, and we are planning to buy additional platforms and to develop our own wagon park. In the last two years, we have bought 300 wagons and are planning to buy more. Beginning in 2017, we are also launching a program of reconstruction of all the old terminals in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What changes and improvements have you noticed on the e-Government front over recent years?</h4><p>Since the idea of developing e-Government was announced by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, over a decade has passed. For this period, we have tried to instill trust in e-Government among both the country's citizens and its experts, including international ones. For the past six years we rose by 53 positions and are currently ranked 28th in the UN's e-Government development ranking. This result was achieved thanks to a number of factors, namely infrastructure development, public services automation and optimization, the launch of new e-services, and growing user activity. In recent years we worked on composite services, whereby interactive services and transactional ones are combined, and several government agencies are in charge of service delivery. Previously, newcomers had to put together a package of documents, make an agreement with a government agency regarding the future name of the company, and register with justice bodies and tax and statistics agencies. The entire procedure used to take at least 30 days. Now, in electronic format, this takes no more than 15 minutes with no paper documents required from businessmen. For user identification, digital signatures are used and certain services may be obtained by using one-time passwords. Kazakhstan is one of few countries where a digital signature is issued absolutely free of charge and is recorded on a chip in national ID cards and also on the SIM cards of mobile handsets.</p><h4>How are new mobile apps developed and what savings do they generate for the government?</h4><p>Currently, Kazakhstan's e-Government is in the phase of migrating to the smart government model, which encompasses mobile technologies and open government. Now, users of iOS and Android operating systems can use the eGov.kz mobile app, through which they might obtain more than 50 of the most popular services on the e-Government Portal. It also contains a “Mobile Personal Cabinet," where all data on citizens is stored. For those citizens who still use the early-model mobile phones, SMS services have been implemented. All the aforementioned capabilities were created either by the government itself or under its order, while now we are turning to another model as platform. As part of developing the Open Government strategy in Kazakhstan, multiple government agencies' datasets are published on the open data portal, data.egov.kz. These may be the findings of inspections of agencies, reports, or industry statistics, for example. Such information had formerly been stored within government agencies and thought to be useless. From now on, under the Access to Information Law in Kazakhstan, which is being enacted, all government agencies are obliged to publish non-confidential information in machine-readable format and made available to the public. Based on this data, any programmer, developer, or student may create their own mobile apps or web services as a matter of convenience to citizens. Today, 325 open datasets are accessible on the data.egov.kz portal, while in the future this number will grow exponentially. As to saving through implementing mobile technologies, we count it within the overall notional saving through e-Government implementation. Compared to the 30 leading examples of e governance, our public sector's spending on IT, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD), is substantially lower. For instance, annual ICT spending in the public sector in the US is $75 billion, $9.1 billion in the UK, and $2.5 billion in Korea, while in Kazakhstan within 10 years of program implementation, the budget will be KZT190.5 billion ($1 billion), and will be used for consulting and creating departmental information systems. The basic e-Government components cost KZT26.7 billion. As a result of business process optimization and automation through saving paper, government employees' and citizens' time, and official document forms, the appropriate saving of budget funds amounted to about KZT70 billion. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The government, through the Ministry of ICT, will allocate more than Ps1 billion for the acquisition of tablets and computers for schools across the country within the "Computers to Educate" program. What is the long-term objective of this program?</h4><p>The Ministry of ICT, through the "Computers to Educate" program, seeks to contribute to strengthening the quality of education through technology. To achieve this, the Ministry allocated a budget of Ps1.4 billion between 2015 and 2019 to support the education of children and young Colombians. For this purpose, "Computers to Educate" developed a strategy that includes three aspects: the first is the delivery of technology to educational sites (tablets and laptops acquired through public auctions); the second is training teachers and principals through a certified course, where they will get a diploma, and giving them a tablet as a tool for their work, as well as training parents through the so-called ICT Family School; and, finally, the third aspect has to do with the use of electronic waste (obsolete computers) of previous benefactors, as part of our environmental commitment and responsibility. The goal for 2018 is to provide tablets to each one of the teachers in the country's public educational centers and qualify them with an ICT diploma.</p><h4>The coverage of digital terrestrial TV in Colombia has exceeded 70% of the national territory, with the aim to end analogue broadcasting in 2019. What are the advantages of digital terrestrial TV adaptation for Colombia?</h4><p>The implementation of digital terrestrial TV has a long list of technical benefits such as improved picture and sound quality and the possibility of increasing the number of channels through the multiple channel feature. However, the most important thing is what these technical advantages mean for the end users. This translates into better content and the ability to access information for free, changing the way Colombians watch television.</p><h4>The Ministry recently presented a Colombian documentary, "Operation Antarctica," a documentary that has been largely funded by the Ministry to attract offers for national public television. What other initiatives are under way?</h4><p>The government of President Juan Manuel Santos has made an unprecedented bid to strengthen public television. That effort has resulted in co-productions with world-renowned houses and domestic producers to continue to position public television with high quality content. Since 2010 the government has invested about Ps25 billion in multiplatform content, developed with the support of international production houses, with a scheme that is improving programming and public TV content. In addition, we have opted to strengthen the capacity of personnel involved in these large projects, promoting good practices in television production. 2016 will be no exception; we continue to focus on the development of a convergent strategy for our public television, increasing the production of local content and strengthening regional TV channels for users to find a wider range of content.</p><h4>On February 22, the World Mobile Operators Association (GSMA) recognized Colombia as the country with the best government strategy for managing spectrum for mobile broadband communications. What projects are lined up in this area for this 2016?</h4><p>This award was a recognition of Colombia's excellent management of spectrum. Our strategy aims to ensure the availability of this resource to support the growth of mobile broadband internet connections, which we project to have with the implementation of the “Plan Vive Digital." We have been making projections for spectrum requirements for the next 10 years and these are updated annually. This year plans to continue with this strategy of judiciously studying mobile spectrum needs for the coming years, with an additional component: the study of frequencies for the fifth generation of mobile communications and participation in 5G in international forums such as ITU and CITEL. Colombia expects to continue to have an important role in these discussions. These activities of international participation go hand in hand with the management of international agreements for the use of spectrum in several frequency bands to ensure proper provision of telecommunications services in the border areas. In the telecommunications area, in 2016 we have a major challenge; the auctioning of the 700 Mhz band, the most coveted spectrum by mobile operators thanks to its coverage characteristics and propagation. This process will ensure better telecommunication services for Colombians.</p><h4>The 2010 Vive Digital plan aimed at incorporating lower classes of society in the digital revolution. As a result, the country increased internet connections from 2.2 million in 2010 to 9.9 million in 2014. How do you evaluate the fact that Colombia is now one of the top countries for internet penetration in Latin America?</h4><p>The work that Colombia has done over the last five years makes us feel proud. We have worked hard to provide the country with the tools for the digital revolution. That's why this new phase of the Vive Digital plan is focused on people, to use current infrastructure for the development of applications, services, and tools to improve the quality of life of Colombians. We cannot rest on our laurels thinking about past achievements, we have to bring connectivity to the lower strata, to ensure that every citizen enjoys the benefits of being connected to the network, no matter what area of the country they are in. To do this we have an ambitious plan to grow from 12 million to 27 million internet connections by 2018. This will translate into millions of opportunities for Colombians to access new jobs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>There are plans to connect the railways of Azerbaijan and Iran by the end of 2016. How will this connection bring new benefits to Azerbaijan and the transport sector of the country?</h4><p>In February 2016, President Aliyev visited Iran and 11 agreements were signed. It was announced that a 8.3km section of the railway between the two countries and a railway bridge over the Astara River on the Azerbaijan-Iran state border will be completed in 2016. We are now in the process of designing it, and we have started looking for a contractor, although we may eventually build this bridge ourselves. This connection has many implications for our country and the transport sector in particular. This project will connect the Persian Gulf with Malacca Bay through a multimodal transport system, as well as provide a connection to St. Petersburg and Helsinki through older railways built back in Soviet times. We will be connected to Mumbai Port and Bandar Abbas Port. Current figures indicate that there are 5 million tons of cargo moving between India and Europe and about 7-9 million tons between Russia and Iran. We would enjoy the opportunity to be involved in some of this activity. There is a political will to achieve this and a willingness of the railways to help. In the first year of operation of the new railway, we are planning to transport 2-5 million tons of cargo, with plans to increase capacity up to 20 million tons in the future. This effort will require some renovations and we will need to see the construction of additional facilities alongside some new, technical solutions. This connection will boost Azerbaijan's currency inflow and work to create new employment opportunities for Azerbaijani citizens. If we can handle 2-5 million tons, we will be able to get $50-70 million and create 2,000-3,000 new jobs dealing with railways, maintenance, and so on. Iran also wants to establish a railway connection with Moscow and St. Petersburg.</p><h4>The first freight train recently completed the International Trans-Caspian route from China to Baku. How will this International Trans-Caspian transport route help Azerbaijan's plans to become a transport hub?</h4><p>In this project, we are creating a transport corridor that connects the East and West. It starts off in China, passes through Kazakhstan, the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukrainian ports, Bulgaria, and continues further along the Danube. Over the past 100-150 years, the majority of cargo has been shipped by sea, because it is usually a cheaper option. It is hard for railway transportation to beat sea transport; however, we can compete through the use of air carriers and trucks. It is challenging, but we believe that we will be able to win in this competition. With the new transport corridor connecting Mumbai to Europe, we will soon be able to deliver goods along this route in no more than 14 days at the most. In 2015, Kazakhstan processed 1.2 million tons of cargo from China, while we are just getting started in this activity. We will be working in collaboration with all of our neighboring countries in this capacity.</p><h4>What is the current progress of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway project?</h4><p>In regard to the BTK railway, there have been a lot of obstacles to the project because of the Armenian diaspora and the ongoing situation in that regard. There was an outcry that this BTK project leaves out Armenia, while we, an Azerbaijani company, started building this railway. With regards to the project's technical updates and specifications, we have almost completed 183km of the railway in Georgia; there are only some minor details that we need to finalize. Initially, this railway will handle 5 million tons of cargo and in the future the capacity will reach up to 17 million tons. The Georgian part of the project will be completed by the end of 2016. After the completion of the Georgian portion, the only part left to complete will be in Turkey, and ground works are almost finished there at this point.</p><h4>How can Azerbaijan's railways improve logistics capacity related to the county's exports and become an important source of non-oil revenue for Azerbaijan?</h4><p>It is no surprise that the oil and gas sector continues to play a huge role in the economy, but I believe that we need to diversify and focus on four main sectors: transit transportation, as this will allow Azerbaijan to transform into a transport hub; technologies and innovation; tourism; and agriculture. There is no country that can succeed without having a strong agriculture sector. The increased railway activity in Azerbaijan has the ability to improve the strength of important domestic sectors and can bring positive effects to ordinary people in the country.</p><h4>After transporting nearly 17 million tons of cargo in 2015, what are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The global economic situation is currently characterized by a period of decline. We are doing as much as we can at Azerbaijan Railways. We will continue our efforts to increase the amount of cargo over 2016. In 2014 we handled 21 million tons, mainly inside the country. The decrease in the amount of cargo can be explained by the devaluation of the national currency, decline in the domestic construction industry, and other related factors. The level of imports in the country was reduced as well. We are expecting the amount of cargo to surpass 25 million tons by 2025.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Due to protracted commodity price declines, the UAE has been reducing overspending, which has been slowing down economic activity. How can the UAE find the right balance between holding back public spending and maintaining healthy economic activity?</h4><p>The UAE is facing a similar challenge as other states in the region: maintaining economic activity at a time when spending needs to be adjusted to reduced oil revenues. That being said, the UAE is in a better position than many other countries because here you already have a more diversified economy. The non-oil economy is driven by factors like trade, tourism, and finance. In Dubai, for example, there is more or less the same level of economic activity, with a little softening, but much less than other parts of the country. Dubai is also at the beginning of a process that will, over the next four years, lead to Expo 2020. This will also support activity. The UAE has to continue with the strategy of relying primarily on the private sector to drive growth at a time when the government is going to have to scale back big construction and other projects. The UAE growth rate for 2016 is estimated to be 2.5%, which is above the GCC average. However, there is a distinction within that between the parts that are driven by oil and the parts that are not.</p><h4>Your growth projections for 2016 appear to be lower than that of the UAE government, which predicts 3.5%. Why is that?</h4><p>Growth in the UAE is essentially a combination of the oil economy and the non-oil economy. The non-oil economy in Dubai is expected to grow at a stronger pace than in Abu Dhabi, reflecting a cut back on big projects in the latter. Overall, it would be fantastic if growth ended up closer to the government's forecast. However, I have seen a little softening in the economy, both in Abu Dhabi and in Dubai, so at this stage I feel comfortable with our latest growth projection of 2.3%.</p><h4>Higher government revenue would create much-needed room for fiscal maneuvering. What are the correct steps the UAE should take toward tax revenues?</h4><p>We have been of the view that the UAE, and GCC countries more generally, all need to begin to develop non-oil based revenue sources. Among the most important instruments is the introduction of a VAT, which could be put into place in a coordinated way throughout the GCC. This could generate about 1.5% of additional GDP, based on our experience in other countries. So that would be a positive step. It would also be useful to explore whether some sort of low rate of corporate tax can be introduced. There are two things you need to consider in the GCC and UAE; these countries have substantial buffers they can draw on and do not have to make dramatic adjustments in terms of cutting back spending, raising taxes, or trying to reach a balanced budget overnight. That's why we think it's a perfectly sensible approach for the UAE to run fiscal deficits as they try to adjust only gradually to the new realities of oil prices. In doing so, they have to be careful about how they finance those deficits, because if you finance the deficit disproportionately from the domestic banking system, you could create liquidity shortages in the banking system, which may then have a knock-on impact on credit availability for the private sector at a time when you want the private sector to be more active. So instead it may make sense to draw on your assets and also borrow internationally. These various financing options need to be balanced. The other thing to do is to find ways of protecting the more vulnerable in society during the adjustment. For example, if you raise electricity tariffs and rates, you need to consider making that increase proportional to energy use and income levels.</p><h4>Earlier this year, IMF head Christine Lagarde stressed the importance of the financial services sector as a crucial component in the growth and diversification plans of the UAE. What do you think about this?</h4><p>Financial services certainly are an important sector in the UAE's diversification strategy. Of course, the banking system will be facing a more challenging environment going forward, because banks won't be able to rely as much on government deposits and will have to mobilize their own deposits. Liquidity will be tighter because of that, and borrowing costs are going up as risk appetite goes down. US rates are also edging up. All of that will have an impact. But all in all, banks are starting from a strong place in terms of capital and liquidity, and they should be able to manage that. The UAE also has the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC), which is a very good example of how you can create a hub inside the UAE or any GCC country that serves as a magnet to attract financial companies and also other companies that seek to establish themselves in the UAE and have a regional presence as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What actions has the Ministry of Energy taken to support the oil industry in the face of falling commodity prices?</h4><p>The operations of companies engaged in the oil and gas business in Kazakhstan focus on the implementation of social programs on a regional and national scale. Issues of protection of the oil extracting and petrochemical industries as well as the preservation of jobs remain among the top priorities of the Ministry of Energy. High volatility of global hydrocarbon prices observed over the recent year and a half still exerts a negative influence. Over the course of 2015, the Ministry has maintained day-to-day monitoring of oil extraction and a system-wide monitoring of global oil prices. It also promptly responded to emerging challenges with a view to ensuring the continuous operation of companies. It should also be noted that the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan has cut export customs duty for oil from $60 down to $40 as of January 2016. Currently, concerned state agencies and organizations have agreed on a scale of rates of export oil custom duties with reference to global oil prices, and it is expected that this measure will be approved by late February 2016.</p><h4>What opportunities have opened up for the local power sector as a result of the floating of the tenge? Are there any emerging attractions for FDI in the sector?</h4><p>Switching to a floating exchange rate has entailed the devaluation of the national currency, the tenge, which has undoubtedly affected companies in the electrical energy industry. Power generating equipment is delivered to Kazakhstan mainly from Russia, Ukraine, Germany, France, and China. The devaluation of the national currency means higher prices for spare parts and power engineering equipment from foreign manufacturers, and consequently power-engineering companies have to channel more funds into the procurement of equipment. The scheduled upgrade of production facilities at a number of major enterprises envisages the procurement of high quantities of foreign equipment, which will affect value increase and ultimately cost of production and financial performance of companies. As for attraction of FDI into the power-generating sector of Kazakhstan, it is necessary to mention new opportunities for potential investors to participate in the upcoming privatization plans, which have been announced by the government of Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How do you assess the potential of Kazakhstan's renewable energy resources?</h4><p>Experts estimate the potential of renewable energy resources in Kazakhstan to be at around 1 trillion kWh a year. In line with the concept of changing over to a green economy, the government has set a goal for expanding renewable energy to 3% of the total by 2020, to 10% by 2030, and to 50% by 2050, including wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear stations. Looking ahead, the 2020 development plan for alternative and renewable energy in Kazakhstan has been approved with venues, investors, and deadlines for the implementation of projects totaling at an aggregate capacity of 3,054.55 MW. Moreover, Kazakhstan has outlined clear development indicators for the renewable energy resources sector with a view to ensuring better planning for accounting and systems. Today, the electricity generated from renewable energy resources accounts for less than 1% of the total generation volume in 2015 (exclusive of hydroelectric power plants with capacity above 35MW). Overall, electricity generation from renewable energy resources in 2015 totaled 704 million kWh. It should be pointed out that Kazakhstan has just agreed to the use of renewable energy resources but that development horizons have been outlined, so the task of the Ministry of Energy is to enable Kazakhstan's switch to the green economy and integration of renewable energy resources into the national electrical grid. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Kazakh beer market started to fall at the end of 2015. How do you expect the market will fare in  2016?</h4><p>The Kazakh beer market was restored to its 2012 level in 2014; however, it is difficult to speculate about the market because in 2015 it began to shrink again. We forecast a fall in 2016 as well at an even more serious pace. Over the last two to three years, we have seen toughening state regulations on the beer industry. In 2014, amendments were passed that banned advertisements even for non-alcoholic beer. Beer consumption per capita is 25 liters. In comparison to Russia, where the beer market is also falling, per capita consumption in 2014 was 55 liters. Due to the developed brewing industry in Kazakhstan, we are the only company in Central Asia to successfully produce malt, through the company Soufflet Kazakhstan.</p><h4>Carlsberg is growing in Kazakhstan and at a rapid rate. How do you keep growing despite a declining market?</h4><p>Our path to success was not smooth. In 2010, sales volumes of Carlsberg Kazakhstan <br>fell and reached a historic low by 2013. Our corporate culture is engrained with principles dedication to the company and teamwork. Thus, 2013-2014 was declared a time for sales. It was difficult, because during this period our reputation in the labor market was not the best and people did not want to join us. We focused on our personnel in the retail channel and brought in managers from Ukraine and Russia to organize our commercial and operational functions. Kazakhstan is a huge country, and it is not possible to use a one-size-fits-all approach for consumer needs. We worked out an assortment for every single region. In 2015, we entered with full confidence in success, and by the end of the year the market share of Carlsberg was 33.2%, which was up 3.2% compared to 2014. We have regained the market share we had four years ago. Overall, our competitive advantage is that we produce a quality product. We responsibly purchase our malt and hops and we extract water from our own wells. </p><h4>Why do many companies facing crises have problems with distributors?</h4><p>We have had problems with distributors even in favorable periods. In 2013, we audited our distributors, defining the quality of their services in retail. We made conclusions and replaced about a fourth of distributors who were not innovative. We also changed our pricing model, allowing large revenues on the brands that are in demand in remote regions of the country. Our partners met our needs and we opened more than 20 new logistics centers all over the country. The model we use now is the best for us. We want to expand our portfolio of distributors with more contracts. Our relations are built only on mutual benefits, trust, and motivation toward joint development.</p><h4>What project of Carlsberg's was particularly successful in 2015?</h4><p>It was indisputably our social-ecological Irbis project, which aimed at preserving the Kazakh population of the snow leopard, known locally as Irbis, and received a large and positive social response. It was a partnership with the Kazakh Association for Preserving Biodiversity. During the project, we financed three expeditions to the Dzhungarsky Alatau Mountains where scientists installed 50 photo-traps. It is expected, that the data received from these photo-traps will help local scientists to precisely count the number of snow leopards in the area and will foster effective measures of protection of the animal.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We originally planned to reach an optimal business index in four to five years, but now we see  we can do that in a shorter period of time. I follow the position that any stressful condition within the market it is an opportunity. My teams and I, whom I have worked with during such periods, have always managed to be the leaders. I have no doubts that this time we will work even better. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[thirsty-for-more]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the idea behind producing bottled water to start your operations in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>It all began in 1998. At that time, I was 20 years old, fluent in Chinese, and had never been involved in manufacturing. I thought that bottling water was possibly the easiest thing to do. In 1998, we started producing bottled water in 19-liter plastic bottles, or what are known as office water containers. In 2004, we were the market leaders in the office water segment, and the company had about 400 employees. In 2003, we decided to start producing iced tea. We were the first to obtain the technology for producing iced tea in Kazakhstan, and until 2008 we had no competitors in the country. In 2011, our annual profit was approximately $40 million, and in 2012 it reached $80 million. Nestlé expressed interest in our business, and since 2013 we have been bottling for the company and we are responsible for distribution. From a quality standpoint, Nestlé has helped us reach international standards when it comes to our products. Thanks to government support, we managed to obtain a loan in tenge with a favorable interest rate. This allowed the domestic soft drinks industry to start exporting products to neighboring countries such as Russia and Kyrgyzstan.</p><h4>Innovation and high-quality equipment are key aspects of Galanz's success. How are you maintaining such a high standard of quality?</h4><p>There is a Franco-Italian company, Sidel, which has a factory in Parma producing equipment for the soft drinks industry. The factory provided us with equipment worth $8 million. Thanks to the new equipment, we were able to bottle soft drinks with fruit pulp. For example, there is a brand Aloe Vera, of which we are the only producers here in Kazakhstan and, perhaps, across the entire CIS. We bring raw materials from Vietnam, use Korean technology, and actually have some Korean employees. In fact, we also help to sell this drink to Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, and Russia. The next challenge is to sell large amounts of our products, and to do that you need a lot of refrigerators. Given that Kazakhstan recently joined the Customs Union, suppliers of refrigerators now have to pay higher taxes, which more than doubled from 10% to 25%. When you import a refrigerator from China, Turkey, or elsewhere, you have to spend a lot of money on taxes and logistics, almost doubling the price. We need a huge amount of such fridges, perhaps around 60,000, and at the same time we do not have sufficient resources for that. We also provide retail chains with refrigerators for free, so this year we built a factory to produce them locally. </p><h4>How is the current economic downturn affecting your business?</h4><p>Many of the effects are psychological. We expected devaluation but did not expect it to the extent that we have experienced. We were doing business in Russia, and it was the first country to go through devaluation shock. This is just part of the cycle, and there is no one to blame for it, but we need to work together to overcome it. The crisis has actually been a good opportunity to change our business for the better. It is important for the government and businesses to work hand in hand. Complaints will not help; therefore, we need to stay positive. We noticed a decline in production over 2015 compared to the previous year. The end of 2015 was particularly stressful in this sense. We understand that 2016 will be harder than 2015, and we are considering ways to cut down expenses without raising the prices of local brands. However, we expect that sales in 2016 will drop by 20%. As for exports, the share in total output stands at around 10%. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>KazPetroDrilling has clients among some of Kazakhstan's largest energy players, such as KazMunayGas, Tengizchevroil, and Maersk Oil. What services do you offer these companies?</h4><p>KazPetroDrilling is the largest service holding company in Kazakhstan. Our main service is drilling, as we have three drilling companies within our holding company. Our drilling companies are not solely involved in drilling work; they also do hydrofracturing services for our customers on a turnkey basis. We also provide well cementing, mud, and geophysical services for companies that are drilling. Our group includes companies, such as ZhigerMunaiService. They provide other oil service products and manufacture oil equipment, such as fishing tools. Essentially, everything involved in the servicing of oil and gas extraction is covered.</p><h4>What are some of the oil field services most in demand from energy companies in Kazakhstan today?</h4><p>In terms of products and services, the construction of wells is most in demand. With new technologies and methods of drilling and constructing wells becoming available in Kazakhstan, it is more popular to drill horizontal, rather than vertical wells. Another challenge for Kazakh oil companies, and their service companies, is drilling in deeper fields. Currently, only large projects such as Kashagan, Tengiz, and Karachaganak are working on deep fields. However, smaller, private projects are starting the exploration process using pad drilling in deep fields of over 5,000m. It is a challenge to construct wells in these deeper fields, as complicated and expensive equipment is required. KazPetroDrilling sees potential in this area in the future. We have already assembled a 2,500 hp heavy drilling rig SL-2500 in our facility in Atyrau that can drill to 6,000m. The second area we see potential in for the future is working on existing wells to maintain or increase production for companies of all sizes, including the private, smaller oil production companies. Here, we are talking about providing services such as hydrofracturing and work-overs for existing wells. We believe many companies will increase their demand for these types of services in the near future.</p><h4>How is KazPetroDrilling overcoming the challenges from a difficult year for energy markets? </h4><p>Times are tough at the moment for service companies. We have to respond to current conditions, and we believe the way to do this is to optimize our efficiency and work with our clients to construct wells at lower expense. There is a lot of pressure on companies. In 3Q2015, KazMunayGas (KMG) announced that it is only drilling economic wells. There are a number of technical operational measures that can be taken for optimization, such as using new technologies to drill faster and buying the latest rigs. We are also looking to optimize KazPetroDrilling's internal processes, by using new HR and corporate programs and processes to improve efficiency and control expenditure.</p><h4>What are your expectations for KazPetroDrilling in 2016?</h4><p>We do not believe the market will change much in 2016, and, therefore, we will have another tough year. Our first challenge is to maintain our current position and find ways to save using technology and training. We will take this difficult period as an opportunity to reshape and improve our internal processes to meet the new challenges. Going forward, one of our strategic goals is to expand our activities into neighboring countries' markets, starting with Russia. There is competition; however, when we compare KazPetroDrilling's companies against the larger drilling companies in Russia, we are competitive. The second factor is that there are no trade borders now due to the economic union between Kazakhstan and Russia. As a first step, we have acquired a small Russian company in the BV Group that provides engineering support for horizontal well drilling. </p>]]></richbody0content>

We are developing in different areas now. When we first started it was mainly in the oil and gas business, and now we have a strong presence in the construction business, both in superstructure and infrastructure. We are increasing our presence in different geographies in Kazakhstan. Of course the crisis in Kazakhstan has affected us, and we have fewer new requests coming in. We are taking part at Expo 2017, which is currently a major investment area for the government. We are looking into new products and services cooperating with different parties, particularly the municipalities. Transportation has been developing well and we are taking part in the Astana LRT Project. Astana LRT is a large railway project but it also takes into account all the transportation systems in Astana, including road repair inspections, laboratory tests, and public bus inspections. When it comes to the manufacturing sector we have increased our number of clients in different areas, mainly in management certification, and we have started working in cooperation with Kazak Railways, providing it with different services.</p><h4>What sectors of the economy possess the greatest growth potential in the near future?</h4><p>Digital technology is going to develop rapidly in Kazakhstan in different areas. In terms of infrastructure, these industries require new equipment for area such as road construction, railways, and even airports. Infrastructure needs to develop and reflect advances in construction techniques. We will also soon see advances in the oil and gas sector because they have many new structures in place now. These structures are going to require repairs and renewals and maintenance. Power will also emerge as important as renewable energy becomes increasingly sought after.</p><h4>What challenges do international companies face while investing in Kazakhstan? </h4><p>The main challenge for all international companies including us is human resources. The work permit process is both long and strict, and it is getting more difficult each year. On one hand this is good for the country, but on the other hand, if you want to develop, you need to have some expatriates to share experiences. I can also understand the government's point of view, as some of the companies do not bring anything of worth, just flying people in and having them leave as soon as they finish the job. There is no real sharing of information in this. However companies like us, which are dedicated to developing the country and to staying here for as long as possible, approach work from a different perspective. When it comes to the oil and gas sectors, I do not see a major problem aside from international oil prices. Kazakhstan has a good strategy for oil and gas. <br>In construction, the main obstacle is the standards used today, as they are different from recognized international standards and not fully answering the requirements for new technologies. There is a scheme to develop this that remains unfinished, but Kazakhstan, especially with preparation for the Expo, is constructing much larger and taller buildings than before, and as a result clearly requires improved standards. We are able to share our international experience, which is an important benefit for our partners. Bureau Veritas is one of the biggest and oldest testing, inspection, and certification (TIC) companies in the world. We are able to bring our international knowledge but provide local services to our clients, with good local understanding and knowledge of local standards and regulations, which is an important factor for our clients for selecting us. Our short-term goal is to develop our infrastructure here, and to continue with operations in the oil and gas sector. Our major construction projects have already begun. We will diversify ourselves soon to railways, and increasingly into the transportation and energy sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major successes for Forbes Kazakhstan over the past few years?</h4><p>The main success has been opening the Forbes publication here in Kazakhstan, as the partners at the main office were initially skeptical. They offered a 50/50 deal to publish the business climate stories and all other related information from both the main office and globally. Forbes is highly regarded by businessmen here, as they realize the importance of its content and the conversations it generates. It is an important component of the business sector. At first, it was difficult to get businesses to buy in, but they have realized how important it is for them to share information. They are given the opportunity to discuss topics such as the successes of young businessmen and related start-ups. </p><h4>Do you believe that the readers of Forbes in Kazakhstan are as interested in the business locally as they are internationally?</h4><p>The local business people are more interested in the local information for their respective businesses, though international interest stories are also translated and published in the magazine. Forbes is a great publication to use as a guide for the business climate in terms of both local and global business, especially for those wanting to stay up-to-date on the latest information. Forbes is beneficial for new businesses, and it also has a healthy working relationship with the government that proves useful in providing insight on government projects, which is important to our local readers. Having the magazine circulated locally shows our readers that there is room for investment abroad, and this holds high potential for the local sector. It has been remarkable to see the effect of such a strong brand in the country, and it has a significant influence with the readers. It is an incentive for them to match the global brands since Forbes is a big name. The bigger the name the better it is, and we are working to be similar to the Forbes all over the world. </p><h4>With such great insight into the local economy, how would you assess the current business climate in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The economy in the country is not easy right now, as we are experiencing a sort of crisis. Because of this crisis, it is difficult to conduct business, and a lot of this is attributed to the situation in Russia and Ukraine. Oil prices and the currency drop have also been problematic for business. I started my business in the 1990s and we have established ourselves in the market, which has allowed us to learn to adjust in a turbulent local economy. In the 1990s it was difficult, and in Russia the ruble was new, making it difficult to transfer money with the different currencies. All of the currency exchanges had to be checked, and during that time it was a complicated process. The current issue and environment is no less severe than that situation. </p><h4>How does media play a role during these times, and what trends are you noticing in this sector?</h4><p>The media sector is also facing problems here in Kazakhstan because many companies are not advertising like they did in the past. Prices have risen 20-30%, and most of the media companies are laying people off or closing entirely in order to cut costs. This crisis has its advantages, however, as the price of advertisements has decreased, which will hopefully translate into attracting more advertisers in the coming year as the economy begins to pick up again. Our greatest expectation for the year ahead is to remain stable, and for business to continue as usual for a respected magazine. We are hoping that the economic situation will improve so that our business and dealings with the media will be more profitable than this year. It is also a priority to continue to share important information with our readers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the evolution of the business environment in Kazakhstan over the past decade?</h4><p>Over the past decade, the business climate in Kazakhstan has improved despite the challenges entailed by the global financial and economic crises of recent years. For many years, Kazakhstan had average annual growth of 5-10% propelled by the country's dominant oil industry. The government understands that a positive business environment is necessary to attract foreign investment, but there are still many impediments. Economic diversification is a necessity, though it has proven a challenge, as it has for many countries with oil-fuelled economies. Creating a broad-based economy is a government priority and there have been some successes, but there are areas where the economy could, and should, improve, notably agriculture, where Kazakhstan has all the prerequisites for a robust agriculture and agribusiness industry.<br>Foreign investors have been attracted to areas such as consumer products, logistics, training, consulting, and tourism. The hospitality industry is strong with many global leaders in the luxury hotel industry represented in Almaty and Astana, where business is centered and international conferences are plentiful. There are many other areas of the economy that could benefit from foreign investment and be of interest to investors in search of new markets.</p><h4>Which sectors are currently the most attractive for investors?</h4><p>The oil industry is always attractive, but is well established with a 25-year history behind it. The major oil companies from North America, Europe, and Asia and their supporting oilfield service providers have been in Kazakhstan for a long time. Given that the price of oil is currently volatile and under extreme pressure, now is not the right moment for oil companies or their related services to enter the market. Looking at other areas of the economy, Kazakhstan has an endless appetite for consumer goods of all types and the means to pursue a solid middle-class lifestyle, even a luxurious lifestyle for those who have benefitted from economic growth. The areas that traditionally have performed well are continuing to be the most attractive for foreign investment. Agriculture is an industry that Kazakhstan could excel in given its climate and vast, yet under-utilized territory; provided that agriculture receives a good balance of investment and planning, it will be critical to reducing the country's reliance on food imports and establishing a firm basis for self-sufficiency and food security.</p><h4>Where can reforms be implemented to facilitate the country's economic growth?</h4><p>Kazakhstan has a strong reform agenda and is continuing to implement reforms in many areas that would be helpful not only to foreign investors, but also to local investors. However, there are some crucial areas that continue to be in need of fundamental reform. First and foremost this refers to the country's judicial system, which is still struggling to emerge from the post-Soviet mold—judges are not always well-qualified, nor independently appointed, and tend to issue judgments in support of the government, rather than recognizing the merits of investor cases. Many of these disputes relate to tax issues, where systemic reform is needed to remove legislative inconsistencies that repeatedly bring the same issues back to the courts again and again. Tax legislation changes frequently, yet these changes too often cause more difficulty and more uncertainty, rather than removing difficulties. Every business needs a reliable legal environment in which it can operate. Investors value stability—not just in taxes, but also in everything relating to their business operations. One impending change in the country's tax legislation is of particular concern to foreign investors. Kazakhstan intends to abolish VAT and introduce a sales tax model on January 1, 2017—a fundamental change that most investors oppose. VAT is used throughout the EU and is recognized as a model for economically developed countries. AmCham, its members, and many other businesses in Kazakhstan are discussing the pros and cons of this change with the government, and are offering expert tax advice from international sources, including the OSCE to ensure that whatever changes may be made to conform to best international practices. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is Almaty to the whole of Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The city accounts for 20% of the country's total GDP, and considering the drop in oil prices, now almost 30% of the national income comes from Almaty. Almost 40% of all trading, credits, and deposits, basically all finances, are done in Almaty; 90% of the headquarters of all financial institutions in Kazakhstan are located in Almaty; 15% of SMEs are located here, accounting for half the city's income. Almaty is quite sustainable because SMEs are very flexible, they can adjust to new challenges, they create new job and innovation opportunities, and they can find new niches for new businesses. Around 35% of all businesses in Almaty are in the service sector, including finance and tourism, so it's a service-oriented city and is in that sense quite sustainable. The average age of the city's 1.6 million people is 37, so it is quite young and also represents a large internal market within Kazakhstan, which attracts many opportunities and businesses. Furthermore, one out of every three students in Kazakhstan studies in Almaty. By the end of last year, gross regional product (GRP) per capita in Almaty was $29,000, which means we are talking about a high purchasing power and quality of life, as well as higher living standards.</p><h4>As you begin your term as the Mayor of Almaty, what do you identify as the biggest challenges facing the city and how do you plan to overcome them?</h4><p>We recently published the Almaty 2020 City Development Program, which is one of the first regional development programs to be openly discussed. President Nursultan Nazarbayev has declared five institutional reforms, which involve 100 concrete steps aimed at bringing Kazakhstan into compliance with OECD standards. Furthermore, in line with the Kazakhstan 2050 strategy, we aim to be among the 30 most efficient countries in the world. That means the whole economy and the mentality of our people has to be reoriented and refocused according to the new standards. Some people claim that this plan is too ambitious, but when you look back at the founding of Kazakhstan 24 years ago, we had a GDP per capita of $600. Since then, we have grown tremendously, which is why this is a realistic target. Our President's strategy for success is simple: economics first, then politics. His priority has always been to create a liberal market economy and to have peaceful relations with all countries, and he worked hard to welcome new cadres and personnel who were flexible enough to accept new challenges and new ways of thinking so as to achieve these goals. When people ask what the key to Kazakhstan's miracle was, I always refer back to 1995 when the President adopted a legislative package of 137 new laws. He brought younger, more open, more flexible people into government who understood and accepted his vision and these sweeping changes, and helped implement them. That was how Kazakhstan's new economy came about. Now, we are instituting a second stage of reforms. These are institutional reforms, in fact they will lead to the creation of whole new institutions, and they are quality-based reforms as well. There are five institutional reforms that are part of this package. The first reform envisions a new model for the civil service, one that is more responsible and more transparent, is client-oriented, and abides by the supremacy of law; the second brings changes to the judicial system; the third, diversification of the economy; the fourth, new patriotism; and the fifth, open and transparent government and a responsible and active civil society. We created a national commission to pursue the implementation of these reforms, and a whole package of new legislation is on the way. All of these reform processes have a direct connection to Almaty. Almaty is a liberal city, a city of NGOs, businesses, and active citizenship. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What level of interest is KASE seeing from international investors?</h4><p>We have met with several international stock exchanges and we are now trying to see how we can increase awareness among global investors. Another crucial aspect of our development is to increase our transparency in order to help international investors in obtaining all of the necessary information they need for the related investment decision. There are more than 130 companies listed on KASE, but very few of them are liquid. The KASE index consists of stocks of nine leading companies in Kazakhstan. We have an interactive and informative site that offers all necessary information about our stocks, and we are also working closely with Bloomberg and Reuters to increase our visibility. KASE has recently been classified as “Frontier" by MSCI and S&amp;P Dow Jones, and working towards inclusion into the FTSE frontier market indexes. We have plans for the development of the KASE within the International Financial Center Astana, which has the potential to become a major financial hub for the Central Asian region, with English as its official language. It will be established based on the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) model, focusing on capital markets, asset management, private banking, and Islamic finance. In close cooperation with our colleagues from Dubai we aim to reach new heights for the subsequent sustainable development of KASE.</p><h4>In 2015, you allowed the first transaction in yuan. What was behind this move?</h4><p>Investors can now trade with yuan, in addition to US dollars, ruble, and euros. As we are seeing a surge of trade between Kazakhstan and China, there was also a need for this currency exchange option. We organized yuan-tenge operations to be posted on the stock exchange. Compared to the Chinese market, the volume is tiny, but it is growing. These currency operations will increase in volume in the future because trade between Kazakhstan and China is growing. By means of launching the trade in Chinese yuan on KASE, a simplification in the mutual conversion is planned, which is an important factor to increase the trade between two countries. Recently, we held a China-Central Asia capital markets forum, during which KASE has signed an MoU with the Shanghai Stock Exchange.</p><h4>How is the stock exchange overcoming the challenges of low oil prices and currency devaluation?</h4><p>Although there are more than 100 companies listed on KASE with either shares or bonds, the market capitalization is only around 12% GDP of Kazakhstan, which is low in comparison with other domestic markets, where this indicator reaches 30-40% and 500-800% in international financial centers. Currently, there is a significant outflow of investors from emerging markets both here and elsewhere. The current exchange rate of the tenge is established by demand. After depreciation in the tenge the cost of investments for foreign companies working in Kazakhstan and using the tenge becomes beneficial when they export goods in dollars to other countries. It makes Kazakhstan a more attractive place for investment. The free-floating local currency by itself cannot attract foreign investors. That said, the cost of some assets decreased due to the devaluation, and theoretically investors should be keen on investing in such assets. In reality, we see that the key indicator for investors is trust in the local currency and predictability of its behavior, and that drives them to invest in assets nominated in it. On a separate note, share market trading volumes have shown a drastic increase of 774.5% due to the placement of KazMunayGas JSC shares, while market capitalization increased almost threefold, from $21 billion on August 5, 2015 to $61 billion on August 6. This placement accounts for 85.8% of the trading volume in the first nine months of 2015. However, we need to improve market stability and reduce volatility. We expect that after big shocks and moves, there will be a period of stabilization, and later a period of growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What segments of the market are you targeting?</h4><p>Forte Bank is currently the third-largest bank in the country in terms of capital. We want to make sure that our customer base of SMEs, corporate clients, and retail clients all understand this and are ready to continue to do business with us. The bank's portfolio is approximately 60% retail, with the remainder consisting of corporate and SME clients. As part of our branding we segmented the bank and created three targeted business segments within the bank. We have Forte Bank, which is the largest part and covers the retail segment. The other segment is Forte Business. That was created at the end of 2014, and started at the beginning of 2015 with a specific focus on SME clients, later growing rapidly. We also have Forte Corporate, which is focused on large quasi-sovereign companies and international companies. In the mid-term we see ourselves as a universal bank in Kazakhstan providing best-in-class services to all the three core customer segments. </p><h4>How do you envision the Kazakhstani banking sector evolving in the medium term and where do you see Forte Bank within that outlook?</h4><p>The Kazakhstani banking sector underwent great difficulties in 2015 and at the beginning of 2016, which was quite a shock for the whole economy. When you move from having fixed exchange rates to having a floating exchange rate the effect on the economy can last for an extended period. It is normal for an economy to adjust to major reforms, and this is never something that happens overnight. We feel that the sector has already adjusted quickly to the changes that have occurred. We feel that performance of the banking sector in general is a good reflection of the performance of the economy, so if an economy is growing well, then banks will perform well. We believe in the potential of the economy of Kazakhstan, and this is why we have invested in this project. </p><h4>What are the bank's top strategic priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>Last year we made a profit of approximately KZT8 billion. These numbers are due to be finalized by our auditors, but we feel that we are probably the third or fourth largest bank in the country by profitability. To achieve that in the first year after restructuring, after merging three banks and carrying out all the operational work that needed to be done is quite a success. We feel that 2016 should be a year of improving our internal efficiency, because even though a lot was done in 2015 and our systems were combined, we feel that there is a huge amount of automation that can still be done and improvements that can be made from within. The aim of increasing this efficiency is to ensure our front office staff are focused on providing services for our clients, rather than collecting information or creating reports or reviewing charts. We want that work to be automated and the front office staff to become real banking consultants where they can actually spend time with the clients. We are also going to implement a lot of changes for our clients in 2016 with brand new internet and mobile banking platforms and new retail and SME banking products to be introduced this year. We are also going to be opening new offices this year for both ForteBank and ForteBusiness offering completely different levels of service to our clients. In general we see this year as a year of preparation for when business picks up in 2017-18. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the most significant foreign policy successes of 2015, and what is Kazakhstan's role internationally? </h4><p>A key task for Kazakhstan remains the reinforcement of favorable external conditions in order to continue the course of reforms. The year 2015 was filled with events that once again confirmed the objectivity of principles of foreign activities of our nation: a multiple-vector approach, harmony, pragmatism, and the firm upholding of national interests. Along with that, the formation of a new architecture of security and geopolitical balance of powers accompanied by the deteriorating manageability of global processes requires from Kazakhstan the adaptation of new foreign political approaches and its more pro-active involvement in the settlement of global and regional problems. In this regard, Kazakhstan's diplomacy will intensify in its efforts to peacefully settle heated regional conflicts. Kazakhstan's admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) opens up new opportunities for closer integration into global economic cooperation but simultaneously offers a new challenge to the competitive ability of the domestic economy. We strive to reinforce trust between countries because the deterioration of political relations almost simultaneously entails the disruption of economic ties. The most demonstrative example in that regard is the current cooling in relations between Russia and Turkey. Furthermore, we can become an integration hub for linking projects of the Eurasian Economic Union, the Silk Road Economic Belt, and the EU. We are open to anyone who sees fruitful cooperation on a win-win principle as his mission. This is the essence of our multi-vector policy. In the borderless space of the Great Steppe we have managed to build a modern, successful, and peaceful state.</p><h4>How can Kazakhstan capitalize on the increasing global economic significance of Asian countries, and what is the country's relationship like with this region?</h4><p>In the context of growing global economic significance of oriental countries, in particular China, Kazakhstan can accrue significant benefit. As for China, their project Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB) within the initiative One Belt, One Road (OBOR) is interesting for Kazakhstan and we are already engaged in active cooperation to promote that project. We have all the prerequisites to create a uniform transnational transit and transportation network between Kazakhstan and China. The joint logistic terminal in the Port of Lianyungang, which in the future will link seaports in the Caspian Sea and Baltic Sea, will exert significant influence on growth of cargo transportations between Kazakhstan and China. We have set up a joint enterprise China-Kazakhstan International Logistics Company of Lianyungang incorporated on 24 June 2014 in Lianyungang. Authorized capital of the joint venture makes $68.8 million with a 51% stake ($35.1 million) in its authorized capital owned by Lianyungang Port Co., and 49% ($33.7 million) by KTZ Express. Overall, in the first five months of 2015, the port handled containers exceeded 65,000 TEUs and stored 193,000 tons of bulk cargo. Revenues from operating activities of the joint venture for the above-mentioned period made KZT213 million ($1.1 million). Additionally, Astana and Seoul are interested in intensifying mutually beneficial economic relations. The total volume of Southern Korean investments into our economy has exceeded $3.7 billion. Overall, South Korean companies have been involved in the implementation of 24 projects for a total amount of nearly $7.8 billion.</p><h4>What sectors are the most promising for foreign investment over the medium term, and what are you expecting for 2016 in terms of inflows?</h4><p>It is no secret that the priority development field for Kazakhstan's economy is diversification. Priority sectors include six segments of the processing industry; metallurgy, chemistry, petrochemicals, mechanical engineering, building materials, and food processing. Moreover, for investors in priority sectors, a separate package of investment privileges and preferences has been prepared to include stable laws, tax privileges, compensation of up to 30% of capital costs of an investor, and the streamlined import of foreign manpower. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>It was a notable year for Kazakhstan in 2015, with a number of significant events taking place over the course of the year. Firstly, we celebrated the 20th Anniversary of the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan. It was a year that marked the unity of our people, and once again we could recognize the peaceful coexistence of the 17 religious denominations and over 100 ethnic groups living in our country. We also celebrated the 20th anniversary of our Constitution this year, a document that remains the most important guarantor of the nation's growth, adopted by a referendum in 1995. Thirdly, we celebrated the Kazakh Khanate's 550th Anniversary, an era which still defines our people's destiny. </p><p>Now, on the 23rd Anniversary of its independence, Kazakhstan has become a strong state. Despite the complicated situation in global markets at present, our gross domestic product increased by 4.3% over the past year. We have completed the first five-year plan of our industrial innovation program. We have used 770 new products, created 75,000 jobs, and manufactured 400 new products that did not previously exist in Kazakhstan. We expect that during the second five-year plan, an additional 7,500 jobs will be made available through 75 new programs.</p><p>In 2014, we adopted the Nurly Zhol program. Our goal here is to restore the nation's transport infrastructure. We held an expanded government meeting to adapt the program to the external economic situation, and at this meeting we scrutinized and discussed the working plan. This program is an effective tool for tackling the negative influence of external factors on the economy. It will help attract investment as well as create new products and jobs. Around KZT500 billion was allocated for 2015 and for each additional year until 2017.<br>We also reviewed processing in agriculture, engineering, support for the small- and medium-sized businesses, infrastructure development, increase of public support for the industries, and market protection. We expect the growth of Made in Kazakhstan branded products. In this regard, the government of Kazakhstan will submit recommendations to the Parliament on budget expenditure optimization. The government's social obligations to the people will not end. We believe that the development of healthcare, education, and investment in human capital over the long term will become a basis for the future economic growth of our country. According to the Nurly Zhol program, infrastructural development in Kazakhstan will later affect global economic trends. Experts forecast that the trade turnover in Europe and Asia will reach 60% by 2020. We are acting with this in mind.</p><p>This year, Kazakhstan's part in the Western Europe-Western China project construction will be completed. This represents a 2,700km highway that will reduce delays in the delivery of goods from China to Europe from 45 to 10 days. Kazakhstan's railway system will become a key part of broader land transportation options on the Eurasian continent, too. It connects the Caspian Sea to the Pacific Ocean, and China to Central Asian countries and Western Europe. We have recently witnessed the launch of the major Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Iran railway project. All these measures are aimed at improving Kazakhstan's regional transport communication.<br>In 2015, new laws entered into force aimed at helping foreign investors. The industrial and innovative development program, Nurly Zhol, as well as EXPO-2017, will create the most effective and favorable conditions possible for the development of large combined projects with our foreign partners. <br>Elsewhere, 2015 was marked by the growth of dangerous threats and challenges on a global scale. Today there can be no doubt that terrorism has become a global problem and that the whole world should unite to counteract it. Kazakhstan strongly condemns all forms of terrorism and extremism and fully participates in international efforts to tackle this evil. We are ready to further strengthen our interactions with the world community to overcome this. When countering radicalism and terrorism, it is vital not to confuse the destructive ideologies on which they are based with traditional peaceful Islam and other religious beliefs. The fostering of sustainable inter-cultural and inter-religious dialog is essential to the fight against extremism. Kazakhstan makes a strong contribution to the development of inter-cultural and inter-religious links and conversations. The Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, which was initiated by our country, has become a recognized international platform for dialog. This has truly been a year that has encouraged deep reflection and frank conversation about the present international security situation.<br>The present crisis of confidence in international relations not only weakens the capacity of all states to overcome today's challenges, but also increases the threat of global military conflict. Given the growth of conflict flashpoints in the world, it is essential for us to strengthen the international security system. Firstly, restoring confidence and building a more stable world order is essential for reaffirming the fundamental principles of international law. It is critical that every country, without exception, adheres to its obligations under international agreements and treaties. Kazakhstan stands for confirmation of the principles of equality, mutual consideration of each other's interests, collective endeavors to solve major problems relying international law, and the central role of the United Nations.</p><p>Secondly, in December 2010 during the OSCE summit in Astana, all member states supported our idea of creating common and indivisible Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security community. Today, this approach to ensuring security has become even more important. In light of the threats and challenges of the 21st Century, we suggest developing a new agreement similar in concept to the Helsinki Final Act of 1975. It requires the creation of new security system based upon mutual interests as well as practical issues for the implementation of the principles of the OSCE Astana Declaration. Leaders of all states must demonstrate political will, as well as the vision to look to the future with a global perspective.</p><p>Thirdly, close economic cooperation among nations is the most effective way to ensure security. Today, mutual economic sanctions by the West and Russia are exacerbating an already difficult situation in the global economy and damaging countries and peoples. Kazakhstan, as a member of the world community, is no exception. In this regard, it is important that the declaration, adopted in Minsk on February 12, which provides for a “commitment to the creation of a common economic space from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean,“ is taken forward. For our part, Kazakhstan is committed to the expansion of foreign economic relations and regional integration. On January 1, 2015 the agreement on the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union came into force. For the first time in Eurasia, an economic alliance with a powerful resource capacity and developed transport and energy systems has been established successfully.</p><p>I would like to stress that the EAEU is based upon the principles of respect for sovereignty, economic pragmatism, equality, and openness, without which no such association could exist. Dozens of countries have already expressed their interest in the creation of free trade zones with the EAEU, clearly demonstrating its inherent attractiveness. The completion of talks between Kazakhstan and the EU on the new Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is an important step forward. We also believe that Kazakhstan's membership of the World Trade Organization will also provide numerous opportunities for trade. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[O Captain!  My Captain!]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[o-captain-my-captain]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How successful has the company been in establishing itself as one of the major holding groups in the country?</h4><p>When we began developing the company's strategy about 20 years ago, we worked with many consultants and chose an initial strategy that would allow us to work on low-competitive markets. We were unsure if our managers could compete in markets, which were saturated. We chose markets such as the oil and gas sector, where we focus on production, especially in the energy market i.e. electricity and heat supply, and real estate. For example, we now own a large industrial zone that we rent in order to avoid dealing with competitors in production release, promotion and marketing. This strategy has been beneficial, as we carefully monitored trends in the oil market, and managed to sustain continual growth for 10-15 years up until last year. We operated similarly with energy markets, as we entered at a difficult time when many agents were on the verge of bankruptcy. Currently, energy is leading our portfolio, and we are standing firmly. We have been operating in competitive markets for the last three or four years, entering the retail sector, where our pharmacy chain is now rated number one in Kazakhstan, as well as the banking sector—a competitive area as well, but one we are now able to compete in. We also have purchased ALMA-TV, which is in a challenging but promising market. We have been working with the Boston Consulting Group for six months now, and we will soon finish developing the strategy for the next five years. </p><h4>What opportunities will the purchase of ALMA-TV bring your company, and how does media fit into your growth strategy?</h4><p>We are going to make ALMA-TV an Internet-provider and compete with Kazakhtelecom. This will also create synergy with our bank, which will be more involved with connectivity in the future. Along with ALMA-TV, we have a share in the advertising market, which will create relationships with our other companies and help promote their products. Now we are in talks with Kcell, which should lead to an increase of our product values and to future partnerships. We bought ALMA-TV because we saw great potential in this field; we hold around 60% of Kazakhstan's cable TV market and we are present in every city with a population greater than 100,000. If we join efforts with Kcell, we will be present in every household, even in the rural areas. Providers all across the globe agree that fiber-optical cables ensure much better connectivity than satellites.</p><h4>Economic diversification is a very strong feature for Ordabasy Group. How important it this trend on a national level?</h4><p>It is crucial for Kazakhstan to have a diversified economy, not only to sell raw materials, but to process them into end products as well. We try to diversify our business by entering the fields where our management is strong, but if we cannot rely on our own skills, we prefer to hold our shares and delegate the management to the third parties. For example, we do not interfere with the banking management as the other shareholders have it under control. This is also applied for pharmacies, as we entrust the management to the original shareholders, who continue to hold 51% of the shares. In the oil and gas and energy sectors, however, we feel confident, and act as the controlling and managing company. As the country's resources represent the entire periodic table, it is important that we develop the mining of gold, copper and other metals. We recently entered this market by buying a gold and copper company and we will soon start to produce those metals. Of course, selling them for foreign currency eliminates the devaluation risks, but the most important business for Kazakhstan is logistics and transit. While we do not have access to large bodies of water, we have both China and Russia as neighbors, which will help us maximize our transit potential. Agriculture is the other important sector: we have vast tracts of land suitable for farming and animal husbandry, and we can export organic products. For example, while China exports its apples worldwide, it imports organic apples from Kazakhstan for domestic consumption.</p><h4>We have seen government initiatives trying to boost potential for agriculture. How does Ordabasy Group intend to get involved?</h4><p>We have a small milk farm in Shymkent Region with Canadian cows. Currently, we are also planting 500ha in Zharkent city, near the border with China, and starting next year we hope to start exporting apples to China. We have a joint venture with the Abu Dhabi Falah Fund, an egg farm near Almaty, which we have been working with for almost nine years and have learned how to properly manage and structure an agriculture business in management and structure.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>In general, budget revenues have decreased and oil and gas prices have dropped throughout the entire country. There are many positives as well, however, as the government is implementing a structural reform through wide-scale privatization. Next year will be busy: privatization will be massive, and foreign companies will be encouraged to enter the market. That will give great momentum to Kazakhstan's development, especially in terms of the energy sector, as we plan to participate in privatization of the powers plants and of the Almaty power supply system. With the governmental and the business aspirations in accord, the next year will be favorable for investors and businesses alike, and not just within Kazakhstan. We are now in talks with two Russian companies regarding the purchase of a cable operator in Russia, and we have ambitious plans of expanding our Europharma pharmacy chain to China. It is a difficult task, but we are working hard for it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In the past two years, I have met with President Nazarbayev three times at international conferences, but the visit this October was my first to Central Asia. During my visit, I had a three-point message. First, Japan will dramatically strengthen its relationship with the nations of Central Asia. To do so, Japan will help make the region's industries more sophisticated and develop human resources. We want to climb the value-added ladder. We want to diversify our industries.</p><p>Going forward, Japan will continue to emphasize empowering the people of Kazakhstan as individuals by strengthening the power they already have. As a new initiative, Japan will support the training of people to lead advanced industries in Kazakhstan and other nations of Central Asia by making use of Japan's high-quality engineering education. Secondly, Japan will more actively involve itself in efforts to resolve challenges faced universally by Central Asia.</p><p>We have been engaging in Central Asia-Japan dialogue since 2004. We believe that if an issue calls for a regional solution, then Japan can be a “catalyst" that all parties trust. This dialogue is developing into a framework for the nations of Central Asia and Japan to tackle challenges faced universally by this region.<br>Furthermore, Japan is ready to help make it easier to move around people and goods, which is a critical challenge that must be achieved if Central Asia is to attain further development. This is another area in which we are extremely interested.</p><p>The Central Asia plus Japan Dialogue and a meeting of foreign ministers from this region and Japan will be held next year with transportation and distribution as one of their main themes. We are hopeful that discussions on this theme will deepen in the run-up to these events.</p><p>Kazakhstan intends to establish an external aid organization, and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has an abundance of experience in this field. I am looking forward to the day when Japan can work with Kazakhstan in promoting the development of this region. Japan is hoping to make active contributions to the development of the whole of Central Asia while carefully listening to each country's needs.</p><p>Japan will help Central Asia achieve an open, stable, and autonomous development, under close public-private sector collaboration. Private companies are already keen to engage. The government of Japan will provide support through public funding to encourage private-sector investment, improve infrastructure, and develop human resources. Through such measures, Japan will create business opportunities worth more than JPY3 trillion.</p><p>We would like to deepen the partnership between Japan and Central Asia on the global stage as well. The International Science and Technology Center, which is engaging in the initiative to prevent brain drain from the former Soviet republics in order to ensure nuclear non-proliferation, made a fresh start here at Nazarbayev University this summer. Japan will continue to support this institution's activities, which have now continued for more than 20 years. We would like to work with Kazakhstan at the US as well, in order to push for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation as well as the reform of the Security Council.</p><p>Although Japan and Central Asia are far apart geographically and have different historical backgrounds, huge possibilities lie ahead for the future of our partnership. If we accept each other and take advantage of each other's strengths, and if we join our hands and work together, we can make our future shine more brightly.<br>I intend to immediately start making efforts to realize such a partnership. By sending a cultural exchange mission to Central Asia, or alternately by inviting Japanese-language learners from Central Asia to Japan, we will give force and energy to this endeavor. On the map, we are far apart, though distance does not matter when we are united in heart. To all of the people in Kazakhstan and other nations of Central Asia, I would like to say this: let us join our hands and move forward together toward the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-heart-of-asia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Only 25 years ago, people in Central Asia were cut off from the world. Today, many Kazakh citizens study in the best universities and colleges in the US, Kazakhstan, and elsewhere, while Kazakhstani boxer Gennady “Triple G" Golovkin has shown in his own unique way that people from this region can reach the highest levels of their professions at an international level.</p><p>The US is keenly aware that the security and stability of Central Asia is a crucial building block for broader global security. The region includes such international players as Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, and China, and Kazakhstan sits at the center of some of the most significant foreign policy and security issues on the planet.</p><p>However, the US stake in Central Asia extends far beyond security. We do not want to see a struggle between China and Russia and the US as a zero-sum game. We want to see a Central Asia that claims its place as an engine of growth at the heart of a modern and dynamic Asia. When we invest in each other's countries, all our societies can benefit.</p><p>The future of Kazakhstan and this region will be determined and should be determined by the local population, and not by the US or any other country. We want to partner with Kazakhstan in every way possible. We know that there is a strong platform on which we can now build together. A Kazakhstani proverb teaches us that nothing is as remote as yesterday and nothing is as close as tomorrow. We know that we better do everything in our power, all of us, to take every opportunity to prepare ourselves.</p><p>I am convinced that together we are well positioned to take on three of the toughest challenges of our era. Consider first our economic partnership. Today, there are millions of young people who are ambitious, linked by technology, and eager to share in this globalized world. But many of these people lack any real chance to do so, creating a race between opportunity and frustration. That is a race that we cannot afford to lose, and that is the challenge. </p><p>Today, a nation's interests and the wellbeing of its people are advanced not just by troops, but also by entrepreneurs and business groups, and by the companies that they build. They are advanced by the workers that they employ, the students that they can train, and the prosperity that they create that can be shared by everybody at all stages of the economic hierarchy.</p><p>In Central Asia, you are not only blessed with a rich array of natural resources, but also with strong human resources. Your citizens are young and entrepreneurial. Half the population in Kazakhstan is under the age of 30. To deliver on the aspirations of this new generation, we want to help Central Asia build a solid basis for prosperity by integrating it into a global rules-based system. That is why we have supported Kazakhstan's successful efforts to join the World Trade Organization, and it is why we are promoting connections across the region to what we call our New Silk Road Initiative, which will link Central and South Asia in four key areas: energy, trade and transit, customs and border operations, and connecting businesses and people.</p><p> Economic integration is not and should not be a zero-sum game. To succeed does not mean that somebody else has to lose. From the north to the south, we can support trade. From the east to the west, we can do the same. We can link Eurasia with markets in Europe, China, and Russia. The world will do better if we do that, and the US fully encourages Central Asian nations to develop the broadest range of partners possible. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Just For You]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[just-for-you]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the bank come about?</h4><p>The idea goes back to our founder, Dr. Mehdi Jahangiri. He used to work as a high-ranking official in the Iran Cultural, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization (ICHTO) and decided to establish a private bank specialized in tourism. This was a brilliant idea, as Iran has vast potential in this field. We are an affiliate member of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and, according to its Secretary General, Taleb Rifai, Tourism Bank is the first specialized tourism bank in the world. Although we are a young bank with only six years of operations, we are among the top 100 companies in Iran, specifically the 97th. We have received several awards and credentials for our rapid growth. The mix of young bankers and our experienced management team provides us with good ground to offer attractive services and products to customers.</p><h4>What strategy have you followed to achieve the second highest growth rate in Iran in 2015?</h4><p>The novelty of the idea of a bank specialized in tourism played an important role, but one of the main reasons for this rapid growth is hiring a highly educated and well-trained staff. Around 70% of our personnel have university degrees as well as doctorates and master's and more than 80% are under 30 years old. On the other hand, our management team is made up of five of the most prominent bankers in the country. In addition to that, deploying high-quality IT facilities has helped us to achieve this fast growth. Our well-spread geographical network is going to increase from 85 to 120 branches, and this will be our ceiling, as we want to promote e-banking in Iran. Our initial capital was $66 million and is now $198 million. We are planning to double it this year to $396 million, which will make Tourism Bank one of the highest paid capital banks in Iran. Our goal is to be among the top-five banks in the country in terms of profitability within the next four years.</p><h4>What is the position of the bank in the international arena?</h4><p>We were the only bank in Iran that was connected to SWIFT during the sanctions, although we were not allowed to do international business. We have just received the license to provide international transactions, so now we can go to the international markets, open letters of credit, and issue foreign guarantees. Last February, we accompanied President Rouhani on his trip to France and Italy, where we met with several European banks. Turkey is also one of the countries that is eager to work with us, and we appreciate its support during the sanctions period. We are open to cooperating with international corporations and we are eager to sign agreements on a win-win basis.</p><h4>How are you supporting the development of the tourism industry within Iran?</h4><p>We are not just a commercial bank, we are also experts in the tourism industry. As part of the Tourism Financial Group, we are the main developers of touristic projects and we build hotels all over the country. We constructed the first airport hotel in Iran at Imam Khomeini International Airport and gave the management to Accor Hotels Group. Within Iran, we are the official agent of ICHTO and the National Development Fund of Iran (NDFI), which means that any tourism project that is going to be implemented in the country is presented to our bank and we can offer special financing to provide appropriate services for the developers. At this moment, about 30 tourism facilities such as hotels or health villages are being constructed across Iran through our financing.</p><h4>What can the tourist card offer to the people who want to visit Iran?</h4><p>The tourist card is a debit card that can be used by Iranians and foreigners. If you open an account at our bank, you will automatically become a member of the Iranian Tourism Club, an affiliated company that offers up to 40% in discounts at shopping centers. With all of the points you collect from your purchases, you will be entitled to take part in seasonal lotteries and you can apply for a travel loan from Tourism Bank for up to $165,000. These are good conditions for people who travel to Iran or to any foreign countries. The club membership offers free advice on trips, reservations on hotels and flights, and the online purchasing of flight tickets or accommodation inside and outside Iran.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since its establishment in 2013, what have been the major achievements of the group?</h4><p><span></span>When we were established, the government was looking to take the welfare decisions away from Samruk Kazyna in order to reinvent and reactivate it. In Samruk, the development institutions were only a portion of the assets. Development institutions were never the focus of management, although they play a critical role in the economy, especially during difficult economic times. The banking system was in bad way because of the overwhelming debt burden; it was not functioning as it had prior to the 2008 crisis. The government took an active role of investing in the economy through various programs. We have engaged in many government programs that vary in size and scope. The industrial program has initiatives such as Kazakh National Development, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan, and the Investment Fund of Kazakhstan, all of which play a critical role. We finance many industrial projects, as they provide various instruments, such as lines of credit, export financing, and credit insurance; we also offer equity and private equity investments. Because we posses this wide range of financial instruments and services, we can make tailor-made decisions and solutions for the needs of the entrepreneur or investors who want to invest in Kazakhstan. In terms of burgeoning sectors, the next major area is the development of SMEs. The government has tasked Baiterek with increasing the SME portion of GDP. When Baiterek was established, the contribution of SMEs to GDP was around 19%. Today, two-and-a half-years later, this figure has grown to 25%, and almost 75% of all the financing provided in 2015 to non-mining and non-service sectors of the economy for SME was provided by Baiterek Holding. When you take into account the banking system, private investors, and local private sources of the business owners who are reinvesting back into business, 75% of all investment channeled into the SME development was provided by Baiterek. We are also the main operators in the regional development program for housing investments through our subsidiaries. Our task for 2016 is to renovate and complete 7,000 apartments across Kazakhstan. </p><h4>How are your operations impacted by the $600 million infrastructure investment deal that was signed last month with CITIC from China?</h4><p>We have managed to sign investment deals that will bring almost $6.5 billion to Kazakhstan, some of which is coming from long-term soft credit lines, while other parts come from private direct investment. The $600 million fund that we signed with CITIC Capital is an example of when foreign investors use Baiterek as a reliable and stable partner. The focus of the fund will be Kazakhstan, Customs Union countries, and Central Asia. In terms of industries, the focus is on mining and logistics, agriculture, food processing, energy, and infrastructure. That is not the first fund that we established with CITIC. Five years ago, the CITIC Kazyna fund was established with $200 million, and today it is fully invested. Therefore, the CITIC had a positive experience in Kazakhstan and decided to go ahead with further and more significant investment. This $600 million is not the limit, our plan is to increase the fund to $1 billion and we have interest from other sovereign and private foreign funds who would like to join. We believe that in the next year we can actually increase the amount to $1 billion, and this will be significant.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Baiterek in 2016?</h4><p>The economic climate is volatile due to the drop in oil prices and the situation in Russia. Therefore, it is time for Baiterek to become a locomotive for the economy. This is the time when development institutions can show that they are capable of pushing the economy ahead, creating new jobs, and assisting business in their investments despite the current economic difficulties.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ADNOC has given you a mandate to carry out R&amp;D surrounding the development of oil fields. How is the PI going to develop that program?</h4><p>It is important to realize that right from the beginning of the PI in 2001, we have been at pains to ensure that every faculty member whom we hire is a qualified researcher in her or his discipline. The typical faculty contract at the PI allows for 30% or more of a professor's time to be spent on research. That is certainly the case in engineering, and it is also increasingly the case in the natural sciences. Therefore, we have always been engaged in research to one extent or another. In fact, if you look at faculty productivity indices, the PI has without doubt the highest impact factors of any institution in the UAE. That is because our faculty are exceptionally well published in their respective fields of research. The concentration of research at the PI is in upstream enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and now in gas as well. The research that is on-going at the PI in electrical, chemical, and mechanical engineering also relates overwhelmingly to EOR.</p><h4>Once the PI Research Center (PIRC) is up and running, it will have an annual budget of $33 million. Can you describe in more detail how EOR will be enhanced moving forward?</h4><p>There is work going on in several disciplines at the PI. In chemical engineering, for example, this involves looking at the effects of injecting different polymers, water, or low-saline solutions into existing oil fields. It includes examining at the micro and nano scales what the impact of these measures are likely to be and how they work in different environments. In conjunction with BP, we are building a core flooding facility that will enable us to simulate exactly what happens at the microscopic and nano levels if you inject one solution as opposed to another. In the field of electrical engineering, to cite another example, the use of electro kinetics down-hole to stimulate oil flow toward the well head is another leading field of inquiry that is being pioneered here. Once we gain insights into these and other technologies, we will be better able to apply them in real life, real time situations in the field. Given the normal lead times for new laboratory-tested ideas to reach maturity, it may take as many as three to five years before these ideas are fully realized in the field. Despite the time and resources that are required to make advances in these and many other technological areas of research, we are convinced of the value added by such research and are very pleased to be part of the greater mission of ADNOC to extend the boundaries of EOR beyond current practice.</p><h4>The educational arm of Vision 2030 is formed of PI, the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, and Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research (KUSTAR). How do you qualify this assessment?</h4><p>I agree with it completely. Individually and collectively, these three exciting institutions have moved through adolescence and are becoming known as a group of institutions that work together and collaborate by an ever increasing measure. I have been collaborating in one way or another with colleagues from Masdar and KUSTAR from the very moment I arrived in the UAE some seven years ago. Even then, we were already beginning to see each other as resources instead of as competitors. In the meantime, we have increased the interaction among our faculty considerably. The dynamics among universities are totally different from those at play in the corporate world. For us, the more we share, collaborate, and know about each other's work, without giving away industrial secrets outright, of course, the more we can avoid unnecessary competition regarding the disposition of scarce resources. There is more that can be done. For one thing, I would like to see our institutions focus their resources on creating consolidated and coordinated investments in instrumentation and research laboratories. The PIRC is a great step in that direction. Although we are an ADNOC facility, the more we can create opportunities for faculties at other institutions to have access to cutting-edge technology, the better off we will all be. In particular, I am thinking of electronic microscopes or isotope testing facilities, and being able to work in the rarified field of nano technology, but without each institution having to buy a separate set of scanning electron microscopes on their own. If we can put a bank of them here for different kinds of research and create a central instrumentation facility (CIF) as in the US, we can leverage the resources that exist in each of our institutions without duplicating the expense.</p><h4>In terms of diversification, PI undertook the Solar Car Project. What other projects do you have on-going that involve renewables?</h4><p>I'm glad you asked about that! It is not generally known that our solar car broke world records in the qualifying laps at the Abu Dhabi Solar Car Challenge in 2015, even though we came in second in the race itself. At the risk of sounding defensive, I should note that our second place finish was not because our car didn't have the speed to win, but because we did not have the controls on the engine that would allow us to cruise just at the speed limit without exceeding it. This meant that we broke the allowed speed limit for the race too often and were penalized accordingly. Nevertheless, the entire experience was an extraordinary breakthrough for us. It introduced us as an institution to the potential for research and technological advancement in renewable energy that we can expand and exploit here at the PI. We are also proud of our association with Tokai University in Japan, which was our partner in this. We are now expanding our relationship with Tokai University and looking for new paths of collaboration. There are other things that we are contemplating in the area of solar. We intend that two of the new buildings that are being built on campus to be totally self-sufficient based on solar energy generation. The new PIRC will have green laboratories as part of its roster of research facilities, and we will be looking at solar energy, as well as at other developing technologies, such as lithium-based battery technology for the storage of energy. We are also interested in finding ways to save energy, and particularly to save on fossil fuel expenditure. The PI as an institution and ADNOC as a corporation understand fully that it is far better to earn a profit from petroleum products by selling them in parts of the world that are without adequate energy resources, rather than expending that fuel domestically. In the interests of economic prosperity, finding alternative energy solutions, whether it is wind, solar, or other forms, is certainly something we are becoming increasingly involved in.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>A decade ago, Thailand and New Zealand signed into effect the Thailand and New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership (TNZCEP). To what extent has this FTA been the bedrock of modern bilateral ties?</h4><p>The TNZCEP was one of New Zealand's first trade agreements and has helped create significant trade and economic benefits for both countries since it came into force in 2005. Through improved market access, customs procedures and trade facilitation, increased efficiency, and enhanced profitability, as well as the transfer of technology and skills for businesses, trade volumes have more than doubled in 10 years. Thailand is now New Zealand's eighth-largest trading partner with total trade between our two countries worth NZ$3.25 billion. Thailand exports mainly manufactured goods to New Zealand, while New Zealand primarily exports agricultural goods and wood to Thailand. While there is some work to do in relation to services and the safeguards that apply to some dairy and meat products, we expect this trade agreement will continue to strengthen our important economic partnership.</p><h4>During your previous visit to Bangkok, you suggested that Thailand could become a key hub for New Zealand's investors looking to expand into the region, with a particular focus on the F&amp;B, logistics, IT, and manufacturing sectors. Over two years later, to what extent have these goals been met and has New Zealand since made any revisions to its strategic economic interests with the Kingdom?</h4><p>Taking a long-term view, New Zealand continues to recognize Thailand's potential as a strategic hub for investment in the region. It is geographically located in the centre of Southeast Asia and is the second-largest economy within ASEAN. Significant infrastructure proposals such as high-speed rail connections to China are promising and would further incentivise investment in Thailand and the region. A number of New Zealand manufacturing, logistics, ICT, and F&amp;B companies have established a presence in Thailand, and a number of dairy, beef, and fruit exporters are using Thailand as a hub to explore other markets in Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar.</p><h4>What impact does the recent integration of the ASEAN Economic Community have on New Zealand's strategic relationship with the region?</h4><p>The launch of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) presents a great opportunity for New Zealand to further our relationship with ASEAN and the Asia Pacific region and expand our trade and economic links. In 2015, we celebrated the 40th Anniversary of New Zealand-ASEAN relations. Two-way trade between New Zealand and ASEAN has increased nearly 100-fold, from US$133 million in 1975 to US$10.6 billion in 2015. Much of this growth has been underpinned by the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA), which has been the cornerstone of our trade and economic relationship with ASEAN. New Zealand is supportive of initiatives that broaden regional economic integration such as the ASEAN Economic Community. Mega-regional free trade agreements—the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), and the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP)—seek to broaden ties of economic cooperation between countries in our region. The more New Zealand can link into such agreements, the more New Zealand is able to contribute and benefit from regional prosperity and future economic opportunities.</p><h4>What are your expectations for New Zealand's bilateral relations with Thailand in the year ahead?</h4><p>We are looking forward to realizing the full potential of the bilateral relationship when Thailand returns to democratic governance. In the meantime, our people and business links with Thailand remain strong. Every year, more than 40,000 Kiwis visit Thailand and more than 20,000 visitors arrive in New Zealand from Thailand. Thai Airways has just increased its scheduled flights to Auckland and I expect tourism will be an important area of continued growth. Thailand is New Zealand's largest source of international students from Southeast Asia and our educational institutes continue to build partnerships and foster connections. This year, we commemorate 60 years of diplomatic relations between our two countries. Special events are being held in both Thailand and New Zealand throughout the year to celebrate this special milestone.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide us with a short introduction to the history of the NBCC?</h4><p>The NBCC is the premier bilateral chamber of commerce in the country, especially considering the heritage and history of British and Nigerian relations. It was started 40 years ago by Nigerian and British entrepreneurs with the main objective of deepening trade relations between Nigeria and the UK. Over the years it has catered to the needs of foreign investors from the UK into Nigeria, by providing Nigerian partners and entry strategies through various platforms and structures. We have a council that contains some of the most distinguished entrepreneurs in the country. We have a corporate membership of over 300, and half of those are in the SME category. There is the Premium category, which is comprised of the big boys, the Corporate Plus, and then the Corporate. The Premium category includes companies such as Diageo, Unilever, Standard Chartered Bank, and six of the biggest banks in Nigeria. The chamber functions on activities and programs that add value to its membership. We do monthly breakfast meetings and sponsored events and we organize several trips a year to the UK, where we meet with various chambers of commerce to build trade ties.</p><h4>In which sectors are British investors more involved in Nigeria?</h4><p>The traditional area of investment for the British in Nigeria is of course in the oil and gas sector with a substantial number of investors focused on oil and gas support and technology. Shell is the most important player in that field. Then of course there are the likes of Diageo, with its investment across the country, the second biggest market in the world for Guinness after Ireland. Also, world-class manufacturing companies are here such as Unilever. The British government is now working in partnership with us to bring more British SME companies into Nigeria. They are the ones that need support when entering new markets and are less cushioned against the risks of emerging markets.</p><h4>The oil and gas sector is enduring tough times. Have you seen a decrease in interest from British companies due to low oil prices?</h4><p>Oil prices naturally fluctuate and the oil and gas players know this and think of the long term. Drilling and business go on despite these cycles. The drops will eventually rise, and it hasn't affected British appetite for Nigerian business.</p><h4>You want to spread the concept of reverse FDI in Nigeria. Can you elaborate on this?</h4><p>Our economy has started to mature and it is time to direct our investment across the globe. We have some of the richest Africans on the Fortune 500 list, and they are investing all over the world. There are over 100 multimillionaires who are major international players in various fields. What we want to do is promote global investments on the part of Nigerian investors and companies, because ultimately we believe that it's the depth of your global investment portfolio that attracts other investors who want to partner and work with those kinds of international companies. Nigerian firms that are investing overseas are ultimately investing in their own country's future and attracting more FDI and foreign partners to Nigeria itself. India is a great example. Tata has made its brand a global brand, to the point of purchasing iconic British brands like Jaguar and Land Rover, and it is a net exporter of cars in India and has brought those technologies to serve its country's interests as well as their own. The Lebanese have done the same for Lebanon, remittances going into their economy and being invested in their economy. If a country needs technology transfer, its owners of capital have to have an appetite in investing in strategic industries overseas, where they can then leverage them and bring those technologies back home. The total remittance of Nigerians in the diaspora last year was $20.1 billion. It is time that we leveraged our power and worked with our big investors and businessmen to use those funds to invest in the required technology overseas and bring that technology, investment, and know-how to bear locally and invest it into critical infrastructure. Obstacles and challenges are there, like corruption, which discourages investment. But we have to deal with this and overcome it for our country's future.</p><h4>How has trade evolved between Nigerian and the UK?</h4><p>Trade was worth GBP4 billion per annum back in 2010. By the time I was president of the chamber in 2015, it stood at GBP7 billion. By 2020, we expect it to reach GBP15-20 billion. The UK government has unveiled a huge campaign to get its SMEs to deepen their interaction with Nigeria beyond oil and gas.</p><h4>What would you say are the main challenges that British investors face in coming to Nigeria?</h4><p>There is a negative perception of Nigeria. Due to high-level cases that appear in the press, the average British businessman perceives the Nigerian businessman as a fraudster, which is unfortunate because the overwhelming majority of Nigerian business people are hard working, honest, and industrious. The NBCC is establishing a Nigerian Business and Investment Center in London this year, so people considering investing in Nigeria can go there and start getting acquainted with Nigeria. After all, it's a bit of a culture shock for an investor to go to Nigeria. You need to get acquainted with the country, learn the culture, the standards, how to do business, and interact with people here. We hope the center will be open in June. The office there is at the service of all our members.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>In 2016, we are dividing our membership into six sectors so we can give every member the opportunity to engage with people in their respective sectors. There is: an oil and gas trade group; a professional service group with lawyers, accountants, and architects; an export club, for everyone from farmers to banks exporting from Nigeria; and a construction and real estate group. Between now and June or July next year we'll have divided the chamber into six divisions, which give more specialized services unique to those sectors, and that will give added value and depth to the services we offer our members.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Denmark and Mexico will celebrate 190 years of bilateral relations in 2017, one of the longest bilateral relationships Mexico has held since its independence. How would you assess the state of this relationship?</h4><p>I consider the bilateral relationship between Denmark and Mexico to be a uniquely strong one. At first glance, one might not expect Denmark and Mexico to have much in common. We are vastly different countries in many aspects, such as culture and geography. Yet in spite of that, the relationship that Denmark enjoys with Mexico is strong and benefits both of our countries. I was pleased to welcome President Enrique Peña Nieto and his delegation in Copenhagen. We had some inspiring discussions and I am delighted with the many bilateral agreements signed between Mexico and Denmark in the areas of health, energy, and climate change. On global issues, Denmark has for a long time found a reliable partner in Mexico. It is reassuring to us to know that on critical issues such as combating climate change and supporting indigenous peoples' rights, Mexico is a standard-bearer and a trusted partner. I truly value the leading role Mexico plays in Latin America on climate change. In 2015, Mexico and Denmark cooperated closely on the adoption of new sustainable development goals.</p><h4>Where do you see the biggest potential for deepening trade ties between Mexico and Denmark?</h4><p>Denmark is a small country with a long tradition of innovation and focus on increasing productivity, efficiency, and constantly moving towards greener and more sustainable solutions. Mexico on the other hand is a large country with an enormous labor force and good conditions to host production with global perspectives. It is my ambition that Danish companies sell more solutions and much more know-how to large Mexican companies in order to improve their competitiveness and market strength. In energy efficiency, for example, Denmark has developed world-class technologies and know-how. Mexican companies with high energy consumption could harvest major economic advantages by adopting Danish solutions. Denmark is also at the forefront of health and welfare technology. Mexico is building and renovating a large number of hospitals over the next years, and its government has a strong focus on increasing the quality of health services. A strong alliance between Danish health technology providers and Mexican hospitals would give Mexico access to cutting edge solutions, creating a win-win situation wherein Danish companies would trade more with Mexican partners who on the other hand would improve their services and, in the case of private hospitals, competitiveness. The food and agricultural sector is also important in our trade ties. Denmark has great experience and world-class solutions when it comes to improving the efficiency and quality of meat and dairy production, and Denmark is second to none when it comes to the whole value chain of porcine production. The growing Mexican production of porcine could benefit tremendously from cooperating closer with Danish technology and know-how providers.</p><h4>In 2013, the Danish government launched its emerging market strategy, which aims to increase exports to Mexico by 50%. What factors moved Denmark to establish Mexico as a strategic partner for the upcoming years?</h4><p>The Mexican economy is one of the world's largest, which makes it an extremely interesting export market for Danish companies. More importantly, the consistent Mexican political commitment to a free trade-based economy as well as recent reforms and initiatives to move toward a greener and more sustainable economy has made Mexico increasingly relevant for Danish companies. I am fully aware that it takes time, patience, and local knowledge to succeed in the Mexican market; however, the market strategy for Mexico reflects the Danish government's drive to prioritize and encourage Danish companies to think strategically about the great market opportunities in Mexico.</p><h4>Both countries signed a bilateral agreement to help Mexico meet its commitments to reduce carbon emissions between 2014 and 2017. What are the major lessons that Mexico can learn from Denmark in this matter?</h4><p>The simple fact is that necessity is the mother of invention. The Danish energy transition took off in the 1970s in response to surging oil prices. Today it is not oil prices but the future of the entire planet that forces the world, including Mexico, to change. The good news is that the transition is a sound business initiative. It eliminates the downsides and dilemmas of energy consumption and production, leaving us with a more viable long-term source of energy. By 2050, Denmark aims to be independent of fossil fuels. Danish exports of green energy technology almost tripled from $4.5 billion in 2000 to $15.5 billion in 2013. Green energy pays off, and as the international commitments become realized, the future of green energy business looks bright. In early 2016, we concluded a global climate agreement in Paris, where Mexico was one of the major players in realizing the commitments made in this agreement. Mexico has set ambitious targets for carbon emission reductions and green transition of the energy sector. Denmark has accumulated a significant volume of lessons learned that we now share in an Energy Partnership Programme, which includes a well-established Danish-Mexican energy cooperation for several years. Through this cooperation we supported the Mexican contribution to the COP21 negotiations, the so-called Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, which is now set to be implemented. In Denmark, we have a solid basis for long-term, holistic energy planning. These experiences can also be used in Mexico to ensure a cost-efficient green transition.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement change the Malaysian economic landscape for international investors?</h4><p>Malaysia by itself is a rather small economy, with a population of about 31 million. We understood at an early stage that regional integration was important for us given the relatively small size of our domestic market. In 1995, when the WTO was formed, we were among the first of the 162 countries to become a member. Our economy has helped establish the rules for world trade. However, because of its sheer size, countries started to sign free trade agreements (FTAs), both multilateral and bilateral, out of the boundary of WTO. At the moment, there are about 625 multilateral FTAs globally, of which 419 have been signed and concluded. Malaysia has signed seven multilateral agreements, one of them with ASEAN of which we are a founder member and which consists of 10 states and seven bilateral agreements. We are still negotiating some important ones, for example with the EU and Malaysia FTA, which will provide Malaysia access to a market of 500 million. Another is the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which involves the 10 member states of ASEAN, China, India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, and Australia. During the ASEAN summit in 2015, our Prime Minister expressed the hope that we could conclude RCEP this year. ASEAN brought us access to a market of 620 million people, while signing the TPPA opens our country to a population of 800 million. RCEP is an even larger initiative, as it brings together a population of 3.3 billion. Around 63% of our trade last year was with these free trade agreement countries. When we concluded a free trade agreement with Turkey in August last year, we saw an immediate 54% increase in Malaysian exports to Turkey. The free trade spirit is strong in the 21st Century. Under an FTA you have to eliminate import duties and reduce barriers to trade. Besides goods, services, and investments, the TPP also involves intellectual properties and standards. This is challenging but we feel it is good for Malaysia, as it will help raise manufacturing standards. TPP will be enforced in 2018 if all countries ratify the agreement, so the next two years are for countries to amend their laws. In Malaysia we will amend our Customs Act, Intellectual Property (IP), and labor laws. We strive for integration, also with the US, so we will work hard on this. Another initiative is the One Belt, One Road championed by China. It resurrects the old Silk Road trading route, connecting China, through Central Asia, Africa, and Russia, with Western Europe. All together this covers 64 countries, with a population 4.4 billion. China does not mention this as an FTA initiative, but via its Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), founded in 2013, it made a strategic move by inviting everyone to become a shareholder. China injected the first $100 billion into the bank to improve interconnectivity of roads, railways lines, electricity, power, transmission, ports, and airports. Malaysia is one of the shareholders of AIIB as well.</p><h4>Bilateral relations between China and Malaysia are deepening, with an active presence of Chinese companies in the construction and infrastructure industry. What is your assessment of this development? </h4><p>China joined the WTO in 2001. Before that, the people in China were basically just cycling, but today they are the biggest automotive manufacturers in the world, producing 24.3 million cars in 2015 compared to 12 million in the US or 9 million in Japan. China is our biggest trade partner, with an annual volume of $100 billion. We signed an MoU with China called the Malaysia-China Five Year Programme for Economic and Trade, one of the goals of which is to achieve $160 billion in total bilateral trade by 2017. To achieve this, we cannot rely on conventional sectors such as commodity exports. We must look into industrial cooperation and car manufacturing. For example, Malaysia's Proton manufactures about 100,000 cars a year, while China produces over 24 million. The automotive industry also needs a big market like China to gain sophisticated R&amp;D. FTAs not only facilitate trade and services, but also bring the integration of technology. For example, the Chinese company Geely acquired Volvo from Sweden. Sweden is innovative, but does not have the sheer market size of China. Before this transaction, Volvo had total sales of about 250,000, but after Geely came into the picture sales have already surpassed 500,000. As I said, Malaysia is a small country and we have no choice but to integrate into the world economy: we want market access and we want technology. Trade agreements provide us market access and help us move up the value chain by gaining knowledge and technological sophistication.</p><h4>What are your focus areas for technological advancement in Malaysia?</h4><p>In 2015, 80% of our total exports, RM625.46 billion, were manufactured goods. In the old days, Malaysia was a commodity-based country, responsible for 80% of our income. Today, this accounts for only 15%, including palm oil, crude petroleum, natural rubber, and LNG. We are transforming ourselves into a manufacturing-based country. Selling raw rubber will not make as much revenue as surgical gloves, for example. Palm oil can be processed into chemicals, bio fuels, and diesel to get better prices. Malaysia used to be a low-income nation as we depended on these commodities. By transforming into a manufacturing-based economy, we will be able to improve the living standards for our people. We are working hard on this, but still we export more individual components, for example, to the US, where the final product is manufactured. We are lucky to be strategically located, with consistent climate conditions. Because of these conditions, we attract very interesting investments, such as in the aerospace industry. Malaysia is ideally located for aircraft maintenance; therefore, we have Boeing and Airbus here. Rather than selling our commodities, we must look into developing these sectors. To get there, we have to educate our people, bringing up the level of our universities. We must pursue high technology. This is the direction we are going and we will sign a lot of FTAs to facilitate this goal.</p><h4>In 2015, your administration launched the Eleventh Malaysia Plan. How does this plan influence the policy of the Ministry?</h4><p>The center of attention is still the urban areas, such as Kuala Lumpur, the Southern Corridor of Johor, and Penang in the north. This is where our graduates go, i.e. places with about 11,000 people per square kilometer, where in other areas there are just 100. One strategy for us to improve this disparity imbalance is to deurbanize. We promote SMEs to base them in smaller areas, rather than the major urban centers. This should create a lot of economic activities in these areas rather than congesting the urban areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Microsoft Lebanon evolved over the last year?</h4><p>Microsoft has been transforming the way it does business, its priorities, and its objectives. The most important change has been the expansion of the cloud. The cloud has helped our customers reduce costs and increase their effectiveness. In terms of the local market, we were able to grow despite all that is happening—we are still able to grow the business due to the industries that have remained sound and healthy, such as financial services, retail, and manufacturing. Microsoft is the largest foreign investor in the IT sector in Lebanon today. We are committed to the country by maintaining our investments, by investing in talent, and I am proud to say that Microsoft Lebanon is considered as a main source of talent.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the progress of the IT sector over the past year?</h4><p>Unfortunately, there has not been much of a change in most of the sector due to political stagnancy—policies are not being implemented and decisions to make the sector work have been avoided. The entrepreneurial side, nevertheless, is booming as ever. Startups are leading the transformation of the sector in Lebanon and now we must place our efforts in assuring a high level of quality for those startups. The support from Banque du Liban has been crucial in the development of startups with initiatives such as Circular 331, which has prompted a positive coherence between investors, accelerators, and incubators. </p><h4>How has Microsoft endured the adverse environment successfully?</h4><p>Our partner eco-system has been key in how we have successfully made it through these harsh times. When I look at the eco-system and compare it to last year, the country has made a big step toward going from providing or consuming IT as a capital investment, to start consuming IT as a service. We have more than 200 partners today in Lebanon, and most of them have transformed into IT service providers to the enterprises and the consumers. They have contributed to the resilience of our operations here.</p><h4>What role does Microsoft play in the promotion of entrepreneurship in Lebanon?</h4><p>Part of our mission is to work closely with the Lebanese youth. We encourage employability and entrepreneurship among them through connecting with universities, providing training and free software, and pushing them to start their own business. We organize different projects targeting youth, such as the Imagine Cup, a university competition focused on developing students' ideas, whereby the winner gets to represent Lebanon worldwide. We also have an initiative called BizSpark, which allows startups to have access to our software for free, which helps them develop their ideas on the cloud. This is why we partner with accelerators, with incubators, and with many network partners to help all startups reach their full potential.</p><h4>How would you assess human resources in Lebanon and what strengths does the country have to become the regional hub for IT?</h4><p>From a human resources and talent perspective, Lebanon has all the necessary assets to become a regional IT hub. Talent here is often exported, universities are fairly good, and the Lebanese are natural born entrepreneurs. They are also trilingual and work well in international environments. What is needed is much more infrastructure—the great weakness of the sector is that the costs of connectivity and communications are particularly high, which has pushed many companies to neighboring nations. The political situation and insecurity also represent big challenges to overcome before the IT sector here reaches full proficiency.</p><h4>Microsoft has followed a truly successful strategy in Lebanon. Do you think this strategy can be applied to other countries in the region?</h4><p>We operate what we call “new markets," namely Afghanistan and Iraq, from our Lebanon office. In those cases, we apply the particularities Microsoft has applied here in Lebanon, looking at their potential and building a partner eco-system to make things work properly. The strategy we have used in Lebanon can be applied to other countries indeed. What we have learned with the time we have spent here is that patience and passion are crucial when working in emerging markets—it is necessary to cope with the adversities that might be present here and then turn those adversities into countless opportunities.</p><h4>Do you have any new products coming and how successful has Windows 10 been?</h4><p>Windows 10 is the main driver for more personal computing and is the best Windows ever. It covers all types of devices—mobiles, tablets, PCs, and bigger devices. Its adoption has happened faster than that of Windows 7, and people are responding positively to it. The second pillar is around reinventing productivity through Office 365, which is a mix of the classic Office with email, unified communication, and collaboration services, in addition to Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online. Then we have the third pillar, namely the smart cloud, which gives customers the possibility to procure their infrastructure or platform as a service, while securing privacy and data protection. These are the main three pillars we are working on.</p><h4>What are your plans for Microsoft Lebanon in the next year?</h4><p>We will continue on the same path, working on our partnership network, driving for cloud adoption, and transforming the company to new endeavors. Hopefully the situation in the country will improve and we will be able to be more aggressive in terms of business. This would also allow us to invest more and to fully engage in looking for national development. We could engage in strategic projects with the government to modernize its institutions and provide efficient solutions for citizens and enterprises. We also plan to keep supporting SMEs and the youth and helping them access new technologies, introducing them to the e-revolution, and pushing them to foster their entrepreneurial spirit.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Asia Aerospace City (AAC) aims to offer a complete business ecosystem with high-quality engineering services, industry-relevant human capital, infrastructure, and government support. In practice, what does AAC offer international aerospace companies?</h4><p>Asia Aerospace City is a brand, an umbrella under which we are intending to offer aerospace industry players in Malaysia a complete ecosystem. We offer the right technologies and the right capabilities, which is what investors and companies are looking for, especially in such a capital-intensive, human capital intensive, and high-tech industry as aerospace. There is a certain level of competency that is expected in this industry. Therefore, we offer industry players the right programs that will interest them. If we can convince them of Malaysia's capabilities and let them know they can get the level of human capital they are looking for, then our work will have succeeded. Before AAC was created, we met with lots of industry players and went to all the major international defense expos to study what people were looking for. When we came back to Malaysia, we formulated what we should and could offer these industry players. To uplift our aerospace industry, we knew we needed all the large global players to come and setup their infrastructure here. We know the potential of Malaysia, within the region and Asia in general; therefore, we began AAC based on our strengths and capabilities. Both Airbus and Boeing have backlogs of about 7,000 aircraft on order, and 40% of those aircraft orders are from the Asia Pacific region. Hence, this region plays a large role in the aerospace sector. There is a lot of demand, therefore a lot of room for growth.</p><h4>What is your vision for the development of Asia Aerospace City?</h4><p>We want Malaysia to help unlock the potential of the aerospace industry. All the big players want to be near the largest markets, and there are a number of countries in the Asia Pacific region that can harbor such high-tech industries. Malaysia is one of those countries, if not the ideal country. We want to be the gateway to Southeast Asia in the aerospace industry, if not all industries. Singapore is the most advanced country in the region, and the easiest place to do business; however, we have the manpower, the land, and the factories to develop technology and capabilities. Malaysia has an excellent education and training system. We believe we are the best fit for the industry. This is what we have to offer at AAC. We are the bridge between industry and government in Malaysia, connecting the expertise and the people from both sides. People in industry and government don't always speak the same language, but we, at M-AeroTech, speak both. If you think of AAC as a computer, it has hardware and software. Take the Subang Nexus, for example, which is the aero industry park that we are currently developing, just 45 minutes outside of Kuala Lumpur. To develop this, we have another Mara subsidiary company to develop the hardware and the infrastructure, while M-AeroTech is looking at the software. This is how the infrastructure is developed and activated. We don't just see it as a real estate project. One of our biggest objectives is to have first-tier Malaysian manufacturing companies. The new aerospace blueprint was launched in 2015; one year in and we already have UMW as a first-tier manufacturing company. We are its business consultants, and we help bring its partnerships together. Rolls Royce is looking for a manufacturer in Southeast Asia, for example, and we began the communication between UMW and Rolls Royce. That's been our biggest success so far, for sure. Rolls Royce is a huge name. Envirotech is just two and a half years old; therefore, the UMW-Rolls Royce partnership is our biggest milestone. We will work with various players to match the right companies in Malaysia with the right international players and investors.</p><h4>What is your role in the development of aerospace blueprints?</h4><p>Through our six business pillars, we help formulate all investment, R&amp;D, and business blueprints pertaining to aerospace. In the aerospace blueprint, our part is more about human capital development. Our biggest role is the development of programs that address the competency gap. The industry wants people who are already about 60-70% ready to work on the factory floor. University graduates are only 20-30% ready. So you need to train and develop these people for aerospace, and for the individual aerospace companies' specific needs. We formulate with the industry what is needed, and we develop our training modules in conjunction with them. These are customized, bespoke programs that address all specialized areas to suit the needs of aerospace customers and companies. We are looking for more partnerships and we're always keen to expand.</p><h4>What kind of partnerships are you looking at to further develop AAC as a brand?</h4><p>The UMW-Rolls Royce deal has gone through and is in stage five, and it will start producing Trent 1000 and Trent 7000 fan casings. We are looking at partnerships with other companies like Sapura Industrial and DRB-Hicom. Three years ago we were looking at Mexico. We went to Querétaro and looked at how it was able to turn automotive companies into aerospace companies, and how it brought in companies like Bombardier and worked with universities to develop courses for aerospace engineering. This perspective offered a way to chart our own path in this regard. With Mara, we have 564 centers across the country, including secondary schools, training institutes, and universities. We have about 200,000 students studying in the Mara system, and we also send students abroad to study.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The global economy is challenging and Malaysia is no exception. However, these times present a great opportunity for Malaysia to move way from reliance on natural resources to more value-added products and exports. Malaysia has a strong high-technology sector, with the manufacturing of medical equipment, biotechnology, and automotive. We are doing our part in the overall picture with the development of the aerospace technology sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Are you looking to have any more African airlines flying into Ghana?</h4><p>The construction of Terminal 3 has begun, and that means that we are expanding so that we can accommodate more airlines. We want to encourage more African airlines to come here, and we are taking the necessary steps for that. Terminal 3 will be a big boost for our tourism sector and the overall economy. The foundations are there; 34 airlines fly in and out of Ghana daily, and that is good enough. Air connectivity needs improvement in Africa, and we need good rates for African travelers, so we are working together to understand how we can achieve that to promote more tourism between our countries.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the new tax to help fund the tourism industry?</h4><p>The Tourism Development Fund (TDF) was established in 2012 by Tourism act 817 and its secretariat created eight months ago. The idea behind the TDF is to secure funding for the development of the tourism industry in Ghana. It includes seed money from the government as well as revenue from the 1% levy on tourism patrons, when they use hotels or other tourism facilities. We will also use money from the fund in other investments to raise more funds for the tourism sector and improve tourism sites, while also funding training. It will be a big relief for the tourism sector in terms of financing. It is thanks to these funds that we are able to attend international conferences to promote Ghanaian tourism. Our flagship project this year is the Efua Sutherland Children's Park in Accra. The fund is going to develop it into a state-of-the-art shopping park, which will spur international, regional, and local tourism. The fund has also purchased 10 brand new pickup vehicles for the tourism offices in Ghana.</p><h4>What are the most important tourism hubs and popular tourism sites in Ghana?</h4><p>For animal lovers, the north is the place to be, with Mole National Park. That is a great place for eco-tourism and seeing animals in their natural habitat. For lovers of forts and castles and other historical sites, central Ghana is the place to visit. For lovers of luxury vacationing, plush hotels, restaurants, and shopping, the central region, Western region, Ashanti region, and the Brong-Ahafo region are the best places to visit.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the National Tourism Development Plan that was formulated and adopted in 2013?</h4><p>That is a 15-year plan. We have short-, medium-, and long-term plans; the National Tourism Development Plan is our long-term plan. In terms of our short-term plan, we are looking at training people and improving tourism services. We trained 20,000 people in all areas last year. We expect to apply some money from the fund to train hoteliers and hotel staff as well. We are also developing our tourism as well as the Efua Sutherland Children's Park. Our biggest project in 2016 will be the Marine Drive Development Project. We want to develop that into a state of the art tourism enclave like the one in Cape Town. It will have hotels, restaurants, casinos, children's parks, and other similar facilities. We want investors to come and see what we are offering and invest in that project. The government is enabling an environment there for the private sector to thrive. If a businessman wants a portion of that land, he or she can get a title free of any litigation or hindrance, so there is a lot of potential there.</p><h4>How closely do you work with the private sector?</h4><p>We work closely with the private sector. The Ghana Tourism Federation is the umbrella organization for all Ghanaian tourism trade associations, from car rentals to hotels, pubs, and restaurants. We work closely and liaise regularly with the Ghana Tourism Federation to understand how we can help them and to solve the challenges they face in their business and throughout the industry in general.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2016?</h4><p>We want to consolidate the gains we have made thus far. We are now the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Creative Arts, so this year we are paying a lot of attention to the creative arts industry, which is relatively young in Ghana. The Ghana Tourism Authority is in charge of tourism. In terms of culture, we also have the Commission of Culture. I want to set up a Creative Art Secretariat this year. I am also looking forward to consolidating the gains we have seen in the Marine Drive Development Project. All of the technical consultations have been done, and we want to get started on that project as soon as possible. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was your starting point for establishing Danpong Group in 1999?</h4><p>My starting point for the Danpong Group was opening a retail pharmacy at a time when there was a scarcity of quality medicine on the market. My goal was to get high-quality, generic pharmaceuticals into the country to treat simple diseases, infections, and malnutrition. We opened two main retail pharmacy shops in Kumasi and Accra in 1999. We started to grow and became a wholesaler. Not only were we importing for our own shops, but also to supply other pharmacies. We moved into manufacturing in 2000 and that is when we set up another subsidiary called Danadams Pharmaceuticals Ltd. That company focused on the production of anti-retroviral drugs used to treat HIV patients, and we produced our first anti-retroviral drugs in 2005. We realized that the country cannot continue to import generic drugs because of the foreign exchange imbalance. By bringing in the raw materials and producing locally, we create jobs and value in order to make these medicines available in the country. By employing 275 people, we are able to create opportunities for others as well. We then wanted to move on from that level of operating the pharmacies, and producing and supplying medicines, and explore options for community development. We decided to set up a community clinic and opened the Danpong Clinic, where we see about 3,000 patients a month. We established a medical laboratory with diagnostics capabilities, including CT scanners, ultrasound, and radiology. We have de-worming and drug use and misuse education programs in schools.</p><h4>How have you capitalized on the huge potential for manufacturing and exporting pharmaceuticals from Ghana throughout the regional market?</h4><p>We have been exporting since 2009, and there is considerable potential for further expansion. When we started producing anti-retroviral drugs, we looked to Francophone countries as potential markets. We got our products registered in those countries and submitted our samples for French approval, and we now supply at least six countries with anti-retroviral drugs. We export to Burkina Faso, Gambia, Togo, Benin, and Cí´te d'Ivoire, and we are entering the Nigerian market. The key point is that if the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) wants to see at itself as one economic block, then we need to remove barriers and make these medicines accessible to our neighboring countries. By 2020, Danadams Pharmaceuticals should be the leading pharmaceutical supplier in the ECOWAS region.</p><h4>Are you looking for partners to help build capacity for those exports?</h4><p>We have to build collaboration with the government. We have agencies in these countries and I discuss our goals with the politicians. My aim is to find a way to make medicines available to the population, which is generally well received. The Ghanaian government has been supportive in helping us to grow. With the current economic situation here, we have been looking to the private sector for support and financing to facilitate growth. We are expanding our current factory. We currently produce about 25 million tablets per month, but when we move into the new facilities we will be producing 100 million tablets per month.</p><h4>What role can Ghanaian pharmaceuticals play in supporting the country's GDP growth?</h4><p>The engine of growth in any country is the private sector. Our pharmaceutical sector could be buoyant and help Ghana's economy, especially as none of the Francophone countries have much pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity. The government should support this sector for exporting, rather than depending on gold, cocoa, and bauxite for export revenues. Developing sustainable companies makes more economic sense. People will always need medicines and there will always be a need for health care. Nearly 70% of Ghana's drug consumption currently comes from India or China, so we should build up our own market to meet local demand and to build exports.</p><h4>What products are you focusing on developing?</h4><p>There are 5.3 million HIV patients in West Africa, and 3.5 million in Nigeria alone. The 280 million people living in West Africa are likely to get malaria at least once a year. We will continue to produce the medicine that people need at a high quality. We also have to educate our people. Public education is an important facet of our agenda as a company, as simply improving the environment reduces cases of malaria and other infections. We focus on talking to, educating, and inspiring children through our school visits and sharing our own success stories with them. Children matter most to us, and we want to help them to develop into men and women who believe in themselves; the future of Africa depends on this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What important changes have  you seen at the University of Ghana since you graduated in 1978?</h4><p>I returned to the university in 1986 to teach and I have been here ever since. A lot has changed in that period, and it is a much larger institution today than it was during my time as a student. When I was enrolled here there were 5,000 students. Today that number is close to 40,000 and the faculty has also grown to offer more disciplines. The university did not offer a program in engineering sciences before, and we also now offer programs in pharmacy, veterinary medicine, and many more areas. We have introduced more professional disciplines alongside the traditional academic disciplines.</p><h4>How do you expect the composition of undergraduates and postgraduates to change moving forward as a research university?</h4><p>Our student body is currently made up of about 15% postgraduates and 85% undergraduates. We are undertaking more and more research involving graduate students, and our target is to reach an equal distribution of students in the two groups within the next 10 years. In order to achieve that, we need to invest in equipment and attract more graduates by offering more PhD programs. Increasing the intake of graduate students requires more extensive preparation; we need more rooms for graduate students, we need to invest in new technologies, we need to attract research grants and projects, and we are in the process of doing all of these. We have recently negotiated an investment of $64.4 million in new buildings on the campus. We have also identified a number of key research areas that will help us attract new grants. We are undertaking a lot of research on malaria and climate change adaptation, and we are working on food security as well as poverty monitoring and evaluation. Even though these four are not the only areas that we are working on, this is where we put our resources, and we hope to attract additional grants. This is a university that is putting much more emphasis on research than any other university in Ghana.</p><h4>What are your primary sources of funding?</h4><p>About 10 years ago, as much as 90% of our revenues came from the government, but that has now decreased to around 60%. Students are contributing more and we are increasingly bringing in more third-party grants, particularly from Europe. We currently have a large grant from the World Bank and another large one from the Wellcome Trust in the UK. We also receive funding for smaller projects from several different organizations, including foundations all over the world. The International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada is a major source of funding for small projects. We belong to a number of international university consortia and networks and these facilitate access to international resources. The latest such network that we have joined is the Worldwide Universities Network, which brings together 18 universities from different countries, only two of which are in Africa. The idea is to collaborate on selected areas of research. Partnership with well-established universities in the global north is also often helpful. Some of the strongest collaborators we have are Washington University in St. Louis and Rochester University. In the UK, we have strong links to the universities of Cambridge and Oxford, the London School of Economics, Sussex, and several others.</p><h4>What is your overall aim for the four areas of research?</h4><p>We chose those four areas because these are the areas where we can most comprehensively contribute to national development. African institutions have a much bigger incentive to search for a malaria vaccine than anybody else. Without investigating and coming up with solutions for issues of climate change, all the things that we talk about in relationship to the structure of economies mean nothing. There are few African countries that produce enough food, and relying on imports is not easily affordable. We are therefore focusing on things like seed multiplication, developing high-yielding varieties of crops, improving crops, and improving seed quality. Our fourth area of research is poverty monitoring and evaluation, as social protection methods are becoming more important in developing countries. Without meaningful methods of quantitatively understanding the most at risk members of the population, social protection initiatives become meaningless. We need to generate the data that will allow policy makers to properly target social protection. There should be a commitment to bringing together all of the people who know something about the issue. Our government must bring together all the people that can contribute to finding solutions from universities, the private sector, and from abroad. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current state of the industry from Takoradi's perspective?</h4><p>The capacity of our mill in Takoradi is 18,000 tons per month, and we are working at around 65% of that. All of our buyers are locals, and we go directly to them, cutting out intermediaries. We have eight depots throughout the country, and we store up to 10,000 bags in each of them. Depending on the market and demand, we supply our depots accordingly and they handle the transactions and sales. Grain imports have doubled since 2003. The demand is high and distributed throughout the country, so we go directly to our buyers and pass on the lowest price that we can so that the clients can profit from affordable supply costs and we can increase our market share. The issue is that there are new players in the market with China, Gafco, and now Olam having arrived. Along with the Irani Brothers, Takoradi Flour Mill is the oldest in the country. There are around five flourmills in Ghana, so there is overcapacity of production and the competition is fierce.</p><h4>Some players in Nigeria have sold their wheat mills and there is a lot of activity and investment going on in the sector. Are you expecting similar activity here?</h4><p>There is an ongoing shift of investors. From the 1960s through the 1980s, the major investors, especially in Africa, were primarily French, Italian, British, or Australian, each with their own fields. The majority of investors today are from India or China, and this shift is a global phenomenon that now extends beyond Ghana. I envisage a shift in ownership in the next 20 years from Europe to Asia, but this makes little difference for us. The regional trade alliance is not working well, but this is beyond our control. The government is trying to improve this, but the public sector needs to collaborate with the private sector to better assess the current problems. Based on this open-forum approach, we can then provide more useful information. We have been here for a long time and have a loyal client base. Our hope is that Ghana shifts its attitude more toward problem solving, rather than avoiding problems and shuffling issues and bottlenecks away from attention. We have always believed in Ghana, and we are optimistic about the future opportunities that it holds.</p><h4>What have been some of the biggest challenges that you have faced recently? </h4><p>The majority of our grain comes from Canada and Europe, which has caused us some problems, as we pay for imports with the appreciating US dollar, while the cedi continues to depreciate. This has affected us a lot, and the exchange rate is changing daily. A vessel of wheat costs $2.5 million, so we are losing about 400,000 Ghanaian cedi. We manage with this price as best as we can. We could try to absorb it for a short period of time until the situation becomes unbearable, after which point we would have to raise our prices. We planned well, and when the economy was doing well we expanded and reorganized the company because there was money to be made. Profit margins in 2016 are shrinking, while competition continues to grow. Another problem is the increase in fuel prices being passed on to consumers, which was a necessary move. The government has been subsidizing fuel a lot, while in reality it cannot afford to incur such costs. The public sector has to change its spending habits. One liter of petrol costs almost 4.9 cedi, or about $1.25. The government has said that it wants to subsidize the cost to remove financial strain from the consumer, as minimum wage earners receive just 400 cedi per month. It is important to be cost-effective these days, as anyone who is not will face significant problems. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[foundations-of-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the main aim of Devtraco when you started and how has that changed over the years?</h4><p>The aim of the company was to become one of the go-to developers for real estate as well as for concrete product manufacturing—this was and still is our main strategy. We have since vertically integrated to include other production units while maintaining real estate as our main focus as a developer, and we have moved up from eighth position in 2008 to become the number one real estate developer in terms of dollar value as well the number of units produced per annum. We have added different segments of the market so that we are focusing on the middle-income market with one business unit, the low-end segment with another unit, and the higher-end segment with another unit. Middle-income households are expected to increase spending from $8 billion in 2015 to $11 billion in 2019, so it is a high-growth segment. We have developed a total of approximately 2,500 units.</p><h4>Can you explain the three projects that Devtraco recently launched aimed at the higher-end market?</h4><p>We have already launched three projects, namely the Avant Garde, Acacia, and Niiyo projects. We are handing over Avant Garde next week, and the two other projects in July 2016. They begin at one bedroom with 60sqm and go up to 350sqm, five-bedroom town homes. These properties can be sold for up to $850,000, but our low-end spaces start at $36,000, so we cover a wide range of price brackets. An interesting part of the Ghanaian market is that cash buyers make up 70% of our business, while units purchased with a mortgage make up just 30% of our sales. This has been consistently the case since I took up my position in 2009. Ghanaians are generally debt-averse, and the lowest mortgage rates available are around 13% APR. Therefore, most Ghanaians would rather gather money from relatives and friends and try to repay this informal borrowing as soon as possible.</p><h4>How do you overcome the problems of accessing long-term funds?</h4><p>Access to long-term funds remains a problem. When I took over the responsibility of the company, I identified this as one of the biggest hindrances for a real estate developer. We started talking to a few financiers regarding equity and debt, and we eventually signed a debt agreement with FMO to fund a $120 million mixed-use housing project. We are always looking for partners in this regard. What we try to do is underwrite each project on its own within reason, meaning that we specifically underwrite a project so that it has its own proprietary set of both debt and equity stakeholders. For our new projects, we are always looking for new financiers, however we have not encountered any issues with financing our projects. We have been fortunate and the market has received us well, as has the commercial banking sector.</p><h4>Have your expansion plans changed in response to the increase in competition and slowdown in demand?</h4><p>We no longer have plans for many more projects in Accra. Our expansion plans are now focused on Liberia and the Ivory Coast. We have not had any projects outside of Ghana before, so these will be the first time that we work abroad. Nigeria is also a market that we are interested in, but it is difficult to navigate independently, so our priority there is finding the right partner. Without the right local partner, we cannot seriously engage in an operation there. Nigeria has 180 million people, but it is a difficult and complicated market in which to operate if we lack a proper understanding. The best way to understand it is to have the right partner. In Ivory Coast, we do not feel like we need a local partner, as the country's dynamics are similar to Ghana—but we do need a translator.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[business-as-usual]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What management decisions and factors allowed the bank to post such solid growth figures in 2015?</h4><p>Differentiating our bank in Oman's fiercely competitive banking market relies heavily on providing accurate and reliable customer service, with suitably tailored products and services. We have also managed the bank in reference to several key financial matrices, such as cost efficiency; Ahli Bank is the most cost efficient bank in the country, with a cost-income ratio of around 33%; return on equity and credit discipline, whereby we aim to achieve above 13% return on equity, and to maintain a low ratio of non-performing loans of below 1%. To date, growth has also been a key part of our strategy. In terms of loans, deposits, and balance sheet footings, the bank has grown at an average rate of 20% a year. Over the previous year, we brought in a lot of innovation in terms of mobile and internet banking. We repositioned some of our key branches and launched a number of customer service kiosks in the major shopping malls, which operate from 10am to 10pm.</p><h4>How have you adjusted your management and strategy to deal with the widespread downgrading of sovereign and institutional credit ratings?</h4><p>There are two implications of this, the first of which is our shareholders' potential concern with our stock price. In reality we remain one of the few banks that trade above book value on the Muscat Securities Market (MSM). The MSM 30 Share Index of the large cap companies is closely held by various pension funds and investors. The credit rating downgrades did not have much impact on our stock price because the investor community understands the reasons for both the sovereign and banking sector downgrades. The other implication is that it might have changed the credit appetite and pricing provided by various foreign financial institutions, which provide lines of credit to the bank. To date we have not observed any negative reaction, which is encouraging. Given the tightening liquidity in the finance sector, it remains important to have such lines of credit available in case of need.</p><h4>What growth potential do you see in Islamic banking for Ahli Bank, and is this organic growth or existing customers switching over from traditional banking?</h4><p>We took the decision to launch Islamic banking in a big way, opening seven Islamic branches on the same day. We have found that the corporate and consumer customers are generally happy to borrow money through Islamic financing structures. However, it is more challenging to attract deposits, as no interest paid is paid on deposits under Islamic banking principles. However, there are various investment products that we and other banks provide, which pay profits on a risk-sharing basis. One challenge is that the regulators in various countries are not consistent in the products that are permitted. For example, in Oman commodity murabaha and tawaruk are not yet permitted, which reduces the product suite that banks can offer. While home finance is well served, personal finance is more difficult to structure. Despite this, the Islamic banking market has achieved around a 7.5% share of Oman's overall banking market over the last three years, and I would expect it to cross 10% in the medium term. This reflects a combination of existing customers moving to Islamic banking and, in some cases, consumers whom have opened bank accounts for the first time (or returned funds from abroad), as they were waiting for Islamic banking legislation to be put in place. We are certainly pleased with our Islamic franchise, which contributed 25% to our bottom line during 2015.</p><h4>Would bringing the regulations under one standard across the Gulf fundamentally change Islamic banking for you, given Ahli Bank's link to a larger group?</h4><p>We have fully Islamic banks in some countries, such as Kuwait, so as a group we have that track record and expertise. Having one set of standards is unlikely because each country's central bank has its own scholars and sharia board whose interpretations sometimes differ. The encouraging fact is that Islamic banking seems to have quickly gained popularity in Oman. The government is playing its part as well, by issuing the first sovereign sukuk, which set an Omani riyal yield curve and a benchmark. This paves the way for companies to issue sukuk going forward.</p><h4>Oman's ninth Five-Year Plan calls for more PPPs and private financing of infrastructural projects. Do you see the financial sector playing an important role in these efforts?</h4><p>That has been the case until now. However, current legislation mandates that banks can only lend a certain percentage of their net worth to a single client, whether that client be government or private sector. Banks will begin to hit hurdle rates in terms of their exposure on some of these projects and so other funding sources will need to be tapped. The enabling legislation for PPPs should be released shortly, and there will be IPOs of several state-owned enterprises. We have seen this with the stake sale in OmanTel and we expect that stake sales in the various power generation companies will follow.</p><h4>How would you characterize the overall regulatory environment in Oman, and do you anticipate any changes?</h4><p>This is the 12th country in which I have worked, and I find the regulator's track record to be good here. Despite previous economic downturns there have been no bank failures in Oman, which is a testament to the country's strong regulation. Banks are required to keep 5% of their deposits with the central bank, but recent legislation has provided that 2% of that figure can be held by banks as government development bonds, treasury bills, and government sukuk. That has released around OMR400 million of liquidity back into the banking sector, assuming all banks hold 2% of the required 5% in government securities. There might be further enabling legislation in terms of liquidity measures coming from the central bank, and we expect the government to launch a Eurobond transaction this year. My view is that the banking sector in Oman is highly regulated, but that this has stood the country in good stead.</p><h4>What are your expectations for both Ahli Bank and the wider economy over the next year?</h4><p>For Ahlibank it is business as usual. The cost of deposits will continue to increase, which means the cost of borrowing will also increase. However, I do not see a constraint on the capacity of the banking sector to lend. I also expect the banking sector to remain profitable, highly capitalized, and well regulated. The economic situation is certainly more challenging and the level of year-over-year profitability in the sector may remain flat or decrease slightly this year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Coca-Cola's presence in Mexico developed over the past 90 years?</h4><p>The development of the Mexican Coca-Cola industry has been the result of a combined effort between us, Coca-Cola Mexico, eight bottlers, Jugos del Valle, and Santa Clara. These local bottlers are not only a key piece of the system, but they have the local knowledge and the local flavor, which obviously makes it the Mexican Coca-Cola industry. Our 90 years in Mexico have been characterized by the outstanding relationship we have built with our customers; those Mexican families who come together to enjoy our products. We have also focused on offering a more diversified range of products for the Mexican market, and our portfolio has grown to include water, milk, and juices. We acquired Jugos Del Valle, one of the most traditional and beloved brands in Mexico, and we have grown it to a billion-dollar brand in eight years. Our commitment has been clear in being a reachable brand for everyone, no matter the distance or geographical region. Our products can be found throughout Mexico, even in places where no cars can go. Weekly we reach over 1.5 million outlets in Mexico alone, and that is a result of the commitment and distribution we have in the country.</p><h4>How would you characterize the commitment of Coca-Cola to your partners and suppliers in Mexico?</h4><p>The relationship with the partners and suppliers is tremendous. Integrating a manufacturing network with local suppliers, working with partners who share our ethics and comply with an extensive supply chain, and contributing to the development of local farmers are all key to the development of the company. We employ nearly 92,000 employees directly and over 1.7 million indirectly. We acquire around $700 million in local agricultural products in Mexico. We also invest $1 billion dollars in infrastructure, logistics, training, and social programs in Mexico. We planted over 68 million trees and have recuperated more than 60,000ha. For a second year in a row, we replenished all the water we use for the production of our drinks. We also have the largest bottle recycling plant in the world here in Mexico, which makes us the largest recycler in Latin America. We invest in social responsibility to generate progress in Mexico.</p><h4>What responsibility do food and beverage companies like Coca-Cola have in confronting health and lifestyle problems such as obesity?</h4><p>It is a central element here. Obesity is clearly a huge situation of modern society and we need to halt and reduce it. The food and beverage industry has an important role in helping that happen, but it cannot be the only player doing so. As countries and societies, we need to evolve from an agenda that scares and forbids to one that educates, encourages, and incentivizes. When we want people to move, educating them and providing them with incentives to develop better habits is the right answer. We understand that we need to foster and shape the behaviors of consumers, and we want them to consume responsibly. At the center of this is avoiding excess and moderating consumption. It is a proactive agenda and we are doing the best we can at the moment, but we can learn how to do this better by engaging the rest of the industry and embarking on these campaigns together with them.</p><h4>Coca-Cola is already the number-one brand in terms of consumers in Mexico. Is there still space for growth?</h4><p>There is a huge space to grow. Even in Mexico, where we have outstanding market development, Coca-Cola satisfies only one out of three non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages that people are drinking. We have a lot to do to offer more choice and provide more relevant options, and this alone represents a substantial growth opportunity. Our mission is not only to refresh people, but also to make a positive difference through a valuable contribution. We need to become an example of inclusive capitalism. We want our customers, communities, and value chain to look at us and believe that we are a reliable partner to support their growth. There are plenty of opportunities to explore and we assign resources to find those opportunities. The key question is whether or not we are going to be able to create a recognized value for society that is sustainable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The no premium, no cover policy has been an important part of the NIC's agenda. From your perspective as the regulator, what do you think the impact of this directive has been on the market so far?</h4><p>It has had a big impact on the liquidity of the insurance companies. Before this directive came, insurance companies were only able to collect 35% of their premiums. It was as if they were virtually begging the policyholder to pay. Then, when there was no claim in the year, the policyholder did not feel the need to pay the outstanding premium, even though the insurance company had provided them with cover. With this new directive, in 2014, the NIC asked insurance companies to stop selling on credit and gave them up to the end of 2014 to collect all outstanding premiums. Insurance companies were required to write off all outstanding premiums as of December 31, 2014, from their balance sheet. We were not going to accept them as receivables, as we did previously. Since then the market has been happy. The only hitch is that now that we are getting the premiums upfront; claims have to be dealt with adequately and promptly. That is the next phase. We have issued the guidelines, but we have not started enforcement. The insurance industry tells me this policy is the best thing that has happened to the market in a long time. Initially, they were apprehensive about the risk of losing clients. When we first started with this program of reform, I imagined our greatest challenge was going to be the public. We thought they would not pay up, but the public presented no problem.</p><h4>What do you consider to be the key dynamics that make Ghana a potentially attractive market for investment in insurance?</h4><p>Ghana has been categorized as a lower-middle income economy. We have a growing middle-income group, and now we have a large group of unemployed young people, which is not ideal. However, we hope that in the not too distant future, all these people will find jobs. There is potential for this to drive the insurance market. The whole month of October was dedicated as Insurance Awareness Month. Therefore, we did a lot of education together with the Ghana Insurers Association (GIA) to boost awareness. We involved the Ministry of Finance and we did programs on television, advertising, and promoting the benefits of insurance. The NIC has a complaints bureau and if you have a problem with an insurance company you can come and report it to us and we can mediate. </p><h4>Are you seeing a result in terms of insurance penetration rates?</h4><p>We have not done a survey yet; however, we believe there will be some change even if it is not drastic. Things are improving because previously we found that the boards of directors were not always directly involved in directing their companies and not exercising their over-sight responsibilities over the companies. NIC did a training course for them and we told them we are now going to hold boards of directors responsible, therefore management teams have to do the right thing. We are also strengthening our position by getting to know our market. The market is responsive. People have been telling us that they did not even know that there was an insurance commission. Now consumers and the industry are getting to know about us, and we are becoming visible. We have just had our very first industry meeting where we invited CEOs and chairmen to discuss our problems. Now the commission has a strong relationship with the industry. They realize that we need to work together. On top of that, reforms such as no premium-no-cover, corporate governance, risk-based supervision, and risk-based solvency are all about improving efficiency and strengthening the balance sheet of the industry. For example, a few years ago, the largest asset you could see on the balance sheet was premium debts. That has changed. Now you see the investment-asset ratio of companies rising to 74%.</p><h4>In terms of the competitive landscape, how would you assess the number of companies and is there room for consolidation? Do you see the market changing?</h4><p>We feel we have too many companies for the size of our population and market. Currently there are 48 companies. Of these, 26 are non-life insurance companies and 22 life insurance companies. We also have three reinsurance companies and 76 broking firms. Within that number some are bigger and some smaller. Therefore, there is room for some of those entities to merge and become larger. Nonetheless, we still receive applications from entities that want to come into the market. Our legislation does not give us the mandate to cut the number of companies, but we are considering this. The minimum requirement has been increased to around $5 million (GHS15 million) for insurance companies and for reinsurance companies $12.5 million (GHS40 million).</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>OPEC is going to raise the ceiling of production. How does this affect Schlumberger?</h4><p>From a UAE perspective, the market will be challenging in 2016. We don't see any significant delay of major projects starting. Projects yet to start may be delayed; however, ones that have already begun should continue as planned. Definitely, there is pressure from our customers to reduce costs, and we are working with them on this. We have been running a transformation program at Schlumberger since 2008. We believe that as part of our partnership with our customers we are able to pass some savings along gained through our various initiatives without compromising HSE or service quality. I also strongly believe that it is at a time like this when you should introduce new technology. New technology might be more expensive than conventional means but it is effective if we manage to demonstrate the efficiency gains and value-added to our client. Our objective is to reduce the overall cost per barrel for our clients. For example, we have a remote operation to optimize human resources. Instead of having a full crew, we reduce the crew and use various communication methods to transfer the data to our offices, where senior employees can monitor operations. This provides savings that we can share with our customers. By combining some services that we were providing to a customer, we reduce the time for a logging operation by 30%. It was a combination of new technologies and a look at the way we ran the operation. We combined a couple of runs and saved a lot on rig time.</p><h4>Aside from implementing new technology, how is Schlumberger saving costs at the moment?</h4><p>We started a few years ago, and this is not just a one-year plan; it is an ongoing plan that will run for several years. It is a transformation program. Part of it is remote operations, while another part is multi-skilled workers. We train our employees to be multi-skilled without diluting the specialty of the individuals. It's good for the people because they get more opportunities to develop their skills. This provides us with agility and flexibility and that definitely impacts our cost. We do equipment utilization as well. We look at how we can push more utilization out of the tools we have. This is a benefit for our customer and us.</p><h4>How has the development of extended-reach drilling evolved over the past year?</h4><p>As of now, ZADCO has four artificial islands and ADMA has two artificial islands. We are actively working with both clients so extended reach drilling is very active. Starting from 2016, the number of extended-reach wells drilled in Abu Dhabi will be the highest number in the region and probably worldwide, too. It is pushing the envelope in terms of the length of the drain holes and total depth and everything else. We are talking about 30,000-35,000 feet wells, going to 40,000-45,000 feet; therefore, it is definitely significant and growing.</p><h4>How has the development of sour gas reserves evolved over the past year?</h4><p>Sour gas is still important as part of the overall development of Abu Dhabi. The first phase at Al Hosn is completed and Al Hosn has started producing gas, whilst planning is underway for the next phase. Abu Dhabi is leading the region when it comes to the sour gas development and technology used in this part of the world, as well as in the extended reach. That will make Abu Dhabi a pioneer in terms of trying new technology for sour gas development.</p><h4>Schlumberger continues to be one of the preferred employers, globally. What is your HR strategy?</h4><p>This year, and probably 2017 as well, will be challenging years for the industry, but the good thing about Schlumberger is that we don't stop recruiting as it is important to keep investing for the future.We will slow down the pace of recruiting , but we won't stop. In Abu Dhabi we have the Middle East Learning Center, which is a learning center for people coming from all over the world. On any given day, it can accommodate up to 650 students; therefore, it is the second-largest training center we have in the world, and it is number one in terms of diversity of the training. We can cover most of Schlumberger's segments in this training center. We thank ADNOC for donating this land to us. It opened in March 2007. It is a landmark demonstrating the partnership that we developed with ADNOC through the years.</p><h4>How are you working to support national energy infrastructure?</h4><p>Our overall objective is to reduce our customer's cost per barrel by the various initiatives described earlier, and, subsequently, we are able to share the savings with them. This also means new ways of working and this has to be mutually understood and accepted. We work with our customers to get involved much earlier in the projects because then we can look at the way it's executed; the early phases of planning are where we can make an impact on how it is delivered. Part of the mindset change is to get involved earlier so that we can work together in the planning phase with our customer and look at how we can execute projects much more efficiently. They are very open to that. We have been asked by executives and ministers to work closely with our customers in developing alternative solutions and services earlier. That might even change the status quo of planning. The market in oil and gas is evolving and the challenge the industry is facing is helping us and our clients to think outside the box and change mindsets. The trust is very important as well. We need to be very open. I think it's an exciting time for the industry, despite the fact that it is very challenging.</p><h4>Regarding the Schlumberger brand, what can you say about the deal with Cameron International?</h4><p>We are excited about it in the sense that it is complementing our offering. There is no overlap in our products and services, which is the beauty of the merger. The Cameron transaction is set to create technology-driven growth by integrating Schlumberger's leading reservoir and well technology with Cameron's leading wellhead and surface technology. This will be crucial for our future as we continue to seek new ways to drive total system performance in the areas of both drilling and production with a much closer integration between the surface and subsurface parts of both the drilling and production systems. Once the merger is fully approved there will definitely be a lot of communication and synergy between Schlumberger and Cameron.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[clear-purpose]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Around the world, Bupa is renowned for offering a wide range of medical healthcare products and services. How is the company developing in the local Thai market?</h4><p>Bupa's purpose is longer, healthier, happier lives, which is what we focus on in our DNA both locally and globally. We focus on healthcare itself primarily in Thailand, and we have been here for 30 years. Our purpose is represented through our health insurance products and has catered toward a variety of services across Thailand. We want our clients to have the convenience to regularly utilize medical services wherever they are. Not only do we want to help treat our customers when they are sick, but we are also providing information for the public about eating more healthily, improving their lifestyle, and preventative approaches to healthcare. Nonetheless, Bupa is focused primarily on health insurance—90% of our business accounts for health plans for individuals, corporations, and families. We also have different types of products like travel insurance, accident insurance, and cancer insurance. In the past, many of our clients were expatriates from the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Now, our clientele is very much Thai based, and we have focused on the major corporations known both locally and internationally. We service, on the corporate side of the business, companies from a range of 5-50 employees or even up to 50,000 employees. We also have a really strong individual policy business with 17 branches around the country.</p><h4>Globally, Bupa employs 84,000 staff. What role does Thailand play in the company's overall strategy?</h4><p>Asia is a core area of focus for Bupa long term in regard to growth. We are in many countries in Europe and Latin America as well as Australia and New Zealand where we are also growing, but Asia is the main focus. We have offices in Thailand, Hong Kong, India, Saudi Arabia, and all over China. Thailand is a core part of Bupa's future growth in the Asia region. Bupa has operated in Thailand for over 30 years, creating a very successful business that is now the leading specialist health insurer in the market, with a 38-40% market share of the health insurance segment, which is under miscellaneous insurance business and significant for the non-life industry. We are proud of the position we have in the market and our reputation for excellent customer service. We see a strong future for Bupa in Thailand alongside the continued economic growth and development in the country. The role of health insurance is to offer people with a high quality and affordable choice over the speed and convenience of their healthcare. We therefore see a growing demand for health insurance cover in Thailand, helping to complement and supplement the existing universal healthcare coverage that Thai people already enjoy. With the ongoing development of the ASEAN political and economic framework, the success of Bupa's business in Thailand will also present future opportunities to develop our presence and business across the region.</p><h4>What are some of the most noticeable trends you are witnessing in Thailand's health sector, particularly since the country adopted its Universal Coverage Scheme?</h4><p>Universal healthcare is a great thing for the country, and I would consider it one of society's basics. With the aging population there is a role for insurers like us to supplement that, however. We are working toward supplementing private healthcare as well. As an expert of health, Bupa provides a suite of health insurance products tailored to fit our customers in different stages of life. We also offer value-adding services to fulfill different customers' needs. To cope with an increase in the need for healthcare services due to an aging population, we are expanding our hospital network to provide utmost convenience for all customers in Thailand. In addition, we are one of the only insurers to guarantee lifetime renewal if you apply your health insurance before 60 years of age. Another growing trend across Asia is the digital one. We will rely on digital solutions to improve our customers' journey, through enhanced online channels and servicing. We are trying to make our digital platform and business even more interactive to make the experience more convenient and accessible for our clients. The digital trend is coming across Asia, and there are about 91 million cellphone subscribers in Thailand. The population is only 66 million, which shows that a lot of people have more than one phone. This is a trend we are following closely also in our approach to marketing, which is rapidly shifting online.</p><h4>What does the opening up of the AEC have for Bupa's expansion?</h4><p>It is a great opportunity for us with the AEC. If you look at the surrounding countries, we see a lot of people crossing the border and getting their medical treatments here due to the higher standards. We are working with hospital providers throughout the country to work on servicing these people coming in and create partnerships with them. In addition, we have a strong health network of over 400 hospitals, and thus the expansion of these hospitals will also be beneficial to our expansion to other ASEAN member states. As the AEC opens up gradually, we will closely monitor the opportunity for expansion throughout ASEAN. We are doing some analysis to see how Bupa Thailand can service its customers and sell Bupa products traveling across neighboring countries, with the focus on Cambodia, Lao, Myanmar, and Vietnam (CLMV).</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Our overall expectation for 2016 is sustainable growth. But I go back to our goals that are long term for 2020. We want to have 1 million customers in Thailand and THB7 billion in premiums. As we reach more customers, we want to have all ages and double across the board in growth percentages. We can do this through enhancing and expanding our distribution through branches, agents, and other partners. We are looking at understanding the customer, what they want, how they interact, and segmentation. We are developing products and services on the digital side that add value to them, so we are not just an insurance provider, we are providing content for their healthy lifestyles tailored to their needs. The excellence in the clinical work is crucial to Bupa globally because it is an area we understand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you describe the process of procuring the 2,000 acres of land and establishing partnerships to develop it?</h4><p>When someone says that they are going to build at such a large scale, they are often ridiculed. Sheikh Al Maktoum's father most likely faced criticism after he laid out his vision for Dubai. While still a small-scale developer building 30 to 40 homes per year, I studied the city's development and realized there was a great opportunity because Africa needs cities to support the incoming population and development growth patterns. My team and I therefore put together a design and architectural team with David Adjaye as the principal architect, bringing in different designers and engineers from Portugal, Spain, and Germany to realize the vision. We then acquired the funding for the land, after which we assembled the marketing and communications team while forming international media partnerships with the likes of CNN and the BBC to promote the project. We finally broke ground after two years of planning.</p><h4>Phase I is due to be completed in 2016, how is that progressing?</h4><p>We have had a few setbacks due to the magnitude of investment required for the project. Over the last few years, there have been some challenges with our investors, who are the backbone of the business. Phase I was initially intended to be a prototype of malls, apartments, office blocks, and recreational centers. Due to these challenges however, we decided to create an industrial park and build the prototype of the city around it. After we made that decision, oil prices dropped, and with gold prices also dropping, we decided to create an industrial and manufacturing hub. This would then be followed by housing and lifestyle solutions to compliment the players within the industrial and manufacturing hub. Abu Dhabi provides a good model of how Ghana can build an entire master planned city on available resources. Petronia has a valuable coast, and is based in a region rich in minerals and other resources. It is also just an hour's drive from the Ivory Coast, and Ghana serves as a central point for the entire region. Ghana, like most African countries, relies on imports for things that can be manufactured in country. People are beginning to see the potential in Petronia to be the new Tema, which today is the biggest city in terms of contribution to the country's income because of its harbor and factories. Tema has no gold or oil; it is just an industrial platform. Petronia is set to become such a platform in the Western Region.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2016?</h4><p>We are planning a lot for 2016. Petronia is now established as a city development. Wonda World has built over 200 units for the first time in one year, changing the skyline of Accra in the process. We are developing 1,000 apartments for the underprivileged, and are now branching into public sector housing. We are branching into manufacturing as well, and by forming various partnerships we have created a strong construction company through which we have already completed over 200 units. We are now partnering with some of our suppliers to be able to turn all of our developments into serviced apartments. We are bringing in management groups from countries all across the world, such as Singapore and Portugal. Africa has a bright future in development because these people already have the experience to control and manage the infrastructure. Due to the success of our partnerships, these kinds of projects provide profitable investment opportunities. This is what Petronia and Wonda World are on a mission to prove to the world. We can build 100,000 homes and create the infrastructure and recreational facilities around it to provide a lifestyle that Ghana currently lacks and appeals to the rest of the world. We are making this increasingly possible, and that is what I consider a success. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>There are plans to increase Ghana's domestic aviation capacity. What are the main challenges to that development? </h4><p>The challenge is how to fund expansion; domestic aviation is not as profitable as international aviation. Airports fund themselves via passenger service charges. A domestic service charge has been set low to promote domestic aviation, but the safety standards of airports must be standardized. We already have four regional airports: Tamale, Kumasi, Sunyani, and Takoradi. Takoradi is run by the military air force, though civilian aircraft do travel to it. We embarked on two additional airports last year. One airport is an existing runway of 2,000m and is in good shape, we just need to do some ancillary work. We then started a new airport, beginning with a simple runway of 1,600m by 30m. The project is supposed to be completed this year. Based on our cash flows, we may look at some of the other regional capitals. The president's vision is to have an airport in every region, both to promote socio-political development and to boost domestic aviation. Airport communities tend to have added value, hence we coined the phrase “Airport City.“ We are planning to form JVs with developers for this.</p><h4>Your experience has until two years ago been in the finance sector. What challenges did you face when you took over this company?</h4><p>I spent 25 years in finance and banking, so I came to the airport with a new administration and a mandate to transform the airport in alignment with the President's vision to develop Ghana as a regional aviation hub. Our mission is to provide excellent airport facilities and be a leading airport business in West Africa. Following a self-assessment, we concluded that we needed two things: good infrastructure and excellent service. There was a big infrastructure deficit at Kotoka International Airport (KIA), so we embarked on a program to address that. The airport was overcrowded, most of the equipment was outdated and dilapidated, and there were issues with infrastructure, runways, bathrooms, the terminal building, and the baggage systems. We started to systematically address them all, and we have improved significantly to date, resolving 95% of the issues.</p><h4>Why was Ghana's travel industry so resilient during the Ebola crisis?</h4><p>We suffered by association, but only a bit. Our business at the airport is diverse, and our international market did not suffer. We were proactive from the moment it began. We have a health clinic attached, we introduced thermal body screening thermometers, and there was a lot of public education through posters and hand sanitizers at all the regional airports. The media in Ghana also helped; Ghanaians were aware of what was happening and it did not stop people from traveling.</p><h4>You are about to launch your flagship Terminal 3 project. How will that affect your capacity?</h4><p>We had a footfall last year of 2.5 million. The designed capacity of KIA is around 500,000, so the project is demand-driven rather than speculative. It will be a purpose-built international terminal, and we expect it to be completed around July 2017. It will be a first-class terminal facility capable of handling 5 million passengers a year and 1,200 passengers at peak hours, with six air bridges that can be expanded to eight. It will include 45,000sqft of space for commercial use, three business lounges, and approval for six baggage carousels. We looked to the capital markets to raise funds. The objective was to raise $400 million; we have to date secured $250 million, while the other $150 million has yet to be sourced. The airport has to offer a full complement of services, including hotels, food, waiting lounges, meeting rooms, security, car parks, and all of those related investments are going to have to be provided. Some of those we will provide ourselves, but those that are easier for the private sector to do will be sourced accordingly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was DDP founded and how did it evolve into the largest player in the outdoor advertising market?</h4><p>I started DDP 44 years ago. I was a young graphic designer having worked in advertising for a few years when a lot of people started giving me work for designing logos and school crests and I saw an opening. There was a need for an independent graphic design studio where people could advertise their brands. I started my small graphic design operation using  my mother's table where she used to sell Gari (a local staple food), and by demonstrating what I could do, my clientele began expanding.  Mr. David Wilshire  from the UK approached with an opportunity to do a job for BAT, and things took off from there. Last year I invited Adenia Capital, a venture capital company, into my business, because we are the biggest advertising group in Ghana. We have eight advertising companies in various sectors in our group, with DDP being the first and the biggest. We already have offices in Senegal, Benin, Togo, and offices for others in DRC, as well as partners in Cameroon, Gabon, Niger, and Burkina Faso.</p><h4>Why did you choose to invite partners into the company?</h4><p>We need strong financial support in order to expand outdoor advertising across West Africa. We already have 2,000 billboard spaces in Ghana, and it is common in Africa for the business to die when the owner dies. In order to keep the business alive and expand our borders, I invited the capital group to come into DPP. As we are creating DDP International, we are starting offices in Senegal, Ivory Coast  and Cameroon and we are starting by installing signs in Senegal. What we do is first class, using the same technology as seen in Dubai, Johannesburg or anywhere in the world. </p><h4>How has your client base changed over the years?</h4><p>I do not know of any fast-moving products firm that does not work with us, from Nestlé to Airtel. We deliver a service that is first class, and our prices are competitive. I believe in the Coca-Cola concept of selling a good product worldwide at a fair price. Coca-Cola is one of the most important drinks anywhere in the world, as it is one of the cheapest drinks to buy. This is the whole idea behind our company, to solidify the immediate association between outdoor advertising and DDP.</p><h4>What is your market split in terms of large and small clients?</h4><p>Luckily for us, it is the major players who always advertise big. If we work for MTN and provide 200 billboards, then Airtel want to outdo them and Vodafone will want to outdo Airtel. We also have food advertisers like Nestlé and Unilever, which want to be seen. They have been in the marketplace longer than the telecoms firms, which came in 10 years ago. Telecoms firms now control 60% of our market because everybody wants to communicate; they want to be everywhere, and the others cannot match them.</p><h4>What are the main challenges to expanding regionally?</h4><p>DDP is part of the Argon Group, which is our holding company. The companies in this group across Africa are specialized in media buying, and I use those companies in Senegal, Togo, Benin, and Cí´te d'Ivoire. We already have offices there that buy media for other companies to leverage, and we start there with DDP. We have to use the local people and give them shares so that it becomes a local business. We are all from West Africa, but we cannot go to Cameroon as a purely foreign company from Ghana, we have to use a Cameroonian partner to set up a company.</p><h4>Nigeria is the biggest economy on the continent. Are you looking to enter that market?</h4><p>We have been invited by two Nigerian companies, and one has offered for us to buy them outright. We are currently working all over West Africa, installing billboards in Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, and Liberia. Companies can come to us with a West African campaign, and we have the capacity to implement it with 100 billboards, from Dakar to DRC. We are hoping to migrate signs as is done in the UK or the US. There is no single outdoor company in West Africa with that aim.</p><h4>What are your long-term expansion ambitions?</h4><p>We want to finish with our expansion in West Africa, as we do not need visas. We have available to us the West African regional bank, and it is easy to travel throughout the region. Traveling to Cameroon entails a more extensive visa process, so we want focus first on consolidating our business in West Africa. We already have links in Central Africa; we have offices in Chad, Cameroon, and DRC. We have experience establishing companies in DRC. It will be easy going there, as we have established ourselves. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your current market share?</h4><p>I worked with DHL for 16 months and was then called by Stellar Express, which had acquired the TNT franchise. It wanted somebody to assist in establishing the company, so I came on board. We held about 0.5% when I joined, but we are now more competitive and have around 20%. A lot of TNT clients come to us because we are people-orientated and have developed our logistics accordingly. A lot of courier companies just pick up and deliver, but we even perform the additional service of clearing shipments held at customs. We also deal with airfreight as an added service. We are registered clearers and have clients that ask us to go and clear shipments that are held at DHL. TNT is a multinational company and, therefore, has clients from all over the world, such as MDS, Wal-Mart, Harlequin, Starbow Airlines, UBA, AKAI House, AGS, Steinberg, Coca-Cola, Roberts &amp; Sons, KHR, Movenpick, African Airlines, and Cadbury, among many others. We are the sole company that deals with Cisco and we have a large warehouse for them. Cisco shipments come into our warehouses, we clear for customs, pay its duties, and then deliver. Any time a company needs its equipment, we deliver on its behalf.</p><h4>What is your warehousing capacity?</h4><p>We have a big warehouse and currently house around 2,000 parts for Cisco. Parcels arrive every day; as soon as items are bought, their parts need to be brought into the country. We sometimes have to ship other items into the country when the parts are no longer in the countries. Our pre-finance is also an advantage; we pay duties on behalf of customers. Instead of telling them that the duty amount is ready and they must pay, we pay it for them and then bill them later. It is convenient for the customer to get the shipment quicker.</p><h4>What benefits will the construction of the third terminal building at Kotoka International Airport bring?</h4><p>We have already secured a space at the terminal, as we know it will help us a lot. The new building is a positive move, as the current space is too small and we have had a lot of challenges. Having space in Terminal 3 will give us a competitive edge, as a lot of markets have faced the challenges of inefficiencies at the airport. As a courier, we want to receive our shipments on the same day they are sent, but there are processes that delay the processing of shipments. Our customers do not understand why their shipments take more than 24 hours to be delivered when sent through a courier. This move will encourage competition and better service delivery.</p><h4>How has the demand for you to export products from Ghana grown?</h4><p>The export market has changed, and it is increasing. Not many people wanted to export in the past, but many people are now exporting a variety of things. We send a lot of samples from companies, like Unilever and Coca-Cola. We send clothes, shoes, bags, spare parts for industry, and processed soybean by air freight for a lot of companies like Neurevas. We used to send raw cocoa beans, but these are now processed into cakes here. We used to send raw pineapples and Shea butter, but they are able to process them now into oils and creams. Ghana is moving from exporting raw materials and instead transforming these into value-added goods. Progress has been slow because of the exchange rate, which has affected a lot of people. We can see in the long run that the market is developing. At the same time, our operations are largely imports, as Ghana is an import-based country. From sunglasses to medicine, packaging materials, to laptops; we bring in everything. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Port Authority of Ghana was recently judged as the preferred port in West Africa. How are you building on that success?</h4><p>The port has shown substantial leadership and vision and we are proud of this achievement. The port facilities of course needed to be expanded. Maritime Port Services is investing $1.5 billion in Tema port's infrastructure, building deeper berths of 16m, as well as adding two additional lanes to the linking motorway, transforming it into a six-lane road. The port has modernized the facilities and we are developing an e-clearance process. We have since introduced a single-window platform to make the cargo clearance process more efficient by way of processing the bills of lading and other documents for cargo clearance. We are an import-dependent country, and we receive cargo for our landlocked neighbors. Another development that the Tema port is trying to do is build a dividing terminal so that all containerized carrying vehicles and cars will be going to that terminal, where the removal will take place. We are also developing a container terminal, so instead of having all the containers stay within the port waiting to be moved, they can stay outside of the ports while the owners of the containers pay for them. We are also looking at building a new car terminal.</p><h4>How are the expansions of the Takoradi Port supporting wider economic growth?</h4><p>The western region has become, in recent times, home to not only most of our mineral resources, but also oil, which means that we automatically need to expand the port of Takoradi. The first thing that we have done is engage a Dutch company, which has been doing the reclamation works. The first one has been duly completed and the firm will return shortly for Phase II, which will include further reclamation of additional land. Once we have done that we will have to fully develop a new port facility. The port is aggressively looking for partners to develop its facilities. With the additional interest in the oil and gas industry, I am hopeful that we should not have any challenges in attracting direct investment to build the port up.</p><h4>You have also overseen a boost in Accra's public transport systems. What role have PPPs played in these developments?</h4><p>PPPs help reduce the government's burden, as we no longer need to find money to satisfy the equitable or mobilization costs of these transactions. The private sector is also profit driven and often operates more efficiently. We are currently piloting the bus Rapid Transport system to use the terminals that we have been developing over the past few years. We are also trying to develop some dedicated lanes to reduce travel times and make the process more attractive to passengers. We have now taken delivery of nearly ten rapid transit buses from Scania in Sweden, which has set up a maintenance workshop in Ghana. The pilot program is ongoing and we are supposed to oversee that for the next six months, after which point we will be taking delivery of additional buses from the same company to fully implement the bus Rapid Transit system. We currently have just ten buses, but we intend to acquire 100. We have processed the next 60, which we hope to get soon. While visiting Ghana, the Italian Prime Minister and His Excellency, the President, discussed the prospects of Italian manufacturer Iveco. We are now working on a draft MoU that we hope can facilitate greater acquisition for the Metro Mass Transit Company. With all of the challenges that we have today, it would be great if the company had between 200-300 buses that could operate routes at least in the regional capitals. This would encourage competitors to be reasonable with the fares. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Huawei play in the Ghanaian ICT market?</h4><p>Huawei Ghana has been in the local market for 10 years since its founding in 2005. We have developed three lines of business, the first being our public sector operations, through which we cooperate with the Ministry of Communication, the Ministry of Energy, and numerous other government entities. Our second line of business is in the private sector, working with corporate clients and operators, including MTN, Vodafone, Airtel, Tigo, Glo, and even new operators such as Blu and Surfline. Our final line of business is in the new products segment of the market, such as smartphones and devices.</p><h4>Can you describe your work with Surfline in rolling out Phase II of its LTE/4G capacity?</h4><p>We have demonstrated reliability, cooperation, and advanced technology, and that is why Surfline chose Huawei as its strategic partner for Phase II. Surfline is using us as the supplier of Phase II equipment, as the maintenance service provider, and as the ITO for the whole network. By the end of 2015, we are going to launch some services in Kumasi. Until now, Surfline has only launched 4G services in Accra, so there is a huge demand for the service in Kumasi as well. We should have approximately 40 4G sites available in Kumasi by the beginning of 2016.</p><h4>How has Huawei promoted ICT in Ghana?</h4><p>We use our global experience, financing, and professional expertise to bring more value to the government to increase the level of ICT in Ghana. In 2015 we introduced our Seeds for the Future Program to Ghana. Every year under this program we will invite 15 college-age students from Ghana to come to China for one month of training in the latest ICT technology, as well as having a valuable intercultural experience. They will bring that latest technology back to Ghana. Huawei has also donated four ICT laboratories to universities in Ghana, namely the University of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, the University of Cape Coast, and the University for Development Studies (UDS). This will allow university students to be trained using the latest technology, because we want to help improve the level of education here.</p><h4>How has Huawei adapted its business model to match Ghana's device market?</h4><p>Even though we now rank number three in the world for smart devices, I have found that the African market is better for entry-level smartphones. In the past, the most popular phones have been feature phones, while smartphones now have 18-20% of the Ghana market. We also found from our market analysis that 50-60% of smartphone demand is for phones valued at less than $200. Nevertheless, we are still finding healthy demand here. We launched the high-end P8 phone in mid-2015, and every month we have sold more than 1,000 devices, which has actually exceeded our expectations. In the near future, we expect phones will be replaced by the smartphone. That is why Huawei also provides entry-level smartphones priced at around $50, like the Y300 series. This is good because it meets the demand from people who want to use social media, music sites, and various applications, which in turn creates more demand and adds more value for operators.</p><h4>What is the capacity here to employ local engineers and other Ghanaian staff?</h4><p>Huawei has around 700 employees in Ghana, of which only around 100 are Chinese, while the rest are Ghanaian. These include a number of professionals doing high-tech jobs. We have maintenance service contracts for MTN and Vodafone, and more than 98% of the workers are locals in these two big teams and they carry out network maintenance by themselves. Based on this kind of platform, we want to improve the ICT level of Ghanaians. In the future, we will be able to further reduce the number of Chinese workers here.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2016?</h4><p>We still have positive expectations for 2016 because MTN has received a license to develop its 4G network, and this gives Huawei more opportunities. We also have some other projects operating within the government sector. Our smartphone devices segment has grown quickly as well. The company's smartphone market in Ghana has increased from 3% to 10%, and in 2016 we expect it to increase by another 20-25%. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief history of the Accad Group?</h4><p>We have been in the car business since 1941. We started in the spare parts industry and, 10 years down the line, we established a major workshop to work on engines and gearboxes. It was the only one of its kind in West Africa at that time. In the late 1950s we started with Prince Cars from Japan, as well as Morris and Nissan. In the late 1960s we started an assembly plant and were carrying out parallel imports of cars that weren't assembled domestically. That went on until there was a change in the regime and we stopped assembling. We decided to continue with a full import of cars without assembling them. In 2004, Volkswagen was free and we succeeded in securing the authorized dealership in Ghana. In 2008, I approached Porsche, it being a brand that I had loved since a young boy, and told the managers there that I would like to import those cars. It took about two years for them to decide, and in 2010 we were awarded the importation rights. Since then, we have been doing all three. Around the same time, we also began representing Mercury Marine engines and Quicksilver boats. My father, AR Accad, who was the founder of the company, had a vision of growing the business and reinvesting in Ghana. We have not stopped doing that, we have stayed here, because we believe in Ghana.</p><h4>Do you have to modify the cars as they come in?</h4><p>We offer the full range that the suppliers allow, as we still have to work in Ghana on the quality of the fuels, particularly on the diesel in the country. New technology requires low sulfur content input, and unfortunately we have not reached that level yet for all the engines. We may have the models but not the engines. Everything is modified at the source in the factory, so the advantage of buying a new car from us is that it is tailored to local conditions.</p><h4>Are gray imports an issue for your business model?</h4><p>Yes gray imports are an issue. We are investing in everything, including branding and training, and in every way our overheads are much higher than the gray importers'. Vehicles that come from the US or Europe, which are not made for our roads or the quality of the fuel, may break down and require repair costs after approximately a few months of use. There is also no follow up, especially if there is a recall campaign, and this is an important point. We still allow lots of cars from Europe to be dumped on us, and many of the buses on the roads are not road worthy. A solution should be found, because unfortunately it is a contributor to road accidents in the country and also creates other health hazards.</p><h4>You launched the Porsche Macan last year. How has the uptake been on that compared to your other brands?</h4><p>We did not sell a lot because we did not import it, but our two other brands, Nissan and Volkswagen, are benefiting from the growth of the middle class. Broadly speaking, Africa has been affected in the past two years by the downturn of the European and the American economies. We were sourcing investors in these markets, but with their own economic problems some still have issues that have delayed plans for West Africa and Africa in general, and specifically for Ghana. Many people consider Ghana to be the hub for all of the continent or at least the region. We have gold and fuel and gas, and the country is safe. Our biggest asset is the people. The Ghanaian people are the real treasure of this country because of their personality and hospitality. This makes Ghana what it is, not gold, cocoa, or other commodities. We had bad luck with the Ebola outbreak, and unfortunately I blame the media for that because many people were frightened away from Ebola-free Ghana. We also experienced a drop in the price of petroleum and gold, and we have been very unlucky this year with floods, which have also affected the economy. However, there remains a huge amount of potential here, and we have to think properly about how to work with this and improve on what we have. Looking to the immediate future, we are negotiating for our entry into the truck industry in a more serious way at present. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Karpowership secure the agreement with Ghana's Ministry of Power to supply the country with two 225MW Powerships?</h4><p>Ghana suffers persistent and unpredictable shortages in power supply, which the locals call dumsor. The Ministry of Power was looking for a medium-term, fast-track solution to bridge this gap between demand and capacity. Karpowership's Powerships have the advantage of being quickly deployed. This is an ideal solution for the current power deficit, staving off the negative social or economic impact that power shortages would otherwise have on the country. </p><h4>What kind of infrastructure do you need for your ships to be able to operate here?</h4><p>The main advantage of a Powership is its self-sufficiency. The Powerships contain a full power plant, including the substation, which is unique among most of the rapidly deployed generation assets. The only infrastructural constraint is the transmission to land capability. Ghana has fairly robust infrastructure in this sense, not having suffered from a lack of investment or maintenance. Our transmission lines at the Tema site are already completed and in place, so the project will be operational within a few weeks of the Powership's arrival. The second Powership is expected to be delivered in the 2H2016.</p><h4>What role have your partners played in Ghana and how is your relationship with them?</h4><p>All of our stakeholders have been supportive and welcoming. The Ministry of Power has been helpful as our off-taker. This kind of relationship is a first for Ghana and also a first for Karpowership. There is always a learning curve in new partnerships, particularly when using a business model such as ours that many people do not yet understand. It is understandably difficult to grasp the concept of the Powerships without first seeing them in operation. The project will get a lot more support and understanding once Karadeniz Powership Aysegul Sultan begins functioning as a power station.</p><h4>How big are these Powerships and how long will they be deployed in Ghana?</h4><p>A Powership is about the size of a football pitch. A 225MW power plant would require one and a half times that space. We have signed an agreement to work with the Ministry of Power for 10 years, which is a standard duration for medium-term projects. Most independent power producers (IPPs) work under 20-30 year contracts. As the portfolio in Ghana develops and as the government realizes its vision over the next 10 years, bringing in a 20,000MW coal plant with an additional 1,200MW from other stations, the Powerships will be uniquely positioned. When the Powerships are no longer needed, we can move our assets elsewhere. </p><h4>Will Karpowership extend its presence throughout the region beyond Ghana?</h4><p>This is a part of our plan. We provide utility scale solutions, and the Powerships have the flexibility to be quickly deployed, making our value propositions a plug-in-and-play scenario. There is a shortage of affordable power in West Africa, as is the case throughout most of the continent. Karpowership's Powerships offer at least a partial solution to those challenges. Our strategy in West Africa is to make Ghana our power hub. Ghana is the sweet spot in this region and it offers easy access to other countries such as Cote D'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso. This is a major advantage, especially given the overall business environment and stability here. We expect to add more megawatts to our production capacity in Ghana over the next couple of years. West African economies are growing fast and they will need access to quick power before they can develop their own energy infrastructure. Ghana has the connections and grid strength to get things done from this country all the way to Nigeria to the east and Burkina Faso to the north. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You started in 1992 and, since then, the company has become one of the key infrastructure players here. Was that the vision when you started?</h4><p>We had a focus and determination about what we wanted to deliver and how we wanted to deliver it. Then we targeted the larger supply chain. We started with importing cables, and then began to export by bringing semi-finished products into the country, adding value, and then exporting. Now that we have power, we also produce the cables here. We then realized that our clients also needed electrical accessories such as transformers and switches. Ghana also has raw materials like aluminum and copper, which gives us the full supply chain. We are going to extend what we have into neighboring countries, as they have the same needs. For us to sustain the market, we must train our people in terms of technology and use that to generate efficiency. We need a technology transfer, just as is the case in other parts of the world. My motivation is the desire to see this happen, especially among women. We have to start planning now for the next 50 years, forecasting where Ghana will be so that we will be able to catch up with the other parts of the world.</p><h4>What is the current manufacturing capacity here?</h4><p>We recently installed new machinery, which doubled capacity. We now produce 12,000 metric tons of aluminum and 4,000 tons of copper. We have widened our scope, and now we need to improve on training to be more efficient, as we cannot afford wastage. We currently have about 250 employees.</p><h4>Which of the raw materials that you use are sourced in Ghana?</h4><p>We currently have all of the raw materials here, but we are of course going through a little challenge in terms of power. Once the energy supply is sustainable, we will be able to source aluminum locally. We have to import the majority of raw materials.</p><h4>How did dumsor (load shedding) impact your operation?</h4><p>It is something that has woken all of us up and is pushing us to become more efficient, because we are now considering installing solar panels to cut costs. It has shown us that there is no time to waste when implementing such efficiency-increasing initiatives. The power situation is getting better, but we cannot relax. We have to think about the near future and the increasing population, which we have to be able to support.</p><h4>You already export to the ECOWAS region. Are you looking beyond that?</h4><p>We are actually looking at exporting beyond ECOWAS, as the quality is virtually the same following our becoming ISO 9001:2008 qualified three years ago. Our product is of the same standard as anywhere in the world. We are looking at Europe, because here we have raw materials, the capacity to add value, and products that meet international standards. That of course means that we have to have the right level of technology to ensure that our systems meet the needs of our clients. I always encourage other industries to make the effort and earn certification, because it helps and motivates the company to improve their performance.</p><h4>You also have cable operations in the marine sector to support the growing energy industry. How does your location allow you to tailor your services?</h4><p>We have ports here, so it was a natural step to produce steel wire ropes for the ports, as we have to be responsive. The Tema dry-dock and shipyard needs this kind of equipment. We have to look at our surroundings and understand how we can enhance it. Tema harbor is expanding, as is the fiber-optic market. If all goes well, we want to go into the fiber optics by the end of next year. The world is moving on. We used to do telephone cables, but the demand for that is dwindling. If we are not catching up, then we will be left behind. We are looking for a partnership for this, because although we have the necessary capacity and local expertise, we have not done it before.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Our plan is to expand and add to what we are doing by more than 50%. We have to catch up now that the power situation has improved. The need for financing is high, but so are the local rates, so having a partner to support our development would help a lot. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which areas of the economy do you see significant opportunities for investment?</h4><p>The Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC) is a government agency established under Act 865 2013 to promote, coordinate and facilitate the growth of the economy. Investment opportunities abound in the entire value chain of the oil and gas sector in Ghana. Aside from the opportunities in this sector, there is potential in infrastructure, particularly in expanding existing roads, ports, rail, and airport facilities. The power sector also presents opportunities. The center will be seeking to meet the investment targets articulated by the National Development Plan. With the increase in demand for housing solutions, investors can consider investment in the real estate sector for opportunities in both low-cost and luxury housing. The luxury segment in particular ties in with the tourism and hospitality industry and we are working with the Ministry of Tourism to channel investment into that area. Opportunities exist in agriculture, where we are seeking to significantly increase investment and our collaboration with the Ghana Free Zones Board and the Ghana Export Promotion Authority will help stimulate this sector. We are also looking to attract investors to collaborate with local businesses in manufacturing, assembly of light electrical parts, and electronic accessories.</p><h4>What impact is Ghana's short-term and cyclical instability having on investor interest?</h4><p>In 2015, Ghana had challenges like currency depreciation and interruption of power supply; however, investors remained interested in the country and it continues to be a safe and secure investment destination. In addition to political stability and streamlined investment procedures, Ghana possesses a robust legal and regulatory framework. According to the World Bank's 2015 Doing Business report, Ghana ranks as the best destination in West Africa in terms of the ease of doing business and ranks among the top five in Africa. Despite the short-term cyclical instability, the GIPC recorded appreciable levels of FDI inflows in 2015 after two years of implementing the GIPC Act. The total number of registered projects was 170, with a total estimated value of $2.68 billion.</p><h4>Recently there has been a large focus on the role of ECOWAS in building sustainable economic growth models. What is being done to encourage this regional investment flow?</h4><p>West African countries have enormous potential to strengthen competitiveness, which will drive growth, reduce poverty, and deliver jobs in the region. The ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme (ETLS) for instance is one of the means through which regional investment is being encouraged. It seeks to provide impetus to the process of economic integration and development in the West African sub-region. It is expected to provide easier access to markets in other ECOWAS countries and thereby encourage local manufacturing outfits to compete favorably with cheap imported products. The scheme is also expected to encourage entrepreneurial development through the provision of preferential treatment in specific areas among member states. Extensive progress has also been made on freedom of movement, a crucial part of ensuring a sustainable regional market. In 1980, visa requirements or entry permits for ECOWAS citizens were eliminated and, from July 2016, Ghana will be allowing citizens of AU member states to enter the country and obtain visas on arrival with the option to stay for up to 30 days. This measure is expected to stimulate air travel, trade, investment, and tourism in the long run.</p><h4>The “Made in Ghana“ campaign is helping to galvanize local companies and promote them overseas. How can domestic investment be encouraged to support these flagship companies?<br></h4><p>The GIPC actively encourages, promotes and facilitates investment both into and within Ghana, and we work to do this in a number of ways like ensuring awareness of investment and business opportunities. We also celebrate corporate excellence and successful enterprise building through initiatives like the Ghana Club 100 awards. In addition, the GIPC is also facilitating domestic investment through its Call for Projects initiative, which allows domestic investors to submit project profiles for screening and packaging for inclusion in the GIPC's project catalogue. We employ this worldwide as a promotional instrument aimed at various categories of investors that may be interested in establishing partnerships and providing financing. As part of our strategy for 2016, the GIPC will focus on improving upon its operational efficiency, provide higher level services and roll out the second phase of our “Think Ghana Make it Happen“ campaign with the target of propelling Ghana to become the preferred investment destination in Africa. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The no premium, no cover policy has been an important part of the NIC's agenda. From your perspective as the regulator, what do you think the impact of this directive has been on the market so far?</h4><p>It has had a big impact on the liquidity of the insurance companies. Before this directive came, insurance companies were only able to collect 35% of their premiums. It was as if they were virtually begging the policyholder to pay. Then, when there was no claim in the year, the policyholder did not feel the need to pay the outstanding premium, even though the insurance company had provided them with cover. With this new directive, in 2014, the NIC asked insurance companies to stop selling on credit and gave them up to the end of 2014 to collect all outstanding premiums. Insurance companies were required to write off all outstanding premiums as of December 31, 2014, from their balance sheet. We were not going to accept them as receivables, as we did previously. Since then the market has been happy. The only hitch is that now that we are getting the premiums upfront; claims have to be dealt with adequately and promptly. That is the next phase. We have issued the guidelines, but we have not started enforcement. The insurance industry tells me this policy is the best thing that has happened to the market in a long time. Initially, they were apprehensive about the risk of losing clients. When we first started with this program of reform, I imagined our greatest challenge was going to be the public. We thought they would not pay up, but the public presented no problem. </p><h4>What do you consider to be the key dynamics that make Ghana a potentially attractive market for investment in insurance?</h4><p>Ghana has been categorized as a lower-middle income economy. We have a growing middle-income group, and now we have a large group of unemployed young people, which is not ideal. However, we hope that in the not too distant future, all these people will find jobs. There is potential for this to drive the insurance market. The whole month of October was dedicated as Insurance Awareness Month. Therefore, we did a lot of education together with the Ghana Insurers Association (GIA) to boost awareness. We involved the Ministry of Finance and we did programs on television, advertising, and promoting the benefits of insurance. The NIC has a complaints bureau and if you have a problem with an insurance company you can come and report it to us and we can mediate. </p><h4>Are you seeing a result in terms of insurance penetration rates?</h4><p>We have not done a survey yet; however, we believe there will be some change even if it is not drastic. Things are improving because previously we found that the boards of directors were not always directly involved in directing their companies and not exercising their over-sight responsibilities over the companies. NIC did a training course for them and we told them we are now going to hold boards of directors responsible, therefore management teams have to do the right thing. We are also strengthening our position by getting to know our market. The market is responsive. People have been telling us that they did not even know that there was an insurance commission. Now consumers and the industry are getting to know about us, and we are becoming visible. We have just had our very first industry meeting where we invited CEOs and chairmen to discuss our problems. Now the commission has a strong relationship with the industry. They realize that we need to work together. On top of that, reforms such as no premium-no-cover, corporate governance, risk-based supervision, and risk-based solvency are all about improving efficiency and strengthening the balance sheet of the industry. For example, a few years ago, the largest asset you could see on the balance sheet was premium debts. That has changed. Now you see the investment-asset ratio of companies rising to 74%.</p><h4>In terms of the competitive landscape, how would you assess the number of companies and is there room for consolidation? Do you see the market changing?</h4><p>We feel we have too many companies for the size of our population and market. Currently there are 48 companies. Of these, 26 are non-life insurance companies and 22 life insurance companies. We also have three reinsurance companies and 76 broking firms. Within that number some are bigger and some smaller. Therefore, there is room for some of those entities to merge and become larger. Nonetheless, we still receive applications from entities that want to come into the market. Our legislation does not give us the mandate to cut the number of companies, but we are considering this. The minimum requirement has been increased to around $5 million (GHS15 million) for insurance companies and for reinsurance companies $12.5 million (GHS40 million). </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the factors that led to Ghana's energy crisis and what are your priorities for dealing with it?</h4><p>Ghana's first major hydroelectric power plant, the Akosombo Hydroelectric Plant, was commissioned in 1965 with an installed generating capacity of 609MW that later increased to 1020MW. In 1982, the second major hydroelectric power plant, the 160MW Kpong Hydroelectric Power Plant, was commissioned downstream from the Akosombo Dam. The third hydroelectric power plant was commissioned in 2013, with an installed capacity of 400MW at Bui in the Brong Ahafo Region on the Black Volta River. The country's electricity needs had largely been catered to by these hydroelectric dams until water levels began decreasing. The Akosombo, Kpong, and Bui Dams now operate at 50% or less capacity. There is therefore a need to augment electricity production by looking at other sources of electricity such as thermal, solar, and coal. In the short term, the government is considering a number of generation projects to help mitigate the shortfalls in generation capacity. These projects will commence in 2016 and include the 220MW Kpone Thermal Power Project (KTPP), the 110MW TICO Expansion Project in Takoradi, the first half of the 360MW Sunon Asogli Phase 2 Project, and the 38MW VRA TT2PP expansion project. The government has also fast-tracked such energy projects as the 225MW Powership in Tema, another 250MW emergency AMERI Project in Takoradi, and a 300MW GE Early Power Project in Tema. In the medium term, projects slated for delivery between 2016 and 2018 include the 360MW Asogli Phase 2 Project, the 350MW CenPower Project where ground has already been broken and civil works commenced, and parliamentary approval has been obtained for Government Consent and Support Agreements (GCSA) authorizing both a 360MW Jacobsen Power Project and the 240MW Amandi Project. The government is also considering adding 1,000MW of “clean" coal into the generation mix.</p><h4>How is your Ministry prioritizing gas development in the country?</h4><p>In order to address the erratic nature of gas supply from Nigeria through the West African Gas Pipeline, the government is currently considering fuel supply projects such as an emergency LNG project to be delivered at Tema by West African Gas Limited, which has already commenced, while another regular LNG project to be delivered by Quantum Power Ghana Gas Limited in the second quarter of 2016 is progressing steadily. The government has also agreed through the cabinet to make available the reverse flow of gas through the West Africa Gas Pipeline from Ghana National Gas Company in the Western Region to the Tema power enclave in the event of gas shortages from Nigeria.</p><h4>How do you forecast the capital markets' support of Ghana's energy challenges?</h4><p>In 2014, the government of Ghana signed a compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) under which MCC will support the power sector in Ghana to provide adequate and reliable supply of power while helping ECG maintain a clean balance sheet. One area that MCC prioritized was the restructuring of the Electricity Company of Ghana in order to bring private participation to the electricity distribution sector. Its role is to look at what form private-sector participation (PSP) should take. Its responsibility is to find a solution to strengthen ECG's strategy and employ its  finances. Its studies conducted thus far for the MCC recommended the implementation of either partial privatization or concessions. Under partial privatization, part of the shares of the government in ECG (no less than 51%) would be sold to a private entity, which would then manage and operate the ECG distribution system. Under the concession option, the operations of ECG would be handed over to a single concessionaire, which would control and operate the ECG network for a period of 20-30 years. At the end of the concession period, the operations would return to ECG. The assets would remain at all times during the concession period the bona-fide property of ECG. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kosmos discovered oil in 2007, and its Jubilee field was largely developed by Tullow. How did Technip get involved?</h4><p>Kosmos joined with Tullow in 2009 to develop the Jubilee field, where Tullow was the majority operator, alongside with Kosmos, GNPC, and Sabre. It was the first time that Tullow had ever developed a field and it needed stronger technical support. We brought a lot of technical experience and helped it complete the first phase at Jubilee. Afterwards, we continued working on the field and did the gas export line, and then the second phase of Jubilee. Between 2009 and 2014, we were busy with the Jubilee field. The whole country was excited by this discovery, so the authorities wanted to produce as soon as possible. We delivered the first oil after four years, which normally should take six years; the main challenge was the speed. The second field after that was the TEN Field. The tender was presented in 2013 and we took the opportunity to continue supporting Tullow in that development, trying to benefit from the lessons learned at Jubilee in order to deliver on even better terms.</p><h4>In October 2013, Tullow awarded $1.23 billion in contracts for subsea construction and installation for TEN to a Technip-Subsea 7 consortium. How has that project progressed? </h4><p>When TEN arrived, the project was huge, but it has since been split into two phases. At the time, we did not have enough vessels to support the project, hence our need for partners. This is why we did it with Subsea 7. It is a consortium in which we have 700 of the total, and Subsea 7 retains 500. It is the same scope, but we split the project geographically. The whole project has seen great success, and we have delivered on time and within our budget.</p><h4>The Jubilee field took longer to reach peak production than initially projected, resulting in lower-than-expected revenues. Are you seeing expectations in today's forecasting scaling back?</h4><p>We are not facing that. We know the fields here and we know the market. Eni's project has been approved as well. Ghana is right on track with those plans. The biggest issue recently was the boundary dispute between Cí´te d'Ivoire and Ghana. This has impacted some field development because the fields cross the dispute area, meaning that no drilling is allowed in this area and some projects there have been delayed. Eni's project has received commitment from the government, so those plans are going ahead. For now, each operator has to assess the commercial viability with the oil price as it is, as well as the delays in development that may result from the boundary dispute.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We will be involved with the TEN field, which will give the country gas and increase the power generation and power production, both key components of sustainable development in Ghana that will create a platform for Ghana's industrial development. After the official launch of Eni, we will move from tendering to operation, which will bring in more gas for Ghana to produce electricity in 2017. We have found that while projects are being delayed in other countries, it is business as usual in Ghana. Though this might overexcite the competition and attract more foreign competitors to Ghana, the market will ultimately expect more. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With low oil prices, companies are trying to reduce spending per barrel. What technologies are you offering to reduce companies' costs and thereby maintain your competitiveness?</h4><p>Baker Hughes is very big on R&amp;D and constantly looking for ways to introduce new products to the market. With oil prices where they are these days, costs are a very important factor in terms of customers keeping projects alive. We continue to introduce new products to customers, sometimes products our clients have never considered. For example, in directional drilling, most companies will drill their wells with conventional tools or with first generation ultrasound drilling tools. We want to introduce a system whereby you can drill that well without the logging-while-drilling (LWD) technologies, so you can drill and log at the same time, eliminating wireline loss. So you save on drilling efficiency time. Our clients are renting rigs, which is a day-by-day cost, so we help save time with this system. That's one of the innovative technologies that we bring to the marketplace. We do the same in chemicals, with a lot of R&amp;D investment going into the chemical products that enhance production for our clients.</p><h4>Do you have any problems with post-water production in Ghana?</h4><p>Some, but not a lot. With the likes of Tullow, we've been injecting a lot of chemicals. Ghana is more likely to develop gas fields than oil fields because it is exploring gas for power. For example, the Sankofa field that ENI is going into right now is just to produce gas for power in Ghana. It plans to drill 15 wells. Drilling will probably take about two years, with production expected in about 42 months. So it's a long-term project. In 2017 there will be another big gas project being initiated as well. With the country's power problems, there's a lot of gas in Ghana at the moment. Therefore, we have a three-pronged approach: improving our footprint in Ghana, developing local capabilities, and developing contact capabilities to provide the right competencies and the right human capacity to serve Ghana's needs, while another key pillar is our partnership with government agencies and GNPC and with their partners as well, because they are key players in this market.</p><h4>You recently met with the Minister for Power and discussed boosting local content. What sorts of initiatives are you considering?</h4><p>We have to develop local Ghanaians, improving their competencies and capabilities. The aim is that more Ghanaians can perform roles that have previously been done by expats. We have been doing our share in terms of hiring and training Ghanaians at Baker Hughes, and we continue to develop local talent and human resources. We've also sent many Ghanaians for additional training and specialization overseas. We'll also start forming joint ventures and partnerships with Ghanaian companies, helping them develop their technical abilities and capabilities. That will help us keep our business alive in Ghana and develop our capabilities in Ghana.</p><h4>Do you expect more joint ventures in the market, and is there any government initiative to push legislation and regulations to enable more partnerships and JVs in Ghana?</h4><p>Yes, I think that will be the way to go—foreign companies teaming up with Ghanaian companies to forge new paths and projects in the oil and gas sector. The government and the Petroleum Commission have also ensured that local content is a requirement for any company wishing to invest and do business in Ghana. A certain amount of money and funds are required to develop, hire, procure, train, and partner with Ghanaians in Ghana. We are already perfectly positioned to abide by these new regulations, having been here a long time and having already done our share in terms of hiring and working with local Ghanaians and developing local capabilities in the company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been your strategy for growth?</h4><p>Stanbic Group was, and still is, the largest bank in Africa by assets, and has a considerable African footprint. I decided that we needed to make it one of the top three banks within three years and a top-tier bank by year five, which we managed. We had two branches at that time and one agency. Stanbic Bank runs three business; corporate investment, retail, and wealth, so we had to build a configuration that could respond to our client base. Our initial strategy was to build a very strong corporate investment capability. That developed our global markets business, which involves treasury and intermediating foreign exchange, interest rate management, trading securities, and some structured transactions to ensure we are active on the foreign exchange markets. We saw our multinational business expand in the corporate and investment banking area. We had to make sure we had points of representation across the whole country so we could be a collections and a payment platform for the multinationals. There are many mining companies based in rural areas, so we expanded the bank network -  we now have 34 branches, up from three. Our focus has also been to make sure we get the right people into the bank at all levels. One area of measuring is market share, which we hope to push up to 10%. Our cost of income ratio exceeds 50% or better. We are looking at the equality of our loan book, which is again a ceiling of 2% or better. Our shareholder return is a 27% return on equity. We also want to make sure we push our brand image. We have to be the go-to branch, whether it is for multinationals, the government, or domestic corporates that want to do much more value-adding bank solutions and services. We want to be a brand that attracts the right companies and gives its employees the best opportunity for growth and contribution.</p><h4>How did you win the best investment bank in Ghana award?</h4><p>Investment banking is where we can lead in value addition, and that is where the differentiator for a bank like Stanbic resides. Investment banking is for enabling governments or private investors to navigate difficult terrain and still be able to access the right levels of capital that they need. Our investment banking offering allows us to be the ears and eyes on the ground and also allows us to attract the right caliber of people; it is a strong proposition. We have qualified people and they are the first to see opportunities and are also able to tap product specialists to come in and put deals together. That has been our strategy and it is working very well. </p><h4>How important is innovation?</h4><p>We are one of the most dominant banks in the most developed financial services markets of Africa. In terms of modern payments, we are ahead of the curve. What holds us back are certain regulations and also the readiness of our clients. In terms of electronic cards, we probably have the best cards and our ATMs are the most enabled for foreign cards. We see a lot of use of our ATMs by foreigners because we have Visa, MasterCard, and the rest. We also offer Money Wallet, which works globally and is protected from theft. We recently launched an app for smartphones to pay for services, and we are trying to get as many merchants on it as possible. We held a conference recently to encourage direct debits. In Europe and North America, direct debits account for about 60% of payments and cash is less than 5%, but the reverse is true in Africa. Part of the role of Stanbic Bank is to encourage the use of direct debits. We are trying to improve the payments and collection environment to increase efficiency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led you to found the Institute for Fiscal Studies?</h4><p>There cannot be any disagreement about the fact that as a nation we have had fiscal challenges for years. This Institute has therefore been founded to contribute to Ghana's fiscal management through innovative research into relevant public finance issues. In doing this, we would be able to provide practical recommendations that would help to put government finances on a sustainable path and thus ensure the socio-economic transformation of the country.</p><h4>Your reports noted how the IMF's rebound expectations for GDP were a bit optimistic. What else can Ghana do to reach its medium-term targets?</h4><p>Our reports indicated that the price of crude oil started falling in July 2014. A year before that time, the price of crude oil was slightly over $100 per barrel. The general macro-economic environment has also not been stable. We are witnessing exchange rate instability as well as soaring inflation. The view of the Institute is that all of this will work against the growth of the economy this year. As a result our view toward the short-term growth prospects does not look too bright. However, we have a lot of confidence in the medium-term growth prospects and as a country we are working toward the medium-term transformation of the economy.  Now a lot is being done in the energy sector, expansion in infrastructure, diversification in the export sector, and a huge growth in human capital through a major improvement in the educational sector.</p><h4>Transparency and efficiency are watchwords of the current government. What role will technology and software play in driving this agenda?</h4><p>Technology has long been recognized by the government as a major player in Ghana's quest to achieve transparency and efficiency in the country's fiscal management. In 1997, the government embarked on a wide range of public financial management reforms termed the Public Financial Management Reform Programme (PUFMARP). An important aspect of PUFMARP, which was aimed at enhancing efficiency, accountability, and transparency of the financial management function of the government, was a technology/software component called Budget and Public Expenditure Management System (BPEMS). In 2010, Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information Systems (GIFMIS) was introduced to replace it. The major focus of the GIFMIS is the upgrading and fresh installation of Oracle Public Sector Financial e-business Suite software. As part of GIFMIS, budget reforms focusing on Programme Based Budgeting (PBB) were also implemented. GIFMIS now has widespread use in the country's public sector and there is no doubt that both transparency and efficiency have been enhanced.</p><h4>What key reforms are you expecting?</h4><p>I can only talk about the reforms the government itself has stated that it is going to introduce in the financial sector in 2016. Firstly, the government will use the book building approach in allocating issuance on the domestic capital market similar to the approach used for Eurobond on the International Capital Market in order to promote a more active engagement between the government and its book runner as well as large institutional investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, and mutual funds. Secondly, the government is of the view that there exists a significant amount of assets that lie unclaimed in the financial sector. These include dormant bank accounts and unclaimed dividend, interest payments, pensions, and insurance benefits. Currently there is no regulatory framework to govern the management of this large pool of assets, which, according to the government, represents a significant portion of private savings in the economy and which are often forgone without a structure to consciously trace the beneficiary's next of kin. The government plans to implement a Dormant Asset Scheme by proactively taking measures to improve the tracing of beneficiary owners and providing for sound investment of the scheme's assets.</p><h4>Do you have a message of confidence for investors looking at Africa?</h4><p>Africa's economy is growing faster than the economies of all other continents. Indeed more than one-third of the 54 African Countries are registering annual GDP growth of more than 6%. Today, Africa's economy stands at about $2 trillion and indeed it is booming and attracting more investors around the world as confidence continues to grow. Intra-African trade is growing rapidly, 20% of governments' spending is on education, the continent is becoming increasingly stable, and we have most of the world's arable land and soon the world's largest workforce. These factors are rapidly shaping the socio-economic transformation of the various economies and thus improving the lives of the African people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the many lines of business under UT Holdings develop?</h4><p>UT started as a unique financial services company and a finance house for lending to SMEs and the informal sector. Banks typically avoid serving this sector because it is risky and difficult to quantify due to a lack of data. Unfortunately, 78% of the economy falls into the informal sector, where companies need startup capital and funds to grow and expand. As we began to understand the SME market and its needs, we realized that we needed the support of other structures and institutions. We developed UT Logistics because we could not lend to importers safely unless the goods were first cleared, warehoused, and collateralized. The collateralization process requires a quick evaluation of properties, and we therefore expanded our capabilities further and established UT Properties. We later acquired UT Life to capitalize on synergies with our lending activity. UT Private Securities may ostensibly seem out of place with the rest of our business lines, but it integrates well with our group by supplying personnel and monitoring equipment for our clients, as one of our main concerns is ensuring clients' safety and respect. We had previously outsourced security services for our buildings and car parks, but this presented many difficulties so we decided to develop our own private security resources that fit better with our values.</p><h4>How receptive has the market been to UT Holding's expansion of financial services in Nigeria and South Africa?</h4><p>We have experienced a learning curve so far. We have had to review South Africa and start very small. The important lesson that we learned was that it is necessary to work with local partners for this kind of venture. In both Nigeria and South Africa we intend to establish relationships with local partners. Nigeria is interesting because when we entered that market we were being told that our operation would fail within its first year; that was over four years ago.</p><h4>How would you evaluate access to capital for SMEs in Ghana?</h4><p>We have been trailblazers in developing a capital market for SMEs in Ghana. We started with lending, but now provide a wide range of services to such an extent that the central bank even finds it difficult to replicate our model in some cases. Successfully providing capital support for SMEs is a matter of ensuring that any credit from the financial sector will be mutually beneficial to the client. We are keen to ensure that our loans are actually going to improve the life of the people receiving them.</p><h4>The first half of 2015 was difficult for UT Bank. How did you manage to turn things around?</h4><p>Ghana has had all sorts of economic hardships that culminated in the recent IMF bailout. Our problems of access to electricity, unstable currency, devaluation, high inflation, and high tariffs on utilities have all had a harsh impact on SMEs. Companies in the manufacturing sector recorded losses almost across the board because of the consequent reductions in their working capital. The currency depreciation damaged business in the services and trading sectors, which rely on imported goods. The government was not paying companies in the oil sector and recoveries were not being paid for offshore locations. The government was simply not paying its contractors and this affected us directly, unlike other banks that were not financing SMEs. We wanted to look at the problem from within because we cannot control the external economic environment. The issue became how to restructure our internal processes and systems to ensure that UT Bank can survive these downturns. We changed our management structure and examined the whole market to refocus on the sectors we wanted to be involved in. We identified, in this reassessment, our shortcomings, retrained our staff, and introduced a system to evaluate our risk management function and changed the credit appraisal process. We aggressively mobilized deposits in order to reduce the impact of the excessive rise in interest rates. We built on our existing retail loans to expand our portfolio of cheaper deposits. We recorded losses of approximately $7.4 million and $690,000 in 1Q2015 and 2Q2015, respectively, totaling 1H2015 losses at just over $8 million. We drastically reduced our losses and were back on the right track by 3Q2015 with a quarterly profit of over $950,000. We have the right plan in place and so we have high confidence in the team we have put together. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the wake of multiple Boko Haram attacks in the region, what can be done to enhance security within the region?</h4><p>The new Nigerian government has done a lot to combat the threat posed by Boko Haram and has essentially put that organization on the retreat. However, we still have to maintain a greater level of vigilance. We have to use the peace building architecture that we have devised and the early warning systems we have already established in our regions and use those mechanisms to protect our citizens. ECOWAS is an integrated region that allows for the free movement of citizens, which creates a greater imperative for national structures to be more effectively integrated. Increasingly, regular communications with one another will naturally promote the sharing of information and provide as much intelligence as possible on request, allowing us to work together to deal with any security challenges that may arise. We currently allow for free movement among member states for a period of three months without a visa or any form of residence requirements. This will change, as we are planning to launch the ECOWAS biometric identity card, which will operate as an identity card, travel document, residence permit, and work permit.</p><h4>What are the key countries you are working with to return to Ghana's 2011-13 GDP growth levels?</h4><p>Our focus is on developing new partnerships to deal with key infrastructure challenges and to increase investment in other growth areas while developing economic opportunities, jobs, and improving the standard of living. We are no longer in a position to take on additional debt to deal with the infrastructure challenges we have, and investments now have to be commercially viable. The focus is on developing PPPs (but not PPPs that are backed with sovereign guarantees) whereby we can assure our investing partner that any funds generated from investments are available to repay any financing facility and create a platform for greater investments in our economy.</p><h4>In which sectors have you identified key opportunities for growth?</h4><p>The number one issue for us right now is energy. We must expand our power generation, improve transmission, have more efficient distribution, and even push our generation capacity in excess of our national demand, as we have the infrastructure to export it. Some of the challenges we are facing right now are due to our infrastructure not being able to keep up with domestic demand, hence the energy sector is the number one area where we would like to attract new investments. Transportation infrastructure and supporting logistics infrastructure are also important. We are looking for partnerships to expand our existing ports and harbors and develop new inland ports. Likewise, we have seen an upswing in the domestic air travel market, and there is potential in that sector as well. The provision of water is also a basic utility that we all need. Dealing with the challenge of waste management is something that every country, city, and municipality has to deal with. We have had some PPP projects that have been interesting, but there is room for more. The government is looking for investments from the private sector in order to deal with the infrastructure deficit we have. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Chamber's new office in Accra helped increase business opportunities between the countries?</h4><p>Our international offices are part of our expansion strategy and our aim to explore new markets for investment and trade opportunities on behalf of our members. The new office in Ghana marks the second office opened in Africa. The first, in Ethiopia, was inaugurated in 2013. These developments underscore the commitment of the Dubai Chamber to strengthening economic ties with Africa. The launch of this office is an important development in the expansion of Dubai Chamber's footprint in Africa and sends a strong signal of our commitment to enhance ties in both Ghana and in the West Africa region. This office has acted as a link between our Western African counterparts and us, and has opened many trade and investment opportunities.</p><h4>What are the key sectors for investment in Ghana?</h4><p>Ghana is endowed with abundant natural wealth, including vast agricultural, mining, and human resources. Along with its growing manufacturing sector, agriculture remains a key sector of the economy. The fastest growing export markets for Ghana's cocoa beans and products are found in the Middle East, South Asia, and the Asia-Pacific regions, which are suitable for Dubai intermediation. Cocoa represents 57% of Ghana's export earnings, and the country is the second-largest producer of the crop after Cote d' Ivoire, accounting for 34% of the global cocoa market. The Chamber has been working closely with Ghana to promote the trade of cocoa. Ghana's exports of cocoa to Dubai have grown over the years to AED27 million in 2014. Poor infrastructure has made logistics expensive for companies in every sector, and with most prominent Gulf players in this sector, such as DP World, Aramex, and Kuwait's Agility, a lot of opportunities exist in the port and logistics sectors as well as aviation sub-sectors like refuelling and ground handling. The manufacturing sector also offers immense opportunities, whether it is in oil and gas, agriculture, or automobiles.</p><h4>How do you assess non-oil trade between Ghana and Dubai?</h4><p>Dubai's non-oil trade with Ghana registered at AED3 billion in the first nine months of 2015. The West African country is ranked 44th on Dubai's list of trading partners worldwide, and there are currently 27 Ghanaian companies registered with the Chamber. </p><p><em>This is an uncut, unedited interview, available only to our premium subscribers.</em></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You founded SAS in 1994. Who are your primary clients?</h4><p>I started  SAS to do investment, starting with stock brokerage. We soon added corporate financial advisory services, consulting for companies that want to go to market to raise money. Apart from companies, we also advise government institutions. Later, as we established ourselves, we followed accounts and went into asset management—pension funds, provident funds, individual wealth, and, of course, our own investment funds, such as the Fortune Fund. These are our three broad areas; stock brokerage, asset management, and corporate finance advisory services.</p><h4>How did you then develop Strategic Initiatives Ltd?</h4><p>Knowing how small the market for these services is, the deals being few and far between, and instead of waiting for companies to come to us for advice to raise money to fund their projects, we looked for opportunities to pursue our own projects. I started Strategic Initiatives Ltd, and identified the sectors that were most in need. One area we looked at was the energy sector. I went out and presented a case to my Chinese counterparts, who came in and established Sunon Asogli Power Ltd and initially invested $203 million to build a 200MW combined-cycle gas-fired plant. There is an ongoing expansion for another 360MW, and by May of next year total capacity will be 560MW. We also worked on Africa World Airlines, again with Chinese partners, and this has become the leader in the small domestic market. We hope that next year we will see more expansion and collaboration with other airlines. We are now mostly targeting renewable energy. We are looking at the mini-hydropower segment through a new subsidiary, Lighting and Construction Africa Company Ltd. We have submitted an application for a provisional license covering nine mini-hydro sites, and we are also looking at solar. Hopefully, perhaps within the next two weeks, we will submit an application for a provisional license to build solar power plants in the Upper West Region of Ghana. We are also working with an American company, Zoetic Global, which has a new technology in hydropower production, the in-stream auger turbine. We are negotiating a PPP with the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG). The augers, designed to be deployed in fast-flowing rivers, have the potential to revolutionize power generation. We will be the first company to undertake large-scale commercialization of this technology. We plan to generate 100MW from the post-wash section of the Akosombo Dam, without building any new dam on the river. If it succeeds, we can replicate that at many dam sites across the world. SAS has undergone a major transformation since its founding in 1994. We have become entrepreneurial, and are now in the business of creating businesses.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the future in that respect? What sectors are most ready for growth?</h4><p>One of the most attractive sectors now is energy. Per-capita consumption of electricity is low here compared to other countries. Infrastructure is generally promising. For example, our road density is also low, presenting extensive opportunity for growth, as is the case with energy. That is one of the reasons why Africa is seen as the next frontier for development. The story gets more interesting if you look at the fact that we export our bauxite to Jamaica and then import aluminum. We should develop an efficient aluminum industry, and if we can convert the bauxite to aluminum, so much of the value addition will be done here and many jobs will be created here, with positive ramifications for sectors that are dependent on the commodity. Agriculture is important because it employs more than half of our people but contributes only about 22% to GDP. There is a lot of opportunity for enhancing agricultural production, given all the fertile land we have. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies have you introduced to deal with the drop in commodity prices?</h4><p>We have had some major shocks to the economy over the last three years. We had disruption to our gas supply for two and a half years, and then the simultaneous fall in cocoa, gold, and crude oil prices, all of which have exposed our vulnerability as we implement our agenda to consolidate our position as a middle-income country. The fall of crude oil prices to a low of $45.0 per barrel compared to a benchmark revenue projection of $99.38 per barrel in the 2015 budget meant that we had to revise revenue targets and related expenditures that were to be funded from the annual budget funding amount. We are monitoring the crude oil prices for 2016 and will do the necessary fiscal adjustments through due process should the need arise.  However, with that in mind, and with the IMF program and our own homegrown policies, there are clear signs that our fiscal consolidation efforts are yielding positive results, making the economy more efficient. Accordingly, the GSS estimates that GDP will come in at 4.1% for 2015 compared to the 3.5% initially projected. The World Bank and IMF estimate future growth above 7%. We are returning to a growth path and our fiscal performance so far clearly shows that we can plan to manage and reverse periodic setbacks and take care of opportunities, as and when they occur.</p><h4>Last year Ghana issued a Eurobond, with a 10.75% yield demanded. How does that fit into your overall growth strategy?</h4><p>We issued our fourth sovereign bond, which was over-subscribed by $1 billion. The 15-year tenor of the bond is the first by any Sub-Saharan African country besides South Africa. With that, our target is to shift away from short-term debt instruments when financing the capital budget. Instead we will target long-term development projects. This has brought with it the capacity to refinance short-term debts and upcoming sovereign bond debts, as well as the remaining principal of the Eurobond that will mature in 2017. The World Bank has also chosen to back an up to $1 billion refinance component, which is a strong reassurance to the investment community.</p><h4>Public-sector salaries accounted for 72% of government expenditure in 2012 and energy subsidy bills have fuelled fiscal debt. What are the main initiatives being put in place to pull these expenditures under control, boost transparency, and encourage confidence in the economy?</h4><p>The 2015 budget aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit from 10.2% of GDP in 2014 to 6.5%. However, due to the decline in crude oil prices, this target was revised to 7.3% of GDP in the 2015 Mid-Year Review. Since then, as a result of good revenue performance (including GRA's compliance efforts), containment of overruns in the wage bill and other spending, as well as the withdrawal of energy-related subsidies (except funded cross subsidies), our fiscal consolidation program is on course with the deficit and set to be on target at 7.3%. Wage containment initiatives such as our collective resolve with public-sector unions to negotiate wage adjustments within budgetary constraints, payroll audits, and other initiatives such as ESV to minimize the incidence of ghost workers and net freeze in recruitment have also contributed to reducing the wages-to-tax revenue ratio of 57.6 % in 2013 to 44.2% in 2015. </p>]]></richbody0content>

He became an active member of the ANC’s armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, in 1962, following the banning of the ANC in 1960. While on his way out of the country in 1963, he was arrested and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. He left South Africa in December 1975 and for the next 12 years was based in Southern Africa. Following the unbanning of the ANC in February 1990, he was one of the first ANC leaders to return to South Africa to begin the process of negotiations with the then apartheid regime. In 1991, at the first ANC conference held in South Africa since 1959, he was elected Deputy Secretary General. He was elected ANC Deputy President in December 1997, and served as Deputy President of South Africa from 1999 until June 2005.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the development of the relationship between South Africa and Ghana since formal diplomatic ties were established over 20 years ago in May 1994?</h4><p>As the first country to receive its independence on the continent, Ghana inspired and provided support to South Africa during the times of apartheid. This is the background against which we base our relations—one of friendship, solidarity, and a common purpose to move forward together toward prosperity and progress. Ghana and South Africa cooperate in international and regional fora such as the UN and the African Union. At the bilateral level, the Permanent Joint Commission for Cooperation between South Africa and Ghana was established in 2007. The main objective of the Permanent Joint Commission for Cooperation is to promote political, economic, and social cooperation between our two countries. Several incoming and outgoing state visits have taken place in an attempt to seal these relations. The highlight of the August 2011 State Visit to South Africa was the signing of seven agreements and MoUs covering a wide range of sectors including trade and industry, science and technology, defense, tourism, and ICT. Further agreements were signed during the Presidential State Visit to Ghana on November 26, 2013, taking our work to a higher level. South Africa and Ghana have agreed that these instruments should translate into concrete projects that will benefit our people.</p><h4>Do you foresee more South African companies entering the Ghanaian market to provide alternative offerings to the country's traditionally relied upon European goods and investments?</h4><p>South Africa has emerged to become the 14th largest investor in Ghana. Between January 2003 and April 2013, a total of 28 South African FDI projects were recorded, which created 4,683 jobs. These projects represent a total capital investment of R64.7 billion ($4.065 billion), which is an average investment of R2,310.37 million ($145.155 million) per project. South African companies that have invested in Ghana include inter alia, MTN, AngloGold Ashanti, Game, Goldfields, Stuurrock Shipping, Simat Group, BSI Steel, Educor, Metropolitan, Stanbic Holdings, Standard Bank, SABMiller, Woolworths, African Explosives, Multichoice, Shoprite Checkers, Sherwood, Steers, and South African Airways. Ghana has in the past two years built four shopping malls across the country, with Kumasi City Mall and Achimoto Shopping Mall both scheduled to be built in 2016. Ghana's expansion of shopping malls presents South African companies with a great opportunity to initiate and expand investment in the Ghanaian market. Also, Pick n Pay announced in October 2015 that it would be opening its first store in Ghana in 2016. The Ports of Lome in Togo and Cotonou in Benin are strategically positioned to facilitate the movement of South African goods entering Ghana, thus making it even more attractive for South African companies to invest in Ghana. Other incentives include a sound microeconomic environment, access to all markets of ECOWAS, 100% foreign ownership, infrastructure development, and the ongoing privatization in key economic sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>It gives me great pleasure to join you in bidding farewell to 2015 and welcoming a new year. This is a time for celebration, a time to express gratitude for the good fortune and blessings bestowed upon us throughout the course of this past year.</p><p>This is also a time for contemplation and analysis. It is a time, as we move forward, to leave behind the setbacks and limitations of the past because with this New Year come new opportunities and the promises of limitless possibilities.</p><p>This is true not only for us as individuals but for us as a nation. 2015 was, in many ways, a challenging year. There was growth, and there were numerous accomplishments, but we also experienced a number of setbacks and faced what, at the time, felt like limitations.</p><p>They were not altogether unexpected. Indeed, I had asked the good citizens of Ghana to exercise patience and to bear with us during the difficult period. Words cannot express how impressed and inspired I have been by the understanding, the strong support, and the consistent encouragement with which they responded.<br>Even the voices that were raised in disagreement or criticism spoke volumes of truth about your unwavering love of Ghana and our shared desire, despite differing opinions on policies or methodologies to see our nation progress.</p><p>We may have differing opinions on how to get Ghana to the place where we want it to be, but the fact remains that we all do want to reach the same destination: one where Ghana is fully developed, with a thriving economy, ample employment opportunities, solid infrastructure, a top-level educational system that is accessible and free to all, a functional health delivery system, an overall reduction in poverty, and so much more.</p><p>But that doesn't happen overnight. Three years ago, when I was sworn in for my first term as President, the problems that Ghana was facing, while not insurmountable, were foundational.</p><p>The power crisis is a prime example. The process of load shedding did not begin with my administration. The problems in our infrastructure have been apparent for quite some time.</p><p>True progress must be sustainable. What we needed was a stable foundation, not a patch-up job. And that would take time. The decision I took to fully expand our energy infrastructure was not politically expedient or desirable. Indeed, the decision I took was quite unpopular.</p><p>But leadership and popularity are not the same thing, and every so often in the course of leadership, one has to make decisions that are neither popular nor politically expedient<br>Given the increasing unrest, terror, and instability that is occurring throughout the world, our resolve to work together toward the implementation of long-term, sustainable solutions for the development of our beloved Ghana is all the more appreciated, and it is all the more necessary. We are closer now, than ever before, to realizing the fruits of our patience.</p><p>Last year, as we ushered in 2015, I assured that I was listening to the people's concerns, and I pledged to continue to listen. I would continue to serve this country with the understanding that one of the hallmarks of democracy is the continuous communication between the people of a nation and their elected representatives.<br>Each and every member of this government is listening to the country's concerns, and is committed to working for the greater good of Ghana and for the welfare of its people. Each and every member of this government will uphold the promises that have been made to the people, whose interests we serve.<br>Those who fall short of that commitment have been, and will continue to be, asked to tender their resignations and relieved of their responsibilities. Ghana is not for one person, or one political party. Ghana is not for some select group of people; Ghana is for all of us, for our children. Ghana is for the future generations. We should always remember that the actions and attitudes we take now—all of us, not merely those of us in government—will determine the course of their fate.</p><p>Just as each of us is greeting the New Year with the intention of constructive change and the expectation of exciting new possibilities in our personal lives, let us also greet it with the same intentions and expectations in the life of our nation.</p><p>Let us go forward into 2016 with courage not caution, with optimism and a faith in our ability to achieve and succeed.</p><p>May God continue to bless you and our homeland Ghana during this year, and always. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Rolls Royce is one of the leading producers of engines for both civil aviation and defense, and you recently signed with UMW to produce fan cases for your aircraft engines in Malaysia. How did this partnership come into being and what is your vision for this project?</h4><p>Let me begin by setting some context. Our aerospace business has an order book of over £67 billion in 2015, which is more than 80% of our total order book. Of this, over 50% of our orders come from the Middle East and Asia. We built the Seletar Campus to increase our manufacturing capacity so we can deliver on our order book, and we wanted to be closer to our globally located customers. The Campus is our first facility outside the UK to assemble and test the Trent aero engine and manufacture our crown jewel technology, the Wide Chord Fan Blade. It opened in February 2012 at an investment of over £350 million. At both our Derby and Seletar Campus sites we have the capability of assembling and testing several types of Trent engines. At the Seletar Campus, we assemble the Trent 900 engines that go onto the Airbus A380 aircraft, and the Trent 1000 that go onto the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Soon, we will also be assembling the Trent 7000, which will go onto the new Airbus A330neo, the latest aircraft from Airbus. This is a complex business; each engine has around 18,000 components with 35,000 parts. We work with over 8,000 companies in 70 countries, each of them playing their part in producing our products. It's like conducting the world's largest orchestra. So, you can imagine what kind of supply chain and logistics are required to make an engine. We have three key strategic principles for our global production process. The first is to have operational excellence in our supply chain, embedding a lean approach across all of our sites. Second, we want engineering excellence, and third we want to capture after-market value through customer satisfaction. So considering this context and in a bid to improve efficiencies, we are building a supply chain ecosystem to support our Seletar Campus. Some of our global suppliers have chosen to be closer to the Campus by establishing their own sites in Southeast Asia, for example in Senior Aerospace in Thailand. In step, we are also on the look out to form new partnerships to build up our supply chain. UMW is our first tier-one supplier in Malaysia, and so far our partnership with UMW is a success story. It was chosen after an extensive bidding process. UMW proved to be ambitious, able, and willing to manufacture and assemble titanium fan cases for our engines. We found them to be the right partner for us. This project also has the support from the Malaysian government, and with that we hope to extend the partnership beyond fan cases for the Trent 1000 and Trent 7000 engines. We are confident that this will lay a strong foundation for engine component hard metal manufacturing in Malaysia. This will be a major cornerstone for the Malaysian Aerospace Blueprint. We hope this will inspire innovation in manufacturing and in end-components in Malaysia in the longer term as well. This is our vision to work together with UMW and the Malaysian government, and to build on this success to further the interests of the Malaysian Aerospace Blueprint.</p><h4>What were the company's ideas when it helped found the Aerospace Malaysia Innovation Centre (AMIC) in 2011, and how would you assess its main achievements to date?</h4><p>A center like AMIC is the cornerstone for any country that wants to gain innovation in aerospace. AMIC was created very purposefully and with the support of the Malaysian government. We decided to participate together with quite a number of other Malaysian and foreign companies. It is a major pioneering initiative and it is still in its infancy. It usually takes a long time to bring an institution like this to a mature level; still, AMIC has already achieved some key breakthroughs. AMIC has helped local and international aerospace industry players; it has signed numerous MoUs and agreements with players in the industry, and it works with both local and foreign universities. We are confident that with the continued stewardship by the current sponsors and the opportunities created by the new industrial investments in Malaysia, AMIC can become an integral part of the aerospace sector.</p><h4>In 2016, the new National Aerospace Blueprint 2015-2030 was launched. How do you think Rolls-Royce ties into this Blueprint?</h4><p>Firstly, we are proud to be making a major contribution to the Blueprint's success. We hope that our partnership with UMW will be a catalyst for growth in Malaysia's aerospace industry over the next 15 years. We hope that our 25-year agreement with UMW, which more than covers the blueprint period, will also create opportunities for more similar initiatives in Malaysia. The previous blueprint has already created high-income jobs and the aerospace industry contributes MYR11 billion to Malaysia's GDP; it is projected to reach MYR55 billion by 2030. Hence, we need all players, big and small, to join this effort to support the Blueprint for its success.</p><h4>Does Rolls-Royce have a strategic regional vision about how to use the characteristics of different countries in the region to develop your business?</h4><p>We tend to be very global and deliberate in our business decisions, which are influenced by market nuances. For example, we recognize that Malaysia is quite advanced in composite materials, and that Thailand is already good at making metal components. But we are very aware that these type of capabilities can be replicated elsewhere. We know that there are players in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam who are willing and eager to step into this sphere of the economy. What's important to us is to find the best and most reliable suppliers not just in the region, but also the world; for example, there could be suppliers in Italy, Korea, and Mexico to consider. In the future I am sure there will be more and more from China as well. Of course for us, it's important to keep in mind the locations of our key manufacturing sites around the world.</p><h4>The low commodity prices have impacted many oil-supplying nations across the world. How does it affect your strategy?</h4><p>There are two sides to this. If you look at the opportunities for players like us, we cannot escape the impact of commodity price changes whether up or down. It gives us an opportunity to look at how we do things and make changes to enhance efficiency. We are sensitive to commodity price changes and we are adapting our strategy accordingly. For example, we are trying to procure components closer to Singapore as this reduces transport and sourcing costs. The other side of the coin is, with falling oil prices, air travel becomes cheaper, but then some countries are exposed to currency fluctuations. Overall, it still results in more demand for seats and this must be good for the major airlines and, by consequence, the aerospace industry. You can already see Airbus and Boeing pulling in orders, so engine suppliers like us are benefiting from this demand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2015, the largest ever intake of students occurred. What can we glean from that regarding the university's progression and expansion?</h4><p>In the five years since I started here, the student population has tripled. The university has graduated two batches of students out of the Abu Dhabi campus; therefore, I would suspect that part of what is going on is that people are starting to hire our students. There is good brand recognition now because we have graduates out there. The other thing that we did this year was join the national common application and placement office (NAPO), and we had always done our admissions process, more or less, completely separately from everyone else. It is the standard for application in the US, and so here, what NAPO really is, is a system by which students can fill out one application for everywhere they want to go. Students can then prioritize which university they would prefer to attend. The vision for the university is for it to be more selective and our board has been consistent with that. It wants to be sure that we are getting the top students; therefore, we do a little bit more diagnostic work at the beginning, particularly with math, science, and language. All of our staff are expected to be involved in research and they are all expected to be able to teach both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Roughly two-thirds of our faculty, when they join us, have their terminal degree from a top-100 institution. Hence, we are aiming high; we have more than 40 nationalities among our faculty, so it is an international institution in that regard. The idea was really to provide the students with a representative, international, quality experience, although most of those students will be Emirati. At the graduate level, we have just over 1,500 students today. More than 200 of those are graduate students and amongst the graduate students the demographic is about 50-50 expatriate to international. However, at the undergraduate level, the mix is about 80-20.</p><h4>What are you focusing on in terms of research?</h4><p>The most direct answer to that is that Khalifa University is strongly directed by Vision 2030; it is driven by diversification. In fact, Khalifa University and Masdar Institute form the educational arm of the 2030 vision. If the government is going to take the economy in the envisioned direction, it is going to need universities here that produce local workers that can be employed in these new industries, as well as do research that is also going to benefit future industries. Therefore, when we made our research plan we had the 2030 plan in mind, which is where the five areas come in: ICT, aerospace and technology, energy and environment, healthcare technologies, and security.</p><h4>How is this group of core subjects going to develop as the economy develops and continues to change until 2030?</h4><p>In industry, we are starting to engage with companies like Emirates Steel. Emirates Steel, currently, has no research staff, but it does desire them. Therefore, what we are talking to them about is how to collaborate on projects. If there is an intake of our graduates in the next five to 10 years, then we change that situation, but it takes a little time. Politically, it is important that more decision makers are technically trained.  You have people making decisions about technical industries that are not familiar with the technologies that they are managing. There have to be more people in government with technical backgrounds; it would make a difference. I think that there is an excellent prospect for that here because the sociological status of engineers in the UAE is strong. It is actually higher than a doctor, which is one of the challenges that the medical profession has, as well as being higher than a lawyer. In the Emirates, if students graduate with a BSC in Engineering, they put Engineer (Eng) in their title. There is a reason for that, and it is really important. That will work for us in the future, because decision makers are going to look at these people and think that is a well-educated person and someone that will create opportunities to lead in the future.</p><h4>There is a new site being built, adjacent to the current one. How will that enhance the University?</h4><p>The construction on the site next to the current location is huge for us, literally and figuratively. It is going to add about four times the space available to us. Just in terms of scope, it is really important. Engineering and science are both resource intensive; therefore, we outgrew our current resources pretty quickly and we, therefore, need more. On the academic side, the expansion area that is most important for us and will be expanding is science. This refers to applied math and statistics. We are looking to develop programs in chemistry, and eventually physics and biology as well. There are certain inter-disciplinary research areas that will benefit from having more scientists on campus; healthcare is an obvious one. In sustainability and climate change, you need to have engineers, but also atmospheric chemists, biologists, and so forth. What I expect in the next year or two is that we will grow beyond a single college university (engineering), to one having more comprehensive offerings relating to science and technology. The science college will grow and start to offer an even better diversity of choices for students to study. In the next two to three years, that is probably the biggest thing for us. We have just over 1,500 students now. We have not really designed this campus to go much beyond about 3,000 students.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Despite their name, the Panama Papers are not mainly about Panama. They are not even primarily concerned with Panamanian companies. The more than 11 million documents, illegally hacked and relating to previously undisclosed “offshore" corporations, are roiling the world with revelations of the vulnerability for rampant abuse of legal financial structures by the wealthy.</p><p>They are unfairly called the Panama Papers because this particular trove of documents came from a single law firm based in Panama; however, the problem of tax evasion is a global one.</p><p>Panama does not deserve to be singled out on an issue that plagues many countries. But we are willing to accept the responsibility for fixing it, in part because greater transparency is ultimately a continuation of reforms we have recently undertaken. The world must tackle this problem collectively and with urgency, and Panama stands ready to lead the way.</p><p>The scope of the information is breathtaking, with the files include information on more than 14,000 banks, law firms, corporate incorporators, and other middlemen from more than 100 countries, which is just a small part of a worldwide industry that harbors trillions of dollars. That some can rig the system to hide their wealth is not merely unjust, it also harms global development by siphoning off revenues that could be directed to education, healthcare, and infrastructure.</p><p>Contrary to media reports, Panama does not make special allowances for “offshore" structures. The association of Panama with offshore activities comes from the fact that we tax only income derived from within Panama, not from without, which remains taxable pursuant to the laws of relevant jurisdictions. These rules, based on laws in New York and Delaware, originated in 1927 and are common today. While these laws have been buttressed by additional regulations, they can still be manipulated for illicit purposes.</p><p>Under previous governments, Panama was no doubt a target of money launderers. Today, Panama is committed to adopting all transparency reforms needed to satisfy the international community. In the 21 months of my administration, Panama has taken steps to increase transparency and strengthen its financial legal systems. We developed a robust treaty network that allows exchange of information. “Know your client" regulations were substantially enhanced and extended not only for financial and corporate providers, but also for key non-financial industries vulnerable to abuse. And as of January 2016, we require identity certification of shareholders of all Panamanian companies.</p><p>I have announced a commitment to the automatic exchange of financial and corporate information, and we have proposed steps that we believe are consistent with the goals of the international community, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) through its Common Reporting Standards proposal. These reforms have been recognized and validated by the international community, including the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, which cited Panama's “significant progress" in combating money laundering when it removed us this year from its gray list. Removal from that list occurred in record time.</p><p>Our financial transparency ranking with the non-governmental organization Tax Justice Network has steadily improved since 2013, and we now rank well ahead of Japan, Germany, and the US. We have also progressed positively in a peer review by the OECD's Global Forum for Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. These reforms in Panama, along with other international efforts, have been paying dividends.<br>Still, more work is needed. I have announced that Panama's Ministry of Foreign Affairs will create an independent committee of international experts to evaluate our policies, determine best practices, and propose measures that will be shared with other countries to strengthen global financial and legal transparency. We expect their findings within six months. Panama will continue to cooperate with other jurisdictions to prosecute offenses outlawed in our Criminal Code, and we will continue to exchange financial and legal information to comply with the many treaties we have ratified. We also reiterate our willingness to engage in dialogue with the OECD and its Global Forum with respect to reaching financial transparency agreements that can further the economic development of our countries.</p><p>After decades of dictatorship, Panama is a stable democracy committed to the rule of law and is home to the regional headquarters of more than 100 transnational companies. To fulfill our democratic evolution, we must have a government committed to transparency, accountability, and the separation of powers. Our response to the current crisis will test our resolve and our potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>A number of new airlines will begin operations here in 2016. What has attracted them to Panama?</h4><p>The number one reason is that this is a hub from which people can continue on to smaller cities in the region. Travelers from the Far- or Middle-East can fly direct via Emirates, and transfer through Panama to anywhere in the region, from Costa Rica, to Nicaragua, and so on. Because of security and many other complications, it is much more difficult to travel through US cities and the airports there are all congested. It used to be the case that passengers had to fly through the US to go to Europe, but that has changed over time. KLM now brings over 400 passengers a day from Europe. A significant number of these remain in Panama, while the rest go to other cities in the region. If we didn't have this connectivity and amount of flights, we would not have the amount of business, so it is a blessing. Tocumen Airport is a hub, but the country itself is a bridge to the Americas. People come to do business here. Many regional companies have benefited from the strong logistics sector here, which is a strategic asset for the country. This is why new airlines such as Emirates and Lufthansa have decided to come and why there are others in the pipeline. We have the potential for more from Europe. The important approach is to connect hubs. Dubai is a hub, so it is an important alternative. Another advantage of Panama is its stable climate, which is rather important for ensuring timely performance and avoiding delays.</p><h4>Do you think Panama is competing with hubs such as Miami or New York?</h4><p>We are not replacing any of those destinations; we are complementing them. Panama is filling a gap within this region of the world. Airports like Miami are congested already. The key factor is quick connectivity, planes arriving on time, and being able to move those planes from the sky to the gate. When a plane takes an hour to take off after boarding, as sometimes happens in New York, there is a loss of competitiveness. Competitiveness is a big focus for our administration, which is why we are expanding our infrastructure. In the coming years, we will invest about $1.4 billion in infrastructure.</p><h4>What progress has been made on the new Terminal 2?</h4><p>At our current rate, T2 will be finished by January 2018. The major infrastructure is about to be finished right now. Glass and roofing will be installed this year, followed by the infrastructure, consisting mainly of the baggage system, which will be done by the end of 2017. Once we do that, we have a plan for T2.5, or T3, depending on how we see the company progressing. Parallel to that, depending on our growth, we will address the need for a new runway. We are looking at doing this between 2022 and 2024.</p><h4>How have passenger volumes grown over the last year?</h4><p>It is not going to be an enormous growth year, mainly because Latin America had a tough year due to commodity prices. This challenge has brought a big devaluation in Colombia, with which we have close ties, so traffic with Colombia has decreased in tandem. Traffic has increased from Europe and from Brazil. Chile and Argentina have already started picking up, and Venezuela is more or less the same. Travel to the US has been good. We will do better and there will be some growth, but 2016 will be a tough year for Latin America due to the readjustment of currencies. That said, the horizon of Latin America is good. We are bullish in our outlook and project annual growth in travel of about 6% for the next 10 years in Latin America.</p><h4>How do you think Panama should market itself as a tourist destination?</h4><p>We have a lot of opportunities in beaches and conventions. That is the number one opportunity, which Panama must continue to leverage. That means Panama has to finish building a convention center, of which it is in dire need. Everything around the Canal is important as well, as it continues to be a wonder for people even today. Panama is also an important shopping destination, and this should be another area of focus for the country.</p><h4>What is your expectation for Tocumen International Airport in 2016?</h4><p>Our main objective is to finish the new T2 terminal. It is a big, complex project because of the technicality it involves. My job is to ensure that we can cater to our customers, which are the airlines and passengers. We have to ensure that Emirates, Lufthansa, and the rest enjoy good success. This is a hub airport, and it must continue to cater to the hub model in order to continue to expand. We play a key role in making sure that the systems are working properly, and it is important that we continue to modernize our facilities. We are going to be working on the runway so that we can move more aircraft. It is going to be a tough year for us in terms of construction, and not just because of T2. We are investing about $60 million in construction. It is going to be busy to administer that, but we welcome the workload.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>At a time when many international companies want to enter the market, what does it mean for Energia to be a wholly indigenous E&amp;P company?</h4><p>This is a natural resource company and therefore we are dealing with nature and that is indigenous. The owners should participate in the country's natural endowment. This is what we should be looking to do and we should not expect anything less.</p><h4>Last year you mentioned plans to build a refinery, together with your partners, with a modular plan scalable to 30,000bpd in capacity. What is the status of this project at the moment?<br></h4><p>We have moved forward two steps. We scaled down to a 10,000bpd plant for a start. We have our first license to establish (LTE) from DPR, and we have signed a contract with an EPC contractor in Houston for Front End Engineering Design (FEED), after which we will go into  detailed the engineering work, fabrication, installation, and then commissioning. We are also working on several agreements, including a crude sales and purchase agreement in conjunction with our upstream partners, Oando Production and Development Company (OPDC), on a refinery project, as well as product offtake agreements with potential offtakers and project management. Of course the refinery is going to be a completely separate entity as it is downstream, different from our upstream E&amp;P business, which means that we are adding further value in country. The upstream segment will be trading with the downstream company through an arms length agreement. Our plan is to commence clearing the refinery site in 2016 to prepare for the utility facilities construction. This is while the Houston EPC contractor works on the fabrication of the main processing plant. We are targeting 1Q2019 for the plant's commissioning.</p><h4>Will the final products from the refinery be for the domestic market or for export?</h4><p>For now it is intended principally for the domestic market. We operate out of Delta State so we have a certain catchment area and it will not be a big refinery plant.</p><h4>What impact have poor global oil prices had on Energia Limited and how are you dealing with this challenge?</h4><p>Anyone who has been in the industry for over two decades will probably have come to respect the cycle of ups and downs. That said, we have all deceived ourselves to the state of the environment. Things have changed because, rather than importing, the US started producing. OPEC used to take the heat, but on this occasion it said no; they all want to maintain their market share. However, this situation creates a wider positive outlook because it is going to make the industry more innovative and efficient. For oil-dependent economies such as Nigeria, it is going to help us look inwards. Nigeria has about 41 different economic sectors, but only six principal sectors are running the economy and, as a result, the rest of the sectors are flat. Some 80% of Nigeria's revenue and 90% of our FOREX comes from oil. Therefore, what has happened with crude oil prices is a blessing for the country in disguise, forcing Nigeria to reduce reliance on oil. For us, too, we are also realizing that we cannot rely on exporting crude oil and are looking at refineries, gas utilization, LNG, and petrochemicals. Everybody is beginning to look at the total value share to stay in business.</p><h4>In 2015, Energia Limited temporarily stopped further exploration work. Has that now resumed?</h4><p>The Minister for Petroleum said recently that we have to start going back into the field and drilling to stop rapidly declining reserves. Nigeria had reserves of some 37 billion barrels but, without further exploration activities, and continuous production, this has now fallen to some  34 billion barrels. Energia's plan is to probably resume drilling before the end of 2016.</p><h4>What steps is the government taking to help companies face this tough economic situation?</h4><p>Before the price fell, the government sat on the Petroleum Industries Bill (PIB), but it is now clear that it has to deal with the reforms. It has also seen that it is not going to be easy within the present structure. Therefore, it is going to phase it in. The first and current phase is the restructuring of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which will be split into components. The National Assembly is supporting the government to ensure that it can get the PIB passed. This will provide the regulatory framework to give investors the support they need. They need to know what terms will guide their investments. The government still has a lot of challenges and only four years to turn things around and we are hoping this will happen.</p><h4>What is Energia Limited's role in terms of the social and economic development of the country through CSR programs and employment initiatives?<br></h4><p>Energia Limited is probably in the top three companies in our industry in terms of our CSR work per capita. We have done well in the environments we have been working in. One of our communities is literally developing a new city. We give about 4% of our gross revenue to CSR and have a trust fund that we set up to manage this money, whose board meets on a quarterly basis. We have set up a community parliament where we meet to discuss issues. We have established a number of institutions, including a secondary school, and one of our communities is building a new housing estate. We pave roads and we have created and funded a community security program as well. We are working on our vision for an agricultural park and we have an entrepreneurship program, including training and start-up grants. We offer scholarships for education. Plus, we use expert consultants to do economic baseline studies for the planning, development, and implementation of our programs. In short, we apply professional standards to our CSR.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Our goal for 2016 is to remain successful because we believe we are one of the lowest cost producing companies in the country. We produce at $18 per barrel. Even if the price of oil comes down to $20 per barrel we will still be in business. This is our plan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Burger King® performed since opening its first restaurant in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We opened our first restaurant in May 2012 in the Mega Alma-Ata shopping center in Almaty. Since then, we have been able to grow exponentially and now have 27 restaurants operating in Kazakhstan, including five Drive Thrus. Now we are the fastest-growing international fast food chain in the burger segment in the country and, in a number of regions such as Karaganda, Pavlodar, Aktau, Atyrau, and Aktobe we are the first international fast food brand to open restaurants there. In terms of actual guests, last year we had over 6 million visitors to our restaurants compared to 4 million the previous year. It means that everyday more than 15,000 guests visit our restaurants across the country. In terms of total sales, we reached $22 million at the end of last year for the full year. We have been able to expand quite aggressively over the past couple of years by opening 27 restaurants in less than four years and will continue to grow. Of course, that was in a certain economic climate. Regardless, we think that it is important to continue to grow. On April 15, 2016 we unveiled our first restaurant in Uralsk, which is the eighth city that now has a Burger King® restaurant. So it marks a big milestone for the company because Kazakhstan is a large country and being able to grow and expand is challenging due to logistical issues and the great distances between cities. Today the company is also one of the biggest employers in the sector: as of February 2016, 550 people are employed at Burger King® restaurants. By the end of 2016 the plan is to increase this to 650 people. Annually the company provides jobs and career opportunities for 100-120 people, especially for local young people.</p><h4>What is your business strategy given Kazakhstan's current unstable economic situation? </h4><p>Our strategy is to ensure that guests keep coming back to our restaurants. Providing excellent customer service is a pillar of Burger King®. In addition we continue to offer guests our King Savers value menu that we rolled out two years ago to make sure we are always affordable for customers and also to meet and exceed guests' expectations, which means being able to provide the best quality food with great service at reasonable prices. That's what a good business is all about.</p><h4>What differentiates you from your competitors?</h4><p>Firstly, Burger King® developed a strategy to differentiate itself from the competition with “Have It Your Way." This is a key strategy for Burger King® and means that any guest can order a burger exactly how they want it. For instance, if a guest wants to take out the lettuce, onions, or tomato, or to add some spices, then he or she is free to do so. It gives the guest the freedom to actually order customized burgers, which is unique for any quick service restaurant (QSR) business. Secondly, what makes us stand out is the broiling and flame grilling of our meat as opposed to frying, as it provides guests with a great tasty burger. There is a big taste difference between fried burgers and flame-grilled burgers and they are also healthier. The third differentiator is the very high quality of the products we use. Our suppliers have all been approved globally and chosen in accordance with international quality standards and the company's own internal standards, as the health and safety of our guests is our number one priority. All our food is now imported from Russia and European countries because Burger King® has strict quality and safety standards. Another aspect of our competitiveness is our prices, which are in line with the market. There are a lot of factors that influence price. This is a new industry in this Kazakhstan, so suppliers and manufacturers will have to be able to create the necessary infrastructure to be able to service restaurants and companies like ours.</p><h4>What are the company's priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will focus on further developing service quality so as to exceed our customers' expectations. To achieve this goal, we will soon launch the BK University, which will provide educational programs for our restaurant managers so as to improve skills and knowledge in management. We will also continue to expand on the market and plan to launch about six new restaurants in 2016, including four Drive Thrus. Our aim is to introduce the Kazakhstani people to the Drive Thru format and promote it as a convenient way for drivers to order food without needing to get out of the car. This year we will launch a Drive Thru at a filling station in Almaty. In late 2015 we launched the first such Drive Thru in Aktobe, which is operating successfully and serves more than 3,000 cars per month. Such a format is quite popular in other countries worldwide; for example, Burger King is planning to open 150 fast food areas at petrol stations all over Spain by 2018 and such a format has already been developed significantly in Germany and South Africa. Offering a large range of complementary services for customers stopping off to refuel is a fairly successful strategy. Additionally we are working to further develop our delivery service across Kazakhstan and continue progress with the King Savers value menu platform. We are also developing our offering for children by introducing a birthday package and iClick interactive game zones in our restaurants. This year we are organizing and participating in a number of CSR projects. One of the most exciting upcoming projects is a scholarship program for Kazakhstani students.</p><h4>How is Burger King marketing itself to compete with the demand for McDonalds in the market?</h4><p>We have been able to refocus on our differentiation strategy and for us nothing has really changed. It is just about being able to reinforce our core strengths and differentiation points, and to focus on our goals, tactics, and the implementation of our strategies. Our business will not change, and it will make us stronger and sharper as the market further develops with more players entering the country. We feel quite confident as a business because we have already passed the initial stage of formation. We have loyal guests and, in terms of geographical footprint, we are the biggest QSR chain. We feel confident heading into this year and will continue to build and grow our business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[take-our-advice]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are involved in the renewable energy sector in many parts of Asia. Which market conditions helped you identify this opportunity?</h4><p>Our core focus as a firm is on the lesser-developed economies of Asia. Of course, in all these countries, electricity generation is a key issue. From the very beginning, energy was a focus, as was the financing of energy projects. When we started 20 years ago, solar and wind energy were relatively expensive, and biomass was almost nonexistent, so the industry turned to gas and imported coal for a quick fix. We initially established operations in Cambodia, where it is expensive and time-consuming to import fossil fuels, so the government turned to other sources, such as hydropower, which is a local natural resource. Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam all have massive water resources that come down from the Himalayas and obviously they all want to harness that to produce electricity. Vietnam produces a huge amount of its power from hydro, but it is almost all government funded and managed—only recently have they opened the sector to private financing. Laos, on the other hand, opened the sector to private involvement back in 1995-96, so it has been better positioned over the last 20 years from a private-sector perspective.</p><h4>What services does DFDL provide to the renewable power sector in these countries?</h4><p>Firstly, we provide the negotiation and the drafting of the initial agreement with the government, the MoU, which then turns into a longer-term project development agreement. Once the feasibility study is done and approved, we go into the next phase, the Concession Agreement with the government, to guarantee the project on the ground in Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, or elsewhere. We provide document drafting and structuring of the arrangement between sponsors; usually there are multiple shareholders and they need agreements between themselves and other consultants. We also manage the external documents with the government including social, environmental, legal, tax compliance, and so on until the deal is signed. Then these projects need financing, and we also advise on that process. As projects develop, they may encounter other issues, such as director changes or refinancing. On the lender side, we frequently advise on debt financing of projects. Usually on that side we start by doing detailed due diligence on the project company for our clients—the banks—in order for them to proceed with a loan.</p><h4>In terms of PPP projects being launched in Thailand and the region, what trends are you seeing?</h4><p>PPPs are best suited in countries where the government has initially attempted to manage everything, and has later realized it is necessary to invite the private sector to assist with these projects. Poorer countries that want to develop quickly typically open up to the private sector. The projects that result still qualify as PPPs, because the government might take an equity interest, but outside of that the government will fund their equity interest and the asset is owned by them—this is in contrast to the type of PPPs common in Taiwan, China, or the Philippines, where most industries are state-owned and they hire BOT contractors and management teams. There are many layers of private sector involvement in typical public projects. In Thailand, there is a new PPP law that came into effect a few years ago, which was intended to change things somewhat. Thailand is typically a country where the government manages many sectors directly, with the exception of the energy sector, which they opened up to independent power companies through a bidding process. That said, even before the introduction of a formal PPP law, major road networks in Thailand were built by private-public consortiums, and the MRT and BTS were largely funded by private companies listed on the stock exchange.</p><h4>How do you expect the launch of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2016 to affect your line of work?</h4><p>In terms of energy, I do not expect a significant impact arising purely from the AEC, except to the extent that it will increase economic activity and therefore increase demand for electricity, particularly in places where electricity has not been historically available. Most factories in Thailand are based in or near city centers so electricity generation is based there as well. With the AEC, there are incentives for companies to relocate their factories across to one of the new special economic zones that may have relatively poor electricity availability, like the Cambodia border region for example. Those areas need to come up with a plan to produce enough electricity to guarantee that all the factories that relocate there will have affordable, easy access for the long term. In that sense, the AEC is likely to increase the impetus for an integrated power grid across the region. ADB has been trying to implement an integrated power grid for over 20 years, but there has not been the economic and cross-border political incentive to actually do it. Along with logistics and transportation, creating an integrated grid to facilitate the trade in electricity will be essential for further growth. From a legal perspective, it is highly likely there will be many more cross-border issues involved, which will impact law firms such as DFDL. The questions of where and how to resolve disputes across borders will become increasingly important when you move from a domestic to a regional economic system. As such, places like Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Bangkok will become more and more important as centers for overseeing disputes that involve regional business.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead? </h4><p>It is difficult to provide a short answer because each country in the region is so unique and there are a number of critical issues that remain uncertain. In Thailand, for instance, a lot will depend on the elections that are anticipated sometime in the next two years. Thailand funds many Mekong region power projects because its large demand for electricity outstrips its domestic supply. All those power projects built in Laos are not for their domestic power consumption, although maybe the AEC will change that a bit, but rely on the demand here in Thailand. So if the Thai economy is flat, there is less incentive to build these big projects over the border. The Thai economy has changed substantially, which is why domestically it depends on the elections and on the effect of measures that are being taken now to stimulate the economy and the incentives put in place to attract new investors. A lot of those incentives, while some are focused on the Thai economy, are also dependent on Thailand becoming more integrated with the regional economy and future growth is, therefore, largely dependent on solutions to problems outside of Thailand. The whole push to move Thailand to a service economy is not just for consumption of services domestically, but also for Thai companies to provide services to the region. I expect the AEC to stimulate that as companies try to consolidate their presence in ASEAN.</p><h4>What do you consider to be the most important change your company will implement in the medium term?</h4><p>We expect that the establishment of the AEC will foster strong growth in cross-border trade and the restructuring of many domestic companies into regional ventures that are better suited to benefit from the AEC. Consequently, DFDL is really focusing on building upon our tax and customs practice group. A lot of law firms, particularly domestic firms, don't really have a dedicated tax group and certainly don't offer advice on cross-border tax structuring in the region like we do. We also expect the AEC to stimulate mergers and acquisitions in the region and so we intend to expand our M&amp;A practice group in anticipation of this activity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Thailand's integration into the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) mean for the country's diplomatic standing in the region and beyond?</h4><p>Thailand, one of the founding members of ASEAN in 1967, sees the launch of the AEC on 31, December 2015 as a key milestone for ASEAN. We believe it will raise the diplomatic standing of all its members for good reason. Above all, economic integration will bring tangible benefits to more than 600 million people in the region. Intra-ASEAN trade grew 10.5% on average during 1993-2013. ASEAN has also been outward looking. Beyond its own region, ASEAN has established five FTAs with six dialogue partners and is soon to conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with the six dialogue partners. RCEP will be one of the largest FTAs in the world, with the potential to stimulate trade and investment for Asia and improve the livelihoods of half of the world's population. Thailand will actively cooperate with other members to achieve the AEC vision for 2025: an economic community that is highly integrated, competitive, dynamic, people-centered, and engaged at the global level. Team effort by the 10 members will push ahead important work such as trade and investment facilitation and further liberalization of the services sector so as to maintain the AEC as an attractive trade and investment destination for the international community. According to Baker &amp; Mckenzie, it is projected that the AEC will realize its potential as the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2050. The AEC, as part of the ASEAN Community, will engage dialogue partners and stakeholders to ensure that the AEC remains relevant to the millions of people in the Community and beyond.</p><h4>What are some of the most important provisions in the upgraded ASEAN-China FTA as it pertains to Thailand's economy?</h4><p>The successful upgrade of the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) on November 21, 2015 will help ensure that our region remains resilient in the face of a slowdown in global economic growth. The ACFTA was signed over 10 years ago and the upgrade was long overdue. As ASEAN's first FTA with a trading partner, ACFTA has helped to propel the establishment of other ASEAN+1 FTAs. The ACFTA upgrade will improve trade and investment opportunities between ASEAN and China through more facilitative customs procedures, more options for rules of origin, increased liberalization of services, increased investment promotion and facilitation, and increased areas for economic and technical cooperation. Thailand's private sector will find the new rules of origin more flexible to use. As a result, more than 2,000 goods from Thailand could gain greater access to China. Such goods include chemicals, leather, wood and wooden products, garments, and steel products. As the service sector is an increasingly important driver of economic growth for the ASEAN Economic Community, ASEAN stands to benefit from greater opportunities arising from the newly liberalized services sector in China, such as tourism and financial services (in the area of securities), construction, and engineering. Thailand will explore business opportunities in the tourism sector as this is an area of strength for Thailand and there is yet more room for people-to-people connectivity between ASEAN and China. Moreover, all parties stand to gain from measures such as investment promotion, industrial complementarity and production networks, information exchanges, and one-stop investment centers. Thailand hopes that the ACFTA upgrade will boost trade and investment between ASEAN and China and help to achieve the targets set by leaders for $1 trillion in trade by 2020 and $150 billion in investment by 2021.</p><h4>Thailand has been commended for exploring business opportunities and securing free trade agreements (FTA) with new partners from across the world, including Pakistan, Russia, Turkey, and Iran. How important is it for Thailand to build diplomatic and economic ties with less traditional partners?</h4><p>To remain competitive and drive the economy forward in this changing global economic landscape, Thailand is actively working to strengthen economic ties with all partners, both traditional and less traditional. During the last few decades, the Thai government has focused on export-oriented policy, and relies heavily on exports to drive the local economy. Today, maintaining export share in key traditional markets, and expanding our network of FTAs, remain high on the government agenda, but it is only one of the approaches that we are taking. Our policy formulation has accounted for global economic uncertainties such as the slowdown in the Chinese market, sharp fluctuation in oil and commodities prices, the rise in the US interest rate, and the economic crisis in Europe. Once all these factors are taken into consideration, it becomes apparent that no longer can we rely exclusively on our exports to traditional markets. South-South trade and investment have become strategically more and more important. In fact, working with less traditional partners is not a new policy. For years, Thailand has had economic cooperation with many developing countries. Among this is development cooperation based upon His Majesty the King's sufficiency economy philosophy, in which Thailand has provided assistance, exchanged good practice, and shared experiences in the application of the sufficiency economy to Lesotho, Timor-Leste, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Jordan, Senegal, Mozambique, and so on. Our goal is to help uplift the wellbeing and welfare of local communities in order to ensure sustainable and inclusive development. Thailand fully recognizes the economic potential in fast growing markets such as Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and Russia. We have always maintained cordial and healthy relations with these partners. For Thailand, the global economic situation has reinforced the need for Thailand to look beyond our traditional markets. Therefore, we are currently negotiating FTA with Turkey and Pakistan, while exploring closer economic ties with Russia and Iran. A high-level delegation led by our Deputy Prime Minister recently paid a successful visit to Iran, while our Prime Minister is scheduled to visit Russia in May 2016. Thailand has recently been approached by Russia to consider negotiating an FTA with the Eurasian Economic Union. We are currently exploring the possibility of such negotiations. Moreover, we have indicated our interest in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Thailand is currently in the process of assessing obligations and challenges relating to TPP. We also look forward to the resumption of negotiations on the Thai-EU FTA.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The year ahead will see an increasingly globalized and interconnected world.  There will likely be many challenges including threats and problems that know no boundary. At the same time, opportunities will be immense. A key to handle this is to further strengthen and expand international cooperation. This year Thailand has set out to play a leading and constructive role in the global arena, particularly among developing countries. As chair of G-77, we aim to reinforce South-South cooperation especially in moving toward the realization of sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the longer term. We are also laying down a 20-year strategy for the country that will provide guidelines for our positioning in the years ahead. Our goal is for the country to achieve stability, prosperity, and sustainability. The priorities of the current Thai government are to enhance the country's strength in various ways, including increasing Thailand's competitiveness. This is done by restructuring the economy in many ways. The government has, among other things, designated high-priority clusters with potential for development with incentives for investment. We also prioritize supporting startups and SMEs, providing funds for investment at local levels, and enhancing ease of doing business by improving laws and regulations. At the same time, we aim to increasingly contribute to the security and development of the international community. Our role as chair of G-77 as said before is one clear example. On a side note, relations with the UAE and the Middle Eastern region as a whole are important to us. As Thailand and the UAE key trading partners, the year ahead should see closer cooperation and interaction between our two countries and peoples. While each of us can act as hubs and gateways for our respective regions so as to encourage more trade and investment, we must also strengthen cooperation in other important areas including energy and tourism.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the common legal challenges investors face when coming to Qatar?</h4><p>An emerging market like Qatar naturally has some legal challenges. Probably the most important obstacle for investors wanting to establish a business in Qatar is the requirement that foreign firms establish a joint venture with Qatari partners, and that the foreign ownership in the joint venture not exceed 49%. Sometimes regulations are not widely published and are at times enforced with little or no consultation with the private sector. In addition, rent is increasing rapidly given the growth of the economy and the influx of foreign workers into Qatar. In addition to that, The Foreign Investment Law places two main restrictions on foreign investors who wish to establish a legal presence in Qatar: (1) The percentage of foreign ownership permitted; Law No. 13 of 2000 (The Foreign Investment Law) says that a Limited Liability Company's capital must be contributed by a Qatari investor with a percentage not less than 51 %, Limited Partnership with Shares with a percentage not less than 51%, and Unincorporated Joint Venture with a percentage not less than 51% of capital must be contributed by the local partner, and as for Joint Stock Company (Public or Private), 75% of the money must be contributed by a Qatari partner, and for a Single Person Company, 100% must be contributed by a Qatari investor. (2) In terms of the types of business in which foreign investors can invest, The Ministry of Economy and Commerce is officially responsible for giving authorization, which is normally determined on a case-by-case basis. Finally, tobacco and manufactured tobacco substitutes are subject to a customs duty of at least 100%. The QSTP free zone does not impose import duties. As with many GCC states, the importation of pork is prohibited and the importation of alcohol is severely restricted.</p><h4>Qatar ranks number one in the world in terms of paying taxes according to the World Bank's Doing Business report. How would you assess the tax regulatory system in Qatar and why is it world leading?<br></h4><p>The tax regulatory system in Qatar is the most favorable in the world, according to the 2009 Forbes Tax Misery and Reform Index, which ranked countries in terms of the harshness of their tax regimes—those employed in Qatar pay no tax on income obtained from their employment. Qatar has made paying taxes easier for companies by eliminating certain requirements associated with the corporate income tax return. Under the 2009 Tax Law, Private firms established in Qatar pay tax on their taxable profits at a flat rate of 10%. Qatari companies wholly owned by GCC nationals are exempt from corporation tax. However, the profits of business establishments that are wholly owned by Qatari individuals are not taxed. Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) entities are subject to the separate jurisdiction of QFC and a 10% corporation tax on taxable profits—there is no tax exemption for any share in the profits to which a local shareholder is entitled. The standard rate of customs duties (standardized across the GCC) is 5% of the total amount of the goods and their associated insurance and shipment costs. According to the Doing Business report, Qatar ranks number one in the world for paying taxes with 99.44%. On average, firms make four tax payments annually, spending 41 hours a year filing, preparing, and paying taxes, and pay total taxes amounting to 11.30% of profit.</p><h4>In your opinion, what are some of the most important changes that should be made in the near to mid term to make Qatar a more attractive business environment for investors?</h4><p>There are some important changes that should be made to make Qatar a more attractive business environment. For example, the general requirement for a company (subject to certain exceptions) is to be owned 51% by a Qatari shareholder. Restrictions on foreign ownership of Qatari companies are contained in the Foreign Investment Law and that law remains unchanged, which doesn't simplify the process and adds a number of requirements that would be time consuming. By contrast, for a local investor establishing a business in Qatar, the process can be quicker and easier given the absence of certain requirements that would otherwise be required of foreign investors. In addition to that, we should also note that the new law does not make any changes to the incorporation of companies in the QFC or the Qatar Science &amp; Technology Park, both of which have their own separate incorporation regimes and rules. Finally, the new law makes no change to the relatively attractive existing tax regime. Essentially, LLCs that are 100% Qatari owned do not pay tax, whereas LLCs that have foreign ownership will have their profits taxed at the rate of 10% on the share of the foreign investors' profits. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you balance international expansion with domestic expansion?</h4><p>We are very focused on international expansion. Simultaneously, however, we intend to maintain our position as a market leader in Qatar, while encouraging private investors to participate in building a solid hospitality network within the country. We are always looking to invest in a collection of unique properties in key sought-after international locations while partnering with some of the world's finest hotel brands, ensuring they are aligned with our ethos and brand values. We acquire and further invest in properties that have set the standards in the industry, as we work to create an enviable portfolio of iconic hotels around the globe.</p><h4>How would you describe the overall strategy of Katara Hospitality?</h4><p>With 45 years of experience as an international hotel owner, developer, and operator, Katara Hospitality has always been at the forefront of the industry. Our goal is to leave an outstanding legacy for the future generations and to use our resources and expertise to invest in heritage properties around the world, each of which represents both a legacy and a future. Following the success we have achieved in 2014 and throughout 2015, we are now focusing on our next strategic target of expanding our portfolio of iconic hotels to 60 properties by 2026. We take immense pride and pleasure in rejuvenating historically iconic hotels, restoring them to their former glory, and ensuring their hospitality heritage is secured. One of our foremost priorities is ensuring maximum possible returns for a wide range of stakeholders; investors, operating partners, employees, and the guests at our hotels. This strategy has positioned us as an international forerunner in the hospitality sector, and earned us recognition as an organization that is pushing the boundaries of industry excellence.</p><h4>What regions are of major focus for expansion for Katara Hospitality and how does this reflect the macroeconomic conditions affecting these international regions?</h4><p>Europe remains a key part of our focused international expansion. Our European presence continues to be strong and next year will see the opening of several iconic hotels. With properties in UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, we expect to invest in other markets in the Mediterranean countries. North America is also a possibility and we intend to further expand in Asia. The year 2015, we added The Westin Excelsior Rome, The Peninsula Paris and Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Milan to our global portfolio, which brings us to a total of 35 properties in operation or under development.</p><h4>What is the significance of the recent opening of Katara Hospitality's Peninsula Hotel Paris to the overall growth of the company?</h4><p>The Peninsula Paris is an iconic property, not just in Paris but globally and is an asset to our growing portfolio. The opening is hugely significant for us as the property offers the quintessence of the French culture with state-of-the art services in iconic locations. Our guests visiting us from Middle East are very interested in cultural as well as historical heritage and look today for a holistic experience with tailored services in the most exclusive locations. France is renowned for its cultural heritage and has given the world fabulous cuisine, amazing artists, unique fashion trends, and memorable monuments. Middle East travelers appreciate this subtle mix of history, “Art de Vivre,“ and luxury sophistication, which cannot be found anywhere else in the world. Europe on the whole has strong appeal as an aspirational holiday destination for travelers owing to the diverse and high quality of its tourism offering with the added appeal of cross-country travel. This is why Europe is a key focus for our international growth and The Peninsular Paris is a key property in our expansion journey. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some recent milestones that your office has achieved?</h4><p>First of all, Miraflores is an attractive district to live and to do business in, and we have decided to work with that in two aspects—a kind of urban aspect to improve the area, and a human aspect to work with the population. In that sense, we have proposed utilities work, roads, sidewalks, and parks that can be shared by the people. We even have secure places in some parks because Lima is a seismically active zone. For the human aspect, we have developed a children's council; I meet with them and they provide a childhood perspective and suggest things. We took the idea from an Italian environmentalist teacher, Francesco Tonucci, who posited that cities that are good for its children are also good for its adults. We have three kinds of councils: children, youth, and adult. They often meet with me and tell me their opinions or their requests. In Miraflores there is a high population of seniors. We are building our third and largest senior housing facility. On Wednesdays, I open city hall for constituents to share their complaints, suggestions, and praise. This provides me with a connection to the citizenry that is valuable. We have also been highlighting the use of technology and telecommunications information, which allow for more participation, more connectedness, and more facilities for people. People can pay their taxes, inquire about dossiers, and follow the most important meetings all on the internet. We have an application simply called Miraflores that allows us to interact with the citizenry. What we look for is technology that will benefit the people. In November of last year I was in Barcelona, and I just came back from Pruebla, where I was invited to speak about Miraflores. In April, I am going to Bogotá. Miraflores is becoming an example of information technology worldwide.</p><h4>Why do people feel secure in Miraflores?</h4><p>El Comercio wrote an article about Miraflores, asking: “What the secret of Miraflores?" The answer is that we meet every Friday with a district committee on public safety, where we have involved the two commissioners, police from other metropolitan agencies, firefighters, peacekeepers, and the district attorney. There are in total 20 people who make up a platform that meets every Friday. We recently had meeting number 245, where we discussed an integral strategy called Miraflores 360° Todos juntos por la seguridad ciudana, or “Everyone together for a safe city." This means that, every day, we are involved in a comprehensive monitoring of the city. We have a central command where we can see what is going on. We also have a group of people checking integral statistics from the national police force and have created a real criminal map, so we know exactly where the most problematic areas of the city are, where the calmest are, where we have to put more emphasis, and what we need to do to be better. We have received awards and recognition for this, and I have always told people security is something done every day and we have to keep working to provide security to our citizens. The crime rate in Miraflores decreases every year, while the rate in the country increases. We are going against the current of what is happening nationwide.</p><h4>Why is Miraflores a great place to invest?</h4><p> Miraflores offers security in every sense of the word. We know that there are many aspects to consider regarding security, and that every leader has to offer social security, human security, legal security, citizen security, and so on. In Miraflores, we offer fair rules and, as a result, we have legal security. People know that they can come and establish themselves and that there are no risks to their investment. Moreover, we offer security on the streets, and as a result there is no theft; businesses can grow without collateral risk. We have put an emphasis on the care and use of public zones, because if they are secure and used, they will generate a positive cycle.</p><h4>What projects are currently shaping Miraflores? How do you maintain your iconic image while maintaining a balance between modernity and tradition?</h4><p>Maintaining balance is always complex, and we must have a balance. We have projects in the north close to San Isidro. One is designed by Jean Nouvel, which will gather business, homes, entertainment, and a five-star hotel all in one area where the San Martin Headquarters used to be. There is a project for a hotel in Costa Verda, too. While we have these projects in the germination state, there is also a commitment to conserve traditional areas by the town council, and that is where the balance is. In the traditional areas where there are old, big houses, what we look for is that the owners have a commitment to maintaining the house and we encourage them to preserve the buildings. We are elaborating on our urban development plan for the next 20 years and we take into consideration several elements, such as the kinds of citizens, the new socio-demographic conditions, how young people like to live, who will live in outlying areas, and who will live near Nouvel's project. We are listening to the entire population in order to improve the district in the following 20 years. Miraflores is a consolidated city but there are always developments underway, such as gentrification. The town council's commitment is to provide security and fair rules and to put into place elements for the good care of areas that will make the gentrification process happen not only in the center, but across the whole city. Some days ago, I read a report about Lima's districts; the best value per square meter is in Miraflores, and we have extended beyond our original district. This is something we are proud of. It is not that the grounds have become expensive, but it is an indicator of quality.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the performance of Qatar's tourism sector and its role in Qatar's economy as a whole?</h4><p>Tourism is a major catalyst for Qatar's socio-economic growth. Not only does it contribute to expanding the economy, attracting investors, and creating jobs, it also supports the development of a national brand on the international stage, encouraging intellectual dialogue and the breaking down of barriers between peoples around the world. In a country heavily reliant on its hydrocarbon wealth, tourism is playing a pivotal role in diversifying Qatar's economy, in turn shielding it from market infatuations that can impact its growth and sustainability in the long term. Last year once again showed promising results for Qatar's tourism sector. The numbers of both international and regional visitors have been on the rise. Visitors' numbers from the neighboring GCC markets have increased. This follows the establishment of QTA's GCC representative office there in 2014 and reflects the various trade and consumer-centric joint promotions, the Qatar annual calendar of festivals, events, and other initiatives launched to attract visitors. Moreover, the country witnessed a rise in overall hotel occupancy due to the various events, festivals, and conferences taking place. All in all, these positive results put Qatar on track in helping it achieve its goal of 7 million visitors by 2030. </p><h4>What is your view on the growth potential of the MICE sector with the development of state-of-the-art facilities that Qatar offers?</h4><p>Qatar is solidly carving for itself a place on the global map as a premium destination for business events. With the country's plans to increase the number of visitors by 20% within the next five years, we believe that developing a strong business events sector will help the country achieve these numbers, and will enhance Qatar's ability to develop a sustainable tourism sector. In 2015, the number of exhibitions rose by 40% with Qatar hosting 50 exhibitions in different sectors including fashion, real estate, education, and medicine. We expect another rise in the number of exhibition to reach 85 exhibitions and a rise in visitors by 5% in the coming year. The success that the business events sector has been enjoying is due to the luxurious, first-class, state-of-the-art venues available in Qatar. In the coming months, the new Doha Exhibition center will be opening its doors to all event organizers and will host its first event in November 2015. These numbers show us that our strategy to triple the number of visitors to Qatar by 2030 is well underway and that 2016 will see more efforts en route to achieving this aim.</p><h4>How would you describe QTA's strategic approach toward attracting international visitors and which regions of the world pose the most opportunity for growth?</h4><p>The guiding principle behind Qatar's tourism development strategy is quality, authenticity, and sustainability. We place top priority on ensuring that tourism growth is fully compatible with Qatar's cultural, social, and environmental integrity. We aim to build on our traditional strengths in the GCC leisure market and in business tourism, while placing increased emphasis on diversifying into new areas, with a focus on the major European source markets such as the UK, Germany, France, and Italy. That said, we will also continue to focus on the rapidly emerging markets of China, the Far East, and India, and have plans to penetrate these regions within the coming years. To complement our market focus, we are mindful of specific segments that cross-geographical boundaries as identified in Qatar National Tourism Sector Strategy 2030. A major target group, namely those that embrace sophisticated, experienced travelers actively seeking new cultural experiences and families, whether from neighboring countries or overseas, are strategically considered in all areas of tourism development. We remain interested in niche markets including special sports tourism, culture, and education. Qatar's Aspire Zone has an outstanding infrastructure for all types of sports-related tourism, including winter training camps and pre-tournament coaching and team building initiatives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Mozambique for Elevo's overall strategy?</h4><p>Mozambique is the second most important market in Africa after Angola for our group. From a global perspective it is the third biggest market for us, not in terms of figures or numbers, but we are seeing year after year that our presence is growing here. Until last year we were doubling our turnover every year, and this year our growth will be between 30 and 40%.</p><h4>How are you getting such impressive results during such a difficult period?</h4><p>It is a matter of opportunities. We started to build in 2010 and each year since have been winning high-value contracts in a sector that is very competitive. Fortunately we managed to get three contracts for road construction, after concluding our first project of 75km in the north and now have 300km of roads contracted for development and more than 100,000sqm of buildings projects during for the 2014-16 period. This was important in our process of growing in terms of infrastructure and buildings. We needed to develop the capacity to be chosen by our clients and to get the confidence to win tenders. We are a company with a huge history of construction, more than 75 years' experience, and our goal is to perform well in the contracts that we have to the highest standards of quality, because we know that this market is competitive and exigent. There are established construction companies here from many different nations, including Portugal, South Africa, China, and Brazil. We really need to perform well because it is the only way we can continue.</p><h4>What projects do you plan to focus on in Maputo?</h4><p>We are now focused mostly on buildings construction. We are building offices, condominiums, houses, and industrial facilities, and we believe that here in Maputo we will continue to work on those types of projects. We plan to diversify our activity not only in terms of the types of projects, but also with different business models. There are opportunities for new project concepts to reach different markets, namely that of the Mozambican middle class, as we need to insist on good quality and balanced prices, or structural projects, to allow for the sustainable growth of the city and the province.</p><h4>What projects are you developing outside Maputo and what provinces have the most potential for the near future?</h4><p>Our anchors are Maputo/Matola, Pemba in Cabo Delgado, Milange and Mocuba in Zambezia, and Cuamba in Niassa, where we have a huge operation. Pemba is a business center that we started to build up at the end of 2014. There are important opportunities in the region, not only in terms of buildings but all kinds of infrastructure. Pemba is a strategic option for us. We have one construction site and one industrial site where we have installed a quarry and our own production of materials for that market. We are also working on an important project in the development of the Milange-Mocuba corridor, which was financed by the EU. This is a program that connects the Malawian border with Mozambique through Mocuba and links up with the port in Nacala. We are building about 150km of road. It is also an area that is regularly affected by flooding, so we are participating in emergency works by building bridges and ensuring that we have good infrastructure for the future. The EU is investing a lot in developing this corridor.</p><h4>What does the EU bring to the table?</h4><p>Usually in Mozambique the requirements for construction are exigent, since the institutions have good people and technicians, with strong experience. Projects like this one of the EU and the National Roads Administration (ANE) involve international financing and a mix of client, local authorities, engineers, and construction companies helping each other to achieve better standards of performance. On this project, the EU does not only want to finance the construction of the road; it wants to bring about the economic development of the region at large, solving the strategic needs of this important logistic corridor by rebuilding and repairing crucial bridges and areas affected by floods and contributing to the social development of people's lives. We believe that this project will have a huge positive impact on the country, the region, and the people now in the present and for the future. Both national and local authorities are involved in the decision-making process.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the human capital situation in Mozambique?</h4><p>We have over 1,100 people working with us. We feel content when we are contracting new people on a monthly basis, most of which are Mozambicans. Our challenge is to broker a progressive substitution in areas of high specialization, with Mozambicans gradually taking over the positions currently held by expatriates. We have a program, the Elevo Academy, in which we are trying to increase our training efforts for Mozambicans. It is difficult to keep workers in Mozambique, especially in the construction sector. We have to ensure that there is progression and balance in the conditions of the foreign employees and the locals. We are engaged in an internal process with our managers to prepare Mozambicans for these roles.</p><h4>What are your targets, goals, and expectations for 2016?</h4><p>It is important from a financial perspective to maintain our clients and to continue working on the projects we have started. Our main goal is to be successful in these projects, and to focus on the clients with which we are already working and the new ones we targeted. We believe that this will be a year of transition, with decisions and clarifications regarding the huge projects in the north being made. That will tell us more, as it will have a considerable effect on the course of the year if positive signs are given. We will not depend on it, however, because Mozambique has many potential investments in projects that will come online this year. We also need to face climate change, with floods and dry seasons that impact the country and people. Water management, dams, and water infrastructure can be new areas of focus. The opportunities are here all over the country, so we hope this can be a year of growing and consolidating our presence here in Mozambique. There are some challenges to overcome but we have the capacity go on.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ADIB is a pioneer of Islamic banking in the UAE. How do you assess how you have developed business in compliance with governing ethics?</h4><p>I wanted to develop the bank and open it up to a much larger market. We looked at what it was we had going for us and how could work for everybody, beyond just being a community bank for Muslims by Muslims. We wanted to be everybody's bank, and we decided that our ethical standards would be the key value that we offer to everybody, including all stakeholders, clients, and customers. Islamic banking is, at its core, an ethical way of banking. The aim of it is, first and foremost, to be just and fair, as well as sustainable and safe, while being profitable at the same time. In advanced economies, consumer protection is a major issue with dozens of laws involved, with each country having its own laws. The core of sharia-based banking is protecting the consumer, protecting the stakeholder, and protecting the environment. Consumers all around the world want the same thing, namely what is good for them. Everybody around the world has the same principles; they want the feel-good factor and they want to buy from those who are ethical. We have conducted a lot of research and interviewed more than 5,000 people on five different continents to help do this. We have worked with MacKenzie Group and Boston Consulting Group to come up with a universal value proposition that works for everyone. It has come down to a few basic aspects, all of which can be summarized in one word: ethics.</p><h4>Looking at the current economic situation in the UAE, with other banks looking to the bond and loan markets to have access to capital and maintain liquidity, how do you think this could be an opportune situation for ADIB and other Islamic banks?</h4><p>ADIB, like other financial institutions, is engaged in the investment banking space. We are engaged in the Islamic bond market, or sukuks, and we arrange, issue, and invest in sukuks. There are opportunities out there to invest in more sukuks. I believe sukuks are more efficient and more beneficial than conventional bonds because they rely on the presence of real assets, whereas bonds don't necessarily require assets in the equation. Therefore, for investors it is safer to be in a sukuk than in a conventional bond. If, for example, an airline issues a sukuk, it is a prerequisite that the aircraft is part of the deal. If there is ever a default, at least the sukuk holders still have the aircraft. But in the bond market, although a similar asset-based bond is possible, it is not a prerequisite. In Islamic banking it is a prerequisite, which is why investors prefer this—it is safer.</p><h4>Islamic banking has become a huge part of the international banking sector in recent years. How do you perceive the future of Islamic banking?</h4><p>Islamic banking has indeed become recognized as a viable mode of finance. Former French minister and current IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde has been quoted on numerous occasions saying Islamic banks bring better stability to the global financial system than conventional banks do. She is a proponent of Islamic finance because she believes it is better in terms of systemic risk in the global financial system. She is not saying this solely from the shareholders' point of view, but from the point of view of the depositors, the regulators, and the shareholders. She is talking about the entire system. Islamic banks, in general, tend to be less risky and less speculative. They take risk, but it is natural risk, because they are primarily driven by the real economy of trade, manufacturing, and construction, not just the financial economy.</p><h4>Christine Lagarde has said that Islamic banks need to develop sharia-compliant liquidity management tools for the banks to adequately assess and address risks. What are your thoughts on this?</h4><p>She is absolutely right. Normally, banks are supposed to maintain a level of true liquidity on their balance sheets. It usually is a percentage of its overall balance sheet, usually around 10% or 20%. That true liquidity could be money that is deposited at the central bank or money invested in short-term marketable money instruments such as certificates of deposit issued by the central bank or treasury bills. Those are available, but primarily conventional.</p><h4>How has the regulator Al Etihad Credit Bureau (AECB) influenced lending and borrowing specifically for ADIB?</h4><p>We are among the pioneers who participated in the credit bureau, having fully participated from its earliest stages. We believe the credit bureau is a prerequisite for any stable and successful financial market. It will enhance transparency in the future, it will establish the credit-worthiness of a borrower applying for credit, and it will bring a greater element of safety into the system. We are a great believer in it and we want to see more of it. We work closely with AECB for the retail business. All our consumer transactions run through the AECB.</p><h4>How has ADIB tailored its services toward developing the SME sector?</h4><p>We are among the top three biggest banks for SMEs, and we are successful in that segment. Our value proposition is wide-ranging. We work with the whole gamut in the SME segment. Of all the products we offer, we have an excellent list of liability management and cash management products, and we have a number of great financing products, including real estate finance, auto finance, warehouse finance, and inventory finance, for example.</p><h4>The Islamic finance sector continues to grow in the country, expected to be worth $260 billion by 2019. What portion of that do you believe that ADIB will account for?</h4><p>Domestically, we aim to be the largest retail bank by 2020. Not just the largest Islamic retail bank, but also the largest bank overall.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why was a dedicated authority, separate from the government, established to  manage the Canal?</h4><p>This organization evolves from the fact that the US managed the canal as a public utility for the better part of 85 years. The Panamanian people wanted to make sure that the canal would operate outside the political sphere and therefore decided that it needed to be totally independent both financially and operationally, unlike the other government institutions. We resorted to a constitutional amendment, which took place in two different legislatures, 1993 and 1994. The success of the Panama Canal has had to do with this marked independence from government rooted in the constitution, but contingent that it would be operated safely, uninterruptedly, efficient, and that it must be profitable. Thus in addition to maintaining, conserving, and investing in the Canal's modernization and expansion, a definite goal of the Panama Canal Authority is to ensure the Canal's profitability for Panama, which is a different focus from that of the US, and one that has worked well for the last 16 years.</p><h4>What does the Canal expansion mean for Panama?</h4><p>There have been several efforts in the past to expand the Canal. The first was in 1939, but this was suspended in 1942 at the outset of the Second World War. In the 1960s there was an effort to study if the demand for an expansion was there. At one point, engineers looked at several alternatives for a new canal through the Central America isthmus with the emphasis that it would be a sea level canal. During these latter studies excavations using nuclear explosives were considered. The studies were concluded and published in 1970 but nothing actually evolved from them. Panama was focused in 1972 on trying to regain sovereignty over the Canal Zone and embarked on a process to garner support around the world, leading to the signing of the 1977 Torrijos-Carter treaties. On October 1, 1979, the Torrijos-Carter treaties set forth the transitional period and the administration of the Canal would remain basically under US administration all the way until December 31, 1999 at noon, when the transfer officially took place. During this long process, all expansion efforts were paused. The US, knowing that they would be turning over the Canal, decided there was no need to take on the effort and cost of an expansion. However, additional Panama Canal alternative studies were performed between 1985 and 1993. In the meantime, we relied on the same original canal, yet ships kept getting larger. The Universal Congress on the Panama Canal held in 1997, as well as additional studies from abroad, showed that the Panama Canal had to be expanded if it was to grow in the future. This led us to look again in 1998 at what was needed and how we could get the expansion done. By 2001, we were clear that the container segment that had reached 50% of our revenue stream from transit operations were shifting to much larger vessels that could not fit in the present lock system. We worked on studies for five years to produce a proposal leading up to the October 22, 2006 favorable referendum, with 77% of the people of Panama voting in favor of expansion. We started executing the expansion program on September 3, 2007, and we are now nearing completion within the next few months. It has been a great enterprise defying many challenges over the past eight years to get us where we are today. This is a complex project that required engaging top international dredging and construction contractors that would bring in the latest designs and construction technologies, as well as manage the intricate logistics. Over 90% of the people that worked on the project were of course Panamanian. A substantial amount of the dredging was performed by the Panama Canal employing its own equipment and dredgers.</p><h4>What spillover effects will the expansion have?</h4><p>The spillover effect has already been felt. The construction of a project of this magnitude requires that many workers mobilize to the project, both from different areas of Panama and abroad. That in itself has been a positive injection into the economy. At the peak of the construction some 14,000 workers were being employed on the many Panama Canal expansion projects. This significantly increased consumption in goods and services including housing in Panama. We have already spent about $5 billion in the project, much of which has been pumped  into Panama's healthy economy. Moving forward, the expansion will not only allow our present customers to benefit from the economies of scales provided by the larger vessels that will soon be able to transit the Canal, but will also allow the Canal to exploit opportunities for growth in another segment, such as new LNG vessel traffic from the US, which recently became a net exporter of gas. That will become an important new product that we will use the canal, and which we anticipate will progressively reach three Post Panamax LNG vessel transits a day by 2020.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Our outlook is that 2016 will probably be similar to 2015. We are finishing the third set of locks, and our expansion should be operational by the end of 2Q2016; every effort is focused on not missing that deadline. This of course is not entirely in our hands since we are dependent substantially on our contractors' ability to execute. With regard to contractor claims, they will take some time to resolve and we have a very strong team that represents us well in these processes. In the meantime, we are concentrating on getting the construction completed with the required quality, and to begin to see our customers making use of our new locks and channels . The pressure is on us, both locally and from abroad. This project is the largest expansion of the Panama Canal ever—it will be done when it is done, and we want it done right.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways is UCQ establishing partnerships to continue building Qatar's healthcare sector?</h4><p>Advancing health and wellness in Qatar is fundamental to what we do, and we pursue every opportunity to do so. In addition to our partnerships with a wide range of healthcare providers, we conduct research with other disciplines and organizations. Our research program at UCQ has gone from zero to $4.5 million over the past few years and has involved professionals from HMC and a variety of other institutions. We are particularly proud of our leadership role in research and professional healthcare.</p><h4>How would you describe some of the landmark achievements of the past year?</h4><p>Launching the master's in nursing leadership program in January was an enormous achievement. The program grew out of feedback we received from our students, many of whom are already in senior nursing positions and wanted more education in leadership. These were people who had tremendous skill and talent, but who wanted to continue building their expertise so they could be the best possible supervisor of those working for them, and to have the ability to lead the improvement of health and wellness in Qatar. Our program helps them acquire theoretical knowledge so they are equipped to be visionary leaders, in addition to practical skills such as budgeting, management, and quality control so they can achieve their vision effectively.</p><h4>How would you say that UCQ fits into the growth of the healthcare sector on the regional and global level?</h4><p>UCQ is not a huge institution, but we have been given the opportunity to have a major impact in Qatar. We are involved in many important initiatives and sit on major committees that are directing and structuring healthcare in this country. We are also involved in continuing professional education for healthcare professionals, and this is important because, to my knowledge, Qatar is the only place that is wisely taking a national approach to professional development and professional certification. I personally sit on a number of committees and it has been an extraordinary privilege to be consulted as the Ministry of Health and others chart the course for healthcare in Qatar.</p><h4>What was the significance of the MoU that the University of Calgary recently signed with Primary Health Care for developing the skills of healthcare professionals?</h4><p>The University of Calgary in Qatar exists to train nurses to the highest technical standards. As part of this, we have had a close relationship with the Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC). HMC sponsors some of its nursing employees to attend UCQ in our master's program so they can upgrade their skills and have the costs of this additional education covered. As a result of the MoU with Primary Health Care, some of the employees will now have a similar opportunity to study with us. This is important because Primary Health is looking to expand its community nursing and public health nursing programs, and we can help deliver on this vision. We also expect to be able to sign similar sponsorship agreements with Sidra and the Supreme Health Council, which deepens our partnerships and expands the expertise of those delivering healthcare in Qatar.</p><h4>What are some of the key strategic points of the University of Calgary Strategic Plan 2015-2018?</h4><p>Students are the most important aspect of UCQ. That's why they are the first of the four key elements of our strategic plan. We strive to provide a positive student experience through excellent teaching and learning, which in turn attracts Qatar's best and brightest to the nursing profession. Secondly, we focus on stability, which is about having the resources to train an increasing number of students for the future. Our third priority concerns stakeholders, which means building positive relationships with the community around us. Finally, we have to think about systems for delivering high-quality programming to our students and the wider Qatar community. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is building QEERI's portfolio of international partnerships to furthering its objectives?</h4><p>QEERI is a new institute under development and in the process of building its state-of-the-art labs and research facilities. Building a portfolio of highly regarded and world leading international institutes is very important for the success and growth of QEERI as we benefit in a number of areas, such as buying down technical risks and not wasting time and resources trying to learn what others have gone through, speeding up our development of projects and transfer of know-how, and interacting with the best in the world and helping build the right culture for innovation and research, gaining access to state of the art research labs and tools at partners' facilities while ours is being completed, and building a network of professionals that can help in recruitment and in positioning QEERI, Qatar Foundation, and Qatar in the international scientific and technical arena.</p><h4>How would you assess the viability of externally marketing the technologies developed at QEERI?</h4><p>QEERI is a new institute and still building its labs and research facilities. Commercializing a technology is a time-consuming process and it takes time for the research findings in the labs to transfer to the market as commercial products. Despite the fact that QEERI is a very young institute and that the labs and facilities are not yet ready, the scientists and researchers at QEERI have made significant technological advancement that will prove beneficial and impactful in the near future. The focus of QEERI agenda is on energy and water security challenges that are facing the region with global outreach. Therefore any new technological advances in these areas would be relevant and much needed.</p><h4>How important is developing the international perception of Qatar as a leader in R&amp;D?</h4><p>There can be little doubt that R&amp;D plays an important role in meeting the world's challenges going forward, and will be one element in what needs to be an integrated economic approach to energy and water resource management. It is vital that Qatar's international reputation be highlighted as a leader in R&amp;D especially after the gained reputation of Qatar Foundation due to Her Highness' vision. This is clear through the establishment of three major research institutes focusing on national challenges for the state of Qatar. These institutes are already internationally recognized through the top outputs including publications in Nature and filing a number of invention disclosures. The reputation will also help attract top scientists as recruits or collaborators</p><h4>What have been the important achievements of QEERI since its inception?</h4><p>Among our most important achievements since January 2011, when QEERI was founded, is recruiting world-class scientists to address national energy and water grand challenges. We now have 130 full-time employees and 102 of them are scientists. We are also training Qatari technical specialists at a leading research institute in Japan on advanced tools and equipment, which is now helping QEERI set up the state-of-the-art labs and research facilities. Perhaps most importantly, we are beginning to build a portfolio of projects in order to realize the solutions to Qatar's grand challenges and priorities: energy security and water security. In doing so, we have won three accelerator awards by building prototypes of technology. Another key element for the institute's success is establishing a national steering committee (STEWARD) for energy and water securities chaired by HE the Minister of Energy and Industry to coordinate the R&amp;D activities among key stakeholders in Qatar. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar aims to be a global leader in innovative product development. What are Qatar's competitive strengths in this context, and in which fields is it suited to excel globally?</h4><p>QTSP is part of a larger family that includes the Qatar Foundation, which is founded upon three main pillars: education, science, and community development. In terms of the science pillar, we have Qatar Foundation Research and Development, of which QSTP is a part, and we add value to that innovation value chain across the whole ecosystem of innovation in Qatar. In terms of Qatar's areas of expertise and competitive advantages, the R&amp;D community has drafted the Qatar National Research Strategy 2012. The strategy is founded on four main pillars, three of which are directly related to QSTP and one to social sciences. The first pillar is energy and environment, the second is computing, and the third pillar is biomedical. We are particularly committed to supporting  solutions for important issues in energy security, water security, cyber security, and such health issues as diabetes. Qatar can leverage its long history, legacy, and experience in oil and gas, so that is one of the main areas where we have a competitive advantage and can make a huge impact from a technology and innovation perspective, as well as in terms of eventual commercialization. That of course does not mean that we will only be developing products, innovations, and research in oil and gas. Our research results and research community efforts will guide the way. The outcome of that applied research provides the inlet for the QSTP to take it on the commercial route.</p><h4>What type of products does the market most need right now?</h4><p>Identifying what the market needs is challenging. The market ultimately drives itself. Some things are pushed to the market, while other things are pulled by the market. Particularly in ICT, the model of pushing things like software and apps into the market seems to work well. We just finished our second cohort and have begun our third cohort. It is good to see how this program is attracting entrepreneurs with good ideas. Our first cohort had 27 applicants, the second cohort had 53, and the third cohort had 107. Due capacity, we can accept only 15 ideas per cohort, and we have two cohorts per year. The more applicants that we have, the better chance that there will be good ideas. Some projects in the first and second cohort will move into our incubator to take their technology further, and they will receive all the support that QSTP has to offer.</p><h4>Do you have plans for any more physical expansion or development?</h4><p>We are currently at 83% occupancy, so there are expansion plans and the construction of our new building, Tech 4, is already underway. Tech 4 is a different style of building workshop, and is designed to cater for heavy and high-vibration equipment, creating more of a workshop environment.</p><h4>How do you find an ideal balance in terms occupancy between local start-ups and multinational tech players?</h4><p>Our vision is to be recognized as an international hub for applied research, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Once we got the numbers in that endeavor and across different fields, we attracted small start-ups. Our Business Connect event is all about bringing together big companies and start-ups, hosting workshops, fostering dialogue and communication, building connections and networks, and creating synergies. We have always sought that fine balance, because that is the key to success in what we are trying to accomplish.</p><h4>What is your outlook for QSTP in 2016?</h4><p>It is going to be a busy year. Oil prices will remain a global and local challenge, which only reinforces our efforts to build a knowledge-based economy. With a knowledge-based economy, we will no longer be beholden to fluctuating commodity prices. We are aware of how important our mission is, and this puts a lot more pressure on us, but this is a good thing. In 2016, we will continue supporting the incubation of start-ups and entrepreneurs, building synergies and partnerships, and working toward the creation of a knowledge-based economy and society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe some of the key achievements for Quantum Global Solutions over the past few years?</h4><p>Following a period of restructuring, we relaunched as Quantum Global Solutions (QGS) in mid-2014, which reflected our growth in new geographical locations. QGS is working extensively in the Middle East with our clients and their projects across the GCC, serviced from our regional offices in Doha, Dubai, Riyadh, and Amman. Outside of the Middle East, we have teams operating in Europe, the US, and Asia, managed out of our offices in Istanbul, Chicago, and Hong Kong. This expansion was primarily driven through client demand and as a company we have grown by around 20% over the last 12 months and expect this trend to continue.</p><h4>How would you rate the success of your unique multimedia platform, and to what extent does it give you a competitive edge in the market?</h4><p>As part of an array of strategies to deliver early settlement of claims and disputes, one unique method QGS uses to trigger negotiations and avoid protracted disputes is through the use of fully animated movie presentations using creative and dynamic multimedia techniques. It is a fact that 90% of the information transmitted to the brain is visual, and our brain processes visual images 60,000 times faster than text. As the saying goes, a picture tells a thousand words. To leverage this fact, QGS has developed an in-house media team specifically dedicated to the preparation of movies and interactive presentations used to demonstrate construction claim entitlements. When utilized in this way, media is particularly useful for making presentations to employers' senior management, the key decision makers who do not necessarily have the time to read and digest the large volumes of narrative accompanying many claim submissions. Media can be used to present issues clearly, concisely, and with a focused message aligned to the desired outcomes. QGS has used media extensively on complex disputes and this has proven to be very effective in securing decisions with positive results. Our focus is to encourage dialogue, to take the emotion out of the subject, and get people to talk. Clarity, focus, and resolution is our philosophy, which is enabled through the use of dynamic media.</p><h4>How much does international growth represent your overall strategy to develop QGS?</h4><p>Qatar is our headquarters and our primary market with 75% of our operations. Qatar's population has more than quadrupled in the last 15 years and is expected to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. This rapid growth leaves continued demand for services across all sectors. From a business perspective, with its stable political system and a solid platform of growth supported by the country's energy sector, Qatar is one of the most prosperous and vibrant countries in the world to do business. Remarkable opportunities exist for professional organizations, which have been greatly enhanced by Qatar being chosen to host the FIFA World Cup in 2022. QGS is a recognized and trusted brand locally, regionally, and internationally. Our success is based on client satisfaction, repeat calls, and reputation. Our growth has been driven through the demands of our clients, who also operate on a global basis. The balance 25% of our operations outside of Qatar is spread 15% elsewhere in the Middle East and the remaining 10% covering our global operations.</p><h4>In terms of Qatar, how important is the 2022 FIFA World Cup and Qatar's National Vision 2030 to the overall growth of the local construction market?</h4><p>The QNV2030 provides a clear picture of how this amazing country will develop across all sectors. Qatar's hosting of the FIFA World Cup in 2022 fully aligns with this ambitious national journey of human development and sustainable economic diversification that seeks a secure future for all its people, built on human capital rather than its finite hydrocarbon resources. These steps build on Qatar's strong international presence in the fields of energy, media, and sports. According to recent reports, Qatar plans to increase spending on major projects by around 20%, including the $7 billion New Doha Port project, the allocation of $20 billion toward the construction of roadways and highways, and the construction of eight stadiums at an estimated cost of over $32 billion, some of which are being built afresh, while others are to be refurbished. Our role will keep pace with the market and as the volume of projects grows, there is an increased requirement for our services across the board. The implementation of fast track major projects will include change to suit developing requirements and coordination with other developments. Project change results in additional time and cost and our role is to support the client and the contractor to avoid dispute and encourage amicable resolutions.</p><h4>Looking forward, what are your expectations for QGS, specifically in the year ahead?</h4><p>We are partnering with our clients in Qatar on key infrastructure projects including railways, roads, airports, and the new port as well as numerous energy, industrial, healthcare, educational, commercial, and residential projects. In terms of QGS, we will continue to grow in line with the demand from our customers in Qatar and throughout the Gulf. We are probably looking at a minimum 20% growth year on year for the next few years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Having recently appointed Ibrahim Al-Othman, who has extensive experience in the local energy sector, as the company's CEO, what does this move show about UDC's strategic outlook?</h4><p>United Development Company (UDC) is fortunate to have welcomed Mr. Al-Othman as the company's CEO. With over 25 years of experience, Ibrahim Al-Othman has come on board to ensure the company continues pushing forward and ensuring the primary focus remains results-oriented in delivering for our shareholders, clients, residents, and employees. Our foremost emphasis at this stage of UDC's development is to focus on the company's core business as a means to achieving greater progress and profits for our stakeholders. Ibrahim's track record at previous executive positions he held makes him the right executive to lead this paradigm shift in UDC's strategic focus for the next five years. This means he will lead our progress by increasing profits from real estate development, sales and retail leasing, and management, in addition to overseeing major improvements in the performances of our various subsidiaries and partnerships. </p><h4>How would you rate the success of your development of The Pearl, and to what extent will you be targeting similar large-scale projects to boost the company's growing profile?</h4><p>As Qatar continues to witness remarkable growth, The Pearl-Qatar has become home to a diverse range of cultures and ethnicities, and is now proudly one of the fastest growing communities in Doha. We are therefore committed to sustaining growth and profitability as well as meeting stakeholder expectations by working to complete the remaining phases of our flagship development, The Pearl-Qatar, and to conclude winning partnerships in other key sectors of operation. Our strategy is to focus on the core business, namely urban development, real estate sales, retail leasing, property and asset management, and district cooling. Potential in these major areas is huge, and we are confident in our ability to achieve the satisfaction of our stakeholders.</p><h4>As a company that is listed on Qatar's Stock Exchange, what can the local market do to attract more foreign investment to its shores?</h4><p>Qatar is fairly open for international investors, and its continued development relies to a good extent on the continuing flow of foreign investments. Therefore, Qatar will need to ensure that it remains competitive compared to other GCC states if it is to be considered more favorably by foreign investors. This may take the form of additional and more liberalized free trade zones and more detailed landlord-tenant legislation. On our part, The Pearl-Qatar will continue to attract interest from tenants and buyers alike for a variety of reasons, most notably for being the first development to offer freehold ownership to foreigners as well as for the variety of investment opportunities it presents in real estate development, sales, retail, and hospitality.</p><h4>What are some of the recent trends you are noticing in Qatar's real estate market?</h4><p>The country's growing population ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup continues to impact real estate dynamics of supply and demand. Qatar has equally strengthened its position as one of the leading property markets for investors, as the growth in the sector is likely to continue, supported by Qatar's strong economy and government investment in infrastructure and road works. We are also starting to witness a shift towards adopting a sustainable approach to urban expansion and population distribution in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV2030).</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead? </h4><p>Major opportunities will arise at The Pearl-Qatar in the near future in relation to investments in infrastructure, transportation networks, and tourism as part of QNV2030. Therefore, the real estate market could never be more favorable to investors than it is today. On the residential side, the increase in population due to recruitment of personnel from outside of Qatar by new and expanding businesses continues to drive demand for residential accommodation. Our outlook is to move ahead and can be achieved by focusing and committing to our three imperative strategies of attracting investors, attracting more residents and retailers, and completing the development of the Island. Focusing on and implementing these three strategies will bring more success in 2015 and the years to come. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is the expansion of transport and logistics to the overall economic growth of Qatar?</h4><p>Hamad Port perfectly fit within the regional and international logistics and supply chain of commercial commodities. It is a strategic piece of infrastructure required under Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV2030), which sets a crucial goal for the diversification of the Qatari economy and developing the country into a regional trading hub. Diversifying the economy through Hamad Port will make Qatar more resilient against changes in the global economic environment. Current transport and logistics infrastructure projects will facilitate trade, enhance the competitiveness of local industries, and increase the role of the non-hydrocarbon sectors in the national GDP. Under the wise leadership of The Emir of Qatar, His Highness Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, this vibrant nation will witness an era of non-hydrocarbon world trade through Hamad Port.</p><h4>What are the most important objectives of Mwani Qatar and what services is the company developing to accomplish these goals?</h4><p>Mwani Qatar's strategic goal is to transform its ports into the ports of choice for all port users, including main shipping lines, through efficient operations, enhanced customer focus, and the application of the highest standards of safety, security, environment, and quality. Mwani Qatar endeavors to consolidate its leading position locally and is pushing for a strong regional and international presence as a leading integrated port and logistics services provider. With an economic zone being created in close proximity to the port, trade is set to have a tremendous boost and fulfill the economic diversification goals of QNV2030.</p><h4>How will the offerings of Doha Port and Hamad Port complement each other?</h4><p>Qatar's infrastructure projects are progressing at a fast pace, and Phase I of Hamad Port, one of the biggest infrastructure projects in Qatar and the region, is on schedule for completion by end-2016. Doha Port will be redeveloped into a cruise terminal once Hamad Port becomes fully operational. Mwani Qatar plans to redevelop Doha Port to receive more tourists and cruise ships in the future. We will also be developing a temporary cruise terminal at Hamad Port, which will serve the incoming larger cruise ships during the 2016/2017 season until Doha Port is fully redeveloped into a cruise port. HE Jassim Bin Saif Al-Sulaiti, the Minister of Transport and Communications, has had a clear vision from the moment the authorities embarked on building one of the largest port developments in the world. Mwani Qatar's strategy is fully integrated, allowing complementarity among the ports to serve our customers without any gaps while developing and upgrading our port infrastructure to reach the highest standards of quality and service.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>It is expected that the decreasing international oil prices will have an impact on the growth of the world economy, with cascading impacts on international trade and the maritime transport sector. However, low oil prices also have a positive impact on shipping rates and shipping lines' profitability. In all cases, 2016 will be a period for us to consolidate our productivity and efficiency to prepare for the upcoming growth cycle that normally follows economic downturns. I am optimistic in this regard, as the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) is still following its ambitious infrastructure plans, which will boost the regional economic growth and position the region as a leading trading hub. Hamad Port will open up new horizons for domestic and foreign investment, especially in the Um Alhoul Economic Zone. Hamad Port has the crucial infrastructure necessary to achieve the economic diversification goals of the state. It will facilitate Qatar's international trade to serve the neighboring states through transshipment of goods and will provide incentives for FDI to come to Qatar, especially to the Um Alhoul Economic Zone to establish SMEs, diversify the economy, and take advantage of cost-effective logistics services provided at the port for imports and exports. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which ways will ongoing Qatar Rail projects act as an enabler for future growth of the Qatari economy?</h4><p>In general, there would be no economic growth without strong transport infrastructure. One of the main factors for any investor, especially international investors, when they are considering investing in any country or sector, is transport infrastructure. So, the quality of transport infrastructure is always a critical decision for international investment and for the local economy as well. Transportation infrastructure affects everyone including both the private and public sectors along with the community as a whole. Historically speaking, if you look at the transport sector in Qatar, the sector's development directly reflects the growth of the country. With this in mind, if you look back about 20 years ago, the population was under 500,000. Now, 20 years later, Qatar has become a multicultural and diverse country with over 2.5 million residents. The traditional mode of transport in Qatar was to use private cars and the road system. But in the longer run this would not be sufficient to cater to the needs of the city, the growth of the economy, the evolution of the commercial system, and so on. With such growth, I would not see it as sustainable to have just a road system and simply widening the road; we cannot make the city only a road-based one. The vision for Qatar Rail is that we have different projects to serve the needs of different sectors. The most important one is the metro, the aim of which is to transfer and carry passengers inside the city and to areas outside of the capital. It is a must-have transport system, which is efficient and very sustainable, and will save a lot of time.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the viability of Qatar Rail finishing the Doha Metro and Lusail Light Rail projects on time?</h4><p>We have started to think about this, even at the planning stages for the projects. We decided that it was very important for us to be extremely careful and concise about which companies we would select to carry out the design, building, and contracting. For example, we make sure that we have a prequalification condition that each party has to associate with a local party. Not only that, it is not enough to have a single company with a local company enter a joint venture with, we need to ensure that we have a richness of expertise with the contractors from the international and local company contribution. This dynamic is important because, in a partnership arrangement such as this, the foreign and domestic companies can support each other; the international company bringing the capacity and know-how to the project and the domestic company bringing market expertise. So we started to call or qualify very strong joint ventures with structure that we believe will make them more able to deliver these projects and the program on time. At the same time, we wanted to evaluate the opportunity of having a single joint venture or consortium to do the entire project. However, we decided that this was too big of a risk to take as it leaves such an important project in the hands of a single entity. In the end, we thought of dividing the project into parts and using multiple joint ventures and consortiums so as to ensure the successful delivery of the overall project. </p><h4>In what ways do you think Qatar really stands to benefit by the completion of the GCC rail network?</h4><p>The GCC network is to extend over 2,100 km from the north of Kuwait to the south of Oman. When complete, the GCC Rail Network will provide strong infrastructure and connect Qatar to many ports. So you virtually have an axis in the Red Sea and in the Arabian Gulf, and this will have a great impact on freight transport. For imports, for example, you will be able to choose the cheapest way to transport your goods inside of Qatar. And also, during times of emergency, it will provide access to many other ports. The rail freight sector inside the GCC is designed not just to drive the growth of trade but also the enhancement of the road system, because each train will take around 400 trucks off the road. If you run trains every hour, for example, you can imagine that we are taking thousands of trucks off the roads, which then enhances road safety and the maintenance of these roads. And it will also improve the competitiveness of small and medium-sized industry players in Qatar and the GCC. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the major accomplishments of Es'hailSat over the last year?</h4><p>Es'hail-1 was fully sold by 2014. By 2015, we tried to expand the capacity on Es'hail-1 by leasing some spectrum from our partners, and re-leasing and operating it using our satellite. Fortunately, we were successful in doing so and we expanded our capacity, which was again fully sold. Now, we are looking forward to Es'hail-2. For me, 2015, in terms of sales and marketing, was a great accomplishment by expanding the capacity of Es'hail-1. In addition, 2015 has seen the great progress made on Es'hail-2. We have gone through the critical phases, such as the critical design review (CDR) and the preliminary design review (PDR). These are the critical phases of any satellite because they could delay of the manufacturing process. Fortunately, we have passed these without any risks or faults. Also, in 2016, we signed a contract with PromerQatar for the construction of our teleport and control station for Es'hail-2. Things are moving according to the plan. Hopefully, the project will move forward on schedule to start Es'hail-2 operations on time.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind Es'hail-2, and what do you expect to gain by launching a second satellite?</h4><p>Es'hail-2 is a complement to Es'hail-1. Es'hailSat, as a company, was established for different purposes: strategic and commercial reasons. Es'hail-1 has achieved the strategic vision, maybe 80%, and Es'hail-2 will complement that remaining part of the strategic and commercial objectives. Also, Es'hail-1 has a great return on investment (ROI), but Es'hail-2 will increase that ROI. Before we launch Es'hail-2, we have already received applications and requests for capacity. This is definitely based on the reputation that Es'hailSat has built in the market over the last few years in terms of quality and customer service. Fortunately, we have no problems or claims. So far, everything is as expected.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges that you foresee with sales and marketing of Es'hail-2?</h4><p>The challenge today is competition. The market is open. In the past, we had only a few satellite operators in the market; however, now we have at least four. Those have brought extra capacity to the market and new services. The challenge is to maintain the quality of service and also to maintain the price. When there is a lot of capacity, it can turn into a price war. The challenge is to control the prices. From the broadcaster's point of view, it could be a benefit. From the operator's point of view, it would be a disadvantage. We are trying to maintain the balance. We know there are some operators in the market, and we know that those operators, with many years of history behind them, have experience and well-established brands. They know the market, perhaps even better than us. However, we are trying to maintain a high level of quality because not all the customers are looking for price. Some customers are looking for independence, quality, and reliability. We are trying to account for all of these factors and work around them. </p><h4>What does the partnership with SpaceX mean for the future success of Es'hail?</h4><p>Honestly, the launch market is limited. There are limited players. We have French players, some Chinese, and also some from the US. When we decided to go with SpaceX and Melco, the Mitsubishi manufacturer, we decided to send a different message to the market and industry. When we floated the RFP for Es'hail-2, we received proposals from different manufacturers and launchers, and we decided to go with the best value in commercial and technical terms.  We chose the best fit for our strategy and budget. Most of the satellite manufacturers met our criteria and most of them had similar prices. We have decided to go with a Japanese company to send a message to the market. The US and European companies control the market. The Japanese also have a successful rate of satellites, such as the ones built for the governments of Turkey and Japan. However, in terms of commercial activities, they have a limited history and now we are in the pipeline. Therefore, we have decided to go with a new player. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Arab Engineering Bureau's performance over the previous year?</h4><p>We have been continuously growing. In the last couple of years we faced some serious challenges, because the results of the economic crisis six years ago usually come at the end, but we see a continuous work flow. Even now with the oil prices down, the private sector has been extremely aggressive. We are busy, and we are still growing both locally and regionally. With regards to today's recent challenges, namely the oil prices, Qatar has diversified in a smart way with gas and other industries, and of course with the mega investments it has made abroad.</p><h4>Arab Engineering Bureau is present across many different sectors. Where do you see the primary areas of opportunity for business moving forward?</h4><p>That all depends on the trends in the direction of the government's decisions. Because of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, we can already see our future projects mainly revolve around the hospitality and retail sectors. This is reflected in our current workload, as we are consistently engaged in hotel and shopping center projects. In conjunction with the World Cup, we are involved in one of the stadiums, which is a substantial project for us. When we look at our current client base, we have guided our business to an even 50-50 split in terms of numbers, but the scale of government projects is greater than that of private-sector clients. That said, we are seeing a transition in the country whereby our expectations for the future are shifting toward the private sector and we foresee this as a major opportunity for us moving forward.</p><h4>How would you assess Qatar's real estate investment climate right now?</h4><p>Investments in the real estate market are actually so good at the moment that I am worried about inflation in construction costs. Even though this may not be so obvious with the contractors in the medium-sized segment, what we have on the drawing board indicates that the  difference is significant. Fortunately the government is prepared and is focused on the prices of raw materials and the means of their acquisition. One of the most important parts of this plan was the inauguration of Hamad Port, a critical addition to the import of construction materials.</p><h4>How would you describe the importance of your domestic business here in Qatar compared to international expansion?</h4><p>Our local operation is definitely our primary activity. We have our head office here and are servicing most of the offices out of here, with the exception of Manila. Manila is a backup for Doha, so we can control the growth within Doha because both markets have similar construction risks so we need to collaborate with engineering support firms. We have invested in opening our own firms, and Manila has around 60 people servicing just the Doha office. Kuala Lumpur (KL) is independent, but we are doing good work and our involvement with the KL local market  is picking up well. </p><h4>How important is it to continue integrating traditional architecture in Qatar?</h4><p>Identity  is important, even in modern buildings; a city should have an identity, and Doha has developed in this manner where its identity is present in even its most modern buildings, while for government buildings and embassies incorporating elements of local vernacular  is a must. We should not even try anything else because the demand is that the design reflect the local architecture. However, when we work abroad in places like Dubai, it is slightly different, as the architectural identity of Dubai is in fact its modern buildings.</p><h4>What does it mean for Arab Engineering Bureau, as a preeminent Arab contracting company, to have such significant involvement here?</h4><p>We see the influx of foreign firms as a positive sign, because it means that we compete against the best even when we win most of our bids. We just won the contract for a stadium and we were the only local firm to make a bid amongst the other foreign competitors. The amount of work requires so much expertise and so many firms to work together that there is no way local firms alone can meet the demand. What this does is create a need for local firms to raise their standards to match those of the highest international competitors, which only improves what we are doing in the long run. It is extremely healthy, and it would in fact be a bad sign if no firms from all over the world were interested in our market. If they are all coming, it means that there is underlying potential for market development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since opening only a short time ago, Hamad International Airport has garnered a large amount of international recognition including three Skytrax 2015 awards, being named as the Strategic Project of the Year at the 2015 Global Projects of the Year award ceremony by CG/LA infrastructure, and being ranked #6 in the World's Best Airports by Conde Naste Traveler. How do these awards help to improve the airport's reputation?</h4><p>All awards and accolades that HIA receives reinforces its global standing as an international travel hub and five-star gateway for Qatar and the rest of the world. The airport's success, which is demonstrated by these awards, as well as our successful operations, also furthers our ambition to position HIA as a major player in the international aviation sector. </p><h4>Aside from international recognition, how would you assess the performance of HIA in terms of its KPIs? When looking at these figures, which areas are the most important to drive growth in 2016?</h4><p>At the moment, having completed just over 17 months of operations, our top priorities are to maintain our smooth and efficient operations and  ensure that our operational concepts are embedded properly. As we are the hub airport of the best airline in the world, the customer experience on the ground must match that on board Qatar Airways. Therefore, our KPIs are On Time Performance (OTP) both at arrival and departure as well as Minimum Connection Time (MCT) for both our passengers and baggage. Additionally, since we are committed to delivering a five-star service, we monitor our Airport Service Quality (ASQ) scores as well as Skytrax feedback. Growth is coming from the expanding operations of our national carrier, Qatar Airways. However, our focus for 2016 will be on capacity growth in a manner that will ensure that our twin priorities of operational efficiency and OTP and MCT are not disturbed and that our customer experience continues to be the best in class</p><h4>What will be the most immediate impact felt by passengers as a result of the New Doha International Airport (NDIA) Steering Committee airport expansion plans?</h4><p>HIA currently caters to 30 million passengers per year. Upon completion of the expansion project, this capacity will increase to 50 million passengers per year. Keeping our growth projections in mind, this expansion has been planned strategically for our capacity to keep up with our passenger growth. This means that our passengers will continue to enjoy HIA's seamless and stress free travel experience. As HIA's facility grows in size, so will the services that we will provide, which will also be something our passengers will get to experience.</p><h4>How do you think that Qatar and Hamad International Airport are redefining the air travel industry?</h4><p>HIA is one of the world's newest airports and as such has been designed, developed, and built with the very latest technology, user-experience research, and functional design approach. This combination means that HIA redefines the experience for all passengers and sets new benchmarks in airport design, as has been evidenced by the fact that it won the Skytrax 2015 Best Airport in the Middle East award at the Skytrax Airport Award Ceremony, held at the Passenger Terminal Expo 2015 in Paris in the first year of operations. HIA is not just a travel hub but offers an overall travel experience with our core focus being on passenger engagement. We redefine the passenger travel experience with high levels of investments having been made in passenger facilities and services. This makes us a world-class airport and gives us an edge over the air travel industry. HIA takes a unique and refreshing view on airport hospitality. The airport's award-winning duty free emporium with more than 70 retail shops and more than 30 restaurants is extended with the 100-room Airport Hotel and Vitality, the wellbeing and fitness center, which features two squash courts, a 25-metre swimming pool, gym, and spa. All these services and facilities are a part of the unique passenger experience that HIA offers and helps redefine the role of a modern airport. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How significant has Qatar Airways' fleet program been to the overall success of the company?</h4><p>Qatar Airways operates one of the youngest fleets in the sky, which includes the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Airbus A380 and, as the global launch customer, the Airbus A350 XWB. These aircraft offer passengers a superior cabin environment, one which reduces the symptoms of jet lag and fatigue associated with long-haul travel. By also offering Wi-Fi connectivity and the latest cabin design enhancements, passengers can choose to either create an office in the sky or relax while enjoying more than 2,000 entertainment options on our newly launched Oryx One inflight entertainment system. Having one of the world's youngest fleets, with an average aircraft age of no more than four years, also leads to lower emissions and contributes to Qatar Airways' environmental commitment and responsibility.</p><h4>What potential does the Asian market represent to Qatar Airways and what is the regional strategy going forward?</h4><p>Qatar Airways has undergone unprecedented growth in its 18 years of operation, and it is set to continue, with significant growth in Asia throughout that period. Asia is an important and strategic market for Qatar Airways and it is for this reason we chose Singapore as one of the first inaugural routes for the latest generation A350 XWB aircraft, of which Qatar Airways was the Global Launch Customer for. On June 1st, 2015, a third-daily frequency to Singapore was added, and all three Qatar Airways daily flights to Singapore all operate with the A350 WXB, increasing overall capacity on the route in 2015 by 67%. With the progressive addition of the A350 XWB and the increase in capacity, not only are more passengers able to experience our award-winning product, but they also benefit from shorter transit times for onward connecting flights to and from Europe, Africa, and the US. This is complemented by the opening last year of our new hub and home, Hamad International Airport, which enables our passengers to enjoy a comprehensive, five-star experience at the world's newest international gateway. Hamad International Airport provides a seamless, hassle-free travel experience for our passengers, from check-in and passport control right through to boarding. The opening of the new airport has also resulted in expedient, convenient transfers for connecting passengers. Hamad International Airport can connect passengers through with a minimum connection time of 45 minutes or less. The airport boasts over 600,000sqm of space, 40,000 of which are dedicated to 70 top-of-the-line retail outlets and 30 food and beverage options. Additional features include a 200-room hotel, a spa, squash courts, activity nodes, and art installations throughout the terminal.</p><h4>How has Qatar Airways played a role in achieving the government's initiative of Qatarization?</h4><p>At Qatar Airways, we understand our responsibility in playing a pivotal role to foster and nurture the talent of Qatari youth wishing to develop a career path. We also acknowledge that we need them to build upon the foundation and to develop the future of the company, which is why we have created individually tailored programs under the talent development program called Al Darb, or “The Pathway," to bring out the best in an individual, playing to their unique skills and strengths. We offer 9 different tailor-made development programs to our Qatari recruits, as well as sponsoring 23 majors.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>This will be a year of expansion with more frequencies to existing gateways and new destinations, expanding to even more opportunities for travelers. In January 2016 we will launch direct flights to Los Angeles, with further gateways to Atlanta (June) and Boston (March) added shortly after, together with upgrading our service to Philadelphia to operate with an Airbus A350 XWB, and the launch of double-daily flights with this same aircraft to New York in the spring. We know how important it is to have a network that takes our passengers to their destination as swiftly and comfortably as possible, with the best available aircraft in the skies, which is why Qatar Airways will continue to grow while not compromising on our high standards of service. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have QNBN's operations benefited Qatar?</h4><p>Network infrastructure improvements undertaken by QNBN amount to an estimated 0.023% annual contribution to GDP. Secondly, QNBN's support of operators in both the fixed and broadband rollout has helped create an environment of competition in quality and services, resulting in a direct benefit to the people of Qatar. They can now enjoy great services and offers from their choice of operator at affordable rates — something that was not available prior to QNBN. While contribution to GDP, consumer choice, improved quality, better service, open-market competition, and affordable rates are all priceless benefits for Qatar, the greatest contribution of QNBN has been in eliminating network duplication and enhancing network security systems, resulting in direct savings for the State of Qatar. </p><h4>How important is developing world-class ICT infrastructure to facilitating the overall investment climate of Qatar?</h4><p>One of the most important aspects of government income is opening the business sector prior to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. There will be a lot of companies that open their business in Qatar before 2022, and they want to see evidence of sustainability for their businesses beyond 2022. Making Qatar a hub for business after the event is extremely crucial, and is the foundation of the four pillars of Qatar National Vision 2030. A strong ICT infrastructure is as indispensable for future economic growth as roads, electricity, and water. No nation will be able to sustain economic development without a solid ICT infrastructure, which is why World Bank and ITU reference economic growth with Internet penetration and broadband KPIs. A secure network is extremely important in today's highly volatile and competitive business environment, and QNBN aims to extend this network to the government and enterprises as well. Within 2-3 years, high-speed internet connection will become the fabric of our educational institutions, healthcare, businesses, government ministries, and homes. Nobody will be able to access healthcare services without high-speed internet. Internet will become a necessity. It is inconceivable to start a business without road infrastructure, water, and electricity. Similarly, no economy will be able to flourish without reliable, secure, and affordable broadband networks. China subsidizes electricity to boost its manufacturing economy, agricultural economies depend on government's water management, and timely investment in the ICT infrastructure and broadband backbone is crucial for knowledge-based economies, as outlined by the QNV2030. We are working to improve the quality of life of our people by providing this infrastructure, and we are looking to provide this to each home in order to ensure quality of life for the future; each home should have electricity, water, and high-speed internet.</p><h4>What is the relevance of the fiber-optic team that is being formed to the overall planning?</h4><p>In light of the fiber-optic budget requirements as listed by the utilities and ministries, key subject matter experts were invited to a high-level optimization initiative where they presented the duplication of investment and cost savings opportunities to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister mandated a study to explore and finalize government requirements for fiber infrastructure, and to take the initiative to avoid the duplication and overlapping of infrastructure. I am on that team, nominated from the ICT sector to talk not only about QNBN, but also ICT infrastructure in general. The outcome of the study identified that all duplications can be avoided by dedicating the fiber optic rollout to a non-commercial state-owned company with a mandate to provide single infrastructure and related services under the specifications and security needed to avoid any inter-departmental government duplication at a better value than a commercial enterprise. Due to the criticality of the projects and high security requirements, it was recommended that QNBN provide fiber-optic secure infrastructure that is isolated from commercial traffic for the government network, as well as the networks for transportation, and the secure network needed for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and any other future events of national importance. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the major changes that the QFC has undergone in the last year?</h4><p>In 2015, the Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) celebrated 10 years of facilitating firms' success, supporting the growth of the Qatari private sector and helping to diversify the economy.  When the QFC broadened its platform in 1Q2014, it initiated a series of legal and structural enhancements to accommodate non-financial institutions within its framework. To promote the addition of these non-financial permissible activities to a wider audience, we embarked on an outreach program, which was carried out throughout 2015. This program involved participating in key industry events locally and internationally to shed light on the growing business opportunities in Qatar and explain the different options for setting up under the QFC.  Our efforts resulted in an increase of over 35% in the number of new QFC licensed companies as of October 2015. In addition to our structural enhancements, our tax department introduced a new credit for tax losses scheme, which to the best of our knowledge is a world first. This scheme allows QFC-licensed firms who launched operations after January 1, 2015 to receive cash payments for tax losses incurred in the first two accounting periods of operation. The tax credit is calculated at a rate of 8% on eligible losses and licensed firms can claim up to a cumulative maximum payment of QAR200,000. In a further move, by allowing wholly-owned Qatari companies to apply for a 0% concessionary tax rate, we have increased the appeal and benefits for local enterprises. Local companies now account for around 30% of our licensed firms.  The support the QFC gives does not however stop once an organization becomes a QFC firm. We demonstrated the QFC's strong commitment to supporting the needs of our community by establishing the Employment Standards Office (ESO) as an independent entity. The ESO ensures that both employers and employees are protected through robust regulations, codes and procedures. The ESO is also responsible for enforcing compliance with regulations, ensuring the fair treatment of employers and employees, encouraging communication between its members, facilitating dispute resolution and developing a productive QFC workforce. </p><h4>Along the same lines, what are some of the most important objectives that the QFC must reach in the coming years?</h4><p>We are seeking to build on the QFC's remarkable growth in 2015 and reap the rewards of further improvements to our platform.  Tax incentives, an improved legal framework, and enhanced client relations will drive our innovation agenda in the coming years in a bid to further cement our position as a leading destination for doing business in Qatar and the region.  As such, we believe the QFC will further integrate itself within the fabric of Qatar's economy and will continue to attract an increasing number of local and international firms by facilitating their success. </p><h4>With the GCC seen as an attractive investment destination, albeit a competitive one, what role do you think Qatar can play as a financial hub of the region?</h4><p>Qatar is recognized as a stable country with an economy that has been consistently ranked amongst the fastest-growing in the world.  While significant downside risks are building in many countries across the world amid a slump in oil prices, Qatar is expected to maintain its solid performance over the coming years thanks to its prudent economic diversification policies and the vast majority of projects are expected to continue as planned as Qatar develops its infrastructure. We have noticed that there is increased interest in other areas of investment aside from oil and gas, notably construction and transport. Qatar's real GDP growth is expected to accelerate from 6.8% in 2014 to 7.8% in 2016, driven mainly by the double-digit expansion of the country's non-hydrocarbon sector. There are a number of opportunities to benefit from these sustained growth predictions across various sectors.  Qatar has always been a gateway between East and West. Earlier this year Qatar National Bank, Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB) and Chinese brokerage Southwest Securities signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a company handling Islamic finance deals in China. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>QNB Group now has many representative offices in the world's key emerging and established markets. How will those offices help bring in more international companies to do business in Qatar?</h4><p>Currently, QNB has established representative offices in several large and high growth emerging markets, such as China, India, and Vietnam. Trade and investment flows between these countries and Qatar as well as our footprint have been growing over the past years; there are several Chinese and Indian companies operating in Qatar. Similarly, several Qatar-based multinational corporations have been growing businesses with these countries. These offices act as a conduit facilitating these flows to increase business potential for both Qatari and Middle Eastern companies planning to expand and grow their international business contribution and vice versa.</p><h4>How important is international diversification to QNB's overall growth strategy?</h4><p>International expansion is one of the cornerstones of QNB's strategy to achieve its vision of becoming a leading Middle Eastern, African, and Southeast Asian bank by 2020, and a global bank by 2030. In line with this vision, QNB will continue to expand its international network and footprint through strategic and opportunistic inorganic growth. Target markets are selected frontier and emerging markets that demonstrate favorable macro-economic growth, coupled with a growing and healthy banking sector as well as a range of available targets. When looking at growth opportunities globally, we have identified a set of markets in Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia as our focus areas for further expansion. Selected countries in those regions are fueled by ongoing improvement in business conditions, favorable demographics, and increasing globalization. Furthermore, there are significant trade and investment flows within and across these regions that QNB, as a financial intermediary, could facilitate. Growth in these regions is key to achieving QNB's goals. We believe that a wider geographical presence gained through such expansion will reduce the QNB Group's exposure to certain economic risks in the event of any economic downturn and, in turn, provide stability to its financial position</p><h4>How did recent acquisitions help QNB's international expansion strategy?</h4><p>QNB's strategy is to focus on high growth markets where QNB has a competitive advantage. Therefore, we have made acquisitions and strategic alliances in key growth markets such as Egypt, which we consider as our second home market, and our recent alliance with Ecobank, a leading pan-African bank with presence in over 36 countries across West, Central, and East Africa. This is reflected by the increasing strong performance of QNB's international operations with loan contribution rising from 19% in 2013 to 24% in 2015, deposit contribution from 37%  to 39% and net profit from 28% to 31% over the same period. In December 2015, QNB Group entered into a definitive agreement with the National Bank of Greece for the acquisition of its entire stake comprising 99.81% in Finansbank A.Åž (Finansbank) in Turkey. QNB Group expects to finalize the transaction during the first half of 2016. Finansbank is the fifth largest privately owned universal bank by total assets, customer deposits, and loans in the Turkish market. Turkey, with its significant market size, population, growth track record, strong economic and banking sector prospects, and strategic location as a gateway between Europe, Asia, and Africa, represents such a market and is, therefore, of strategic importance for QNB Group. Furthermore, QNB intends to capture a share of increasing trade and investment flows between the international footprint of Turkey and QNB. Turkey's trade with the Middle East and North Africa region has risen nearly tenfold from $5.6 billion in 2000 to $52.2 billion in 2014.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Although the global operating environment for banking and finance has been challenging, our strategic regional focus is enabling us to capture exciting opportunities. Despite the global headwinds in 2015 that have impacted African and Southeast Asian markets, there are pockets of opportunities as they continue to require investment and trade flows to support economic development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the impact that the drop in oil prices has had on the State of Qatar's energy policy?</h4><p>The State of Qatar's energy policy is dynamic and resilient, guided by the wise vision of HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Emir of the State of Qatar. Qatar has ably countered the negative impact of the low oil prices through its appropriate fiscal and monetary policies. Our resilient energy policy has intensified the usage of all applicable means for increasing efficiency of production while focusing on cost reduction and increasing the competitiveness of Qatari hydrocarbon products without sacrificing our efficiency and production. In addition, our energy policy has also focused on rationalization of the local demand for energy and reducing inefficient demand, which puts extra strain on the budget. Our long-term energy policy and our investment decisions have been well thought-out, having evolved as a part of an organic growth with the best collaborators, state-of-the-art technology, and best practices, in a clear and transparent manner</p><h4>With the US, Australia, and Iran all expected to boost natural gas production and exports in the years to come, how will this impact Qatar's natural gas production levels and what are your expectations in the mid term?</h4><p>The upcoming LNG projects in Australia and North America will add to the surplus in the market in the coming years and put pressure on prices, making it difficult to justify further investments in developing new natural gas resources. However, increase in demand for gas is more than any other fossil fuel and may even accelerate because of environmental gains. As far as Qatar is concerned, its LNG supply will continue to remain competitive and reliable, backed by its first-mover cost advantage and supported by efficient delivery mechanisms covering the entire value chain from production and processing to exporting and receiving terminals, serviced by world's largest fleet of 85 dedicated LNG carriers.</p><h4>One of the four pillars of the Qatar National Vision 2030 is to diversify the country's economy, and within this to develop the country's industrial potential. In what ways does Qatar's continued hydrocarbon production support this objective?</h4><p>Qatar has prospered by utilizing its hydrocarbon resources to sustain its prosperity over the long term by wise management of exhaustible resources to ensure that future generations inherit ample means to meet their aspirations. These resources can be leveraged to make sustainable development a reality. Converting these natural assets into financial wealth provides a means to invest in world-class infrastructure by building efficient delivery mechanisms for public services, creating a highly skilled and productive labor force, and supporting the development of entrepreneurship and innovation capabilities. These achievements would in turn provide a broader platform for the diversification of Qatar's economy and its positioning as a regional hub for knowledge and for high-value industrial and service activities.</p><h4>What specific sectors of industry are of primary importance to development?</h4><p>Qatar aims to develop a knowledge-based economy characterized by innovation, entrepreneurship, excellence in education, world-class infrastructure, and the efficient delivery of public services. For the purpose of suitable economic diversification, Qatar is looking at these sectors of the industry and services, which are of primary importance, and maintains their competitiveness through competitive advantages derived from hydrocarbon industries. I must mention that Qatar plans to enable the private sector to play an essential role in achieving sustainable development. Training and support for entrepreneurs is a basic precondition for enabling the private sector to carry out its required role. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the importance of education to the future growth of Qatar? </h4><p>Qatar is transforming into a knowledge based economy, and it had set the road map to achieve this through the National Vision 2030. Education is a key element in the national strategy as it is an important factor in realizing this transformation. The education sector has made impressive strides during the last decade, attracting world class universities and schools to open in Qatar, offering top quality educational opportunities to the residents of Qatar and the neighboring countries. As a result, we now have Qatari graduates from these top universities who are well equipped to join the work force, use their knowledge to build the nation, and help it achieve its growth objectives. <br>I firmly believe that success and growth in life cannot happen without knowledge and faith. From my own experience, the formula for success is simple: have the conviction that knowledge can make change happen. Have patience, endurance, seize opportunities, and use your knowledge and experiences in life to realize your objectives. Without education, success is unattainable. In order to encourage those graduates to succeed and strive for a better, more developed business world in their home country, we have to accommodate their visions and aspirations by integrating their ideas into our businesses. By doing so, we inspire them to grab these opportunities we create so they continue in our footsteps, building Qatar's economy and further enhancing it through their education. With education comes growth, progress, and innovation, which is what we hope the future of Qatar will be; filled with prosperity and success.</p><h4>How are Qatar's investments in education and strategy transforming the landscape of the Middle East as a whole becoming a hub for progressive thought? </h4><p>The significant development of the education sector has a hugely positive influence on the progress of the economy as a whole. Growing and developing the economy locally creates an attractive hub for worldwide investors to invest, students to study, and people to work and build careers. This results in the transformation of the whole region and makes it a pivot for education, progress, and innovation. Qatar is investing heavily in research and development and also promotes and hosts key events in the country such as the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE). WISE has been one of the key players in developing progressive, enquiring mentalities within Qatar and in changing the way Qatar is viewed around the world. Qatar Foundation Research and Development (QF R&amp;D) is another strong player in building education in the country, as well as participating in developing the community of the nation. The resulting level of international profile and exposure Qatar is achieving through these initiatives, as a hub for education and progressive thought and development, can only have a positive effect on the wider region. </p><h4>How is Qatar's overall strategy for growth changing as it approaches the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the completion of the Qatar National Vision 2030? </h4><p>Qatar had already announced its National Strategy 2030 prior to winning the World Cup. Winning the World Cup has helped to accelerate the progress. Once the Vision is delivered, a new long-term strategy will be announced, building on what we have all achieved. By 2030, Qatar will have a developed infrastructure, advanced healthcare, improved education system, and, of course, a more diversified economy geared toward innovative growth. The 2022 FIFA World Cup provides the motivation to achieve those goals sooner. Right now, this means we are focusing on building the fundamentals of a developed country by constructing commercial and residential properties, stadiums, healthcare centers, and developing all the necessities for hosting one of the biggest events in the world. After 2022, the further evolution of the country will begin. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With Qatar's five-year National Development Strategy coming to an end in 2016, what have been some of the major end results?</h4><p>While the strategy process and implementation should be seen as continuous and will stretch beyond 2016, many of the major reforms now underway were identified. These include changes in the fiscal process, efforts toward reducing subsidies and increasing efficiency, the introduction of a national health insurance scheme, infrastructure planning, and a national R&amp;D effort. Beneficial outcomes from these efforts are expected in the years ahead. One of the Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics' most remarkable achievements in 2015 was the Simplified Census of Population, Housing, and Establishments, which was conducted in cooperation with the Ministry of Municipality Urban Planning and intends to provide a proper database to carry out comparisons, projections of demographic data, and the community's social, economic, and urban characteristics. The results of this census were announced on October 20, 2015, during the celebration of World Statistics Day. That celebration was in line with the request of the UN General Assembly, which adopted October 20, 2015 as World Statistics Day under the slogan “Better Data, Better Lives,“ emphasizing the importance of statistical data as inputs in the formulation and follow-up of sustainable development strategies in order to achieve the national development goals. One of the other key achievements by MDPS was the election of the State of Qatar as a member of the Statistical Commission and the UN Commission on Population and Development to represent the Asia-Pacific Group for the 2016-19 term, which came to crown the efforts exerted by Qatar in the fields of statistics, population, and development issues, and the continuous and effective coordination between MDPS and all the concerned parties. </p><h4>How does Qatar formulate broad sweeping plans like the National Development Strategy or the Qatar National Vision 2030 in a way that global macroeconomic forces, like the recent financial crisis or drop in oil prices, do not affect the goals or outcome of these strategies?</h4><p>Of course, it is not possible to predict the future precisely, and all strategies are formulated and implemented under conditions of uncertainty. But in formulating a strategy it is important to identify risk factors and to consider how the strategy can be adapted to changing circumstances. In fact, the National Development Strategy 2011-16 advocated many of the changes that are now in process, at a time when oil prices were high. The newly drafted financial system (2015) is one example. It supports budget reforms and ensures that government spending delivers value for money. But lower oil prices have accentuated the challenges and have given even greater urgency to action, while the core of the strategy is not changed—a core that gives primacy to sustainability and ensures that prosperity today is not bought at the expense of the welfare of future generations. Also, we have taken careful note of the lessons learned from the preparation and implementation of our first National Development strategy, with the midterm review emphasizing the need to link the strategy and budget process much more closely.</p><h4>Looking forward, what challenges or obstacles do you foresee in Qatar achieving the objectives of the Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>One of the key challenges facing Qatar National Vision 2030 is to develop the second generation National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSOS), and to provide indicators required for monitoring progress in project implementation and for evaluating project outputs, thus enabling decision makers to propose and introduce necessary interventions in order to creatively achieve NDS goals. In addition, the challenges that were first identified in QNV2030 are still to be fully met. But that is expected, as they are intrinsically long-term development challenges. There are many areas where Qatar will continue to expend efforts to improve and do better—in healthcare and in education outcomes, for example. Fiscally, we need to calibrate our sights conservatively so that we will provide adequate funds for the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Ahlibank's performance?</h4><p>Overall, 2014 was an excellent year for the Bank on all fronts. In terms of performance, we have recorded strong operating and net income growth, even after allocating access provisions to protect us against future unforeseen loan losses. On the strategic level, we have completed our rebranding, major technology investments, and taken major steps to address the bank's liability structure, leading us towards early compliance with both new prudent funding and Basel III rules.</p><h4>Ahlibank recently signed its first syndicated loan, which was worth $200 million over three years. What is the significance of this deal to the overall operations of Ahlibank? </h4><p>The size of the syndicated facility was not our aim. There are several milestones that can be highlighted with this debut facility: feasibility, an improved maturity ladder with long-term funding representing 6% of our 2014 balance sheet, commitment and trust of major regional and international investors in Ahlibank, and last but not least the profile of Qatar as a haven for investment.</p><h4>How open is Ahlibank to partnering and collaborating with additional regional and international banks on similar agreements? </h4><p>Following the successful closure of an oversubscribed loan facility, we have set a benchmark for future arrangements if required, such as a syndicated loan structure, MTN, Tier I, or bilateral arrangements. We will decide what is appropriate at the right time. Our Tier I adequacy ratio is currently 16.9%.</p><h4>Fitch Ratings has recently upgraded Ahlibank's IDR and SRF from A to A+. What does this mean to Ahlibank going forward and how does this reflect the strength of Qatar's banking sector as a whole? </h4><p>The recent rating upgrade has placed Ahlibank equal to all the major banking players in Qatar. This is a true recognition of the Bank's strong position on all fronts. </p><h4>What is your expectation for the year ahead? </h4><p>The operating environment in 2015 is different than 2014 and beyond. Hydrocarbon prices have declined by 50%; therefore, we must set realistic expectations on final results. We believe in prudence and long-term sustainability against short-term gains. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate the success of the recent $4.1 billion bond issuance in September and how will this impact Qatar's financial position?</h4><p>QCB has been actively managing liquidity to ensure monetary and financial stability, and thereby to support sustainable growth. The bond issuance in September 2015 is part of that broader strategy of liquidity management. Despite this issuance, the banking system liquidity was in a primary surplus position as reflected in the sum of net Qatar Money Rate (QMR) deposits and excess reserves with QCB at QAR5.4 billion at end-September 2015. Moreover, the banks' liquid asset to liabilities continues to be stable at around 50%, while the quality of banking assets has continued to improve; the gross NPL ratio has declined to its lowest level since 2011. At the same time, reflecting the implementation of the Basel III framework since January 2014, banks remained well capitalized (capital adequacy around 15%, significantly above the current regulatory requirement of 12.5%) and profitable (return on average assets at 2%). This suggests the continued robustness of Qatar's financial sector.</p><h4>What newly enacted laws will have the most impact on the performance of the Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE)?</h4><p>Under the Strategic Plan for Financial Sector Regulation, importance is also given to the development of the QSE. In particular, attention has been given to attract foreign investment. An important achievement in this regard is the issuance of Law No. 9 increasing the foreign ownership limit to 49% for listed Qatari companies. Following the introduction of this Law, the QSE recorded high levels in traded volume and index in September 2014. The Strategic Plan also aims to maintain a conducive and investor-friendly environment. The liquidity provision scheme of 2013, together with the new rules on margin trading introduced by the Qatar Financial Markets Authority (QFMA) offer a number of advantages for the market and investors, such as increasing trading volumes and liquidity, and should help to reduce price volatility and promote confidence among investors, thereby ensuring a fair and orderly market. Such positive developments gave rise to upgrades by MSCI and S&amp;P to emerging market status in 2014.</p><h4>Considering many Qatar-based banks are expanding their operations internationally, how would you assess the strength of the Qatari banking sector and what role do you foresee Qatar-based banks having as development partners?</h4><p>The expansion of operations of Qatar-based banks internationally is in itself an indication of the increasing strength and confidence of these banks to compete with other banks in the international arena. As a regulator, QCB is ensuring that the expansion should be prudential. Limits have been fixed on the foreign currency gap. The ratio of foreign currency asset to foreign currency liability of each bank should be at a minimum of 100%. This means that short positions are not allowed, but long are allowed. More importantly, QCB has been in the forefront in implementation of Basel III requirements. The capital adequacy is being monitored at both solo and consolidated levels. The strength of the banks is also reflected in their ability to meet Basel III requirements with excess capital buffers and low levels of NPLs despite the persistence of low oil prices. Hence, the ratings of the banks continue to remain high. Qatari banks have been playing an important role in the development of the economy. They have been extending credit to both the hydrocarbon and the non-hydrocarbon sector to meet productive needs. The current high growth in credit to the private sector reflects the support they are providing to the diversification of the economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-right-side]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what elements of the company do you attribute your high growth rate?</h4><p>We have all lines here. We have the motor line, credit line, PNC, and life business. That is our biggest line followed closely by motor. Our portfolio is healthy because we have certified underwriters, and we do not have anybody who is lacking experience. For our claims, we have engineers. We need to make sure what we pay in claims is done correctly so we have engineers handle it in our motor area. We have more than $33 million in our motor portfolio. We have around seven or eight mechanical engineers in our claims department to make sure we are doing the process right. We have the support of the founder of this company, QIC, which has huge technical capabilities. This has helped the company to grow operationally.</p><h4>Do you expect your balance of offerings to change?</h4><p>It has already changed in the past two years. We have diversified and improved all of our lines. Some of the lines, like property and commercial, have increased 100%. Balancing the portfolios has been one of main objectives recently. By the end of this year, the ratios will have changed compared to last year.</p><h4>How has online insurance developed for Beema?</h4><p>We were the second insurance company in the market to offer online insurance options. We offer it in motor renewal, TPA, damage, travel insurance, and home insurance. We had sales of about $1.65 million last year just for online and in 1Q2015 our sales are already up around 37%. We are really encouraging this part of our business.</p><h4>How competitive is the Islamic insurance market in Qatar?</h4><p>We try to compete in sales, and sales are the benchmark of our strategy. We do not compete on rates but there are people who prefer to come to an Islamic institution. Our services are fast and easy to use, which is why our annual rotations is at 50% in retail and PNC, and in other lines is more than 95%. It is easy to compete in motor and retail especially and, even though a lot of people who buy cars insure them fully, the car will lose value and so insuring that part is much cheaper. Because of that, rotations are much lower, but if we look at a third party maybe we will find that it is more. There are a lot of players in the market. In QFC, there are more than 26 companies and so the only way to stand out is on the service level. Insurance is a service industry. We focus on that and make sure we deliver exactly what the customer wants.</p><h4>Takaful products are an interesting part of the market. Can you comment on how well developed Qatar's takaful market is?</h4><p>We have a sharia-compliance company that audits our products. It is hard to get its approval but we try to provide all the products that will help people living here in Qatar. The Islamic insurance market here is still growing and is not mature yet compared to Malaysia or Saudi Arabia. The awareness and need for sharia-compliant insurance is growing YoY. There was a recent report by KPMG that said that the takaful market is the future in the region.</p><h4>Looking ahead, what are the major targets and expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>We are hoping to exceed $82 million this year, and I expect that by the end of 2016 we can reach more than $100 million in contributions. There are many companies in the market and the only way to stand is out is by developing new products and ideas. One of these products we have already released this year and it has gotten a good response. And throughout the rest of the year we will introduce more products. Of course, our geography will expand within Qatar. Right now, we have three branches outside the country and we are planning to spread more throughout Qatar. We do not want to compete with the same products that other people have. We want to differentiate ourselves. If you have a product no one else has and you lead in that, you will eventually be followed and be successful. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the opportunities for Ajaj Group in the Qatar's agricultural sector?</h4><p>We began operations in the agricultural sector in 1985. We work mostly in the private sector, and we remain top rated and market leader in specialized agricultural production. We own more than 300 greenhouses surrounded by 5,000 palm trees, and produce almost 20 tons of vegetables daily. Two years ago we began focusing on flowers. We have visited many countries worldwide to develop the concept of agriculture growing in Qatar. We had 40,000sqm of greenhouses full of white roses concentrated in one place. In the Middle East, we cannot have one special production line and concentrate solely on its enhancement; we have to create a more diversified product offering and constantly adapt our production to meet the local demand of the market.</p><h4>How would you assess Qatar's opportunities in the construction sector as the country heads toward the 2022 FIFA World Cup and beyond?</h4><p>Competition in real estate will continue for the foreseeable future. There are some who claim that Qatar's real estate market is like a balloon and that inflation has begun. Based on our experience and market forecast, GDP will keep pace with inflation even after the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Many people do not remember that Qatar reached similar peak points in the past, as was the case with the 2006 Asian Games. We thought that there would be chaos in the real estate market after 2006, that there would be mass vacancies, and we would have a surplus of supply. Fortunately, that did not happen, and based on that experience we have similar our Post-2022 expectations. What is also reassuring to us is the ambitions set out in the Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV2030). This plan puts a tremendous emphasis on developing the country's human resources, and one of the predominant players in the market in this regard is Qatar Foundation (QF). QF has set its target on developing a world-class education city that will attract students from across the world. With the ambitions of QF, we see tremendous growth potential in the real estate market for projects associated along these lines. Similarly, we are still forecasting continued opportunity within the energy sector despite the recent drop in oil prices. Qatar will continue to expand its energy market and will continue exporting its natural resources despite market fluctuations. With these developments, we expect a host of energy sector projects in the near future. There will be, of course, challenges for Qatar as we approach 2022, and we are preparing for market fluctuations even beyond then. It is, in fact, likely that there will be a one-year market reset from 2022 to 2023. However, all matters considered, there is a clear direction for Qatar that has been laid out by the country's leadership in the QNV2030. As long as Ajaj Group aligns its goals and ambitions with that vision, we will achieve success.</p><h4>Which sectors have the most potential moving forward?</h4><p>We have identified two sectors as having the most potential in the near future, namely agriculture and manufacturing. On both these fronts, Qatar is facing import-related challenges. The country is importing all of its foodstuffs, leaving us vulnerable to risks in terms of food security. In the manufacturing sector, Qatari industrial and construction companies are forced to import many of essential assembly, construction, and agriculture materials at a high cost. It is therefore one of the aims and ambitions of the Qatari government to diversify the country's economy and stimulate growth in these areas. What we have seen so far is that many Qatar-based banks are beginning to finance projects in these areas. In conclusion, when I look at the current state of the economy in Qatar, I see tremendous opportunity in both fields, as they perfectly mirror the ambitions of the country as a whole. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the state of foreign investor interest in Qatar's real estate sector and how does today's macroeconomic investment climate reflect this? </h4><p>We are strongly optimistic vis-í -vis Qatar's robust real estate sector in general. High foreign investor interest is due in part to the government's decision to open up its various economic sectors to foreign participation and relax its business regulations. These decisive moves have attracted foreign investments on top of a wide range of incentives offered by the government such as subsidized or nominal rates for gas and electricity, no import duty on machinery, equipment and spare parts for industrial projects, tax exemptions on corporate tax for predetermined periods, and no export duty. Other factors that are further sustaining and driving this high foreign interest, and thus resulting in the residential and non-residential sectors' growth, include large government spending commitments, a fast-growing population, a stable business environment, increased consumer demand, continued progress on infrastructure projects, and robust private consumption. As a result, Qatar is now considered the fastest-growing construction and infrastructure market in the GCC. For example, the country is keen on investing in various infrastructure developments in main commercial areas such as Doha, a key financial hub in the Gulf, especially as we are in the middle of our preparations for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The developments in Doha, in particular, are expected to create high demand for commercial office space in the capital city. Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV2030) will result in a large growth for commercial real estate as well. Furthermore, the construction of shopping malls is on the rise due to the affluent nature of the population and a vibrant tourism sector, both of which are driving demand for modern retail facilities—particularly for luxury goods outlets. Last year, both rental and sales figures went up, driving the property market further. The local real estate sector is projected to sustain this growth momentum in 2015 and in the years to come buoyed by the country's strong economic performance.</p><h4>What elements underpin Qatar's economic diversification plans?</h4><p>Qatar's diversification plans are crucial to its long-term socio-economic development goals. According to the Qatar Economic Outlook 2014-16 Report issued by the Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics, the non-hydrocarbon sector, particularly services and construction, will significantly spur Qatar's economy on. Major ongoing government infrastructure projects, such as highways, expressways, train stations, drains and sanitation, health centers, and education facilities as well as other essential infrastructure for the 2022 FIFA World Cup will drive the construction segment. The country's sizable investment programs, rising population, and sound fiscal policy are expected to stimulate activities within the local non-hydrocarbon industry as well, thereby increasing its contributions to Qatar's gross domestic product. The QNV2030 is another key driver of long-term growth within the sector. To sustain this momentum, the private sector will also have to step up to play an even greater role in Qatar's economic diversification goals.</p><h4>What challenges does Qatar face as it looks to maintain its impressive growth?</h4><p>It is highly important to sustain Qatar's successes in various fields and look for new ways to further develop its hydrocarbon resources as well as its non-hydrocarbon sector. With a committed leadership, grand vision, and robust and mutually rewarding relationships with international partners, Qatar is well on its way to attaining environmental, economic, social, and human growth and development. The realization of the goals embedded in the QNV2030 will address challenges such as balancing modernization with the preservation of traditions, meeting the needs of today without compromising future requirements, managing growth, maintaining balance between Qataris and expatriates, and engaging in good environmental stewardship. Qatar's economic outlook will remain upbeat in the years ahead, backed by strong growth, stable inflation, and large fiscal and current account surpluses. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do you see for LNG in Thailand's future energy security?</h4><p>Today, Thailand imports LNG and LPG. LPG is used in every sector and every part of Thailand, be it households, transportation, or industrial use, and demand for LPG is increasing throughout the country, even though it's not increasing at the same rate as before. As for LNG, we import LNG and mix it with our own gas to produce electricity. This is part of our long-term electricity development plan in which we're trying to balance the portfolio so that LNG can play a bigger role in the future.</p><h4>What role does the Middle East play in terms of Thailand's efforts to secure energy independence?</h4><p>Thailand and the Middle East have a longstanding relationship. As a net importer of energy, Thailand imports much of its oil and gas from the Middle East, mostly Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE. But in terms of LNG, we mainly import from Qatar.</p><h4>Qatar is currently undergoing a major transformation in terms of trying to diversify its economy while also transitioning to renewable resources. How can Thailand and Qatar work together to develop renewable resources, and how can Thailand learn from Qatar's economy and use it as a model for energy independence?</h4><p>For the time being, Thailand and Qatar are not involved in any cooperation in terms of developing renewable energy resources. But Thailand is also committed to developing renewable energy technology, and in this regard we're probably number one in ASEAN, and in the top five in all of Asia. If Qatar were to want to undertake any partnerships or projects in renewable energy, Thailand would more than welcome the opportunity to work with it in this regard.</p><h4>What impact will Thailand's joining the ASEAN Economic Community have on the energy needs of Thailand?</h4><p>The ASEAN Economic Community is about connectivity, and Thailand is very strategically placed in the heart of the ASEAN mainland, which means we could easily connect with neighboring countries' electricity power lines and grids, and also to natural gas pipelines. This kind of connectivity mean that those resources can be optimized and that could bring these countries even closer together. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the way that the drop in oil prices has affected Qatar's economy?</h4><p>Hydrocarbon activities have a vital role in Qatar's economy, and particularly in formulating fiscal policy, as oil revenues comprise a considerable share of government revenues. Hence, one shall expect that a fall in oil prices has some direct and indirect implications on the economy. However, it's worth reminding in this regard that the Qatar government has proactively planned to deal with such possible global market conditions; hence, the dramatic fall in oil prices is not a shocking aspect, but rather has influenced the government to adopt further measures with ease. Qatar's economy has several strong market fundamentals, which can adequately contain the negative implications of falling oil prices. The government's commitment to its planned vital projects over the coming five years can be perceived as a strong fuelling source for non-hydrocarbon activities, of which trade-based activities are the most important. The nature of planned projects, where several forward and backward linkages exist with other activities across the economy, suggest that non-trade based activities will continue observing robust growth over the foreseen future. These important facts shall, in turn, maintain confidence among businesses and consumers, and send clear signals on the growth prospects of our economy. Accordingly, trade-based activates shall expect a growing demand on their products, be it commodities or services, but perhaps with a slightly slower pace than what it would be under significantly higher oil prices.</p><h4>What role do SMEs play in overall diversification?</h4><p>The fast developmental pace that Qatar's economy has witnessed over the last 10 years and the associated demographic developments have strongly fueled the rising number of SMEs. Currently they comprise almost 97% of all companies. Nevertheless, our ultimate vision is not only to see the number of SMEs rise, but, even more importantly, see their contribution to economic growth, employment, and investment develop, among other positive dimensions. To achieve this promising target, the government, through its relevant bodies, has taken and will continue considering several direct and indirect measures to motivate SMEs in the country. On the Ministry's side, a new commercial companies' law was introduced and came into effect in August of 2015. The new law entails more efficient legal rules and procedures meant for licensing new businesses. While the new law targets all types of businesses, SMEs are expected to benefit the most, as the cost and time savings associated with this new law matter the most to small-scale businesses. More importantly, the Manateq free zones area, which will expand over the coming few years together with the development of logistic areas, shall with no doubt provide considerable opportunities for SMEs. These areas can be seen not only as a promising incumbent for SMEs, but also as a potential market for SMEs country-wide through backward and forward channels.</p><h4>What business-related challenges in the Qatari economy do you foresee in the near to mid term?</h4><p>Qatari businesses need to adjust well to the increased global competition that significantly narrows market sizes for individual businesses, given the fact that most activities in Qatar operate under open-market conditions. Of course, competition is not a newly emerged challenge, but one shall expect that its severity will increase in the foreseen future in light of slowing global economic growth. Therefore, Qatari businesses need to climb up the ladder of efficiency and need to think about new innovative products.  Another possible challenge that could dampen business appetite for growth, and influence potential investors' decisions to invest, is uncertainty among the repercussions of falling oil prices and volatility. Equally important is the the lack of a better understanding of the market and its potential opportunities. The need to touch upon such a challenge will further rise over the near future, as traditional investments may not continue to be as profitable as they once were, especially in light of emerging global market circumstances. Hence, existing businesses as well as potential investors might face difficulty in accessing credit and finance as credit institutions may become more risk averse in the medium term. In this regard, as I mentioned earlier, the Ministry is conducting detailed diagnostic work to define promising sectors and activities in Qatar, and this will help potential investors to decide on the most profitable and sustainable opportunities. Moreover, economic and logistic zones shall also play a vital role in this context. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2015, there was much talk of OPEC's decision to maintain production levels, the impact this has had on prices, and the subsequent discord among some OPEC members. How would you describe the past year's developments?</h4><p>OPEC's decision to maintain production levels in 2015 despite falling prices and the imbalance in supply and demand was one taken by all OPEC Member Countries. Over the years we have seen differences of opinion between Member Countries, but we have always been able to come together and solve any disagreements. And this has made us stronger.</p><p>It is also important to recognize that falling prices have coincided with rising supplies from non-OPEC countries. Since 2008, non-OPEC supply has risen by almost 6 million barrels a day (mbpd). In contrast, OPEC's production has been fairly steady. It underlines the fact that maintaining the supply-demand balance and reaching price stability requires the cooperation of major non-OPEC producers. The current lower price environment is obviously test for all producers and investors. Lower prices mean less revenue.  And less revenue means tighter budgets. We have seen a number of projects being canceled or put on hold, rig counts have fallen dramatically, and redundancies have been made. Over the years, the oil industry has gone through a number of cycles that have required it to adapt and evolve.  The current environment is another one of these.  As with previous cycles, the industry will come through it, becoming increasingly resilient and more efficient along the way.</p><h4>Qatar has many megaprojects in the pipeline with a reported value of up to $250 billion in total. What impact do you foresee the low oil prices having on Qatar's successful completion of these projects?</h4><p>Qatar has a long history of successfully completing complex and challenging oil and gas projects, through various industry cycles. Over the decades, its commitment and investments have transformed it into one of the world's major energy hubs. Of course, the current cycle is a challenging one for every one, particularly given the levels of investment that are required in the oil and gas sector. I am sure all companies will be looking at their project portfolios and assessing the risks and opportunities, based on the present environment and the longer-term outlook. It is clear that country has a long-term vision, aligned with the objectives of Qatar's National Vision 2030, for the sustainable development of its hydrocarbon resources, both in the upstream and downstream. It also has the resources to support this vision. Home to the world's third-largest gas reserves, the country is also the fourth-largest natural gas producer.  And in terms of oil, it remains an important producer, with significant proven resources to aid further expansion.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>At OPEC, we expect to see a more balanced market in 2016 as global economic growth is expected to be higher than last year, oil demand growth continues its recent expansion, and non-OPEC supply growth drops considerably. We see the world's economy growing in 2016 by 3.2%, slightly higher than the 2.9% for 2015. And on the back of this, we expect world oil demand to increase by around 1.25 mb/d in 2016. In terms of supply, the market can expect to see a continuation of the slowing growth trend in non-OPEC supply that has been apparent in 2015. In 2014, non-OPEC supply growth was over 2 mb/d, which slowed to around 1.3 mb/d in 2015. And in 2016, we actually anticipate a decline of 700,000 b/d. It means that global demand for OPEC's crude in 2016 will be around 31.6 mb/d, an increase of around 1.8 mb/d compared with 2015. A more balanced market is essential for us all. It is essential for our industry's future.  It is essential to all those consumers around the world who rely on hydrocarbon resources for their everyday needs.  And it will be essential to the future of those currently without access to modern energy services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the Republic of Korea is already considered one of Qatar's closest energy trading partners, what non-energy sectors pose the greatest opportunity to further the collaboration between the two countries?</h4><p><span></span>Our two countries have long maintained a close relationship, especially in the areas of energy and construction. Qatar is the top gas supplier to Korea, and Korean companies have participated in 103 projects in Qatar (worth $17.8 billion) in the four decades since they first started doing business in the country in 1976. In the process, they've contributed greatly to Qatar's efforts to build infrastructure and establish the industrial base.  Thanks to the visit of Emir Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar to Korea in November 2014, the visit of President Park Geun-hye of Korea to Qatar in March 2015, and frequent exchanges between high-ranking officials, a number of MoUs have been signed to promote cooperation in diverse areas of trade and investment, industrial technology, ICT, finance, and medical care. By building on these agreements, we've gradually expanded our bilateral cooperation to other areas such as public health, education, national defense and security. Looking ahead, we can expect to see big opportunities for our two countries to partner in fields like small- and medium-scale manufacturing, ICT, smart grids, and medical care as demand for bilateral cooperation grows in the wake of Qatar's industrial diversification polices aiming at preparing for the post-oil era.</p><h4>How can the Republic of Korea's experience in diversification facilitate the diversification of the Qatari economy?</h4><p><span></span>Korea has experience in developing competitive industries in textiles, steel, automobiles, semiconductors, medical care, and ICT, to name a few, in a short period of time. What is more, Korea has been working in recent years to transition toward a creative economy that encourages convergence between manufacturing and service industries and promotes high-tech business start-ups. At the same time, Qatar is pushing forward with industrial diversification under the Qatar National Vision 2030, in a bid to move beyond its energy-dependent economic structure and realize sustainable economic growth. To this end, I understand that it is making active efforts to attract and develop new industries in manufacturing, IT, new renewable energy, and medical care. I believe that the 'creative economy' of Korea and the 'National Vision 2030' of Qatar are of the same vein, and close bilateral cooperation will contribute greatly to realizing our respective goals. In this regard, we should take advantage of the Korea-Qatar High-level Strategic Cooperation Committee to further strengthen cooperation on mutual investment, joint R&amp;D, and exchanges of young talents.</p><h4>Similarly, one of the strategic thrusts of the Qatar National Vision 2030 is to stimulate economic growth via industrial development and manufacturing. How can Korean SMEs play a role in achieving this goal?</h4><p><span></span>Korea has long focused on nurturing small and medium enterprises through R&amp;D investments and finance support. In recent years, we put more emphasis on promoting entrepreneurship. These efforts have given rise to a number of globally competitive SMEs, and technology-based start-ups. Korean SMEs specializing in renewable energy, construction and plant materials and equipment, and ICT have a strong interest in cooperation with Qatari companies. They are more interested in building joint ventures and transferring technology. To help such Korean SMEs enter the Qatari market, Qatar needs to attract investments through providing financial incentives and resolving regulatory difficulties faced by companies wanting to do business in the country. Korean SMEs' entry to Qatar will fuel the development of technology and manpower suitable for local production, and experience working in SMEs will enhance local workers' entrepreneurship. Therefore, attracting and cultivating SMEs is an essential factor in developing home-grown industries, and Korean SMEs' entry to Qatar will contribute to achieving that goal.</p><h4>How can the Republic of Korea play a role in assisting Qatar in developing peaceful nuclear power?</h4><p><span></span>Nuclear power is an indispensable source for power generation in the post-oil and new climate era. It is also a useful tool for industrial development and economic growth.  Since it first established a nuclear research institute in the 1950s, Korea has adopted nuclear reactors and power plants for both research and commercial purposes while making investments in the use of nuclear energy and development of nuclear technology. Through these efforts, it has accumulated and localized related technologies, enabling it to become self-sufficient in nuclear energy and export commercial nuclear power plants to the UAE. Korea can share the know-how it has accumulated through continuously constructing and operating nuclear power plants over the past 40 years as well as via its experience with localizing nuclear energy technology. In the short run, by implementing the MoU on nuclear cooperation that our two countries concluded in March of this year, Korea can cooperate on training personnel in the nuclear energy field and engage in technical cooperation related to nuclear reactors for research purposes. In addition, if the Qatari government decides to use nuclear energy in a commercial way, Korea can expand its cooperation with Qatar into that area as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azercell demonstrated its Express Office at Bakutel 2015. What are some of the services offered through this Express Office model?</h4><p>At the latest BakuTel event, Azercell surprised its customers and all the visitors of the international exhibition with an entirely new retail concept and approach that they will see in all company stores in the near future. The new concept of the stand allows for one to be comfortably acquainted with our products and projects, provides a handy testing environment of the innovative solutions, and offers services for digital lifestyles. At BakuTel 2015, our stand demonstrated how Azercell products can solve common customer problems. The main goal was to inspire the consumer by offering tailored solutions. Each separate space had its own style, mood, and content. Interactive displays and features were intended to make customers learn and engage in a communal experience. Interactive elements were also developed to create tools that focus on providing the best telco examples. Shortly after the pilot demonstration at BakuTel 2015, we successfully launched our first new concept Azercell Express office at the 28 May Street Baku city center. The comfortable environment and professional personnel help the customers in their choice of any products or mobile devices. Furthermore, according to our one-stop-shop concept, subscribers are able to make payments for their phone bills, use the full range of customer services, and buy a new phone or number. Azercell Telecom was the first mobile operator among CIS countries to introduce such services to its subscribers by launching the first Azercell Express office in Baku back in 2004. Constantly expanding its network and coverage, Azercell now has 15 Express Offices operating in Baku and 35 in the regions. We also have four customer service centers in Baku and six in the regions. In general, AzEx offices in Azerbaijan have reached 50 in number. In addition, Azercell provides customer centers at Asan-1, Asan-2, and Asan-3 service centers, as well as at the service centers for Taxpayers under the Ministry of Taxes. Azercell will continue to increase the number of its Express Offices in the new concept all over the country in order to provide our customers with prompt and top-quality services.</p><h4>How is Azercell looking to get involved in the Formula One Grand Prix that is coming to Baku this summer and what are your expectations for the event?</h4><p>With the utmost confidence in my company, when any local or international large-scale event is held in Azerbaijan, Azercell has provided the highest-quality mobile communication services in line with world standards. This was the case during the First European Games of 2015 held in Azerbaijan, and also during the 2012 Eurovision Song contest held in Baku. Thus, our successful experience will be expanded and strengthened during the Formula One Grand Prix as well. I believe that the Azercell network will perform the best across all areas of the Formula One event. Having a reliable and strong network is our priority and the core of our business. Azercell also continues to be the largest investor in the non-oil sector of the country. In 2015, the company invested about AZN68 million in the development of telecommunications in Azerbaijan. Azercell is also a leading company in the field of technical achievements. Currently, the company owns the first and the largest LTE (4G) network in both Azerbaijan and the region. Our internet, accessibility, and customer services will be as speedy as a Formula One car.</p><h4>With the largest market share in mobile operations for Azerbaijan, how has Azercell evolved as e-commerce and mobile applications play a larger role in the lives of Azerbaijanis?</h4><p>Today, 4.5 million people in Azerbaijan choose Azercell. We account for 48% of the local telecoms market, and we are persistent in sustaining our leadership position. According to official statistics, smartphone penetration in the country is now 30.7%. This figure is growing directly proportional to indicators such as the economic wellbeing and IT literacy among the population. Approximately 3 million people per month use mobile applications in Azerbaijan. In order to let e-commerce and mobile applications play a larger role in the lives of Azerbaijanis, everyone in the country needs easy access to mobile internet. Making high-speed mobile internet affordable for everyone is one of our major targets, as well as increasing smartphone penetration, especially in the regions. Thus, over the past year alone, Azercell has provided up to 55% discounts on internet tariffs and held a range of smartphone campaigns and bundles. Azercell already started moving from a SIM-card selling culture to a solutions providing culture, always anticipating customer needs. Azercell is the widest provider of M2M solutions among mobile operators in Azerbaijan. M2M services are popular among individual customer groups of the company. For example, tens of thousands of energy meters for the Baku Electricity Network Company use Azercell SIM cards. We provide similar services to more than 300 companies throughout the country, amounting to over 130,000 SIM-cards. I am proud to add that we will continue our innovations in this field. In addition, the Barama Innovation and Entrepreneurship center operating on the initiative of Azercell produces a number of local applications for smartphones and it is growing every day with the involvement of new developers. At Barama, we provide young specialists with all the opportunities to create and develop their technological ideas and even organize their own business. Currently, more than 200 start-ups have applied to our center, over 60 of them have been working at our office, and more than 30 have successfully launched businesses. In addition, the first locally developed M2M technologies have been produced at our Barama Center. This includes the Sumaks system, which enables the control of various daily household processes remotely, and the recently presented Avtomaks, the first local GPS navigation service based on M2M. We have always been at the forefront of M2M technologies. My favorite app, Bookmate, was presented by Azercell in 2015 and has already attained wide popularity. It allows for the access to half a million titles of literary works at any time through a mobile phone or tablet. The Bookmate app hosts more than 100 titles of Azerbaijani authors and offers classical and contemporary literature in Azerbaijani, English, Russian, and Turkish languages.</p><h4>What are some of Azercell's different social projects aimed at furthering the development of education in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>It is important to support corporate citizenship and responsible business. Azercell has always followed a distinct corporate social responsibility direction. We know that one cannot lead a healthy business without contributing to a healthy climate around it. Over the years, the company has supported a range of projects in health, education, sports, culture, and environmental protection. Education has always been one of our prioritized fields in our corporate social responsibility efforts. In addition, Azercell partners with the country's leading educational institutions and provides instrumental support through technological innovations. Above all, by focusing on the continued improvement of social welfare projects in our country, our new social responsibility strategy is designed to stimulate technological progress, develop young entrepreneurs in this sector, and utilize mobile technologies in education and in the application of innovative services. In this regard, the efforts and projects of the Barama Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center are of great value. In cooperation with the British Council, we have realized professional training for technical colleges across the country. Every year we organize extensive English language and professional media training for journalists. We pay special attention to students from Baku and the various regions of Azerbaijan. Every year, dozens of students receive honorary scholarships and get internship opportunities at Azercell. Over 1,200 students from different universities in Baku, as well as in the regions, have applied to these programs so far. The Student Bursary Program aims to provide support to successful students in their development as future specialists. This project, held under the sustainability strategy of Azercell, will help to strengthen the company's corporate social responsibility activities and contribute to the welfare of our society.</p><h4>The Parliament of Azerbaijan held successful elections in November 2015. How can this election help continue the governmental support of innovation in the ICT sector of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Governmental support is important for SMEs and also necessary for the big businesses of the country. The State Fund for the Development of Information Technologies, operating under the Ministry of Communications and High Technologies, is an important body that stimulates the ICT field and provides financial support for the expansion of scientific research. We are glad that this foundation makes the necessary efforts to attract investments that provide for the production and technological cooperation between domestic and foreign companies operating in the ICT field. Also, the organization of conferences, seminars, exhibitions, and other international and local events is valuable. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year 2016, the 20th Anniversary of Azercell?</h4><p>As the most preferred mobile operator in Azerbaijan for the last 19 years, Azercell will aim to provide superior-quality mobile communication services in the country, maintain a high level of professional customer care services, introduce the latest technologies, and ensure access to high-speed and affordable mobile internet for everyone. Experience shows that there is not a big difference in timing between the application of the newest technologies in developed countries and Azerbaijan. For example, the launch of 4G in Azerbaijan by Azercell in 2012 was far earlier than in many of developed countries. The future is in mobile internet. Thanks to this technology, a number of new solutions will emerge in everyday life that will change the way businesses are managed. Azercell will stay faithful to our strategy of bringing world-leading technologies to Azerbaijan and continue pleasing our customers in the most beneficial way in 2016.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In March 2010, Honduras and Colombia signed an FTA. Since then, how has trade between both countries developed?</h4><p>The FTA between Honduras and Colombia sets the rules for a bilateral relationship with clear and predictable trade standards between the two countries. Honduras' experience has been positive. While we still have a trade deficit with Colombia, aspects agreed in the FTA have led to an increase in imports for Colombia from Honduras as a result of the placement of new products in the Colombian market, especially in the clothing segment. Without any doubt, this trend has had a positive impact on the economy of Honduras, through the generation of jobs and attracting investment toward product placement in non-traditional markets, but with great potential. It is worth mentioning that the framework of dialogue that the FTA generates with Colombia also leads to regular assessment of its performance in order to strengthen it and improve bilateral trade. To date, it remains to define an agenda for further market access for products that do not now have preferential access. There is no doubt that the FTA has been beneficial for both parties, although Colombia has a better balance due to the size and dynamism of its economy. Honduras exported $10.5 million and imported $187.7 million, but registered a drop in sales to the country. But the two countries have increased sales, which is beneficial to both countries, as we generate growth and job creation. Our entrepreneurs should take advantage of the opportunities offered by the market in Colombia and we hope to help them find new markets in that sister country.</p><h4>In terms of security, in September 2015 Honduras and Colombia signed a unilateral agreement to fight against terrorism and organized crime. How do you expect this agreement will help progress toward achieving better safety levels?</h4><p>Indeed, on September 25, 2015, Honduras and Colombia signed the Memorandum of Understanding for the Establishment of the High Level Group on Security and Justice (GANSJ), which will be used as the primary instrument for the coordination and monitoring of actions of all legal instruments in force between Honduras and Colombia on security and justice, drugs, combating organized crime and human trafficking, and others. We certainly share with Colombia the primary notion of working together, taking advantage of best practices and exchange of experiences in the fight against insecurity through the exchange of information and coordination of actions under the agreement and the identification and implementation of best practices to strengthen the institutions responsible for security in our countries. The GANSJ's scope spreads across the political, operational, legal, and cooperative levels with a view to ensure the implementation of actions that generate legislative and procedural harmony, and effective communication channels are thereby making sure that the results achieved in the fight against insecurity are successful and with a measurable impact for the advancement of our peoples. The partnership between the two governments and coordination through GANSJ has allowed us to accurately hit criminal gangs, especially drug cartels. Honduras used to be a country widely used as a bridge for the transit of drugs from Colombia, and other neighboring countries, to Mexico and the US, and this has been greatly reduced. The US government itself has acknowledged that traces of drug flights have been reduced by over 70% and all this is possible thanks to the cooperation between our governments and their agencies. The seizure of drugs is increasing every year. At the same time, Colombia has helped us to prepare our police forces, prosecutors, and judges. We hope to continue working on it, because it is beneficial to all parties involved.</p><h4>What it is the present political and economic relationship with the government of Colombia?</h4><p>Honduras and Colombia established diplomatic relations on January 1, 1825. Since then the bilateral relationship between the two countries has been marked by strong ties of cooperation and friendship in the various regional and multilateral spheres, defining the relationship as that of strategic partners. It is important to mention the results of the active relationship, such as several legal instruments, to regulate cooperation actions (security, trade, investment, culture, education, and technology exchange), as well as common interest issues marking the international agenda. In that sense, we have a Bilateral Mechanism for Dialogue and Political Consultations created by the Memorandum of Understanding signed in Tegucigalpa on September 4, 2012. The Bilateral Mechanism provides a mechanism for consultation at the ministerial level to address political, cooperation, economic, and trade issues, as well as the updating of regulations, security issues, regional and multilateral issues, and also a bi-national mechanism at the level of Vice Chancellors responsible for reviewing commitments, who to date have met twice. The Joint Committee on Technical Cooperation, Science, Culture, Education and Sports was created under the Agreement on Technical and Scientific Cooperation signed on March 4, 1980 and the Cultural and Educational Cooperation Agreement signed on August 12, 1961. The last meeting of the Joint Committee V was on April 4, 2013 in Bogotá, at which we defined the Cooperation Program 2013-2015. Besides trade, Colombia has increased investment in Honduras. The Honduran banking and cement sectors have benefited from the arrival of new capital. We are excited about this and hope that more Colombian companies and investors can settle in the country. We guarantee legal security, as well as mechanisms to solve differences and disputes, established by the FTA. And finally, as I mentioned before, we have the GANSJ, which frames the action in the security and justice fields. The FTA reaffirms our strong bilateral relationship in all its different dimensions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Are you looking to have any more African airlines flying into Ghana?</h4><p>The construction of Terminal 3 has begun, and that means that we are expanding so that we can accommodate more airlines. We want to encourage more African airlines to come here, and we are taking the necessary steps for that. Terminal 3 will be a big boost for our tourism sector and the overall economy. The foundations are there; 34 airlines fly in and out of Ghana daily, and that is good enough. Air connectivity needs improvement in Africa, and we need good rates for African travelers, so we are working together to understand how we can achieve that to promote more tourism between our countries.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the new tax to help fund the tourism industry?</h4><p>The Tourism Development Fund (TDF) was established in 2012 by Tourism act 817 and its secretariat created eight months ago. The idea behind the TDF is to secure funding for the development of the tourism industry in Ghana. It includes seed money from the government as well as revenue from the 1% levy on tourism patrons, when they use hotels or other tourism facilities. We will also use money from the fund in other investments to raise more funds for the tourism sector and improve tourism sites, while also funding training. It will be a big relief for the tourism sector in terms of financing. It is thanks to these funds that we are able to attend international conferences to promote Ghanaian tourism. Our flagship project this year is the Efua Sutherland Children's Park in Accra. The fund is going to develop it into a state-of-the-art shopping park, which will spur international, regional, and local tourism. The fund has also purchased 10 brand new pickup vehicles for the tourism offices in Ghana.</p><h4>What are the most important tourism hubs and popular tourism sites in Ghana?</h4><p>For animal lovers, the north is the place to be, with Mole National Park. That is a great place for eco-tourism and seeing animals in their natural habitat. For lovers of forts and castles and other historical sites, central Ghana is the place to visit. For lovers of luxury vacationing, plush hotels, restaurants, and shopping, the central region, Western region, Ashanti region, and the Brong-Ahafo region are the best places to visit.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the National Tourism Development Plan that was formulated and adopted in 2013?</h4><p>That is a 15-year plan. We have short term, medium term, and long-term plans; the National Tourism Development Plan is our long-term plan. In terms of our short-term plan, we are looking at training people and improving tourism services. We trained 20,000 people in all areas last year. We expect to apply some money from the fund to train hoteliers and hotel staff as well. We are also developing our tourism as well as the Efua Sutherland Children's Park. Our biggest project in 2016 will be the Marine Drive Development Project. We want to develop that into a state of the art tourism enclave like the one in Cape Town. It will have hotels, restaurants, casinos, children's parks, and other similar facilities. We want investors to come and see what we are offering and invest in that project. The government is enabling an environment there for the private sector to thrive. If a businessman wants a portion of that land, he or she can get a title free of any litigation or hindrance, so there is a lot of potential there.</p><h4>How closely do you work with the private sector?</h4><p>We work closely with the private sector. The Ghana Tourism Federation is the umbrella organization for all Ghanaian tourism trade associations, from car rentals to hotels, pubs, and restaurants. We work closely and liaise regularly with the Ghana Tourism Federation to understand how we can help them and to solve the challenges they face in their business and throughout the industry in general.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2016?</h4><p>We want to consolidate the gains we have made thus far. We are now the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Creative Arts, so this year we are paying a lot of attention to the creative arts industry, which is relatively young in Ghana. The Ghana Tourism Authority is in charge of tourism. In terms of culture, we also have the Commission of Culture. I want to set up a Creative Art Secretariat this year. I am also looking forward to consolidating the gains we have seen in the Marine Drive Development Project. All of the technical consultations have been done, and we want to get started on that project as soon as possible.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In March 2016 the UAE hosted the Global Aerospace Summit. How would you evaluate the aviation industry and the role has Emirates Airline played in it?</h4><p>Aviation is a vital part of the increasingly globalized world economy, and it has facilitated momentous growth for international trade, tourism, and international investment, in addition to efficiently connecting people across continents. Aviation is one of the main engines driving Dubai's emergence as a global center for trade, commerce, and tourism. That is why the government created a business and regulatory environment that supports its growth by encouraging open competition through open skies policies and efficient operations. As a result, aviation and its direct, indirect, and induced outputs will account for more than 17% of Dubai's total workforce by 2020. I believe aviation and air travel has a promising future, but only if everyone involved in this sector—the industry, governments, regulators, and local communities—work together in the long-term interests of all stakeholders.</p><h4>World airline traffic has doubled every 15 years since 1975 and aircraft manufacturing along with it. Do you see aircraft manufacturing as a potential industry to develop in the UAE?</h4><p>The UAE is already a world-class aviation hub, so the sensible progression is to grow its capabilities and maximize synergies across the aerospace value chain. Mubadala is a good example of how innovation in the aerospace industry is contributing to the economy and helping to create a diversified aerospace industry across both manufacturing and services. I believe that Emiratis will greatly influence the aerospace sector, both at home and around the world, in the years to come.</p><h4>Congested airspace poses a long-term challenge. How can the burden of congested airspace be alleviated in the Middle East?</h4><p>At the moment, air traffic control is manageable but we know where the issues are as we have six international airports sharing the same airspace here in the Gulf. We are evaluating a number of air traffic management solutions. Governments in the region understand the criticality of making airspace management feasible for all, and I anticipate progress in the next two years.</p><h4>The growth of the aviation sector over the past 20 years is testament to the country's emergence as one of the world's leaders in aviation. How can the UAE maintain this edge?</h4><p>The UAE can maintain its edge because we are fortunate enough to have visionary leaders who understand that the right mix of geography, modern infrastructure, innovative products and services and most importantly, people, will help the UAE keep its edge over the competition. For example, Dubai's strategic location, at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and Asia, has been at the foundation of Emirates' success in building a global hub for travellers and cargo. We serve about one-third of the world's population within a four-hour flying radius, two-thirds of the world's population within an eight-hour flying radius, and almost 90% of the world's population with non-stop flights using the latest ultra-long range aircraft. Geography is only part of the story. A clear vision was put in place for the right infrastructure, systems, and investments needed to build a global destination. Good products will keep us ahead and will help us win new customers and loyal fans. For Emirates, this means flying modern aircraft that are efficient to operate, and ensuring we have the latest onboard features to guarantee our customers get the best value and experience. Last but not least, it's people. Recruiting and retaining the best people from around the world and bringing together the best insights and practices will continue to contribute to our success.</p><h4>What are Emirates Airline's prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>Emirates' rapid growth has reflected that of Dubai's. In 2015, we flew 51.3 million passengers on 240 aircraft. In 2020, when Dubai hosts the World Expo, we expect to be flying 70 million passengers on about 300 aircraft. We will receive 37 new aircraft this year, and will also retire 26 older aircraft to keep our fleet young, modern, and efficient. We will launch services to more new cities including Yinchuan and Zhengzhou in China, Cebu and Clark in the Philippines, Yangon, Myanmar, and Hanoi in Vietnam. There will be more developments, so watch this space. We believe there is still great potential for the airline—and Dubai—to grow even further. For Emirates, one of the keys to unlocking that potential will be the new Al Maktoum International airport (DWC). The new airport at DWC will not only feature the latest technologies for a better passenger experience, but also open up much needed capacity to accommodate the expansion of our fleet and operations. As always, we will remain focused on growth, and take advantage of opportunities that work for the business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the outcomes from your recent meeting with Thai Prime Minister Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha?</h4><p>I am pleased to have met Prime Minister Prayut, as well as my counterpart Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Gen. Prawit Wongsuwon at my last visit to Thailand in November 2015. These were meetings between old friends—PM Prayuthad attended Singapore's 50th National Day Parade celebrations in August 2015, as well as Singapore's founder father Mr. Lee Kuan Yew's funeral service in March 2015. Besides thanking Thailand for their friendship, another objective for my visit was also to reaffirm the excellent bilateral relationship between both countries. Defence is a key pillar of this bilateral relationship. We value our defence relations with Thailand. We have a long history of military exercises and joint training together, between armies, navies, and air forces. We agreed that both countries share the same desire to further strengthen our defence relationship so as to foster mutual understanding and interoperability between both armed forces. Singapore sees Thailand as a critical and valuable player in ASEAN for peace and stability in the region. I discussed regional and international security developments with PM Prayut and DPM Prawit, where we agreed on the need for open, inclusive, and robust regional security architecture. As fellow members of ASEAN, we share similar perspectives on the security issues confronting our region. Terrorism is one common transnational threat that both countries face, and one that necessitates cooperation from our key partners in the region. When I spoke to PM Prayut, DPM Prawit and the senior military leadership, we all agreed that no one country has the resources to address these threats alone. Instead, it is important for countries to undertake practical cooperative activities that will build mutual trust and confidence, as well as enhance our capabilities to address these threats. I am glad that Thailand has pledged assets and troops to the upcoming ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM)-Plus Maritime Security &amp; Counter-terrorism Exercise that will be held in May 2016.</p><h4>How would you assess the bilateral defence relationship between Singapore and Thailand?</h4><p>Defence relations between Singapore and Thailand are close and long standing. This is reflected in the frequent exchange of high-level visits, as well as military exercises and professional interactions across all three Services. Most recently, our air forces concluded the trilateral exercise, <em>Ex Cope Tiger</em>, with the US in March 2016, and both armies conducted <em>Ex Kocha Singa</em> in February 2016. We also work together at multilateral events like the ADMM, ADMM-Plus, and the Shangri-la Dialogue (SLD).</p><h4>What are your expectations for bilateral defence ties between Thailand and Singapore in the year ahead?</h4><p>Just last year we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. We have a very good defence relationship, which I am confident will continue. In addition, we are always striving to do more to strengthen the relationship and people-to-people ties of both armed forces. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for Thailand's strong support for the SAF's training in Thailand for many years. I am also very appreciative of Thailand's strong support for Singapore-hosted multilateral events like Singapore Airshow and SLD, and I hope Thailand would continue this for SLD16, which will celebrate its 15th anniversary.</p><h4>In your view, what impact will the opening of the ASEAN Economic Community have on defence cooperation and regional security?</h4><p>The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) aims to build closer economic ties amongst the 10 ASEAN member states. This complements the existing efforts made by the defence establishments—under the ADMM framework—to foster greater trust and mutual understanding in the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is the aerospace industry for Mexico right now?</h4><p>The aerospace industry in Mexico has a short history as an organized sector. Even though there are manufacturing facilities that have been here for almost 30 years, the industry has only been actively pushed in the last 11 years. Today it has become an important addition to the Mexican economy, to the point where at the closing of 2014, we had exports of $6.4 billion, over 43,000 employees, and 300 manufacturing and operation sites across the country divided between various companies. There are manufacturing facilities in 18 Mexican states.</p><h4>What has driven the sudden growth and dynamism in the aerospace industry over the last several years?</h4><p>Our growth is a combination of several factors. Firstly, Mexico has become successful and accomplished in advanced manufacturing related to the automotive industry. Once the rest of the sectors that require advanced manufacturing took note of Mexico's capabilities in this field, they understood that it makes sense to be here. Another reason is that Mexican labor is very anxious to learn and adapt to new technologies and processes. There are hundreds of manufacturing facilities in different industries all over Mexico, and they are among the most productive and efficient facilities in the world. Being in NAFTA and neighboring the US, we have the biggest economy and aerospace industry in the world on our doorstep. The whole industry operates and trades in dollars, so the exchange rate is also an advantage for us. There was a big push eight or nine years ago when we saw a huge exchange rate difference between the euro and dollar. That was good timing for European firms to look into manufacturing in Mexico.</p><h4>Mexico's “Pro Aereo" plan aims to put Mexico among the world's top 10 aerospace countries with 110,000 employees and $12 billion in exports by 2020. What has to be done to achieve this?</h4><p>We have three main strategies that we are following based to meet ProAereo's goals. Firstly, we need to develop the right supply chain with the right processes. Even though our industry is growing fast and efficiently, we are still missing key processes that are required in the supply chain. Secondly, we have to develop human capital with the capabilities to take the industry forward. The Mexican employee is eager to learn new processes and technologies, but we still need to work on quality culture and security culture. Thirdly, we need to promote our country and our industry together with the new policies that we are pursuing hand in hand with the government. </p><h4>Is Mexico's current educational system equipped to meet the needs of the aerospace industry?</h4><p>We are defining the educational needs that meet what is required on the manufacturing floor. Our organization passes this information on to the Mexican Aerospace Education Council (COMEA), which was formed by the biggest colleges and universities in Mexico, together with the Secretaries of Education and Economy and the other aerospace players here. The aim is that COMEA meets these developing needs in the Mexican aerospace education. One thing that we have noticed is that we do not require as many aerospace or aeronautical engineers as we expected. There is a greater need for technicians who are capable of having those facilities up and running efficiently. The task is to convince young graduates and students that working in the aerospace industry is an attractive career path and a good investment in their own futures.</p><h4>You are also the Director of HEMAQ. How did that company get involved in the aerospace sector?</h4><p>We started back in 1988 as an organization founded to provide high technology for machining components. We were different at the time from other companies in our field, because we did everything locally. The end user of that technology was going to be a Mexican, so we really provided the service they needed and set up the right kind of relationship with our clients that was in the best interests of the Mexican end user. We got involved with an interesting project that required precise machining technology for special alloy materials, an area in which Mexico had little experience. We were lucky to be contacted by a large builder of turbines, and we decided to get involved in this field. The project ended up being much more productive in Mexico than it had been previously and was completed in record time.</p><h4>How much of your client base is now from the aerospace sector?</h4><p>In terms of numbers, it is small, because aerospace is not a volume issue—it is a high value- added field. These are complex machines with intricate parts that have to withstand extreme conditions and provide sophisticated features and functions. In terms of percentage of revenues, aerospace projects bring in a lot more for us than other projects.</p><h4>How have you adapted to provide those kinds of services in the aerospace industry?</h4><p>We have been ISO certified for many years, and as soon as we decided to enter the aerospace industry, we also added AS certification in order to understand the needs of our customers ahead of time. ISO is a more generic certification, as it certifies a company's internal quality system, and AS is specific to aerospace. We had to learn a whole new language and quality culture with the aerospace certifications, but it has certainly paid off over the past 12 years.</p><h4>Do you see aerospace as the biggest growth area for you in the future?</h4><p>Both aerospace and automotive will be our biggest growth areas. Aerospace will be more challenging, perhaps, but it will also be more satisfying and exciting. Automotive, however, will continue to make up the biggest volume of our work.</p><h4>What are your goals for the next few years for HEMAQ?</h4><p>We want to continue to be number one in Mexico, and we are set to begin our strategic plan for next year. We believe we understand all the market needs, but the needs keep changing. It is a challenge to understand customer needs, and that is why we began offering a special support program. Five years ago, we improved our services with our Atención Plus Garantizada program, which is guaranteed service support. As part of this, we are committed to being by the customer's side within 24 hours, anywhere in the country. If we cannot meet that commitment, the customer does not pay for the support. For example, an automotive assembly line breakdown for any one of our customers costs them $30,000 for every 15 minutes of downtime. Time is of the essence, and they need to be back up and running immediately. We have prepared ourselves to be ready to meet not only our customers' needs, but also our customers' customers' needs, and we are ready to be there as soon as possible to take care of those needs with our Atención Plus Garantizada program.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your business advanced over the last year?</h4><p>There was a major correction in the telecoms market last year and rates were cut across the board, which created a little panic midway through the year. But, while everyone else was correcting 5-10% on average, we hit 4% at most and then corrected. We have a long-standing relationship with our dealers, a strong brand, and we have grown in terms of technology. We consider last year to have been our year of innovation. Among our new programs is an augmented reality (AR) program that is about to give birth to a Counterstrike-type game, using and commercializing points. The points you earn using Tune Talk products are commoditized, and they can be used to buy a coffee or at McDonalds. AR will become increasingly prevalent in mobile devices, so we're preparing for that. We are also working on a linear TV station, called CrapTV. We think linear TV will never go out of fashion, which is why we are still focusing on that instead of video on demand. We are a small outfit, so to carry 1.5 million subscribers has to result in some internal structuring that best utilizes our resources and time. Furthermore, we are the dominant sponsor of the Paralympic contingent and we want to have an impact on the Para-games in Malaysia. We believe in building communities and Tune Talk has successfully created a community based on both music and MMA, with which we are in our fourth year of cooperation. It's been a successful year overall and the group has been growing firmly with incredible numbers. Tune Hotels and Tune Protect are going from strength to strength as well.</p><h4>How do you horizontally integrate different services under the Tune umbrella?</h4><p>If you are booking a flight with AirAsia, you get a personal ID. Across the group, wherever you use services, you accumulate points under that ID. You can use those points for the redemption of flights, at hotels, or use it online to buy apps. It pays off if you stay loyal to Tune Group. This is a competitive field, so we decided that instead of going for the numbers, we wanted to go for quality and depth, building communities where we evoke emotional responses and associations.</p><h4>Tune Talk has managed to capture a user base of 1.5 million. How do you attract and retain customers in a crowded and highly competitive market?</h4><p>We were targeting the young market and young male adolescents in general, because they are usually the technocrats in the family. The son is the one saying the Samsung Galaxy VI will be the next best thing, whereas the rest of the family generally follows suit. So we target them, and that's where our video gaming comes in, because it appeals to them. The son makes the mobile technology decisions for the whole family, because he's the one interested in the technicalities of it all. That's why we are male oriented, even though 56% of smartphone users are women. We have aligned ourselves in a way that touches on these trends and the cultural, social characteristics of Malaysia, and it worked well for us. You have to be brave in your decisions, you have to be astute, you have to read the market and trends, and you have to be ready to take risks, because it is a risky business after all.</p><h4>You have launched something called 8G. What is the technology behind that and how does it work?</h4><p>We wanted to raise eyebrows and that's what is behind the name, which I admit is very bold. When we launched CrapTV, we needed a platform that could support it and amalgamate everything through it. We incubated the most powerful piece of technology I have ever seen. It's like running out of highway and becoming a hovercraft. It's system agnostic in that it can work with anything, 3G, 4G, CTE-A, and so on. The machine is in the cloud, and it is truly groundbreaking. We even had it patented in Japan, which is the toughest patenting office in the world. It will be a potential sea change and so we pushed it forward to offer people the experience of 8G. Instead of dividing and fractioning bandwidth into smaller and smaller chunks as users grow, 8G does not compromise on speed and power, by maximizing the efficiency of spectrum use. The robustness of multiple networks working together is unbeatable, providing an extraordinary experience. You can do a lot of things at once. Essentially, it is 4G plus 4G, but 8G raises eyebrows. An economy's true infrastructure is in how you handle the spectrum, rather than roads and bridges.</p><h4>Last year you announced you were considering international expansion, starting with Thailand. How are these plans developing?</h4><p>A lot of this came during the time of the development of the 8G project, which is probably the best way to get into other markets and countries without having to go through the whole rigmarole of licensing and compliancy issues that a lot of countries have. Many people don't quite understand how to handle the MVNOs. They're suspicious that they can be cannibalized. The role of the MVNO is to serve their potential customers better. When we were negotiating years ago, we talked to everyone, including Maxis and Digi, but neither were suited at the time. So we went with Celcom, which trail blazed the MVNO market. Thailand is also in a constant state of flux, with large consulting firms advising the authorities in Thailand on addressing MVNOs, which basically aims at heavily monetizing them to make them pay for a network that was built for customers that don't exist yet. You cannot change these markets overnight and you have to wait for the quiet opportunities that others don't see immediately. The compliance and regulatory frameworks have to challenged and set up accordingly. Right now, Iran is looking very interesting and we are negotiating to move in there.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>This will be an interesting year because of the new application launches. AR is growing, which is a data-intensive service. We anticipate that more consumers will use it on mobile devices, with larger data packages as a result. Tune Talk will be the first mobile provider delivering fiber-like speeds with an unchallenged robustness.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Mecca Metro Project progressed since its initiation?</h4><p>The first phase of the metro project includes lines B and C, followed by line A and D. We have a 10-year program to finish the whole package. During the first phase, 122km of rail will be built, and on completion will reach a final length of 182km with a total of 88 stations. At present the schedule for the completion of the overall project is set for 2029. Our plan is that the first 40km for lines B and C will be completed by 2020. We are already in the last stage of procurement and the consortium and contractors are ready. We should be able to commence work by 1Q2016, and by 2019 we should be at the testing or almost operating stage. One of the benefits of the Metro Project is to ease the problem of traffic congestion, which currently causes a lot of lost time for the public. Other objectives are to reduce pollution, along with creating job opportunities. The project is expected to have a 2.2 benefit to cost ratio for investors, which is very high compared with other similar projects, based on a study conducted by Ernst &amp; Young.</p><h4>Where does the project stand in terms of governmental financing?</h4><p>There has been an absence of public transport in Saudi Arabia for the last two decades. In the late 1970s the first public transportation company, the Saudi Public Transport Co. (SAPTCO), was set up in Riyadh and was run by the government. Public transportation is something that must be subsidized—it is not a profitable business. When the government subsidy disappeared about 20 years ago, public transportation service declined. For example, there is still no local SAPTCO service in Mecca. Our current public transport project was started under the auspices of Al-Balad Al-Ameen, which is a private-sector company owned by the municipality. Before the start of project, the government had already invested about $2 billion in the Mashaaer metro system, an asset owned by the government. Therefore, we, along with the government's company, entrusted that asset to the private sector and designed and executed the first phase of the metro network in Mecca. In mid-2012, when oil prices were increasing, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud approved the development of the rapid transit system in Riyadh and in the same decree he stated that all cities in Saudi Arabia could benefit from this program. Therefore, Mecca city applied with the consent of our local authority and the Ministries of Finance and Transport, and we received approval in 4Q2012 to start our program backed by the government's financial guarantee. This enabled us to put aside our initial plan to proceed as a PPP project, and instead decided that this would be a turnkey project.</p><h4>What is the private sector's involvement in this project and what is the status of the awarding of contracts?</h4><p>As we have the government's decree that it will provide full financial support, the only involvement by the private sector now is contractual. There are various contracts; for example, Parsons Brinckerhoff won the project management office (PMO) contract. There are other contracts in the pipeline and about 10 contracts are yet to be awarded to the private sector, including two in civil works, one for rolling stock, and one in electromechanics. The bidding is already finished and we have nominated the successful companies and consortium. We hope to announce these contracts in 1Q2016 once we receive central government approval.</p><h4>Visitor numbers in Mecca are increasing rapidly. What levels do you expect going forward?</h4><p>In 2015 we had six million overseas visitors for Umrah and about three million for the Hajj. We also had about 12 million visitors from inside Saudi Arabia. So the total is around 20-21 million visitors. In 2016, the government is going to introduce a different approach. The number of Umrah visitors will be increased because now most of the infrastructure in Mecca can accommodate up to about 30 million. This means that from 2016 the real number of visitors from outside the Kingdom will increase by 50%. This is the government's target. The city is ready, but the number of visitors we receive depends on the economic situation in other countries around the Islamic world, where our visitors come from. For example, Indonesia is one of the most important origins of pilgrims and is in a good economic situation, but if that changed it would affect visitor numbers.</p><h4>What are the highlights of other ongoing large projects in Mecca in the real estate and construction sector?</h4><p>In the real estate sector we have various megaprojects underway to improve the informal settlement areas. There are about 55 such areas remaining in Mecca, where sanitation conditions need to be improved. Some of these areas are only 400m from the Holy Mosque and the value of the land there is very high. We have started to develop these areas with the first four projects hopefully commencing in 2016. Some 10 such areas have already been cleared to start a project called King Abdul Aziz Road. This is a 4km stretch of road being built by the private sector. Other opportunities are in the services sector because our visitor numbers are set to double over the next few years. This number may even be tripled or quadrupled in five years, potentially to 25 million visitors. This will require a lot of services in catering, guiding and tours, hotels, and private transportation. All of these services will be booming and they should be provided 100% by businesses in the private sector. The government should only be involved in granting the required licenses and visas for these activities.</p><h4>What plans and new regulations do you aim to implement to enable Mecca's transition into a smart city?</h4><p>Our vision for Mecca is to become a smart and green environment and one of the most livable cities in the world by 2025. It is a very challenging program. We started the process for a project to build the first 400MW solar energy plant here. We completed the bidding process and the winning contractor was ACWA Power. However, with decreasing oil prices this project has been postponed. The drive for renewable energy will be re-launched through the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy. Furthermore, Mecca is one of the few cities that could start this process again economically. One of the problems up until now has been with the Saudi Electricity Company because it has not yet introduced smart meters. Between 2016 and 2018 it plans to switch around three million houses in Saudi Arabia to smart meters. The benefit is that if energy is generated from solar panels, wind power, or any other home source, this goes into the power network and the household is compensated for it. This will encourage people to use renewable energy sources.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for Mecca in 2016?</h4><p>We are working to complete the road network in Mecca. We started a huge program in 2013 to complete the city's four ring roads. By 2016, 80% of this program will be finished and we will start on a new access road that will take people direct from Jeddah to Haram and from Medina to Haram. That will commence in 2016. We also hope that the first signs of Mecca's transformation to a smart, green city will be evident by 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What human resource challenges are specifically related to operating in Mozambique?</h4><p>Our HR policies and practices are some of the most strategic elements of our business model. Our human capital is taken very seriously, especially now that Hollard, as a group, has a more formal  African strategy. In general, the vision that Hollard Moçambique is managed by Mozambican nationals is extremely important to us. We strive to implement succession planning for all roles, but specifically management roles. However, the challenge in Africa and specifically in Mozambique is finding skilled personnel. Adding to the mix is the uniqueness of Mozambique as an investment destination compared to Anglophone destinations such as Zambia, Namibia, Botswana, or Ghana from a Hollard group point of view. All of these are the challenges from an HR perspective but ultimately our long-term goal is indigenization and sustainability. We have earmarked key individuals but invariably everybody is looking for the same individuals. Corporates in the market are always on the look out for qualified individuals and usually source from the finance sector. You just need to speak to management from consulting firms, banks, and insurance companies to realize that everybody is feeding from the same small pool.</p><h4>What role does R&amp;D play at Hollard?</h4><p>The Hollard group is quite unique. I like to think of us as the Google of the insurance industry. For the last 30 years our group has purposefully embarked and developed alternative models and routes to market compared to the traditional way of doing insurance. To put it in a broad sense, two decades ago Hollard was a pioneer in taking the concept of partnerships to another level, recognizing that technical expertise in the insurance industry had shifted to the distribution intermediaries, such as brokers and agents. These were the institutions that harbored the technical experts in their field and in a broad sense owned and controlled the market. Hollard cleverly went into risk-sharing partnerships with some of the best of these institutions, underpinned by a strong philosophy that partnerships were done with like-minded individuals and institutions that understood the concept of win-win-win. On the back of this model, specialized and niche specialty underwriters were formed, creating a broad range of different risk solutions under professional owner management and specific distribution models. I always say that the Mozambican insurance market is an emerging market that, from a developmental perspective, is some 20 to 25 years behind the South African market. We at Hollard Mozambique have a rich bank of resources to call on and leverage to cater to a new, emerging market. The group in South Africa does not look at Hollard Mozambique as a branch, but rather as an independent company sharing the same brand, which we can work to leverage. We have a significant advantage mainly due to our huge pool of experience in so many different environments and specialized distribution channels for insurance, from funeral and group life to legal coverage, engineering risks, and pet insurance. We have the expertise; our biggest challenge is to translate what we already know as a solution that fits the Mozambican needs.</p><h4>Looking forward to 2016, what are your expectations for the local insurance industry, and Hollard's role within the sector?</h4><p>I'm afraid that at this stage we are like most industries, waiting for the so-called megaprojects to come online, and the downstream effect that will result. As a company in this environment we are obviously conscience of consolidation and efficiencies in a difficult period. Like most African regions we have foreign exchange challenges driven by a very strong dollar and low commodity prices worldwide. To a certain extent I think it is fair to say that our understanding is that this has been one of the factors that has caused the delay in the megaprojects. We also need to consider that in the last five years the Ministry of Finance has awarded another 10 insurance licenses. Given the reality of a small emerging market, the challenge is that it is just not big enough to sustain some  shareholder investment expectations. The danger is that smaller companies are going to battle to get into the market and resort to buying market share at drastically reduced rates. At the same time, I am concerned about who will overview the necessary checks and balances to make sure that the right securities are in place to take on the risks of soft pricing. We are in an interesting phase of development under difficult macro-economic circumstances. Our responsibility as one of the top four insurance companies is to assist in positively influencing and educating all stakeholders in the Mozambican market. The future will be interesting, and 2016 will sort out a few things, particularly the manner in which we distribute and how and where the market will grow. The local insurance companies need to watch and follow certain key areas of change. The ones that are able to define and present solutions for the changing Mozambican market will be able to reap the rewards of success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the bank managed to achieve such strong credit ratings?</h4><p>The primary aspect is that our credit rating reflects three core elements that are important. The first is that we are part of Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi itself is AA rated. That is an excellent backdrop to have, particular versus many other places in the region. Abu Dhabi has a strong balance sheet, a strong liquidity position, huge reserves, and a sustainable domestic oil industry; therefore, you can understand why the rating agencies have rated it this way. I am sure that if you took out the conflict aspect of the Middle East that it would be AAA. The Western rating agencies fear that risk. The second is that we have a strong capital base with a business model that we have built and are transforming further. We pay a healthy dividend but always ensure that our capital strength remains—our governance, business model, and dividend policy are all about making sure that our capital position, at all times, remains strong. The rating agencies like that. Meanwhile, people want to buy our tier one paper, which is currently trading at about 102, demonstrating the demand in the market. Rating agencies want people to have access to capital, be conservative relative to dividend policies, and own a business model and government structure that ensures that capital is always maintained. Then, finally, is our liquidity. We have a strong liquidity, even in global terms. It is interesting that Standard &amp; Poor's was so positive about our liquidity position in the sense that oil prices are down and banks are affected; however, we have been able to build liquidity offshore and that has broadened our pool of depositors and liquidity providers. We run an extremely safe stress test ratio and extremely conservative loan-to-deposit ratios versus the global marketplace, which I believe is the third primary reason.</p><h4>How do you expect the bank to develop to enhance market efficiency in terms of securities lending and borrowing?</h4><p>A key area in the capital market space that we are developing is debt capital markets and sukuks. In some regards, sukuks are much more of a global phenomenon, not just in Saudi, Malaysia, or Indonesia. And we want to be a leader in developing a true global sukuk marketplace, which is over-the-counter based and has opened up avenues of investors. The great thing about sukuks is that Islamic investors and Western investor types both invest in them. Hence, the opportunity for this marketplace is enormous. We feel that Islamic finance is a growth industry, but it is starved of being able to access debt instruments through the marketplace, and our job, on a sukuk basis, is to develop that and, within that, we want Abu Dhabi and the UAE at large to be a significant player. We see the significant players as Hong Kong, the UAE, the UK, and Malaysia to an extent. Our job is to develop that. In terms of Western-style bonds, we want to develop capital markets with credit. Here, we want to develop the financial center of Abu Dhabi to be able to also participate in African debt capital markets, South Asian debt capital markets, and so on.</p><h4>What is behind the decline in the percentage of non-performing loans?</h4><p>We have been through a really purple patch. Up until 2014, we had high growth, good oil prices, and lots of investment. The post-2008 positioning involved a lot of restructuring and many improvements were made. I believe the effects of 2008, globally, will be with the world for another 15 years at least. I am not suggesting that the rehabilitation after 2008 has finished here in the UAE. We are getting knocked around by the oil prices, and you would expect nothing less. It is a good thing in some regards because it will force us to look more to the diversification that we have attempted as a country and have actually executed very well. Therefore, continuing to find value we can create in the global world, we have done it with transport, tourism, logistics, and so on, but there are other areas that have to develop, such as financial services. The reality is that I would expect the operating environment for banks to be tougher in the coming years than it was in previous years. That environment will cause some economic realignment, which will hurt some people and benefit greatly some others. That realignment will affect the banking industry. Our strategy has worked well. We are only two years into our first five-year plan to transform the bank. But, it has been good the way that the bank has started to build its international business. We have had a few years of hard work and customers want to work with us. We are starting to see the benefits of that. We are driving mortgages with dirham payroll in Egypt, which is putting two countries together and providing a retail solution. You would not have seen that five years ago in a UAE bank. It is not just the wholesale side, but retail as well.</p><h4>What is the bank's involvement in developing SMEs?</h4><p>First of all, we have totally rebuilt our commercial banking proposition. Some SMEs will always say they need more funds. The reality is that some need it, others do not. Across the world, in terms of the ratio of deposits to loans from SMEs, deposits are larger. SMEs as a segment globally are liquid and progressive. Sometimes, it's not loans they need, but great banking services so they get paid on time, don't get ripped off, and remittances are quickly made and credited. They might need two- or three-day support. However, inherently, SMEs are not huge suckers of capital, which surprises people. We are trying to build a business around those and improve our services and value proposition, which allows SMEs to access foreign exchange at competitive rates and get it quickly through electronic delivery, as well as allowing them to trade across the region. All of those things are what we are trying to provide, in addition to some loans. The second thing we are trying to do with the academy is to help SMEs get the skill sets to run a business successfully and understand cash flows and problems, to help educate them in allowing their businesses to continue to be successful, or even progress into something far grander. The academy is exactly about scaling up. We need to move the SME debate from just lending to a banking service, with good prices to help SMEs succeed. I am a huge believer that Asia was built around SMEs, some of which became some of the great industrial conglomerates that we see today. In my view, SMEs are critical for the success of Europe. In the UK, they employ 45% of the people. If you look at Dubai and Abu Dhabi, what drives so much of it is the SME segment. It is an attractive sector for banks, but you have to do it the right way. You have to create some scale and you have to create the right value proposition and the right business model to respond to that. That is what we have done, we believe. It is an attractive sector, of course, and it will continue to be so. In many regards, it is probably the most attractive sector in the long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>A number of legal developments emerged in 2015 in Saudi Arabia, particularly interest from a FDI sources. How would you assess the regulatory environment for business in the Kingdom?</h4><p>The Kingdom is home to one of the world's most progressive regulatory environments for doing business. All sectors are open except for those related to national security. We allow 100% foreign ownership in most sectors, with no income, sales, or property taxes. Companies can enjoy a competitive corporate tax rate and the full repatriation of profits, capital, and dividends. The government is committed to maintaining this, as well as introducing new initiatives to support the Kingdom's business-friendly environment. Most recently, we have announced that retailers and wholesalers will be able to own 100% of their business in Saudi Arabia. With other national programs to make our economy more competitive on the horizon, I anticipate that this trend of increasing the ease of doing business in the Kingdom will continue.</p><h4>One of SAGIA's objectives is to encourage the role of the private sector by reducing bureaucracy. What are the sectors that offer the best opportunities to local and global investors?</h4><p>Due to Saudi Arabia's demographics and its unique location on the map, almost all sectors are open for business and have great opportunities for both local and international investors to enjoy. The Kingdom has a population of approximately 31 million with significant purchasing power. It is also has a young population, with 70% under the age of 30. In many currently developing sectors, investors have the chance to gain significant domestic market share before their competitors can. Using the Kingdom as their launch pad, investors and companies can expand their reach. Riyadh is a two-hour flight from 150 million people, and a four-hour flight from a total of 1.5 billion people in some of the world's fastest growing consumer markets. With these facts in mind, there is a clear and lucrative export opportunity for established companies in Saudi Arabia. As part of our economic diversification strategy, however, there are a number of priority sectors in which we are focusing on attracting investments through leveraging spending. This integrates the value chain and increases the competitiveness of the Kingdom's sectors. Under the National Investment Plan (NIP), we have worked with a number of government ministries to harness their yearly spending. With each, we have created, or are creating, investment plans that identify investment opportunities vis-í -vis annual ministerial procurement practices. These opportunities are worth hundreds of billions of dollars. For example, in the transportation and healthcare sectors alone we have investments worth approximately $400 billion for the coming decade. You can also expect to see similar opportunities in industrial spare parts, downstream chemicals, ICT, and much more. To enjoy these opportunities, we are inviting foreign and local companies to make direct investments in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What are the main guidelines of SAGIA's plan to increase competitiveness in specific sectors?</h4><p>I believe it is important for SAGIA and Saudi Arabia to have a positive reciprocal relationship with our local and international investors. For those investors who want to help us add value to the Saudi economy, we want to help them add value to their business here in the Kingdom. As part of the RFP process in government entities for megaprojects, we are advocating that companies submit localization plans as part of their proposals. These plans will be taken into close consideration when evaluating the overall strength of each proposal. Ultimately, we believe this approach is the right one and that it will be mutually beneficial for all parties involved. For investors in particular, the immediate financial benefit of many investment opportunities is only the beginning of the overall value present. The transportation sector illustrates this. Many of its investment projects are developing a single set of manufacturing standards that will be used henceforth. The Jeddah and Mecca metro project is an example of where this “common envelope" has been found. These same specifications will be used in all Saudi metro projects moving forward. We are taking this approach for other investment projects where appropriate. The company that decides to invest early on will be the first in line to enjoy a steady stream of business from subsequent projects using the same standards for years to come.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia has been ranked as the Middle East and Africa region's largest FDI magnet, attracting 75 ventures by the end of 2014. What is SAGIA doing to continue delivering inviting investment?</h4><p>Much of what we have done in recent years has focused on making sure that companies enjoy a seamless process when investing and operating in environments that are continuously evolving alongside global business standards. From inception to operation, we want to make the investor's life in the Kingdom as easy as possible. It starts with being available to answer any questions that a potential investor might have. We are prepared and excited to speak to anyone that is seriously considering Saudi Arabia as their next investment destination. In addition, we have taken a number of measures to remove barriers and streamline the licensing process. All investors—whether they are a large multinational or an SME—will receive an investment license in five days or less. Recently, we reached a record of taking only one day to make licensing decisions. All applications can now be submitted online, and the number of supporting documents required for each application has been reduced from 12 to three. We are also making it easier for potential investors to get visas to fully explore the Kingdom's investment environment and incentives before establishing an entity in Saudi Arabia. Along with these improvements, we're offering investors competitive property solutions in our economic cities and industrial lands, competitive financing opportunities through equity investment, loan, and grant schemes, and financial assistance for human resource development.</p><h4>As Governor of SAGIA, what are your expectations and goals for 2016?</h4><p>This will be a landmark year for Saudi Arabia on several fronts. The launch of the National Transformation Plan will set the Kingdom on a new trajectory toward growth and development. We at SAGIA are excited about what it will offer investors, both in terms of opportunities and ease of doing business in the Kingdom.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2013, the Chamber of Tourism of Panama and the Aruba Tourism Authority signed an MoU to boost cruise tourism in both countries. How do you assess its success so far, and what are some other ways in which trade ties can be reinforced?</h4><p>The locations of Aruba and Panama make our partnership a proverbial win-win as both destinations benefit from stimulating cruise tourism in the Southern Caribbean. Panama and Aruba have had a strong informal collaboration for many years, but in 2013 the Aruba Tourism Authority and the Chamber of Tourism of Panama (Camara de Turismo de Panama) signed an MoU to formalize our efforts to stimulate cruise tourism, especially during the summer months. Our respective Ministers of Tourism have been working steadily since 2013 to develop concrete steps to secure additional cruise business for our countries. In addition, these joint efforts have been expanded to include the country of Curacao. The goal is to approach specific key cruise line partners as well as to collectively embark on potential product development efforts. I am very confident that such efforts will lead to success for all three countries in increasing cruise tourism. I believe it is important for countries in the region to no longer view one another simply as competitors, whether for tourists or foreign investment, but to seek out ways we can work together so we all may benefit. Our MoU with Panama regarding cruise tourism is one inventive and promising way to do that, but we should find others. I think we also can strengthen our trade ties with Panama in the maritime and logistics sectors.</p><h4>What are the similarities between Panama and Aruba, and how can the former learn from Aruba's experience in marketing itself to potential visitors?</h4><p>Panama is a highly successful tourism destination and does not need lessons from any country. Our countries have much in common, however, in the warm and welcoming nature of our people. That is one key reason for the success of tourism in both our countries. In terms of joint marketing to increase cruise tourism, I believe what is more important for Panama and Aruba are some of the differences in our tourism and how we can complement one another in terms of what we offer to cruise tourists. Panama, of course, is a much larger country with a vibrant and modern metropolitan setting in Panama City. Panama also has mountains and jungles, as well as the Panama Canal Zone, one of the industrial wonders of the world. Aruba, on the other hand, is an island surrounded by the beautiful blue waters of the Caribbean with miles of white sandy beaches where windsurfers and kites boarders come from all over the world to catch our famous trade winds. And although we are a small island, we are culturally diverse with over 90 different nationalities and a multilingual people who speak four languages: Papiamento, Dutch, English, and Spanish.</p><h4>What makes Panama an important trade and investment partner for Aruba?</h4><p>Panama is a tremendous multi-faceted trading hub, not only for the region but for the world. Aruba also has a strategic location in the Caribbean and is developing its potential with a new state-of-the-art Multi Cargo Sea Terminal, which will open in 2016. We believe there is great potential for Aruba and Panama to collaborate and to develop business opportunities in the maritime and logistics sector. And Aruba, as part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, offers a unique opening to Europe right here in the Caribbean. In April 2015, after attending the Summit of the Americas in Panama, I led a Trade Mission Delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which hosted a conference and participated in a trade show in Panama, both focused on the maritime industry. In addition, the Netherlands sponsored a matchmaking session where companies from the Kingdom could explore business opportunities with Panamanian companies. The Kingdom was represented in Panama by 30 companies from the maritime sector alone, which were seeking to do business with Panamanian and other companies. So, as you can see from this strong showing of interest of the private sector in the Kingdom, Panama is a very important trade and investment partner for Aruba and the Kingdom of the Netherlands.</p><h4>Looking ahead, what are some of the ways in which the two countries can cooperate, and what do you envisage for the future of bilateral relations between the two nations?</h4><p>I believe the future of bilateral relations between Aruba and Panama is a bright one with tremendous potential as our countries cooperate on promoting cruise tourism and seeking business partnerships in the maritime and logistics sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC) was re-established in 2008 to encourage, promote and facilitate investments in all sectors of the economy except mining and petroleum. In which areas of the economy do you see significant opportunities for investment?</h4><p>The Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC) is a government agency established under Act 865 2013 to promote, coordinate, and facilitate investment in the Ghanaian economy. Our functions include: investment advisory services; joint venture search; identification of specific projects for investment promotion; the granting of investment incentives and provision of investor support services; the registration of technology transfer agreements; and negotiation of bilateral investment treaties. Investment opportunities abound in the entire value chain of the oil and gas sector in Ghana. Aside from the opportunities in this sector, there is potential in infrastructure services, which focus on expanding existing road, port, rail, and airport facilities. The power sector also presents opportunities. The Centre will be seeking to meet the investment targets articulated by the National Development Plan. With the increase in demand for housing solutions, investors can consider investment in the real estate sector for opportunities in both low-cost and luxury housing. The luxury segment in particular ties in with tourism and hospitality. We are working with the Ministry of Tourism to channel investment into that area. More opportunities exist in agriculture, where we are seeking to significantly increase investment. Our collaboration with the Ghana Free Zones Board and the Ghana Export Promotion Authority will help stimulate this sector. We are also looking to attract investors to collaborate with local businesses in manufacturing, assembly of light electrical parts, and electronic accessories.</p><h4>What impact is Ghana's short-term and cyclical instability having on investor interest?</h4><p>Despite Ghana's challenges in 2015 in terms of currency depreciation and interruption of power supply, investors have remained interested in the country and it remains a safe and secure investment destination. In addition to political stability and streamlined investment procedures, Ghana possesses a robust legal and regulatory framework. According to the World Bank's 2015 Doing Business report, Ghana ranks as the best destination in West Africa in terms of the ease of doing business. The country also ranks among the top five in Africa. Despite the short-term cyclical instability, the GIPC recorded appreciable levels of FDI inflows in 2015 after two years of implementing the new investment law, the GIPC Act, 2013 (Act 865). The total number of registered projects was 170, with a total estimated value of $2.68 billion.</p><h4>Recently there has been a large focus on the role of ECOWAS in building sustainable economic growth models. What is being done to encourage this regional investment flow?</h4><p>West African countries have enormous potential to strengthen competitiveness and increase trade and investment flows, which can drive growth, reduce poverty, and deliver jobs in the region. The ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme (ETLS) for instance is one of the means through which regional investment is being encouraged. It seeks to provide impetus to the process of economic integration and development in the West African sub-region. It is expected to provide easier access to markets in other ECOWAS countries and thereby encourage local manufacturing outfits to compete favourably with cheap imported products. The scheme is also expected to encourage entrepreneurial development through the provision of preferential treatment in specific areas among member states. In addition, extensive progress has been made on freedom of movement, a crucial part of ensuring a sustainable regional market. In 1980, visa requirements or entry permits for community citizens were eliminated to allow free movement of people within the sub region. In effect from July 2016, Ghana will be allowing citizens of AU member states to enter into the country and obtain visas on arrival with the option to stay for up to 30 days and experience what Ghana has to offer. This measure is expected to stimulate air travel, trade, investment, and tourism in the long run.</p><h4>The “Made in Ghana" campaign is helping to galvanize local companies and promote them overseas. How can domestic investment be encouraged to support these flagship companies?</h4><p>The GIPC actively encourages, promotes, and facilitates investment both into and within Ghana, and we work to do this in a number of ways like ensuring awareness of investment and business opportunities. We also celebrate corporate excellence and successful enterprise building through initiatives like the Ghana Club 100 awards. In addition, the GIPC is also facilitating domestic investment through its Call for Projects initiative, which allows domestic investors to submit project profiles for screening and packaging for inclusion in the GIPC's project catalogue. We employ this worldwide as a promotional instrument aimed at various categories of investors that may be interested in establishing partnerships and providing financing.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2016?</h4><p>As part of our strategy for 2016, the GIPC will focus on improving upon its operational efficiency, providing higher level services and rolling out the second phase of our "Think Ghana Make it Happen" campaign with the target of propelling Ghana to become the preferred investment destination in Africa. We are anticipating a steady increase in FDI in the year 2016 over 2015, while keeping in mind that this year is an election year. In such years, it is natural to see a decline in FDI. There may be fewer overall investments but the size of the individual investments should continue to increase. Many will take the form of public-private partnerships or otherwise involve the private sector. The opening of the Dubai and French Chambers of Commerce offices in Accra last year and this year respectively has been very exciting for us and proves there is interest from the Middle East and French business markets in investment opportunities. Ghana's location and infrastructure are advantages and provide opportunities to access the rest of the ECOWAS region. Given the global economic situation we must vie for the limited FDI that is available. We will also be focusing more on leveraging Ghana's strengths and interest in the African continent. Ghana is open for business and there is strong government support for investors as well as a transparent and functional legal framework to ensure the success of every investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Support for SMEs in Azerbaijan is an important way to achieve growth. What are the ways in which the Ministry is working to create more favorable conditions for SMEs within Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The private sector plays an important role in the development and diversification of the non-oil sector of the economy, with the development of entrepreneurship is one of our priorities. In line with the strategic quote from President Aliyev, “the development of our country depends on the development of entrepreneurship," special attention is paid to the private sector for the stimulation and development of entrepreneurship. As a result, the share of the private sector GDP exceeded 80% while maintaining 73% in employment. According to statistics, more than 660,000 people are engaged in entrepreneurial activities. Over the past years, procedures and rules regulating entrepreneurial activity were liberalized, the mechanisms for state financial support for entrepreneurship were improved, effective mechanisms were established for the protection of the rights of entrepreneurs, state registration procedures of businesses were simplified, and electronic services were expanded. Moreover, foreign trade transactions and the registration of real estate rights became simplified and amendments were made to the legislation regarding the issuance of construction permits, optimization of corporate governance, protection of investors' interests, and bankruptcy. In addition, inspections of businesses were suspended for two years in October 2015, administrative procedures in the fields of licensing and customs were simplified, the number of business activities requiring licenses was significantly reduced, licenses became permanent, and the amount of state fees for the issuance of licenses was reduced twice in Baku and four times in the regions. These licenses are issued by the Ministry of Economy via the ASAN service centers and an Electronic License portal was created. In accordance with the amendments to the law on public procurements, discounts of up to 20% for local entrepreneurs will increase the opportunities for them to win tender projects and will provide additional support for the expansion of domestic production. Tax and customs privileges applied to investors with a view of investment promotion will lead to the further development of entrepreneurship, attraction of foreign investments, an increase in non-oil exports, and the development of the non-oil sector as a whole. Thus, entrepreneurs are exempted from customs duties on machinery, equipment, and devices imported for investment purposes in priority areas of the economy for 7 years. Moreover, a certificate of origin is issued to businesses in a single day, simplifying export procedures. Measures aimed at the development of entrepreneurship in the country are appreciated by international organizations. Azerbaijan has risen from 80th to 63rd place, improving its position by 17 points and becoming one of 24 countries that carried out three or more reforms in Doing Business 2016. According to Global Competitiveness Report 2015-2016, Azerbaijan ranked 40th among 140 countries, and keeps its leading position among the CIS countries for the seventh consecutive year. In general, comprehensive state support measures pave the way for rapid development of the private sector, especially SMEs, which are of particular importance for achieving the targets set in the Development Concept Azerbaijan-2020: Look into the Future.</p><h4>Political stability in Azerbaijan is an important condition for foreign investment. How does this help promote investor confidence as the country looks to attract new funds amid a decrease in domestic expenditures?</h4><p>It should be emphasized that the political and economic stability in Azerbaijan and the protection of the rights and interests of investors are important indicators of the business and investment climate of the country. Furthermore, the geographical location, hydrocarbon reserves, rich raw resources of precious metals and building materials, and a favorable climate for agriculture and tourism create many opportunities for local and foreign investors. To increase the efficiency of transit and logistics operations, the Coordinating Council was established to regulate the transit of goods. Cargo transportation tariffs were also reduced, creating favorable conditions for increasing the transit cargo transportation capacity of the country. Within investment promotion measures carried out in 2015 alone, AZPROMO organized 261 events, out of which 177 took place in Azerbaijan and 84 abroad. These events showcased investment opportunities in the country to local and foreign businessmen, promoted Azerbaijani products for exports, and saw export contracts signed with foreign partners. Exemplifying Azerbaijan's investment attractiveness in the world, in 2015 alone over $20 billion was invested in the country's economy. In total, during the period of 1995-2015, investments in the Azerbaijani economy totaled $220.4 billion, about half of which came from foreign investments. In addition, there are more than 7,000 foreign- invested companies currently operating in various fields.</p><h4>How does the hosting one of the large sporting events in the world, the Formula One Grand Prix in Baku, work to have a positive impact on the overall economy of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is considered a sporting nation throughout the world. Organizing the Formula One Grand Prix in Azerbaijan after the first European Games in 2015 is the result of political and economic stability, the international reputation of Azerbaijan, and the country's experience in holding major events and competitions. This event will have a significant impact on sport development, it will contribute to the economy, and the increase in the number of visitors will stimulate the tourism and service sectors. In addition, the positive image of the country will be highlighted and long-term investments will increase. The athletes and guests taking part in the competition will have an opportunity to get acquainted with the country and observe the successful development model of Azerbaijan.</p><h4>Industrial parks have greatly increased non-oil sector activity in Azerbaijan and added to the socio-economic development of the regions. What are your plans and areas of focus for developing additional parks in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Work is underway to establish industrial zones, industrial parks, and industrial estates. These will create new industries alongside traditional industrial areas, strengthen the industrial capacity of the regions, and maintain the development of industry on the basis of innovation. In accordance with the policy of industrialization, we continued to provide support for the establishment of industrial parks and estates. In addition, up to 270 industrial enterprises, including technical equipment, metal structures, concrete products plants, and textile factories commenced activity. The construction of new important industrial facilities began through- out the previous year. Work to establish of Sumgait Chemical and Industrial, Balakhani Industrial, Mingachevir, and Garadagh Industrial Parks, and the creation of infrastructure in Neftchala Industrial Estate has been proceeding intensely. The first phase in building the infrastructure for Sumgait Chemical and Industrial Park is almost completed, and five residents plan to invest more than $1 billion. Azertechnoline, a resident of the Park, has already signed an agreement to export 60,000 tons of pipes worth $45 million. The building of the external infrastructure at Balakhani Industrial Park is almost completed and more than AZN10 million is planned to be invested by four residents. Now, work is continuing on modern technologies in the field of shipbuilding in Baku Shipyard, a resident of Garadagh Industrial Park. Azerbaijan Investment Company (AIC) is one of the main shareholders of Baku Shipyard. Moreover, the establishment of a specialized industrial park for the steel industry in Ganja is planned. Consistent and systematic measures in the field of industry, the establishment of enterprises based on advanced technologies and best practices, have all had a positive impact on increasing the country's self-sufficiency and import-replacement efforts.</p><h4>What are some steps that Azerbaijan can take with a view to ensuring economic growth against the background of a decline in global energy markets?</h4><p>I gave information about the works done for ensuring economic growth in the new economic conditions. Systematic and durable measures for further improvement of business environment, development of entrepreneurship, stimulation of export, the state programs of rural development pave the way for non-oil sector development. Along with other fields, the agriculture sector is of great importance for the development of the non-oil sector. The development of this field is one of the country's economic priorities in terms of employment and the food security of population. As a result of the work done and state support for the agricultural sector, food production and the country's self-sufficiency rate has increased. In the coming years, targeted measures will continue to build necessary infrastructure for the storage of agricultural products, apply tax concessions, grant subsidies and soft loans, and organize leasing and agricultural services. In addition, logistics centers within the country and abroad look to boost the country's export potential and accessibility in foreign markets. The first logistics center of Azerbaijan has already been established in Aktau, Kazakhstan. This logistics center, which will serve for storage and sales of agricultural products and other food commodities, provides a number of opportunities and advantages for entrepreneurs, especially for exporters. Moreover, a number of large-scale projects are being implemented in order to increase the transit potential of Azerbaijan. The commencing of operations at the Baku International Sea Trade Port, Baku Shipyard, reconstruction of Baku-Boyuk Kesik Railway, construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway projects, as well as the construction of international airports, North-South International Transport Corridor, all further expand the transit potential of our country and strengthen the transport infrastructure of Azerbaijan. In the rapidly growing ICT sector, the launch of satellites into orbit, the organization of high-technology parks, and new e-services have created additional opportunities. Actions have been taken for the development and promotion of the tourism potential of the country. The number of tourists visiting our country and the revenues gained from this sector have considerably increased. Attracting local and foreign investment in the tourism sector, further improving the quality of services, and hosting international sporting and cultural events provide additional stimulus for the development of tourism.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abu Dhabi Financial Group often looks at alternative measures in its investment strategy, particularly during slower times in the economy and on the financial markets. How does this strategy suit the company?</h4><p>This has been the philosophy behind our investment strategy since inception; it is a fundamental part of who we are. Today, the alternative investment landscape is growing worldwide, and it is also the case in the Middle East. Therefore, it is natural that one finds new companies and initiatives in the alternative investment space. We like to invest in downtrend cycles, because value becomes more apparent when things are on the down side and investor sentiment isn't present, or is weak. In terms of sectors, real estate and financial services are the largest in the UAE outside of oil and gas. We, as a group, have a lot of experience and expertise in these sectors; therefore, we will always be looking at them and we will always be active there. Having said that, we also want to expand into different sectors, such as maritime and oil and gas services, among others. It depends where opportunities present themselves. Technology is another sector that is gaining traction in the UAE in terms of biotech, ICT, and mobile applications, for example.</p><h4>What financial instruments and methods suit these kinds of alternative investment strategies?</h4><p>It is diverse. Alternative investments are typically very bespoke and customized; therefore, they are done in ways that are different and new compared to the standard practices regarding investments. When it comes to debt, for example, we talk about junior debt, mezzanine debt, hybrid debt, and convertible debt—everything that's non-conventional. In terms of equity, it's about preferred equity, normal equity, private equity, and private investment in public equities (PIPE).</p><h4>How does your company go about managing and assessing risk in its investment strategy?</h4><p>We invest in down cycles when investor sentiment is weak and people are wary of investing. People think we are taking excessive risk in these periods; however, it is in fact the opposite. We are taking minimal risk. First of all, you are getting a lot of value up front and, secondly, you are already in a downward cycle; therefore, the value has already dropped to a certain level. Our investments are typically opportunistic and represent excellent value. In the projects that we rescue, we take a lot of collateral; therefore, it is very much asset backed. These projects need us not because they are not successful projects, but because banks have caps and don't want to deploy financing over a certain period of time, for example. It is not necessarily because the project isn't viable, which allows us to source capital and funding that is new in the region. Historically, it was equity and debt. Today, it is equity and off-plan investing, last-mile funding, mezzanine, and conventional debt. The funding structure evolves over time.</p><h4>What changes in strategy do you plan once the economy picks up again?</h4><p>The market has already picked up to some degree. The US has picked up and is doing phenomenally well. The capital markets have more than doubled in the last five years. Interest rates have started to be raised and unemployment is low. That means things have already picked up. It is the same with the UK, which is also bustling, as is Germany. Other European economies are still suffering, true, but they are out of the vicious circle. Turkey, South America, Malaysia, and China are now facing difficulties with their currencies and slowdowns, so not all of them will pick up. Some will be disasters, while some are too big to fail. The world today is fragmented. The US and Europe will have their own way forward, and emerging markets and GCC countries will find their own way forward, too. I don't foresee any major crisis in the near future at the level of the 2008 crisis. Middle Eastern countries, Europe, and Asian countries are not significantly leveraged and haven't been relying on banks the way they used to. There isn't any bubble that can be expected to burst. A lot of people today are concerned about oil, which was recently below $30 per barrel. I really believe that for an important commodity such as oil, the prices cannot remain so low. Therefore, now is the best time to buy oil and lock down contracts. Right now, all expenses considered, even water is more expensive than oil. Consider also all the side businesses, products, and industries oil is crucial for, from petrochemicals to plastics.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi Financial Group wants to be another market maker for the ADX and DFM. How will that enhance the company?</h4><p>If you want to be a market maker in the local capital markets like the ADX and DFM, you have to have a license from the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA). We are in discussion with the SCA to launch our market-making division, which will market-make on the ADX and DFM. Today, only NBAD is a market maker. Capital markets will have a major role in the economy with time, and the SCA has done a good job in coming up with new legislation and regulations, new instruments and tools to help get new companies in through IPOs, and so forth. Time is important and things will eventually mature and evolve in the market over time. It is already heading in the right direction. Whether things stay low for a while or go back up, there will continue to be forward progress. We are doing this because we see an opportunity to make money. The industry is still nascent, not matured, and growing. There is a lot of room to grow and make money here, especially if you know and understand the market well. Market making is a profitable business and, simultaneously, it is a cornerstone for a healthy and thriving financial market. It will be challenging in the beginning, but the regulator is working closely with us on this matter.</p><h4>The firm has the vision to become one of the world's leading financial groups. What are your benchmarks to achieve this and how do you see the way forward?</h4><p>One thing we set out to do from the start was ensure that we didn't achieve anything by compromising on our performance. Our performance so far has been stellar, and we want to keep that going. That is our most precious asset at the moment. Growth in numbers isn't really a key metric. For us, consistent, stellar performance is what we're looking for. If we could carry our 27% internal rate of return (IRR) over the last five years into the next five years so that we could say we have had 27% IRR over a decade since our company's inception, that would be superb. It is not easy maintaining such a high IRR across boom and bust cycles, but that's our goal. If it means forsaking further growth, then so be it. To ensure this, we adhere to best practices and drive strong, ethical financing. We hired one of the big four accountancy firms to do a corporate governance review for us. We examine the findings and review them every year and base improvements on this. Other than that, the group subsidiaries are regulated by different regulatory bodies, be it the UAE Central Bank, Emirates Security and Commodities Association, the IFC, or the LSE. Our subsidiaries are closely regulated, and we as a group have best-in-class corporate governance practice and a code of ethics that we regularly circulate among our employees.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Ministry of Commerce recently announced that it expects exports to grow by 5% in 2016. Which macroeconomic factors will be crucial to realizing these goals?</h4><p>The economic situation for 2016 is not bright. We are still in a fragile environment regarding oil prices. The Thai economy depends heavily on exports and over 60% of our exports are goods. We need to work hard to boost our exports. However, when looking at exports, we are not only looking at goods, because our economy is broad. We also export services, which is a growing segment. We are now looking at a two-pronged approach on our exports. This is why we are targeting this 5% figure. If you look at the economic situation that has made us aim for 5%, it is the growing market in the region. In particular, I am referring to ASEAN countries because 2016 is the year we are starting the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), which has the potential to boost the Thai economy. We are in the heart of ASEAN, especially on the mainland, which is significant. If you look around the world, the AEC is a growing market, not only in terms of the region itself but also in terms of the access it offers us to neighboring markets such as India and China. We have those two countries with populations of over 1 billion each. Although China's economy is slowing down, it still remains a growth area for us. This is because under our strategy, not only will we look at these countries as a whole, we will also dig deep into their major cities. When talking about the AEC, Thailand is in a strategic location with unrivalled access to the booming Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam (CLMV) markets. In 2016, we will have an important road and rail link to China through Laos and Thailand. Another two important links will go from Vietnam to Myanmar and also from Thailand through Myanmar to India. These are important aspects when we analyze the future prospects for Thailand.</p><h4>In what ways can the Ministry help exporters establish themselves in both well established and emerging markets?</h4><p>Emerging markets are particularly important for us. We have to separate the two types of markets and look specifically at how we bring people into new emerging markets. For example, I recently returned from a trip to Iran and Oman. Oman is a small country, but it is a member of the emerging GCC bloc and can be a link to the East African countries, and Iran has just opened up following the decades-long sanctions. Iran is a large market and it could also be a link to the CIS. Even big business in Thailand does not have the know-how to access such markets, especially Iran. On our trip we found out that both sides are enthusiastic about each other. Thai business understands now, just from that trip, the opportunities in Iran. Iran is looking for partnerships and Thailand is a good fit in that sense. This is the time to bring our businesses to the new emerging economies. We still have to keep the traditional markets in the US and the EU, although the EU is slowing down. There are also the niche markets where we try to adapt our business, products, and services to suit each market. I am going to Belarus soon, which is also a new market for Thai businesses, and then to Turkey for the launch of our FTA. African countries also offer significant potential for Thailand. Of course, in countries that depend on oil their purchasing power may have slowed down; however, they still need products from Thailand as we have a variety of resources that can match their needs.</p><h4>With so many agreements and FTAs on the table, does Thailand need the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)?</h4><p>It does not hurt to be part of these agreements. We are looking in detail at what the TPP is, because we are, of course, part of the production chain and it would help us to remain in this chain. Therefore, we are studying the TPP in depth; however, as a new member we know that the 12 original members will look at Thailand and ask what they can get from us. If the price is too high then we cannot enter, but we hope we can get support from our friends in the TPP and we can learn from them; for example, from Vietnam and Malaysia, whose level of development is close to ours. We can learn how they adapted and prepared themselves to be part of that huge agreement. We can learn from many other friends and colleagues in other countries who can share their experiences with us. But yes, it is important to be part of the TPP as a trading partner. Intellectual property has been an issue for us, but it is the same for every country in the TPP. That is another area where we can learn from our friends. I do not believe we are in a worse situation than many countries that are partners in the TPP. At the same time, we have been improving on intellectual property rights (IPR) issues. Registration has been a main issue and that has been promoted during the last two years in office. The enforcement has been stepped up and we have been working on improving many issues because we cannot stay put. Even though we are not part of the agreement, we are a trading nation in a trading world. We have new investment opportunities, such as in high technology and R&amp;D where we are luring foreign investment into Thailand. In that sense, we have been moving up the scale, even though we are not a member of the TPP.</p><h4>E-commerce in the region is gaining momentum. In what ways has the Ministry of Commerce adapted to this game-changing phenomenon?</h4><p>E-commerce will be a major element of our export growth. A large percentage of retail, particularly in China, is through e-commerce and this sector is growing fast. We are encouraging businesses and entrepreneurs to make use of e-commerce. We have a department that is nurturing this growth, which we call the Incubator. We have a program to train and develop e-commerce enterprises and, when they are stronger, we partner them with bigger businesses. We are looking to develop this program in three steps. Firstly, for those who have never been involved in e-commerce before, we have the incubator programs. Then, we partner them with mega-business locally to mentor them and help them manage their stock, payment, and delivery systems. For example, the Central Group has trading companies in Indonesia, Vietnam, and elsewhere in the region, and it will connect these new SMEs with its overseas outlets. Our International Trade Department has another project promoting design that is partnered with Japan. Many of the companies that have won that competition have been able to export to Japan. We hold the Prime Minister's Design Awards every year. We take the winners out to exhibitions and promote them in various ways. In 2016, we will not only participate in trade fairs abroad and bring buyers into the country, we will also have a high-level road show going to numerous countries around the world. This road show will include both our SMEs and big business. We are also putting more emphasis on investment abroad. Our bigger businesses are active in outward investment already; for example, the CP Group has gone into Russia and many other countries. Our smaller businesses need to have guidance for outward investments. I think that Thai businesses are quite ready for this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The country's budget for 2016 curtails public investment in sectors such as mining and energy. How do you expect the new budget to affect the economic situation?</h4><p>Colombia is in transition; oil played an important role and it represented 20% of the government's income in 2013. In 2016, the oil industry will only represent around 2%. We have implemented a tax reform that increased the tax contribution from companies; we also cut public investment; and finally, we had a slightly higher fiscal deficit. This represents a strong response to the drop in oil prices. The budget for 2016 has seen cuts in several areas, compared to that of 2015. We have tightened our belts, accounting for around 1% of GDP without impacting social and infrastructure expenditure. We refer to these policies as intelligent austerity. This means a cut in the budget, but having clear priorities such as continuing to reducing poverty levels and maintaining growth rates; in 2015 we had a growth above 3% and we expect to continue at this level in 2016.</p><h4>How will tax reform take shape in 2016?</h4><p>In 2014, Colombia implemented a tax reform that raised taxes for companies. We have recently organized a commission of independent experts to comprehensively revise the tax system in the country. The objective is to make to system more equitable and more competitive. The commission recently finished its report and we expect that by March 2016 we will be implementing a tax reform in the country. One of the key ideas behind this reform is to reduce the tax burden on companies to a manageable level.</p><h4>How do you expect FDI and exports to develop in the next year?</h4><p>One of the mechanisms we had in place to accommodate the fall in oil prices has been the flexible exchange rate. Colombia has not interfered in the foreign exchange market and that led to a devaluation of the Colombian peso against a stronger dollar. This enables us to develop our agribusiness, tourism, and other such sectors; the higher the exchange rate, the more competitive our exports are. This situation varies from that of dollarized economies or economies that are strongly dependent on the dollar. Other positive aspects of devaluation will bring results over the longer term, and this is due to the fact companies' investments take time to demonstrate results. All in all, this devaluation and low oil prices will help Colombia diversify its economy. Also, our exports are more competitive.</p><h4>What is your overall assessment of your term in office?</h4><p>Colombia is one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America in 2015 and this is thanks to the programs we implement to boost economic activity. This is a major achievement within a year in which oil prices dropped—we need to keep in mind that 50% of our exports come from the oil industry. This has been made possible thanks to trust and focused social expenditure. We implemented a couple of programs to prioritize social investment and expenditure and these have paid off.</p><h4>What joint strategies should Pacific Alliance countries implement to boost economic growth in the region?</h4><p>We are transitioning from one phase to another in the Pacific Alliance; we achieved commercial integration and now we are working on financial integration. We have implemented free trade agreements and agreements to encourage the flow of services between the countries, and now we want to achieve a higher integration of the financial markets. In this context, we have taken steps to achieve a higher integration of our stock exchange markets. We also want to boost investment and travelling of investors among these economies.</p><h4>What goals does the ministry aim to achieve by the end of President Santos' term in 2018?</h4><p>We would like to see a very solid economy with strong growth rates and a long-term vision. I would like to see a more diversified economy, a Colombia being part of the OECD, and of course a country in which extreme poverty stands below 5%. Also, I hope to leave a country in which the bond credit rating is BBB+. Finally, we need to achieve peace, because with peace Colombia will boost growth by 1% to 1.5% more.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have recently visited Peru to meet with President Humala. Which areas were identified as having the most potential for increased cooperation between the two nations?</h4><p>Turkey is the 6th most popular tourism destination in the world with 36.8 million visitors and $34.3 billion in revenue as of 2014. Peru offers a wealth of unique touristic attractions.  Many Turkish people have heard of and are attracted to Machu Picchu as one of the new Seven Wonders of the World. With adequate investment incentives provided by Peruvian authorities, Turkish firms could engage in tourism projects in this country and share their experience.  One of the most important areas of expertise of Turkish companies is construction. There are about 250 the world-class contractors operating around the globe.  43 of these are Turkish companies. Turkey ranks second after China that has 65 international construction companies.  The total value of projects completed by Turkish companies in other countries has reached $250 Billion. As we know, Peru will make huge investments in its infrastructure in the coming years. Turkish contractors could make a significant contribution in this regard as highly motivated new partners and competitors of foreign companies that have been active in Peru since long time.</p><h4>Negotiations are underway to establish a multilateral Free Trade Agreement between Turkey and several countries in Central America. What is the importance of Peru's involvement in this? €¨</h4><p>Four rounds of negotiations for the Free Trade Agreement have been completed . Both sides have some priorities and concerns, but we can overcome these inherent difficulties. The leaders of both countries have expressed their intention to sign the Free Trade Agreement in June this year and the negotiating teams have been instructed to reach that objective. The negotiating teams will meet in Ankara this March with the goal to finalize the FTA. Turkey, connecting Asia and Europe both commercially and culturally, has one of the largest economies and markets in its region. As the world's 18th and Europe's 7th largest economy, our purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita income exceeded $19,000 in 2014. From 2002 to 2014, our per capita income has grown from $3,492 to $10,404 at constant prices. In the same period, Peru has achieved high economic growth rates, mostly over 5% per annum. It is noteworthy that Peru is on the way to become a member of OECD and a party to the Trans Pacific Agreement signed on 3 February 2016 in Auckland, New Zealand. The inward foreign direct investments (FDI) performance of Peru is also impressive. In 2013, Peru was the most attractive country for investment in Latin America according to the FDI/GDP Index. The Free Trade Agreement could serve as a lasting and appealing bridge, not only between Peru and Turkey but between the two regions as well. We do not see Peru merely as a bilateral trade partner. Peru is a strategic hub for our economic cooperation and partnership with the region at large.  Our recent bilateral trade volume of $260 million does not reflect the existing potential between Turkey and Peru. </p><h4>How do you envision the future of bilateral relations between the two countries? What are the Turkish government's goals and ambitions to be achieved over the medium term?</h4><p>Bilateral relations have made progress since 2010. There is still a lot of work ahead. We need to sign and ratify certain key agreements soon, most important of which is the FTA.  We need to pay mutually more official visits. The role of governments is to pave the way for the people and entrepreneurs to proceed. Our goal is to increase the currently modest bilateral trade volume to $1 billion in the next five years. We would like to see Turkish contractors and investors start their projects in Peru already this year.</p><p><em>* This contribution was submitted by the Press Office of the President of </em><em>the Republic of Turkey.</em></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is required to stimulate entrepreneurship in the country, especially for SMEs?</h4><p>There was a mentality in the government that the strength of our economy was entirely dependent on global economic factors, which certainly have an impact, but it became an excuse not to facilitate entrepreneurial activity among Peruvian companies. Now it is up to the next government to reduce barriers and obstacles, facilitate economic activities, and implement the appropriate regulations and laws to support the labor force and educational system for long-term development. The informal sector accounts for 74% of total national labor and about 60% of economic activity, so it is important to formalize.</p><h4>What is the main challenge companies face when developing their operations in Peru?</h4><p>The government is the greatest impediment to economic activity. It is becoming increasingly important to be competitive as we are becoming increasingly globalized. We currently have 17 free trade agreements and others in preparation, we are members of Pacific Alliance, of APEC, and TPP; all this makes necessary to be more competitive and in order to be more competitive we have to be cheaper, faster, and more effective in what we do.</p><h4>How will the TPP impact the Peruvian economy and what is its potential?</h4><p>There is always potential in every measure we take to be more globalized because it opens up possibilities to have wider markets and to enter markets at lower costs. On the other hand, as long as we are members and others are not, we open up possibilities for entities to sell their products through us in these globalized market spaces. It is an investment opportunity for people of other countries to generate their products with us and sell them in the markets we now have easy access to.</p><h4>What segments of the national economy have significant potential for new companies to invest and operate?</h4><p>There is considerable potential to invest in the economy and the main opportunities are in infrastructure development. While the government has yet to privatize many services, there is strong potential to do so, opening up opportunities to construct roads, railways, metros, and even to distribute energy to other countries. There is potential to add value to our raw materials; instead of exporting copper we can export copper wires and copper electrical products, which could be manufactured in Peru. There are also opportunities to export agricultural products, particularly fruits and vegetables and commodities unique to Peru such as quinoa. We have about 2,000 different varieties of potatoes so there is definitely potential to develop something there as well.</p><h4>How is the Chamber positioned to develop a synergy between the business community and the government? </h4><p>Our main function is to facilitate dialog about challenges facing the private sectors, and to give the private sector a space to participate in the discussion. We have large events throughout the year to talk with specialists, and we invite academics from different parts of the world to give lectures. We not only discuss general economic issues, but there is also a constant dialogue with different entities of the government. We do not defend any one interest of our members; rather we develop general strategies and defend general interest principles.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2016 in terms of economic performance and what are the Chamber's priority targets for the end of the year? </h4><p>We will have elections this year, and economic activity generally slows during elections years. However, this election season we are confident that we will have continuity, and it is the first time in history that Peru has had 25 years of constant development and political continuity. We try to unify our development process. For example, we want our doctors, investors, and financial institutions to have internationally recognized credentials and functions and global access to opportunities. The Pacific Alliance is not only a free trade agreement zone, it is more comparable to the eurozone. Peru is a member of APEC and for the second time the APEC meeting will be held in Lima, which is a tremendous opportunity to make a strong market here. In order to do that it is important to develop a strategy and take the right measures to make Peru more attractive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the main tasks and major milestones of the Thai Gem and Jewelry Traders Association?</h4><p>Above all, the Bangkok Gem and Jewelry Fair is considered among the top five international trade shows along with the JCK in Las Vegas, Baselworld in Switzerland, and Vicenzaoro in Italy and Hong Kong. With 3,000 exhibitors and 30,000 visitors and buyers, it is the second most important gems fair in Asia after Hong Kong. The Thai gem and jewelry industry has posted annual export revenues of $13 billion in the past five to six years, making us the third biggest contributor to Thai GDP after automotive and electronics, and we have been one of the top five sectors for Thailand for the past 20 years. Furthermore, the industry is constantly growing. Gem and jewelry is a luxury industry, which makes it sensitive to global and national economic fluctuations. Whenever there is a crisis, a decline, or any problem, this industry is quickly affected. About 90% of Thai entrepreneurs are manufacturers and exporters. We have more than 1,500 members, and they are all wholesalers and exporters, 100%. Our role is to help promote their products on the market and the industry in general, internationally, building competitiveness and awareness of our products, and dealing with obstacles and problems faced by our members. In all, from upstream raw material suppliers all the way through to downstream retail, 1 million people are involved directly or indirectly in some way with our association.</p><h4>Could you tell us about the Bangkok Gem and Jewelry Fair and how it boosts the Thai gem and jewelry industry, both locally and abroad?</h4><p>The importance of the fair and the industry in general is attested to by the Prime Minister's attendance last year. In terms of attendance, we can compete with the best in the world, including the leaders of the sector globally, such as Italy; therefore, it is big deal and a major event not just in the gem and jewelry sector but through all sectors. We had a talk with the Prime Minister about the fair and about various problems and difficulties we've been facing in the sector, particularly concerning Thai competitiveness vis-á-vis other markets and countries in the region, proposing certain regulatory and tax changes to boost export revenues, and the Prime Minister was in agreement with us. Our aim is to make Thailand the world hub in colored stones, in which Thai labor can be considered the best in the world. Hence, we are promoting Thailand as the world leader in colored gems, and the Prime Minister has also supported us in that objective, telling us he would give his full support in that field. The success of our sector is the success of Thailand.</p><h4>What factors have been driving the strong growth of the gem and jewelry sector in Thailand in recent years?</h4><p>As mentioned, export revenues of $13 billion put us in third position worldwide. The secret of our success is simple: quality products and skilled labor. We have a long and illustrious tradition in this sector; therefore, it is natural that our products would be in high demand worldwide, which is why we are looking for more support from the government. We are huge contributors to the Thai economy through our sources of revenues, jobs, taxes, even contributing to Thailand's image abroad. One issue is the 20% import duty plus 7% VAT that Thais pay on imported materials and jewelry. We want those buying and selling at the fair in Bangkok to be exempted from that tax. The government has been receptive and supportive in pushing many issues that we have proposed, such as the exemption of VAT for cut stones, gemstones, and diamonds. There is no import duty on those, but there is 7% VAT. It has accepted that and we expect an exemption on cut stones to be in place soon. We also proposed exemption from import duties and VAT for rough stones. We have the most skilled workforce in the world in terms of cutting, polishing, and working rough stones. Therefore, we proposed that all those rough and raw materials come in through the door openly and freely, because we have high value added on those products once finished. The government has also heeded us on that. We need more materials coming into our country; therefore, we need to ditch the 7% VAT on those. They should come in freely as raw materials, which come mainly from Africa, Sri Lanka, and Burma. The government could then maybe apply a tax on the finished product instead.</p><h4>Do you think ASEAN and AEC integration will affect the industry in a positive way?</h4><p>We are the leading country in terms of gems and jewelry manufacturing in ASEAN in terms of volumes and capability. However, other countries, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Burma have cheaper labor and also the raw materials that we don't have. Soon we expect those countries will have their own jewelry industries, too, because they won't just be content with selling rough stones to Thailand anymore. They will want to build up their own gem and jewelry industries, using their advantage of cheap labor and access to raw materials. Sure they don't have the skills Thais have, but those skills can be learned. Vietnam is already catching up to Thailand rapidly. Even Thai companies are starting to relocate to gain access to cheaper labor and acquire those raw materials more easily and cheaply. This is one of our concerns in Thailand and a reason why we need to keep increasing our capabilities, so we can move away from our neighborhood and differentiate ourselves more, while also developing strategies that will keep giving Thailand an edge in new ways. For example, we are in touch with our ASEAN neighbors, educating them and also trying to attract them to the Bangkok Gem and Jewelry Show so they can use that to access world markets and attract buyers for themselves and their respective national industries. We are also bringing India, China, Australia, Korea, Japan, and New Zealand into the equation, helping each other promote and develop the sector.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016 in Thailand and for the sector in particular?</h4><p>I anticipate the same rate of growth as 2015. We need to stay on track and maintain our precision. In 2015, export figures grew more than 5%, which contrasts with a general economic decline. That was surprising for many considering we are seen as a luxury industry. I expect the same for 2016. We hope the US market will grow, considering the US market once accounted for 25% of our global exports—today that's dropped to just 15%. We hope the US market once again moves up to 20%, or even 25% if possible now that things are picking up there again.</p>]]></richbody0content>

What makes Panama an importance economic, security, and political partner for Chile?</h4><p>Panama is the main logistics hub in Latin America, making it, without a doubt, an important engine for global trade. In this context, Chile is the first Latin American user of the Panama Canal and third overall turning Panama into a key player for the growth and development of Chile's foreign trade. Since the expansion of the Canal was announced, Chile has closely followed its development, as it represents the possibility to further increase our trade with the rest of the world, particularly regarding gas imports from the US and Trinidad &amp; Tobago, which will be able to circulate through the new locks. In addition, Panama also aspires to become the hub for disaster relief aid throughout the region, an issue of great interest to Chile.</p><h4>Chile is the first country in South America with which Panama signed an FTA. How did this reinforce trade and investment links between the two countries, and which goods are particularly important?</h4><p>The economic and trade relations between Chile and Panama are governed by the FTA, in force since March 7, 2008. The FTA establishes a regulatory framework that includes disciplines such as: market access for goods (rules of origin, customs procedures, technical standards, and sanitary and phytosanitary standards), trade in services, investment, transparency and dispute settlement. All these disciplines ensure the best conditions for trade in goods and services between Chile and Panama. Since the entry into force of the FTA, exports have grown at an average annual rate of 4.1%. During 2015, Chile exported to Panama a total of $176 million and imports from Panama in 2015 were $82 million, an increase of 9.3% in relation to 2014. There is an increased presence of Chilean products in the Panamanian market, including salmon (5 fold increase), machinery and metal products and equipment (4 fold), and processed foods and wine, which have doubled their exports. Moreover, there are growth opportunities for trade in services, as 80% of Panama's economy is linked to this sector. Regarding investment, Panama is the 10th destination, in the world, for direct investment of Chilean capital. The accumulated direct investment in that country amounts to $813 million, representing 0.8% of the total invested abroad and it ranks as the largest recipient in the region of Central America, with over 20 Chilean companies. Chilean investment is mainly concentrated in services, focusing on finance, transportation, retail, computer services, and construction.</p><h4>Looking ahead, how can the two countries increase their cooperation in other fields such as tourism and education?</h4><p>The government of Chile assigns a special priority to strengthening our relations with Latin American countries. Since 2014, we have focused on promoting an ambitious agenda in Central American countries based on not only the administration of FTAs, but also on three additional pillars: the modernization of these trade agreements, development cooperation, and investment promotion. In the area of development cooperation, Chile is carrying out some South-South, as well as triangular cooperation projects in the region. In February 2016, we presented a cooperation project entitled "Strengthening the institutions responsible for trade policies of the Central American countries" to the EU. This project aims to contribute to strengthen the Central American region as an economic group and help in their integration with international trade. We hope to continue incorporating similar initiatives in other areas such as education, security, and tourism, among others. In addition, we welcome the interest of Panama in the Pacific Alliance and hope that we will continue to strengthen relations in the area of regional integration, through closer cooperation on areas such as education, tourism, transportation, and promoting SMEs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the importance of the transport sector to Nigeria's economy?</h4><p>The transport sector is the second most important sector of the economy after oil and gas. This sector is the one that affects all sectors, including oil and gas. We are currently upgrading all modes of transport, including rail, roads, sea, and air. We have been working on the seaport at Onitsha, Baro, and Lokoja. The first two are ready and the third will be ready soon. We are talking with Chinese companies to see how we can capitalize on Nigeria's internal waterways and use them as a means of transport. In railways, we're in the process of developing a plan for laying 2650km of new railways, investing $20 billion over a period of four years. The construction of two deepwater ports is also underway in Lekki, near Lagos, and at Ibaka in Akwa Ibom River State. The Lekki deepwater port is still in a starting phase but both these developments will be critical, particularly to handle trans-shipping.</p><h4>How can you expand the capacity utilization of the dry ports in Nigeria?</h4><p>Dry ports and extensions are key, and will provide stimulus to the economy. We want our dry ports to be close to where we construct our new railways, especially the Lagos-Kano railway.</p><h4>What role does Nigeria want to play within the West African Regional Rail integration?</h4><p>We are developing this integrated system, because the amount of cargo and services that can be transported within the region is huge. It is an ECOWAS driven project and will facilitate greater trade and development of solid minerals, finished goods, agriculture, and so on, boosting the economic development of the region.</p><h4>What is your assessment on the potential of Lagos as a transport hub within the ECOWAS?</h4><p>We need more airlines coming to Nigeria and the region. This is starting to change and more airlines are coming here, such as Alitalia, Air France, United, Delta, Turkish Airlines, and Lufthansa. However, we still need more regional airlines to connect our 22 airports. Promotion of inter-regional flights and transport routes is also key to this development. In the next five years we aim to have a range of regional flights. </p><h4>After South Africa, Nigeria's air travel sector is the second largest in sub-Saharan Africa. How are you working to maintain this privileged position?</h4><p>We have fixed the communications aspect of air travel, and everything concerning safety, to ensure that we minimize the risk of all preventable accidents. We are also building more connections with airlines. For example, Turkish Airlines will begin flights to Port Harcourt, on top of its flights to Lagos and Abuja. There is huge volume of trade going on in Nigeria, and air travel will expand to cater to these growing needs and demands. The government has plans to concede the management of four airports to improve services and create higher standards. The four airports in question are Abuja, Kano, Lagos, and Port Harcourt.</p><h4>What kind of legacy would you like to leave after your term of office?</h4><p>For me, the most important project for the next four years is the railway project. This will change the country greatly and have a positive impact on the economic development of Nigeria. It is a NGN4 trillion project, which is totally unprecedented. The impact will be felt in all sectors of the economy and provide employment, contributing to Nigeria at both a macro and micro level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since its establishment in 2013, what have been the major achievements of the group?</h4><p>When we were established, the government was looking to take the welfare decisions away from Samruk-Kazyna in order to reinvent and reactivate them. At Samruk, the development institutions were only a portion of the assets. Previously at Samruk, our focus was on industrial assets such as mining, oil and gas, railroads, the airline company, electricity, and chemicals. Development institutions were never the focus of management, although they play a critical role in the economy, especially during difficult economic times. The banking system was in bad shape because of the overwhelming debt burden; it was not functioning as it had prior to the 2008 crisis. The government took an active role of investing in the economy through various programs, and it created efficient instruments and institutions. The decision was to relieve Samruk of certain development institutions and establish a management company, which is our holding, and it will basically make them more efficient and more effective. When the government trusts in the effectiveness of these instruments, it invests through us by channeling government investment into the economy.</p><h4>How are specific initiatives, particularly relating to the Roadmap 2020 and programs for the development of the region 2020, being driven?</h4><p>We engage in many government programs that vary in size and scope. The industrial program has initiatives such as Kazakh National Development, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan, and the Investment Fund of Kazakhstan, all of whom play a critical role. We finance many industrial projects, as they provide various instruments, such as lines of credit, export financing, and credit insurance; we can also do equity investments and private equity investments. Because we posses this wide range of financial instruments and services, we can make tailor-made decisions and solutions for the needs of the entrepreneur or investors who want to invest in Kazakhstan. In terms of burgeoning sectors, the next big area is the development of SMEs. The government has tasked Baiterek with increasing the SME portion of GDP. When Baiterek was established, the contribution of SMEs to GDP was around 19%. Today, two-and-a half-years later, this figure has grown to 25%, and almost 75% of all the financing provided in 2015 to non-mining and non-service sectors of the economy for SMEs was provided by Baiterek Holding. When you take into account the banking system, private investors, and local private sources of the business owners who are reinvesting back into business, 75% of all investment channeled into SME development was provided by Baiterek. This shows the scale at which we are engaged and that the government recognizes that we have become an efficient instrument through which it can effect SME development. The third largest area is the housing program, which is related to the social aspects of government activity. We are the main operators in the regional development program of housing investments through our subsidiaries. Our task for this year is to renovate and complete 7,000 apartments across Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How are your operations impacted by the $600 million infrastructure investment deal that was signed last month with CITIC from China?</h4><p>Since the establishment of the Baiterek, we have made a concerted effort to attract foreign investment, and we were especially successful during President Nazarbayev's trip to China. We managed to sign investment deals that will bring almost $6.5 billion to Kazakhstan, some of which are coming from long-term soft credit lines, while others come from private direct investment. The $600 million fund that we signed with CITIC Capital is an example of when foreign investors use Baiterek as a reliable and stable partner; while they provide us with credit, they are also taking the business risk with us and establishing the fund that will make private equity investments both in Kazakhstan and in the region. The focus of the fund will be Kazakhstan, Customs Union countries, and Central Asia, and in terms of industries, the focus is on mining and logistics, agriculture, food processing, energy, and infrastructure. That is not the first fund that we established with CITIC; five years ago the first fund, CITIC Kazyna, was established with $200 million, and today it is fully invested. So CITIC had a positive experience in Kazakhstan and decided to go ahead with further and more significant investment. This $600 million is not the limit; our plan is to increase the fund to $1 billion and we have interest from other sovereign and private foreign funds that would like to join. We believe that in the next year we can actually increase the amount to $1 billion, and this will be significant.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Baiterek in 2016?</h4><p>The economic climate is volatile due to the drop in oil prices and the situation in Russia. Therefore, it is time for Baiterek to become a locomotive for the economy. This is the time when development institutions can show that they are capable of pushing the economy ahead, creating new jobs, and assisting business in their investments despite the current economic difficulties.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Xerox wants to move away from just being a provider of document technologies to a services company. How has Xerox Emirates implemented this strategy into its business model?</h4><p>It would be more accurate to say that Xerox is broadening its portfolio by building stronger solutions and service offerings as part of our core proposition to customers. In this respect, in Xerox Emirates, we are developing our organizational structure to be able to “Sell, Deliver, and Manage" solutions and services. There have been many developments in the software platform that resides in Multi-function devices and printers, which enables a wide range of benefits, from diagnostics that provide advance warning of toner usage, wear on parts, to our ConnectKey platform that enables us to automate work processes. For example, an icon can be created that enables documents to be scanned and automatically forwarded to specific locations within a customer's organization. The implication for our organization is that we are moving more resources to focus on customer experience and the delivery of service levels. We are investing in the skills of pre-sales analysts and application developers to make our customer's work more efficient. The impact of these changes on our business model is that we see an increase in software and solutions revenue, and we expect this to accelerate over the medium term.</p><h4>What innovative products have you launched?</h4><p>Xerox innovation continues to be around solving real business problems and how customers can better leverage our technology. Customers are less concerned about speeds and feeds and more concerned about improving productivity and reducing cost. So by changing from the traditional “break-fix model," which was reactive, we offer proactive support, where technology does the work, informing us ahead of time when a device needs attention. We call this “Invisible Service." There are also innovations around print management software that enable auditing and accounting by users, departments, or even complete organizations. These developments reduce waste as well as help to lower their carbon footprint. The biggest development is the introduction of ConnectKey® technology. Xerox printers do more than simply scan, fax, and copy. They're productivity powerhouses that help you get more done, faster. With Xerox® ConnectKey® Technology, the multifunction printer becomes the center of a complete productivity ecosystem right out of the box. Print from just about anywhere with mobile print services. Scan directly to cloud services. Customers use simple apps for complicated, often-performed tasks. This latest technology transforms the way people work.</p><h4>Outsourcing of government spells a major untapped opportunity in the Middle East. Has Xerox Emirates done anything in this regard?</h4><p>Yes, the government policy is rapidly demanding suppliers to advance the pace of technology solutions, and in every initiative, such as smart cities and smart government, they are demanding companies like Xerox to raise the bar. And we are ready for it. We are already helping ministries and government departments in the UAE and the region with services from business process outsourcing, information management, and content management to professional services, and from printer fleet management to complete managed print services. We are seeing a closer integration or convergence of services and the managed print environment. Customers in the early phase of managed print were happy with an assessment of what was being printed and a solution to reduce costs. That has now migrated and is evolving very fast. Managed print services is no more about basic printing, it's about managed document services. This next phase is all about security and integration with cloud and mobile technologies. This convergence is broadening the conversation about how we can help customers be more efficient and improve business processes to save money.</p><h4>Sustainability initiatives are on the rise, especially in the UAE, a country that plays an instrumental role in promoting sustainable development and clean-energy initiatives. How is Xerox meeting this demand?</h4><p>At Xerox, sustainability is a way of doing business, rather than a cost of doing business. We focused on environmental performance and sustainability—long before it was popular to do so—in order to positively affect our operations, offerings, customers, and communities. We were among the first technology companies to set a company-wide target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2012, at the conclusion of our 10-year Energy Challenge program, emissions were cut by 42% and energy consumption was reduced by 31%. Our new corporate-wide goal is to reduce energy consumption by 20% by 2020, from a 2012 baseline. Xerox in 2015 was ranked #4 in Corporate Responsibility Magazine's "100 Best Corporate Citizens List." In this market, there is a greater customer focus on the environment and sustainability, too. Here in the UAE we help recycle consumed printer cartridges. We have a contracted an agency that collects empty cartridges from our customer premises. With the growth in the awareness of this service, the amount of collection has grown and we collect between 500 and 600 kilograms of cartridges as part of an initiative that we fund through our marketing department.</p><h4>Where do you see the industry going in the next few years?</h4><p>I think convergence is the key word because technology advancement is helping to integrate many aspects of the way we work and play. In education, content can be accessed from anywhere at any time. In healthcare, the government recently announced that, by 2020, all patient records would be digitized. Technological developments will help Dubai become a healthcare destination. In infrastructure, the use of GPS enables smart transport. Xerox has a solution that is live in Latin America whereby in a city the entire bus transportation is managed intelligently. There are sensors in the buses that feed back to the control so they can know to put out more buses or reduce the number in off-peak hours. It means that timetables can be planned to maximize efficiency. Technologies like GPS and mobile applications are working together to provide solutions that have not been thought of. With multi-function devices, we expect more applications in the coming years that will help other work processes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What additional possibilities for cooperation do you see in the framework of the Austrian OSCE chairmanship in 2017?</h4><p>Austria, in general, attaches great importance to multilateral diplomacy. The Austrian OSCE chairmanship will build on the excellent work of the current German OSCE Chairmanship. We are fully aware of the central and sensitive issue of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The dramatic increase of violence in 2015 along the line of contact is a matter of serious concern. I am aware of the frustration of Azerbaijan with respect to the efforts of the Co-Chairs of the Minsk group in solving the issue. Nevertheless, we are convinced that the Minsk Group is the only practical platform for conflict resolution. We, therefore, hope that that Azerbaijan will continue to work closely with the Co-Chairs of the Minsk Group and within all other structures of the OSCE. The solution based on the Madrid Principles of 2007 is still on the table and, as far as I have been informed, the Russian Federation is promoting a similar solution along these lines. In this regard, we regret the decision of the government of Azerbaijan in July last year to close the office of the OSCE Project Coordinator in Baku. This step has unfortunately significantly weakened the positive role of the OSCE in Azerbaijan and might also carry the danger of an isolation of Azerbaijan within the OSCE. In the light of the importance of OSCE as a conflict solving organization, Azerbaijan might be interested in reviewing its decision and consider a reopening of the office. I am sure a discussion about the exact mandate of the office is possible taking into account Azerbaijan's concerns. Austria would be glad to offer its good offices and assist in placing a stepping stone to the solution of this long lasting conflict.</p><h4>With an active Austria-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce in place in Baku, what is your assessment of the current level of economic relations between Austria and Azerbaijan? </h4><p>Economic relations between Austria and Azerbaijan can be qualified as well-established and on a solid base. Azerbaijan enjoys a significant trade surplus with Austria due to its exports of oil, which comprise over 90% of exports. This economic data illustrates the high dependency of Azerbaijan on one export commodity. This dependence has increased Azerbaijan's vulnerability in times of crises, as 50% of GNP and 97% of exports stem from the oil and gas sector. Austria appreciates that Azerbaijan, under the leadership of President Aliyev, is trying to introduce reforms and diversify its economy. This is a difficult and long-term process, especially as most countries in the region are facing similar problems. I would like to mention that bilateral trade has increased nearly tenfold in the last 10 years. In 1H2015, Austria was Azerbaijan's fifth most important import partner. In 2010, the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber opened an office in Baku, with the aim of contributing to the development and expansion of bilateral trade relations. Last year, two business missions with more than 30 Austrian companies from various industrial sectors were organized. In addition, the office of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber supported the activities of individual businesses and entrepreneurs. </p><h4>As more than 45 Austrian companies are currently operating in Azerbaijan, what role can Austrian companies play in assisting the development of Azerbaijan's technical and technological sectors? </h4><p>President Aliyev has mentioned his eagerness to improve and diversify the Azerbaijani economy several times. Austria is ready to work together with Azerbaijan in this endeavor. Many Austrian companies are engaged in the planning, architecture, and construction business. As a supplier of high-quality machinery in the field of oil and gas, Austria has contributed to the technological development of Azerbaijan. This is also true for the pharmaceutical sector, which is an important Austrian export to Azerbaijan. Furthermore, there is ongoing cooperation in the field of education. The strengthening of university and academic cooperation in the technological field would therefore be beneficial. </p><h4>Which areas offer the most potential for Austria and Azerbaijan to increase mutual cooperation efforts moving forward? </h4><p>Azerbaijan and Austria in many respects share similar features. Our countries and population are of approximately the same size, we share similar climate zones, especially mountain ranges and forests, and geopolitically, both countries are placed between large and powerful neighbors on essential trade routes. I believe that both countries can profit and learn from each other's experience. As the focus of Azerbaijan is shifting to the diversification of the economy, Austria would like to be a substantial partner. Tourism offers excellent possibilities for an extended partnership. The Austrian Tourism University of Krems closely cooperates with the University of Tourism and Management of Azerbaijan. Austria is working in close cooperation with the administration of the Old City of Baku on the restoration of several monuments. We were successful in restoring the Maiden Tower, and now we are working on the restoration of the Baylar mosque and a grave in Shirvanshah palace. We have further plans which need closer discussions and would like to continue this work. The Shahdagh tourism complex is an excellent example where Austrian engineering met Azerbaijani wishes. One must not forget that Azerbaijan's main market for tourism is not Austria or Europe, but Russia and Iran. Tourist promotion, also in light of heavy regional competition, is essential. Austria has great experience in this sector and would like to assist Azerbaijan with its expertise in this field. Another important field with huge potential for cooperation is the agricultural sector, from production to the promotion of products, taking into account the high sanitary standards products need to enter the European market. Another area of cooperation could be an exchange of expertise in the area of mountain farming, as substantial parts of both our territories are covered by mountains. Mountain farming is a niche product, but essential for local communities and has proved to be a corner stone of Austrian agriculture, especially as Austria has placed itself as the Feinkostladen,  or delicatessen store, of Europe.  In addition, the areas of machinery and plants (in particular in the oil and gas industry as well as in food processing) and the renewal of the energy infrastructure offer significant opportunities for Austrian companies. Last but not least, I would like to underline that Azerbaijan, as Austria, is a country on an important international trade link. We are following with great interest Azerbaijan's endeavor to position itself on the cross roads of the silk and spice route. I believe that Austrian know-how in the road and railway sectors could be beneficial for Azerbaijan. I believe that the future of Azerbaijan will be in its function as a trade hub, as it is excellently placed for both directions, East-West and North-South. In this respect it is worth mentioning that Austria has great experience in the field of railway construction. Austrian companies are global leaders when it comes to machinery and equipment for the development and maintenance of railway infrastructure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>South32 was founded last May. Can you tell us about the project and the role of Mozal within the group?</h4><p>On May 25, 2015 BHP Billiton completed its demerger, which saw the creation of South32 as an independent company. South32 is a globally diversified metals and mining company with high-quality and well-maintained operations mining and producing bauxite, alumina, aluminum, energy and metallurgical coal, manganese, nickel, silver, lead, and zinc in Australia, South Africa, Brazil, Colombia, and Mozambique with the Mozal smelter. The roots of South32 are in the Southern Hemisphere, with a head office in Perth and regional hubs in Perth and Johannesburg, South Africa. South32 listed in May 2015 and our securities trade on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), London Stock Exchange (LSE), and the NY American Depositary Receipts Programme under the listing code of S32. We believe that, when we work together, we create a brighter future for all.</p><h4>What implications does this demerger have for Mozal, if any?</h4><p>South32 operates using a regional operating model. Our businesses are run by people who understand their communities and the environment in which they operate. Our African businesses are managed from a regional hub in Johannesburg, with our Australian and South American businesses managed through Perth. There is a lot more attention being given by senior management and the CEO to developing strategies that are most suitable for the assets in operation in Africa. This integrated approach allows us to more closely align our businesses with the needs of our stakeholders and empowers us to optimize support functions regionally to deliver more efficient and productive operations. Following the demerger, Mozal became part of South32, and produces in excess of 560,000 tons of primary aluminum using Aluminium Pechiney AP35 technology to produce standard aluminum ingots. The smelter currently employs 1,200 direct employees and 700 contractors and has been a contributor to many more indirect jobs. In the community, Mozal has developed more than 200 projects, spending over $34m to provide a governance framework and address multiple challenges within community projects. Recently, Mozal signed an agreement under which it will supply 50,000 tons of aluminum to Midal, one of the world's largest manufacturers of aluminum cables.</p><h4>In 2014, you told us that the goal was to increase efficiency and productivity within the company. How have you gone about doing that?</h4><p>We focused on key value drivers and operational indicators that would improve our energy efficiency and our production efficiency, focusing a lot on general productivity and cost improvements. The result was an efficiency improvement of approximately $40 million, a very successful achievement.</p><h4>As a major exporter, how has the depreciation of the local currency helped increase your revenues in Mozambique?</h4><p>Our commodities revenues are determined by the London Metal Exchange price, which is a published price of aluminum. The benefit in terms of currency depreciation is really more on the cost side. Our costs that are conducted in the local currency have seen relative savings, but we also incur dollar-based costs, for instance on a few of our raw materials.</p><h4>To where do you export primarily, and do you anticipate supplying more aluminum for the domestic market in the coming years? </h4><p>We export mostly to Europe. Of our remaining output, about 50,000 tons per annum goes to Midal. There is of course the potential to supply more of our production to the domestic market, but speculating on these developments is difficult as it depends on various factors of business confidence and the specific markets of related industries. The activities downstream from Midal should be one key area of focus. Developing this aspect would stimulate production that can be utilized in the domestic market. Once this is sustainably implemented there could be new sources of profitability.</p><h4>What are Mozal's biggest achievements in Mozambique?</h4><p>We have been making many improvements to productivity, but we have also been doing a lot of work in the community as well. We attracted some funds from our previous shareholder, the BHP Billiton Sustainable Communities Fund, to invest in the community and focus on a few large projects. Around $28 million was the total project funding two years ago. This will go toward social causes and will be completed over the next three years. These projects include: the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; the Livelihoods Empowerment and Development (LEAD) Project, an initiative that works with more than 50 producer organizations that represent farmers to increase their income and business opportunities, improve production capacity through farm-level training, and facilitate access to financing; the child and maternal health care project, which focuses on improving prenatal and newborn care, infant nutrition, and child development practices; and the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) project that aims to transform lives through access to safe water. Our programs have been well received by the community. One of our focus areas has been to become the employer of choice, as well. We have been doing much work in terms of the employee value proposition, and earlier this year we began a housing project for our employees that is due to be completed in 2017. Among many other projects, Mozal is also implementing an integrated project, improving community access to quality HIV care and other health services in the Boane district, which complements ongoing efforts and further strengthens awareness and prevention in communities while building capacity within existing health units. The creation of shared value is what drives our decision-making processes. We work to understand the needs of all our stakeholders, including communities and shareholders, and align our business to deliver on their needs.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>The global commodity-based economy is currently under a tremendous cost pressure because of current market prices. Aluminum is not immune to these factors, so Mozal has also been under pressure. That said, safety is one of Mozal's business pillars, and we are not making any compromises on that front, regardless of prices. Safety remains our top priority, and results speak for themselves. We have focused instead on increasing efficiency of production and energy use. We want to operate our assets to the fullest and become benchmark operators in terms of performance indicators. We are also committed to continuing our community projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Thumbay Group's activities span 13 segments, including health, education, and real estate. What was the process of your diversification?</h4><p>Our core businesses are in education, healthcare, and research. Although we are diversified across 13 sectors, most of the subsidiary businesses such as pharmacies, nutrient outlets, health clubs, retail opticals, publishing, health communications, hospitality and trading, marketing and distribution, diagnostics, and real estate are related to our core businesses. We have grown and diversified as per the Group's vision and our focus has been significant in the process. We consider intelligent diversification and timely innovation the mainstays of continued growth.</p><h4>What is Thumbay Group doing to meet the demand of the health sector in the UAE, which has grown 60% YoY?</h4><p>Our hospitals treat 2,500 patients daily. We deliver healthcare services through our four Thumbay Hospitals in Ajman, Dubai, Sharjah, and Fujairah, a 25-chair dental hospital in Dubai, five state-of-the-art Thumbay Clinics and Thumbay Labs in Ajman, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, and Umm Al Quwain, all in addition to Thumbay Pharmacy outlets across the UAE. Our network of hospitals and clinics are among the largest healthcare networks in the UAE. We offer the most modern treatment and infrastructure across all major specialties. Thumbay Clinics are envisioned as advanced family clinics that focus on personal services, affordability, and convenience, bringing superior healthcare to people's doorsteps. We plan to open many more academic hospitals, clinics, diagnostic labs, and pharmacies in the UAE, as well as abroad, to meet the ever-increasing demand for quality healthcare. There are many healthcare providers in the country, but we are different from every one of them. The difference is that all of our hospitals have an academic setup, and we are the only ones doing this in the private sector here. We have already entered the medical tourism field in a big way and plan to further expand our medical tourism services.</p><h4>Thumbay Group is actively engaged in turning Dubai into an international medical hub. What do you think are the best practices for successful medical tourism marketing?</h4><p>Dubai is now a leading international medical destination. The visionary leadership of this country has already recognized the medical tourism potential of the UAE and initiated several plans for projects to tap into its full extent. It is already doing its best, and there is a special visa for medical tourism already in place. Thumbay Medical Tourism (TMT) renders a large portfolio of travel and medical services to medical tourists from all over the world, and we also arrange on-demand translator services, accommodation services, customized treatment packages, preferred cuisine, travel arrangements, priority appointments, and airport transfer. Each medical tourist is attended to by a dedicated TMT staff. Most packages also include tourist site visits, a dedicated fleet of vehicles, and spa and recreational therapies. We now have the representative offices in Ghana, Nigeria, and other countries in order to bring in patients. We are ambitious in the medical tourism business and in the next five years we want to bring in 1,000 patients a day from 20 different countries. TMT has recently opened a Welcome Center at Sharjah International Airport, a first of its kind in the UAE, which serves as a facilitation center for medical tourists visiting the country through the airport, and will be their first point of contact in taking care of all their needs from the moment of arrival. More such centers are planned at the other airports in the UAE as well.</p><h4>Thumbay is set to build the region's biggest private academic hospital in Ajman. What are the targets of this master plan and how will it contribute to the UAE's development?</h4><p>The new hospital, which is expected to be completed by 2017-18, will be the biggest private academic hospital in the region. It is envisioned as a state-of-the-art, purpose-built, 400-bed smart facility, which will be the teaching hospital of Gulf Medical University. The hospital will be equipped with modern infrastructure and will be constructed over 320,000sqft and stand at four floors with over 120 clinics. The hospital will feature a special robotic pharmacy, a first of its kind in the region, and will have quaternary care facilities. The hospital will also have a fully fledged radiology department with PET-CT scan, a first of its kind in the northern Emirates. With the ultramodern facilities of the hospital, we aim to continue this tradition of providing high quality healthcare services at affordable costs. </p><h4>Thumbay is planning to open representative offices in 20 countries, as it aspires to become an iconic international brand. How is this plan evolving thus far?</h4><p>Plans are afoot to soon open an office in Nigeria, where we already have a representative. With the expansion projects underway in Ghana, we will soon have an office there as well. Offices are also planned in the other GCC countries, with the ones in Oman and Qatar expected to be operational in accordance with Thumbay Group's expansion plans there.</p><h4>What is Thumbay's prospect and strategic plan for 2016?</h4><p>We are following a strategic plan called Vision 2020, which outlines our expansion programs for the next five years. The new year will see many more new projects in the UAE and elsewhere. An important event will be the inauguration of Thumbay Hospital in Hyderabad, India. Our project in Ghana is in progress, and out of the 15 hospitals that we plan to open worldwide, those in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Ghana will be opening shortly. New outlets of Thumbay Pharmacy, Thumbay Clinics, Thumbay Labs, Nutri Plus Vita Stores, ZO &amp; MO Opticals, Body &amp; Soul Health Club &amp; Spa, and Blends and Brews Coffee Shoppe will also be opened in 2016.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the current estate of the health sector in the UAE?</h4><p>There are a lot of healthcare providers now, and the layman feels that it is going to get saturated; however, that is not true. The population is increasing, and with projects like Expo 2020 the population is growing in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. I am sure that more facilities like this will be needed, and the government is encouraging the private sector to develop healthcare and education—and for that we receive good support in this country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What actions has the agency taken over the past year to spur investment in the sector despite the fall in oil prices?</h4><p>The main purpose of our agency is to incorporate new reserves, and maintain and of course raise the production levels of oil and gas in the country. There are many opportunities to make changes in the sector, and the main issue is strategic planning. All the regulations over recent years have worked out pretty well, but of course, at the time, oil prices were high, at times above $100. With prices decreasing dramatically, we have to maximize all of our efforts to optimize production and become friendlier toward operators. The reason for the agency is not only to ensure that operators follow certain rules and criteria. We exist because these companies have come to the country and signed contracts. The most important task at first was to transform from being a state-owned agency to becoming a true service company. We went from being passive and became proactive partners working hand-in-hand with these companies.</p><h4>What was the first step you took in that direction?</h4><p>The first thing that we did was to draft the National Development Plan (PND), which is the roadmap for the government. On the energy side we had the opportunity to include measures that help businesses. The President committed to a program called PIPE 2.0, which defines plans to increase productivity and decrease unemployment.</p><h4>What is the ANH doing to promote investment in the offshore segment?</h4><p>Article 28 of the PND and Agreement 2 of 2015 allowed equal time conditions for offshore contracts awarded by 2014. That means the period of exploration and production paired for all offshore contracts to 9 and 30 years, respectively, while before it was 6 and 24. On the other hand, in a joint effort with the Ministry of Mines and Energy we are preparing the draft technical regulations for offshore activities, which we hope will be adopted by the Ministry in early 2016. Finally, the government issued new rules allowing the declaration of tax-free zones for offshore exploration and production activities, which significantly reduces the rate of income tax and provides benefits for sales tax and tariff.</p><h4>How important is the development of unconventionals for Colombia's oil industry?</h4><p>We have to find a way to increase production and make room for unconventionals. We need help in four main areas: The first is unconventionals, the second is offshore activities, the third is enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and the fourth is coal bed methane (CBM). There are only a few individuals in Colombia lucky enough to have had exposure to these areas in previous roles. We need help from countries that have extensive experience in these areas, so we went to Australia, which was the first country to introduce CBM, and we have just signed an MoU for CBM regulation development. To gain more knowledge about offshore activities we have signed agreements with the governments of both Australia and the UK. For unconventionals, we are in the process of signing an MoU with Canada, and we have had closely cooperation with the US in this area. For EOR we are learning from Canada and the US. Finally, we have requested the government of Norway to integrate Colombia into the Oil Development Program, which seeks to reduce poverty with resources from the sector.</p><h4>What were the results of the Baker &amp; McKenzie study for the ANH to boost competitiveness?</h4><p>We identified four major areas around all issues that could definitely be improved: improved prospectivity, a strengthened a ANH, an increase in the economic attractiveness of the projects, and time conscious and efficient processes. The first on the list was the quality of our geological and geophysical (G&amp;G) information. In the past this information would only be provided when an operator or other party expressed interest in acquiring a specific block. We realized that we needed to increase our prospecting efforts by providing more G&amp;G data on a permanent basis. At the same time we are going to provide investors with four additional ingredients: an environmental baseline, infrastructure information, a social baseline, as there are some communities that are opposed to the oil business and other communities that are far more supportive of it, and security information. As for the strengthening of the ANH, our market strategy will be based on two central elements: a customer service approach in accordance with our customer segmentation model and a permanent licensing model. Regarding economically attractive projects, advisors recommend us to make adjustments to exploratory programs for onshore frontier areas and increase competitiveness through potential adjustments to fiscal measures in order to reduce government take for frontier areas. Finally, we wish to optimize licensing times.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You founded SAS in 1994. Who are your primary clients?</h4><p>I started in SAS to do investment, starting with stock brokerage. We soon added corporate financial advisory services, consulting for companies that want to go to market to raise money. Apart from companies, we also advise government institutions. Later, as we established ourselves, we followed accounts and went into asset management—pension funds, provident funds, individual wealth, and, of course, our own investment funds, such as the Fortune Fund. These are our three broad areas; stock brokerage, asset management, and corporate finance advisory services.</p><h4>How did you then develop Strategic Initiatives Ltd?</h4><p>Knowing how small the market for these services is, the deals being few and far between. Instead of waiting for companies to come to us for advice to raise money to fund their projects, I decided we looked for opportunities to pursue our own projects. I started Strategic Initiatives Ltd and identified the sectors that were most in need. One area we looked at was the energy sector. I went out and presented a case to my Chinese counterparts, who came in and established Sunon Asogli Power Ltd and initially invested $203 million to build a 200MW combined-cycle gas-fired plant. There is an ongoing expansion for another 360MW, and by May of next year total capacity will be 560MW. We also worked on Africa World Airlines, again with Chinese partners, and this has become the leader in the small domestic market. We hope that next year we will see more expansion and collaboration with other airlines. We are now mostly targeting renewable energy. We are looking at the mini-hydropower segment through a new subsidiary, Lighting and Construction Africa Company Ltd. We have submitted an application for a provisional license covering nine mini-hydro sites, and we are also looking at solar. Hopefully, perhaps within the next two weeks, we will submit an application for a provisional license to build solar power plants in the Upper West Region of Ghana. We are also working with an American company, Zoetic Global, which has a new technology in hydropower production, the in-stream augur turbine. We are negotiating a PPP with the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG). The augurs, designed to be deployed in fast-flowing rivers, have the potential to revolutionize power generation. We will be the first company to undertake large-scale the commercialization of this technology. We plan to generate 100MW from the post-wash section of the Akosombo Dam, without building any new dam on the river. If it succeeds, we can replicate that at many dam sites across the world. SAS has undergone a major transformation since its founding in 1994. We have become entrepreneurial, and are now in the business of creating businesses.</p><h4>How would you rate access to capital for local mobilization in the energy sector?</h4><p>The kind of investment you are talking about is substantial. The difficulty in Ghana is how to mobilize these resources. The resources are there, but the market is still young. The pension industry has been monopolized for many years by SSNIT. Independent pension funds have only recently been allowed, which meant that for a long time big projects that should be funded from pension funds had to rely on just one source. The second headache is the interest regime we have, which makes it impossible to borrow. The monetary policy that has been implemented over the years defines inflation in a simplistic way, as too much money is chasing too few goods. For me, that is the biggest bottleneck to raising capital in this country. Who wants to invest in a risky power plant project or an airline when the treasuries market offers you close to 30%, risk free, and the fixed-income market similarly offers you close to 30%, without risk? Who would want to invest in equities under these circumstances?</p><h4>What are your expectations for the future in that respect? What sectors are most ready for growth?</h4><p>One of the most attractive sectors now is energy. Per-capita consumption of electricity is low here compared to other countries. Infrastructure is generally promising. For example, our road density is also low, presenting extensive opportunity for growth, as is the case with energy. That is one of the reasons why Africa is seen as the next frontier for development. The story gets more interesting if you look at the fact that we export our bauxite to Jamaica and then import aluminum. We should develop an efficient aluminum industry, and if we can convert the bauxite to aluminum, so much of the value addition will be done here and many jobs will be created here, with ramifications for sectors that are dependent on the commodity. Agriculture is important because it employs more than half of our people but contributes only about 22% to GDP. There is a lot of opportunity for enhancing agricultural production, given all the fertile land we have.</p><h4>What role will international partners play in this?</h4><p>Much of this we cannot do without international capital. The local equity market is small, and long-term savings are not well developed. As far as local investors are concerned, there is competition between equities and fixed income. Fixed income will win any day at this rate. Mobilizing local resources for investment is tough. That gives foreign investors a field day. However, for projects whose viability is entirely dependent on local consumption, I believe we should be able to mobilize our resources locally, but for the interest rate environment. That is why at the World Trade Centre Accra, our objective is to mobilize investment flows into Ghana.</p><h4>What would you tell people looking to invest in Ghana?</h4><p>Our country is attractive. Ghana is still one of the most peaceful countries in the region. It is safer to walk on the streets of Accra than Lagos or Johannesburg. We still have a young population, and a small but growing middle class. When it comes to human resources development, we are very strong in terms of education. And we have widespread electricity access, reaching over 80% of the country. We also have great access to the rest of West Africa, with the capacity to produce more power to serve the sub-region under the West African power pool program. We also speak English, which makes doing business easier.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the milestones and highlights of Goodyear's presence in Thailand?</h4><p>The first thing is that we are here. We are one of the only two Thai manufacturers that have been here this long; therefore, our commitment to Thailand and the domestic market goes back a long way. Many of our dealers, surprisingly, have been aligned with us as partners for that long. When I go the market and visit our dealers, I am now meeting second- and third-generation owners and it is gratifying to see what successes we are able to achieve working so closely together. A lot of them are highly educated and very sophisticated. Our longevity is parallel to the longevity of our branded retail distribution system. We are supported by our presence in Indonesia, Malaysia and China. The “Made in Thailand for Thais" concept is paramount; people want locally made tires. However, there is a need to supplement that from other plants with specialist capabilities. For example, for commercial truck tires we bring in tires from Indonesia. There are certain small volume tires in Thailand that we cannot justify producing here; therefore, we import them from China where they manufacture considerable quantities of the same tire. We supplement the business from our regional footprint; it is not a stand-alone Thai business in its own right. Nonetheless, we have a large export base out of Thailand. As a result, we are able to offer local consumers and dealers a full product portfolio. The most significant piece of technology to build the broadest range of tire products is here in Thailand, not in Indonesia or Malaysia. We have one of the most sophisticated pieces of equipment here that we installed a few years ago to give us the capability to build certain tires. That capability means that we can sell a full range of passenger tires here in Thailand and import only the premium top-end products.</p><h4>How much do you cater for the export market compared to local demand?</h4><p>About half of what we manufacture gets exported on aggregate. Hence, what predominately stays in Thailand from a passenger and truck tire component goes to the OEMs and replacement tire markets. With aviation tires, for example, we have key customers, such as Thai Airways, and we also supply Lion Air in Indonesia. The vast majority of our aviation business is exported. In terms of the aviation business, there are only two plants where Goodyear manufacturers tires around the world. One is here and the other is in the US; those are our two centers of excellence. Because the design and production of aviation tires are so heavily regulated, it means that this is an extraordinarily advanced and strictly monitored, audited plant. We also build passenger and truck tires that must adhere to these same exceptionally high standards, which gives us the highest quality that you can possibly imagine. In terms of exports, we are a major provider of tires all over the world, but predominately to Australia, New Zealand, ASEAN markets, and China.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the automotive industry in the next year?</h4><p>There are two lines of consumption: the new car purchases and the replacement industry. The amount of cars that are on the road, whatever age they are, determines how many tires there will be in the industry. If you have 10 million cars on the road, a significant portion of those cars will require new tires approximately every two or three years. The second part that drives consumption of tires is the OEMs. The OEM industry has experienced a slump. The OEM buys tires from us, puts them on cars, and sells them domestically or exports them. Exports have been relatively stable, but domestic car sales have slowed down; therefore, OEM demand has slowed too, along with the replenishment of the car parts. However, what has not slowed down is that the new car buyers in 2012 and 2013 saw a massive spike for two years. As a result, the car part sector significantly increased. As a result, there is a distorted position right now in the marketplace. Car owners have to keep their vehicles because they borrowed money at low interest rates but now they need to replace the tires because the cars are three or four years old. Currently, the tire industry is doing well, even though new car sales are not. The question is what it will mean for us in 2019 and 2020.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>For the industry, there are things to be worked on over 2016 and we hope it will more forward successfully. There is some resistance in that; however, we are the sixth largest exporter of tires in the world at $3.4 billion, while Indonesia is at $1.9 billion and Malaysia is probably half a billion. Therefore, Thailand can set the standard for the region. In terms of the company, we have made a great effort over the past three years to build our retail network capability, which allows us to have a clear understanding of the channels we will use to go to market, how to brand it, and where it will go; for example, showrooms, wholesales, or OEMs. Before, we had 36 branded Autocare stores in Thailand; today, it is 61. We have spent millions of baht outfitting and branding these stores and we are building 10 more this year and 10 more in 2017. They are big businesses that are owned by the dealer. That is one channel, and it is a dominant and successful one for us. We are a major supplier to modern trade partners and to the automotive industry care showrooms. I probably spend 60% of my effort on building capability in the dealer network. At the end of the day, I don't see anything in the foreseeable five-10 years that will significantly change how we sell tires in Thailand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent has the Colon Free Trade Zone (CFZ) been affected by the economic climate in the region?</h4><p>We can directly relate our 10% fall in exports last year to what is happening in the region. Venezuela and Colombia are major commercial partners, and last year Venezuela went from representing 20% of our business to 6%. That has impacted our overall performance because it is a huge economy and it is hard to replace that type of volume. We won our case with the World Trade Organization (WTO) over the import tariffs that Colombia imposed on us. Colombia has exercised its right to appeal, however, so we are still waiting for a final decision on whether these restrictions on clothing and footwear, two of our most important commodities, will be lifted. We hope that we will see in the near future some change in both of these situations: a change in the economic situation of Venezuela, and a lifting of the trade restrictions in Colombia. </p><h4>Do you believe the CFZ needs to reinvent its business model to adapt to the needs of MNCs?</h4><p>We do not need to reinvent the business of buying and selling. What we do need to do is confirm what is happening in the region. The Minister of Finance has commissioned a bid for an internationally recognized firm to carry out a deep investigation into the situation and determine what needs to be done. We want to understand if we are lacking competitiveness, if the incentives that used to exist no longer function, or if the expenses are too high compared to other economic zones. We will not reinvent, but instead analyze and reorient as part of what we started doing last year, as well as traveling to different countries to promote the benefits of a regional distribution center to more multinational companies.</p><h4>What is the CFZ's role within the redevelopment of Colon City?</h4><p>The Colon Puerto Libre project is trying to copy the success of what happened in Casco Viejo in Panama City where, as a result of the incentives, we see the American Trade Hotel in a building that was considered ready for demolition 10 years ago. The idea is to combine the incentives from a property perspective along with economic incentives, because we are aware of the attraction that the free zone represents to small and medium buyers, and the potential for creating a free port from a retail perspective is something that would act as a magnet for tourism. Through providing incentives for the rehabilitation of these old buildings, we could recover the former glory of Colon. Architects, urban planners, and other experts agree that Colon is a beautifully laid out city with a lot of historical value, and that it would attract a lot of tourism if it were properly developed. The role of the free zone is to serve as the warehouse for all of the stores that were set up in the city. The free zone administration will provide the IT platform for those companies that set up so that we can then provide the customs and tax authorities with proper tracking and tracing of the goods that go from the free zone to the stores and are then later sold as duty free shopping for both tourists as well as Panamanian citizens. The idea is that the wholesaler for goods like perfume, clothing, or electronics would be able to have a retail point of sale in the city, so that a three-story building would have a commercial storefront on the ground floor, offices on the second floor, and perhaps loft apartments on the third floor. That is the broad vision of what we would hope to accomplish.</p><h4>Can Cuba leverage the free trade zone?</h4><p>Cuba has traditionally been an economic partner of the free zone; it has always purchased here, so we hope to see more of the small and medium entrepreneurs as well as the large trading companies able to arrive here with improved visa requirements. What we hope is that more people will result in more business. Any opportunity to bring more qualified buyers is always welcome.</p><h4>How will the Panama Canal expansion impact the Free Trade Zone?</h4><p>Approximately 90% of the inbound trade in the free zone moves by sea, and the expansion is oriented toward being able to handle larger container vessels. Our desire as a free zone is to get containers off of the ship, into the free zone, and then resold to the region. Expanding the canal means bigger boats, more containers, and greater opportunities for moving containers from ships into the free zone. We are excited because we also hope that this will open up possibilities for expanding our area of operation into the US. As those boats come through here and on to the east coast, there might be possibilities for companies interested in establishing a value adding operation here in the free zone for their goods before they get to stores in either the US or in our traditional area of operation. We have already had some visitors interested in exploring the new options that an expanding canal represents, such as certain companies interested in counter floats from the US to Asia, rather than from Asia to the US. Our challenge is to get in front of more multinationals to be able to present what is a compelling business case.</p><h4>What is the government doing to ensure the benefits of the free zone are felt by everyone in Colon?</h4><p>President Varela has a special connection with the province through both his wife, whose family member was one of the original founders of the free zone, as well as his own mother, who was a teacher here. His aim is to leave Colon better than it was when he became President. Our role is to support this project, so we have donated an area of land for the building of 5,000 homes, creating a new suburb that is expected to have over 20,000 residents once completed. The renovation of Colon City is an ambitious project, with overall investments estimated at around $700 million. This is a huge undertaking, aimed at improving the life of many of the current residents of the city who are living in inhumane conditions because of a lack of investment and the state of the old buildings in which they are currently living.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>With the spotlight on Panama because of the inauguration of the expansion, there will be a lot of multinational companies interested in coming to explore the opportunities. We are hoping that a few of those companies will come to Colon on our new four-lane highway and visit the free zone.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the primary achievements during your tenure?</h4><p>Since we arrived here at the Ministry about three years ago we have made some good inroads. We are expanding the ports of Tema and Takoradi, we have boosted infrastructure, and we have procured public transportation buses. We have also reviewed the legislation of the Driver and Vehicle License Authority and decentralized the service, meaning that people do not have to travel to Accra to renew a license or access services.</p><h4>The aviation sector has received a large boost of support. Can you tell us about your Ministry's ambitions for that sector?</h4><p>We are expanding airport facilities and upgrading terminals in six of our cities. At our primary international airport, Kotoka International Airport (KIA), we have largely refurbished the arrivals hall. We are also constructing a third terminal to increase the capacity of KIA, which we are supporting in its drive to become a regional hub. The contract for that terminal has been signed with a Turkish company. We are also expanding facilities at Tamale Airport, and we revamped and refurbished Kumasi Airport as well. We have recently cut the sod to build an aerodrome in the Volta region. From the other side, we have worked on our bilateral air services agreements, expanding 5th Freedom Rights. We did this with South African Airlines' route to Washington, DC. Presently, we are reviewing some of our existing bilateral air services agreements so that we can make the airport more marketable and, of course, more attractive for additional carriers. We are also expanding cargo facilities, particularly in the northern part of the country, which is home to most agricultural production.</p><h4>The Port Authority of Ghana was recently judged as the preferred port in West Africa. How are you building on that success?</h4><p>The port has shown substantial leadership and vision and we are proud of this achievement. The port facilities of course needed to be expanded. Maritime Port Services is investing $1.5 billion in Tema port's infrastructure, building deeper berths of 16m, as well as adding two additional lanes to the linking motorway, transforming it into a six-lane road. The port has modernized the facilities and we are developing an e-clearance process. We have since introduced a single-window platform to make the cargo clearance process more efficient by way of processing the bills of lading and other documents for cargo clearance. We are an import-dependent country, and we receive cargo for our landlocked neighbors. Another development that the Tema port is trying to do is build a dividing terminal so that all containerized carrying vehicles and cars will be going to that terminal, where the removal will take place. We are also developing a container terminal, so instead of having all the containers stay within the port waiting to be moved, they can stay outside of the ports while the owners of the containers pay for them. We are also looking at building a new car terminal.</p><h4>How are the western regions benefiting from expansions at the Takoradi Port?</h4><p>The western region has become, in recent times, home to not only most of our mineral resources, but also oil, which means that we automatically need to expand the port of Takoradi. The first thing that we have done is engage a Dutch company, which has been doing the reclamation works. The first one has been duly completed and the firm will return shortly for Phase II, which will include further reclamation of additional land. Once we have done that we will have to fully develop a new port facility. The port is aggressively looking for partners to develop its facilities. With the additional interest in the oil and gas industry, I am hopeful that we should not have any challenges in attracting direct investment to build the port up.</p><h4>You have also overseen a boost in Accra's public transport systems. What role have PPPs played in these developments?</h4><p>PPPs help reduce the government's burden, as we no longer need to find money to satisfy the equitable or mobilization costs of these transactions. The private sector is also profit driven and often operates more efficiently. We are currently piloting the bus Rapid Transport system to use the terminals that we have been developing over the past few years. We are also trying to develop some dedicated lanes to reduce travel times and make the process more attractive to passengers. We have now taken delivery of nearly 10 rapid transit buses from Scania in Sweden, which has set up a maintenance workshop in Ghana. The pilot program is ongoing and we are supposed to oversee that for the next six months, after which point we will be taking delivery of additional buses from the same company to fully implement the bus Rapid Transit system. We currently have just 10 buses, but we intend to acquire 100 of them. We have processed the next 60, which we hope to get soon. While visiting Ghana, the Italian Prime Minister and His Excellency, the President, discussed the prospects of Italian manufacturer Iveco. We are now working on a draft MoU that we hope can facilitate greater acquisition for the Metro Mass Transit Company. With all of the challenges that we have today, it would be great if the company had between 200-300 buses that could operate routes at least in the regional capitals. This would encourage competitors to be reasonable with the fares.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ENOC recently signed an MoU with Emirates Environmental Group (EEG) to promote local environmental education. In what ways is ENOC implementing environmentally friendly sustainability practices in its operations?</h4><p>True sustainability can only be achieved if we transform the way that businesses think and operate. ENOC is evolving in a way that aligns with this philosophy. We are keen participants in the UAE's environmental protection imperatives, working closely with the UAE Supreme Energy Council and Dubai Carbon on strategic initiatives of demand-side management, carbon footprint reduction measures, and contributing to energy diversification. Our approach is aligned with the goals of the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy (DIES), which are to reduce energy demand by 30% by 2030 and to diversify the Emirate's energy mix. In 2008, we adopted a scientific Energy &amp; Resource Management (E&amp;RM) Policy and manual ahead of the launch of ISO 50001. We have also rolled out ambitious initiatives to reduce the company's carbon footprint. We opened the Middle East's first green service station and are working heavily on promoting the use of cleaner, greener fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG) and biofuels as alternative automotive fuels. All of our service stations in the ENOC/EPPCO network are now providing ultra-low-sulfur diesel. This is in alignment with the UAE Federal Cabinet decree aimed at improving the UAE's standards of diesel fuel from 500ppm to 10ppm, whereby all commercial diesel vehicles and equipment motorists are to use the ultra-low-sulfur diesel that matches Euro 5 standards. There is a perception that green equals expensive, but from our experience, this thinking is far from reality. The financial impact of ENOC's quick win efforts towards sustainability has been encouraging. An investment of AED600,000 has yielded savings of almost three times that amount. In terms of business plans, the expected annual saving is $6.9 million, with a payback period of just two years. Being green makes business sense, and we hope that organizations here and abroad realize this.</p><h4>How would you assess the current infrastructure in Dubai? Do you think new developments are needed in order to meet the increasing demand?</h4><p>In order to prepare for Expo2020, the government of Dubai is spending AED31 billion for various infrastructure projects related to real estate, transport, hospitality, and aviation. Therefore, the Emirate is an incredibly dynamic market on an upward trajectory of growth and development in the medium term. Regardless of the sector, businesses around Dubai must plan for this surge in activity. ENOC is investing across the board to ensure we deliver on our mandate to supply energy to Dubai and the UAE especially during such a high-demand period. We are creating human development programs for Emiratis, expanding our retail service station portfolio, and expanding our refinery in Jebel Ali.</p><h4>The aviation industry in the UAE is growing at an exponential rate. What opportunities does this offer to ENOC?</h4><p>We provide the jet fuel that powers the aircraft that fly to and from Dubai. The expansion of the airport facilities led us to launch Project Falcon, a unique opportunity that will fulfill more than half of the total jet fuel demand of Dubai airports. Project Falcon is a 58-km pipeline from our storage facilities in Jebel Ali directly to both airports, ensuring a safe, reliable, and consistent source of jet fuel for airplanes. Phase 1, linking Jebel Ali and Dubai International Airport, has been operational since November 2015. The extension, which will link Jebel Ali and Al Maktoum International Airport, is currently being constructed and is expected to be complete by the third quarter of 2018.</p><h4>ENOC also recently acquired Dragon Oil, and you operate across MENA, Asia, and Europe through more than 30 active subsidiaries and joint ventures. What is the impact of these projects?</h4><p>The acquisition of Dragon Oil was a distinctive milestone in the ENOC's growth story, making us a vertically integrated oil and gas player that is well positioned to strengthen our nation's energy security. This investment not only adds an upstream arm to ENOC, but also has significant potential for the emirate of Dubai as a whole. This combination allows ENOC to partner, compete, and grow with leading international oil and gas companies and regional national oil companies. This acquisition is underpinned by the significant exploration potential that Dragon Oil brings to the ENOC Group, fortifying our footprint across MENA and East Asia. Becoming an integrated oil and gas player will certainly strengthen our financial performance, as we will benefit from both the upstream sector when oil prices are up, and the downstream sector when prices are lower.</p><h4>What goals have you achieved since being appointed as Group CEO of ENOC?</h4><p>In August 2015, the UAE Ministry of Energy's decision to deregulate fuel prices was a transformational change for the region, particularly for national oil companies like ENOC. Our sector is capital-intensive; we need to continually invest in new projects to sustain growth, meet customer expectations, and maintain a leading position across all operating markets. By deregulating fuel prices, we have more capital at hand to focus further on local and regional retail expansion plans. We have also taken advantage of market conditions and our strong reputation to grow our international footprint by expanding our operations in MENA and Asia, which is reflected in our numbers. Despite the difficult macroeconomic situation, ENOC revenues increased by 45% over the last five years, reflecting strong operational and sales performance, and increased efficiencies in supply chain management in domestic and overseas markets. In 2015, the volume of sales of crude oil and petroleum products reached a historic high, surpassing 220 million barrels, marking a 16% increase over the previous year.</p><h4>What are ENOC's prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our view is that 2016 will be the year that ENOC looks onwards and upwards. Looking ahead, we intend to build upon our success by expanding our regional and international footprint. Due to low oil prices, we are considering acquisitions in various markets across the energy value chain and we will also further develop the markets where we have successful operations. The focus will be to continue diversifying our revenue streams by investing in operations that are well positioned to generate profitable sustainable growth. We intend to achieve this by strategically positioning ourselves and our portfolio, and by attracting and retaining the right talent. Our expectations for 2016 are positive. From our VIP retail solution, which gives customers a cashless experience in service stations, to smart CNG cylinders that enable consumers to track the level of cooking gas, we will continue to invest in innovation and new technology to support the energy sector in the UAE. We are looking to use technology to improve every aspect of our product portfolio. Expansion, be it organic or otherwise, plays a key role in our strategy. We are looking to grow and improve our retail network to include the renovation of existing service stations, the launch of 54 additional facilities in Dubai by 2020, and the construction of 11 additional service stations in Saudi Arabia during 2016. We are also planning a significant expansion of the Jebel Ali condensate refinery to accommodate rising domestic fuel demand and increasingly stringent product specifications.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the latest trends characterizing the construction sector in Peru?</h4><p>The construction sector in Peru is a reflection of the national economic situation. When the economy grows, growth in the construction sector is twice as strong; when the economy declines, the construction sector suffers doubly. Construction has a multiplier effect on the economy because it supports and influences many other industries; materials are purchased, wages are paid, and taxes to the government and suppliers are paid. The value chain of construction is very high, which is why it is considered a pillar for the national economy. The national economy and the construction sector has indeed charted strong growth, with the state playing a crucial role in infrastructure and heavy construction in particular. Private economic activities related to mining, electricity, roads, and airports also require public infrastructure. In general, opening Peru's economy to privately financed concessions has been instrumental to the country's growth. The maturation of an infrastructure project, especially for concessions, has to be analyzed with a medium-term perspective. The infrastructure deficit is high and both the state and private sector are making serious efforts to meet the demand. The housing segment is more sensitive, however, and much depends on volatile factors such as access to credit, as banks may change their policies. For example, the housing deficit in Peru comes from the lower social class, despite the promotion funds such as MIVIVIENDA, which in practice favors the middle class. This fund has to be reformulated to benefit Peru's broader housing needs. The country is only building 40,000-60,000 homes a year, and compared to the rate of building in Chile or Colombia's, we should be building over 120,000. It is clear a change of policy from the government related to promotions, taxes, or some kind of subsidy is necessary to boost this segment.</p><h4>How would you describe the quality of the existing infrastructure realized so far in Peru?</h4><p>Structural engineering is required to comply with international quality standards—it is not possible to build structures to a lower standard, especially in a seismic country like Peru, where all structures must be earthquake resistant. National and private companies in Peru comply with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards and regulations, and all contracts are required to comply with Peruvian construction standards, which are based on international ones. We have always handled projects to the highest standard, not just in terms of quality of the products but in the operations of the company, attention to environmental regulations, and also to ISO regulations. The company has made a $5 million investment over recent years toward technology.</p><h4>What have been the most iconic projects executed by OBRAINSA?</h4><p>In the last 10 years the company has had great leadership, working wherever the demand for infrastructure was greatest, particular with roads—we have built over 5,000km of new asphalt roads. This country has three disparate regions, especially in the mountains and jungles, so we created a program called Proyecto Peru for the basic paving of roads. There are two main ways Peru's road issues need to be resolved; national roads involve an investment of nearly $2 million dollars per kilometer, which is such a large investment because of the challenging geographical features of Peru, and these last more than 20 years. Peru also has over 75,000km of secondary roads that need to be improved with basic asphalt and maintenance every five years. We have worked in Panamericana Sur in three different contracts and completed almost 3km of missing road between Arequipa and Ilo (Moquegua) that traverses the mountains, and took years to be completed. We have a presence in all of Peru's regions. We are currently working on a road in the north of Peru near the Condor Mountain range border with Ecuador. In infrastructure, we worked on the Pillones Dam in Arequipa, which we designed and built and is one of the most important dams made in recent years. The dam facilitated the a 5-cubic-meter-per-second increase in river flow, thus increasing the energy production of the hydroelectric plant Charcani V, and supplied Cerro Verde with more water for its production. In the last three years, the company has decided to diversify its activity in all the areas of construction, focusing on infrastructure, construction, and various civil works. All three business units were powerful over 2015, and we expect stability for next year and even for 2017. We are the builders and dealers for the concession of the Miraflores underground parking structure, we started the construction of a building for SUNAT, we are working on construction for Cayetano Heredia University, and we are building hospitals in Cajamarca and Huanuco. We are working on an aqueduct in Ilo (Moquegua), which is part of an irrigation project, and we are building 70km aqueduct between the highest point in Moquegua and the coast. </p><h4>What is your medium-term vision?</h4><p>In the last two years the company has been preparing financially to face new challenges for future investment projects. We have enough backlog in our portfolio to work in 2016 and part of 2017. Our medium-term vision for 2016-21 leads to the 2021 second centenary anniversary of Peru's independence, and we aim to succeed in all the concessions we have presented by that time. We want to consolidate our three business units and reach our backlog goal of $1.5 billion by 2021.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[refine-by-me]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TAKREER wants to be recognized as a pace setter in creating sustainable value growth through innovative energy solutions. How are you bringing your energy solutions to market?</h4><p>TAKREER is trying to be the best in the refining industry and capitalize on the opportunities we have here in Abu Dhabi. The opportunities we have are in our large industrial base, upstream. We have a good supply and we have other downstream industries we can integrate with by providing them with the necessary feedstock or other additives. We not only want to be a provider of transportation fuel, but we also want to maximize the benefits to the country by integrating with local industries and diversifying our production.</p><h4>Looking at the products that you produce—naphtha, kerosene, gasoline, and diesel fuel—how are these reflecting the market needs here?</h4><p>Typically, we have been producing transportation fuels and other products that we normally export. However, we are trying to move away from our typical production and basically maximize the benefit of each barrel. With the new expansion, and our heavy oil conversion project called the Carbon Black &amp; Delayed Coker Project-CBDC, we will be moving toward diversifying our production. For example, we will be adding polymer grade propylene, which is the fodder for the petrochemical industry. We will also continue to produce naphtha and export it, but in addition we will make it available for local industries within Abu Dhabi that want to develop other petrochemical industries. Until now, this naphtha has normally been exported, to be used in the same industry, but in foreign markets. In Abu Dhabi now, there are growing numbers of environmental regulations and all the transportation fuels have to meet Euro 5 specifications. In other GCC countries, they call them clean fuels. In the Emirates, we have managed to achieve this standard. For example, in July 2014 legislation came into force here that all diesel has to meet Euro 5 specifications, which means very low sulfur content of less than 10 ppm. This is part of the government's vision to control emissions and ensure sustainable development within the country. We managed to achieve that and were in fact ready earlier than required with the completion of our Green Diesel Project in 2012. With our CBDC project, which is under final construction now, we will also be able to convert all the heavy oil into more valuable products. For example, into calcined coke, which is a specialized material, not a fuel grade, and which will be used in the local aluminum smelting industry. Again this is part of our diversification process and the provision of feedstock to the local industries around us. Another example is base oils, which will be produced by early 2016 after completion of the Group III Base Oil Project to enable us to enter the lubricant market. Group III Base Oils have high viscosity and are more environmentally sustainable as they last longer than the traditional Group I base oils.</p><h4>How is TAKREER's largest site, the Ruwais Refinery, connecting to large projects and other companies in terms of integration and facilitating business?</h4><p>We recognize that this industry is a margin-driven industry. Refineries are really under pressure as their margins are not nearly as good as those in upstream businesses. There are three main factors that will enable us to boost our margins and make us more economically robust. One factor is scale, as this allows us to distribute our costs more effectively in terms of dollars per barrel. Complexity is another important factor. You need to have deep conversion of crude oil to extract lighter and more viable products. The third factor is integration. If your refinery has a nearby petrochemical industry this will save capital expenditure and operating costs for both industries. Of course, you also need to expand to cover the local market's requirements in terms of transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstock. When we were looking at our expansion we had these three elements in mind to ensure that we would in fact be in a stronger economic position afterwards. With the new refinery, we managed to achieve all these elements. In terms of scale, we have doubled our capacity by moving from 500,000 to more than 900,000 bpd. The Nelson Complexity Index (NCI) measures refinery complexity and, after our expansion, we will reach a complexity factor of more than 14, which covers highly complex facilities. The higher you get on the scale the better your margins are. In terms of integration we are now connected to Borouge. We produce propylene that goes to Borouge as feedstock and we are importing its by-products in return. This is a saving for both companies in terms of investment and the associated operating costs. Once we stabilize our operations we will see the benefits of all of this.</p><h4>How does this relate to the wider economy and the mandate to make Abu Dhabi self-sufficient in gasoline, in order to boost income and GDP?</h4><p>Importing refined products is not particularly wise, especially when you produce crude oil. It does not make sense to import a product when you can make it here with your own facilities and people, and add to the GDP. This new refinery will be self-sufficient in gasoline. We do not import jet fuel or diesel as we were already self-sufficient in these products. As a matter of fact, with the new refinery our exports will increase. When you build a new refinery you do it with the next 30 years in mind, not for the short term. Of course, exports will shrink with growth, which is normal. However, for gasoline we have only designed the operations for the local market and we are not thinking of exporting.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the MCTESTP face in the coming five years?</h4><p>The MCTESTP aims to take a new approach to the integration of technical and vocational education, higher education, scientific research, innovation, and technological development in an articulated, hierarchical system designed to catalyze the development of Mozambique through the injection of knowledge, technology, and quality human resources. This is needed to reach the best possible performance in the various socio-economic development sectors. We plan to create a situation in which technical and vocational education can train highly skilled labor for the productive sector, ensuring quality services and the retention of income in the country, which would otherwise be paid to foreign workers. We also want to enable graduates with know-how to improve their employability, and offer higher education to students with higher academic potential. In terms of higher education, we aim to utilize the knowledge of experts and the people at those academic levels to produce solutions to the problems that our country faces. We want to provide highly qualified technical teachers capable of transmitting the scientific and technical foundations necessary for the graduates to interpret and solve problems related to their training areas, as well as to support research institutions and researchers committed to the cause of national development. In the field of scientific research we want to identify the main challenges faced by the Mozambican nation not only in terms of the economy and environment, but also regarding social issues. We want to seek solutions on a participatory basis, listening to the communities and the productive sector in order to find relevant and acceptable solutions for society and to translate the results of scientific activity into useful products and services. We need to produce information that can be used for planning, analysis and decision-making at different levels of government.</p><h4>How would you describe the existing infrastructure dedicated to science and technology in Mozambique? What investments are necessary to meet your medium-term goals and objectives?</h4><p>All Mozambicans should have access to scientific and information technology to improve the wealth creation process and accelerate poverty eradication. Infrastructure is a key component for scientific research, technology transfer, and innovation. Although Mozambique lacks the resources to carry out major investments to this end, it does have infrastructure for conducting science and technology activities. Among those we can mention are higher education institutions and research centers situated across the country such as the Institute of Agricultural Research of Mozambique (IIAM), the Health Research Centre of Manhica (CISM), the National Institute of Health (NIH), the Fisheries Research Institute (IIP), the Centre for Research and Development on Ethnobotany (CIDE), the Institute for Water Research (IIA), the Biotechnology Centre of the Eduardo Mondlane University, the Polytechnic Institutes of Gaza, Manica, Tete and Zambezia, the Biotechnology Laboratory in the city of Xai-Xai, and the Centre for Research and Transferring of Agricultural Technologies of Umbelúze (CITTAU). We also have seven Millennium Villages, with two each in Gaza, Zambezia, and Nampula, and one in Tete, as well as the Science and Technology Park in Maluana (PCTM), which was created for the training and incubation of technology-based companies. We have also established five centers for working on technology for the improvement of rice, corn, and wheat production in the provinces of Gaza, Sofala, Manica, and Tete. Finally there is the Higher Education and Research Network of Mozambique (MoRENet) and the Maluana Data Center at the Science and Technology Park of Maluana.</p><h4>What are the main opportunities for investment in the Science and Technology Sector at present, and how do you plan to attract domestic and foreign investment into this field?</h4><p>In the area of Science and Technology there are six centers of research for the transferal of agricultural technologies located in Gaza, Sofala, Manica, Tete, and Nampula. There are also the data centers at the Science and Technology Park of Maluana and Nampula, which is currently seeking funding, will benefit both public and private institutions, and will contribute to the improvement of service delivery to citizens. The government will also build around 25 community multimedia centers (CMC) to increase internet access across the country, in addition to linking all higher education and research facilities to the Higher Education Network and Research of Mozambique (MoRENet). This will establish virtual libraries, which will contribute to improving research conditions and the teaching and learning process. Two new Higher Polytechnic Institutes in Inhambane and Nampula provinces are being worked on to expand higher education, and we will also pay increased attention to the psycho-pedagogical training of teachers, combined with various postgraduate training programs. The Institutional Development Fund (IDF) will finance over 76 training projects at the Higher Education Institutions (HIES), and we will provide scholarships at the undergraduate level to around 2,500 students from all provinces. In addition, 20 IES and over 100 courses for accreditation will be assessed as part of efforts to improve the quality of higher education in the country. Within five years we also expect to build, rehabilitate, and equip 38 institutions for technical and vocational education throughout the country, and are looking to increase school enrolments from the current figure of 67,000 students to over 80,000. Under the ETP reform we will approve legal instruments and an institutional framework for the implementation of vocational education law.</p><h4>What role would you like the Ministry to play in the establishment of innovative technology start-ups in the country?</h4><p>The MCTESTP should continue to promote initiatives aimed at the creation of a favorable environment for the emergence and development of new technology-based companies. We want to strengthen their ability to undertake scientific research, to foster innovation and technological development, and to encourage scientific entrepreneurship with a view to exploring new ideas.</p><h4>How can your Ministry bring science and technology to rural communities?</h4><p>All initiatives undertaken by the government should focus on improving the quality of life of Mozambicans, and special attention should be paid to the poorest people, most of whom live in rural areas. The Ministry can approach rural communities through the dissemination and popularization of science and technology, at fair trades and bazaars of science and technology, science competitions, and the dissemination of knowledge and local expertise through ICT initiatives.</p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of research and innovation for the future of developing countries?</h4><p>Scientific research is important for the development of any country, and is necessary to contribute to problem solving in various sectors such as agriculture (through improved manufacturing techniques for increasing productivity), health (through studies for introducing vaccines for fighting malaria), or the environment (in impact studies of climate change and improving sanitation), among others. Four main factors are necessary to carry out effective research, and the first is the training of human resources. Between 2015 and 2019, the Ministry will focus on training of researchers and the faculty of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) by granting postgraduate scholarships to strengthen the implementation capacity of research to contribute effectively to the country's development and the improvement higher education studies. In Mozambique there are few companies that invest in innovation to create more competition and subsequently aggregate economic value to their products and increase profits. In order to stimulate research and innovation for development, the Ministry will proceed with the creation of an incentive framework for research and development of businesses both large and small.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What regulatory changes are crucial to motivate better usage of the nation's natural gas resources?</h4><p>With the crude flux, gas is the current topic of conversation. Recent developments in the gas and power sector such as the privatization of power assets, the upward review of gas-to-power prices, and the review of energy tariffs demonstrate the positive and important changes being witnessed in the sector and is an indication of the long-term direction of the gas sector. The ready and ever-growing domestic power demand also provides a platform to guarantee a vibrant future for the gas sector, and government has also introduced various incentives to benefit investors in both sectors. While the government has performed well in providing fiscal incentives for gas producers, there is room for improvement. The recent upward review of the gas-to-power pricing is key and will play a significant role in ensuring that investments in the upstream gas sector develop infrastructure to enable monetization efforts and process gas to acceptable specifications. The Central Bank is also playing an increasingly active role in ensuring that priority is given to the development of the gas sector. Nigeria has all it takes to emerge as a regional gas hub, serving both regional and international markets. The eagerness of Europe to diversify its gas sources also offers a unique opportunity for Nigeria, which has the eighth largest proven natural gas reserves in the world, to play a significant long-term role in the global energy market.</p><h4>Oando acquired ConocoPhillips' Nigerian business in 2014 for $1.5 billion, and in July 2015 it sold 60% of its downstream business for $276 million to the Helios-Vitol Group. What do these moves indicate about your long-term strategy?</h4><p>We are an integrated energy company with investments across the entire energy value chain in downstream, midstream, and upstream operations. The company is focused on growing within the higher margin upstream sector, and we expect to increase returns to shareholders. The enterprise value of our group in 2000 was $50 million, and the value of our group in 2014 was pegged at $5 billion, a fifty-fold increase in our business over a 14-year period. We are executing a plan that we told the world we would do back then, and we have ensured that we have not deviated from our original business plan. The ConocoPhillips transaction is one that sees Oando become the leading indigenous oil and gas producer in the country. Our oil production has increased significantly from 5,000bpd to 54,100bpd. It certainly puts us in the top 100 oil and gas companies globally in terms of reserves and production, and it is a transaction that makes us the first Nigerian company to become one of the partners in an onshore joint venture. The other onshore joint venture partners in Nigeria are Shell, Total, Chevron, and ExxonMobil. This is a significant achievement because we know it has taken millions of dollars in resources to create what we are investing and partnering in today. It also marks the beginning of our transition to become a full-fledged integrated exploration and production company. We have always wanted a substantial portion of our capital base to be invested in upstream activities, and having achieved that, we intend to do more transactions of this nature to expand our footprint within the sector. We expect improved returns due to a higher-value margin from upstream operations, which stands at 25% as opposed to the 1.9% percent margins of downstream activities. As a group, deconsolidation is key for us. We have a listed upstream subsidiary and we will list our downstream and midstream businesses in such a way that we all have three separate Oando on the exchange, allow people to invest in the different areas of operation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current status of the nautical industry in Peru?</h4><p>When we started Lima Marina Club, there wasn't much infrastructure available for yacht owners. Because of the economy and regulations that we have in Peru for importing yachts and large boats, there was a lack of equipment and services for these boats. Back then, around 80% of the fleet was more than 20 years old and small. Starting from 2008, things started changing; we had around 20-25 boats being brought into Peru every year. That is when we started this project. We have since been a big part of the growth in the yacht business. Everything you could need as a boat owner is available here; vessels are secure, clean, and perfectly maintained.</p><h4>What are some of the main features of this marina?</h4><p>We started operations in 2010. We have the same facilities as the best marinas in the world. All of our equipment is brand new and all of the floating docks were imported from Spain. We have the best and newest equipment available. We are located within the city of Lima, where you could not find places to moor a yacht before. From facilities like ours, yacht owners have access to the ocean and all of its merry nautical activities, including visiting bays and islands. Lima is even more beautiful seen from the ocean. We provide easy, secure access to the seas. Ours is a small marina compared to other marinas in the world. We have about 100 boats here. We could not have designed it bigger because of the restrictions regarding the currents and movement of sands. It has a positive impact on the coastline because we have gained a new beach here. We reclaimed land from the ocean, and with that we created a new beach.</p><h4>Who are you targeting as members?</h4><p>Most of our members are Peruvians that were not aware of the possibilities of having a boat or are looking for a premium club. We have 700 members now and hope to reach 900 by the close of 2017. Of those, 170 have some kind of boat. Many members love nautical sports and activities, and they have both small and big boats. We have all of the social members that were looking for a club with this kind of high-end drive. We also made a strategic decision to have our own chef and kitchen. Most of the clubs outsource this work, but we did it in house because we want to be different and well perceived. We have 500 members who are here just for this—to be with their friends and family in this exclusive ambiance.</p><h4>What is your strategy to consolidate the business and distinguish the marina?</h4><p>We have been working with a low profile marketing approach; that is what our members like, as do our potential members. We promote ourselves by ensuring that our members totally satisfied with everything they find here. We conduct satisfaction studies every six months in which we ask members to rate us 1-5. On average, we receive scores between 4.3 and 4.4, and sometimes even a full 5 in certain areas. We study and work to be excellent in all the aspects of the club, from decorations to security. We see between seven and 10 new members a month, which is a lot for a club this size. That is the most important part of our marketing plan—to maintain the loyalty of our members so that they will bring us referrals and friends. We like operating in this manner.</p><h4>What are your targets for 2016?</h4><p>One thing that we are doing well compared to the rest of the market is maintaining our new members' monthly level, as most of the real estate business is low right now because there are a lot of questions concerning the political situation; people are waiting to see what will happen. This club is doing well because we are not a kind of real estate investment, and people know what we are about. Most of the projects that I have been involved with are more in the planning process. Investors are not convinced about launching projects in the market because of the state of politics and the economy. We have a lot of projects, like tourist projects in Cuzco and the north of Peru that are well conceived and well prepared, and we are working on a second residential project outside of Lima, as well as marinas in different parts of the city. My specialty is always doing something unique, not just investing and selling, but something special. Those are always the most difficult projects to sell.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Tequilas del Señor get started as a company?</h4><p>The story started in 1926 when my father came to Mexico from Spain at the age of 16, and he began to work for his uncles in the liqueur industry. The business produced a variety of liquors, including rum, habanero, rompope, tequila, mezcal, and vermouth, and was established in Mexico City. In 1943, my father and his uncles came to Guadalajara and co-founded the distilling operation here with Ana Rosales and her son Carlos Cuervo. In 1957, we began exporting tequila to the US, where the popularity of it and the margarita cocktail were growing. By this time, we were exporting tequila in wooden barrels sent by trucks, and was an important volume for us. In 1968, I moved to Guadalajara, from where I started traveling extensively to call on all of our customers in the US in order to forge relationships with them and promote our tequila. Our aim has always been to make the best quality product that we can, and we put considerable effort into doing that. By 1973, we were the second largest bulk exporter of tequila to the US, after the Cuervo brand. We later broke through to the European market via Spain and Germany to expand our markets, where we had to educate the consumers because tequila was a new drink for Europe. Tequilas del Señor then began working on the South American, east European, and Asian markets teaching consumers the different ways of enjoying this elixir and the couture that is behind it. People are always surprised by the labor that surrounds tequila.</p><h4>Can you talk about the branding process for your products?</h4><p>Each of our brands has its own history. Some of them started with the distillery, while some others have been created or acquired over the years. I also decided to change the name of the company from Rio de Plata to Tequilas del Patrón, and later to Tequilas del Señor, though I kept the name for our distillery as Rio de Plata, which was the original name from when my father set up the business. To help promote Reserva del Patrón, we personalized the labels, which was the first tequila for which we did that. The Sombrero Negro label has a Mexican Charro and Mariachi hat on it and is instantly recognized worldwide, as the emblem is excellent for representing both Mexico and tequila. It is also the brand that we sell most of in different markets around the world. I also sold the rights to the name Patrón to Patrón Spirits, and we then began using the name Tequilas del Señor instead.</p><h4>You are exporting to China and other Asian countries now. Have you adjusted your brand to make it more suitable for those markets?</h4><p>We do both. The Sombrero Negro brand sells well in China and the Philippines. We also have additional brands in China for different sectors, and we even created new labels for China. We use Mexican images but adapted to a Chinese style to suit the market there.</p><h4>What challenges have you faced entering the Asian market?</h4><p>We are one of around 11 Mexican companies that have established their products in China. We started with Casa del Tequila, which we are part of, but we had our merchandise available before many others did. The challenge is to give the Chinese people a quality product and tastes that they are happy with, as well as to teach them how to drink it—tequila is drunk sip by sip, rather than drinking a large glass in one go and then not drinking any more. It is a different culture, and therefore we have to work to make our brand stand out in this market.</p><h4>What do you think makes the Tequilas del Señor brands different from the larger international brands on the market today?</h4><p>We do not deliver the same volume as the larger brands, and this gives us a different position in the markets we reach. We only produce between 2 million to 3 million liters each year, while the larger brands distribute 30 million or 40 million liters per year. We aim to produce the best product that we can and maintain quality. Our competitors have good quality and good products, but we try to be better than them while attending to all the parts of the production and sales process with passion and care. This is why we are in a different position in the global market. It is crucial that we have strong communication with our customers. Behind our customer there is another customer, and we are interested in how our product is received by that final consumer.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2014, the bank's assets under management reached $17.3 billion. How did the bank perform in 2015?</h4><p>It was a good year for us. BAC is a regional bank with regional products serving regional clients. Not only do we have our operation in Panama, we also own a bank in each of the Central American countries and a small operation in Mexico. We continue to grow in all of the segments in which we are present, namely consumer banking, corporate banking, mortgages, auto loans, and, probably the one that identifies us most, credit card operations. All of our loans are classified either as consumer, mortgages, commercial, auto, personal, or credit cards. We are probably better known here in Panama and throughout Central America as the leader in credit card issuing and acquiring —around 23-25% of our entire portfolio is in credit cards. Around 8-10% is in auto loans, 35 to 40% is in commercial loans, and mortgages are around 20%, while consumer loans are about 10%. We are diversified in the different sectors of the banking business. The same applies to our regional presence; the main countries we are present in are Panama and Costa Rica, which account for about half of our operations, followed by Guatemala and El Salvador.</p><h4>What were the biggest contributors to earnings in 2015?</h4><p>We were fortunate throughout 2015 with developments such as the Connect Miles cobranding with Copa Airlines, which was and continues to be a great success. It was launched in June 2015 and it has been greatly accepted. It is a good program and helped boost our sales a lot in the last six months of the year. As mentioned before, growth has been seen across all our lines of business, thus contributing to our excellent earnings.</p><h4>What were the reasons for merging with BBVA and how did it allow for the bank to strengthen its position and market share here?</h4><p>The acquisition of BBVA complimented what we already had. Although BBVA was small in credit cards loans, it was well developed in auto loans, and there was therefore a synergy with our operations that allowed us to achieve around a 23% market share. Similarly, they had a construction loan department, whereas we did not. Corporate and commercial loans were also important. In personal loans and mortgages, BBVA had a nice portfolio that complimented ours, although in mortgages we are a little bit more conservative than the main banks here in Panama. We finance 80% of the purchase of the sale price or the value of the property—whichever is lower. Other banks commonly finance as high as 90-95%. We want to grow our business, but sustainably; our strategy is to grow every year in every segment.</p><h4>How is home ownership encouraged by the banking sector in Panama?</h4><p>There are a lot of opportunities to buy a house here in Panama because of the offers from the large amount of banks operating here. There is a system called Preferential Interest in which the interest for houses below $120,000 is subsidized by the government for the first 15 years, providing much needed support to stimulate home ownership. The banks that are involved have a reference rate in function of the top five to 10 average mortgage rates.</p><h4>How receptive are people in Panama to mobile banking trends and what innovations is the bank is introducing?</h4><p>We are the first bank here to provide a mobile application. Everyday, people are using more electronic channels and we are working toward that. We have to make lives simpler for the client from his office or from his work. Right now in Panama we have 40 full branches and two electronic branches that used to be banks but now inside they are multifunctional self-service ATMs where customers can receive money, pay credit card bills, check their accounts online, and access our call center. We have 225 ATMs, which is a lot for Panama, and we have 35 multi-functional ATMs that can accept cash deposits. The multifunctional ATM has had a good acceptance. Customers are getting older everyday, but new customers are younger and that is the only way we are going to succeed. The reality is that the future is going to be electronic.</p><h4>How does the role of the Panama Banking Association differ from the ministry and superintendency?</h4><p>The Panama Banking Association was founded 53 years ago and represents 70 of the 91 banks established in Panama. The Panama Banking Association is a private nonpolitical non-profit association, and one of our main roles is to take care of the strength and wellbeing of the banking sector by providing our associates with the necessary support to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering legislation. The Panama Banking Association also has an educational arm—the International Banking Institute—that offers courses to local and foreign banking employees and non-banking employees, and is currently in the process of being converted into a university.</p><h4>The 2015 World Economic Forum Report ranked Panama number 11 for the soundness of its banks. To what do you credit this strong reputation?</h4><p>One reason for this is that the continued growth of the sector. Another factor is the quality of the banks here in terms of their liquidity and capital equity ratios. As of November, Panama has $117 billion in assets in the whole financial sector, a 8.35% increase from November 2014 when it was $108 billion. The average rate of non-performing loans for the whole sector as of November 2015 is 1.2%, so we have a sound loan portfolio. On the average liquidity index, the minimum requirement is 30%, and there is a formula that we can look at to calculate liquidity. The minimum is 30% and the average of the sector is 61.5%, so it operates at more than double the minimum requirements. The minimum capital equity index requirement is 8%, and as of September 2015 that figure was an average of 15.2% throughout the sector. These figures attest to how prudently the banks run their business here, and the sector is growing at a rate of approximately 8% per year.</p><h4>Do you expect to see more foreign banks come to Panama?</h4><p>What you have seen in Panama is a constellation of European and North American banks as well as local banks. Probably the last banks coming into Panama are the regional South and Central American banks and certain private wealth management banks from Europe. The possibility for new banks coming is always there, but all the regional banks are already here.</p><h4>Panama is joining the list of OECD countries that share tax information as of 2018. What impact will this have?</h4><p>Panama's President Varela addressed the UN in September and said that Panama is ready to do it, but in a bilateral way. It is willing to exchange information without pressures, and these matters have to be addressed in the UN, and not in a group of countries deciding that the UN was a forum made to discuss these types of things. So Panama's position is to analyze that on a bilateral basis depending on the geopolitical situation in those moments, and following the steps of our main commercial partners so that we can follow what they are doing. The world is more transparent, but it is important that information is exchanged properly and not misused. We have to be clear about whom we give that information and how that other party is going to use and save that information.</p><h4>What are your expectations and goals for BAC International Bank and for the banking sector?</h4><p>Panama is taking the necessary steps and I hope that the international community sees it that way to prevent the misuse of the financial services provided here. We are looking forward to 2016 being a good year for Panama.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[african-power]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give a short overview of ABB's operation in the region?</h4><p>ABB is a multinational with a presence in over 100 countries. ABB is one of the worlds leading power and automation companies, structured into four divisions: Electrification Products, Discrete Automation &amp; Motion, Process Automation, and Power Grids, each with several business units and some 300 factories globally. This model is then repeated in each country. In addition, the way that ABB is structured in the Southern Africa region is based on a hub and spoke business model. The hub is in South Africa, and from there we have what we call “spokes," meaning the countries surrounding it in the SADC region, including Namibia, Angola, the DRC, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. ABB has approximately key 1800 employees in the Southern African region.</p><h4>What is the significance of Mozambique for the overall ABB strategy in the SADC region?</h4><p>Mozambique is an extremely important market with huge potential in the mining and oil and gas sector, as well as in various other industries such as cement, F&amp;B, sugar, aluminium, and several other industries. Mozambique is well positioned to take advantage of its roads and rail and potential power development to supply the rest of Africa's land-locked countries. One of ABB's key growth areas is in supporting the development of the energy sector, where we have both the expertise and solutions in both power and automation. Last November our global CEO, Ulrich Spiesshofer, visited Mozambique for the first time to reinforce the importance of Africa within ABB. As one of the legs of our strategy, we have a 1,000-day African program that was put together as an incentive to develop the African market. Every CEO has a legacy that he leaves behind. The previous CEO targeted the US market to build up our presence there. Our current CEO, in his next level strategy, has decided that one of his key objectives will be Africa. We started the program about a year ago, and since then the CEO has visited Egypt, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Zambia in his first wave, while he plans to visit a few more African countries in 2016. At present, the contribution of Southern Africa to ABB Global results is only around 2 to 3% of the overall revenue. We want to raise that figure. Together, we are targeting and promoting Africa actively, and have had some wins while investing and developing our strategy.</p><h4>What human resources requirements do you have in Mozambique?</h4><p>When we opened here in 2012 the idea was to have a sales office, and we have been expanding this over time. We have been developing local engineering talent and training them in our regional office. Here at the main office we have seven key people and approximately another 25 in Tete. Most of our Talent pool is from Mozambique, but they have received training from abroad as well. For example, we have two engineers that are employed here who were trained in South Africa for almost a year and then sent up to the project in the north of Mozambique.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your involvement in the Songo Project?</h4><p>The Songo project was for ABB to deliver install, manufacture, and commission for HCB three convertor transformers and two air-cored reactors as well as a DC measuring system. While this may sound like a simple task for ABB as a leader in HVDC, there were other logistical factors to consider. The weight of each transformer was over 150 tons, which meant special planning in route selection due to the capacity of bridges to carry these loads was a key factor. In this case it took around four months of road travel time just to get them to the destination. They came from our Swedish factory and were offloaded in Durban because of the sheer weight of the transformers, which are about 150 tons dry weight and approximately 250 tons each when filled with oil. Only the Durban harbor is geared to handle this kind of logistics and has the crane capacity. They were moved all the way to Songo and installed and commissioned in the middle of 2015. Logistics in Mozambique can be complicated, especially in the northern region.</p><h4>What sets ABB apart from its competitors?</h4><p>There are several factors that set us apart from our competitors. Health, safety, and security are the number one consideration for us, and we make sure that we do all of this 100% correctly. ABB has zero tolerance for corruption We never pay bribes or encourage corrupt activity. In Mozambique we have a large installed base and we have ABB equipment installed in around 70% of Mozambique's substations. This, together with our regional footprint, allows us to be active in the market and retain a high level of skill to tackle work at various levels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the evolution of the business environment in Kazakhstan over the past decade?</h4><p>Over the past decade, the business climate in Kazakhstan has improved despite the challenges entailed by the global financial and economic crises of recent years. For many years, Kazakhstan had average annual growth of 10-15%, propelled by the country's dominant oil industry. The government understands that a positive business environment is necessary to attract foreign investment, but there are still many impediments. Economic diversification is a necessity, though it has proven a challenge, as it has for many countries with oil-fuelled economies. Creating a broad-based economy is a government priority and there have been some successes, but there are areas where the economy could, and should, improve, notably agriculture, where Kazakhstan has all the prerequisites for a robust agriculture and agribusiness industry. Foreign investors have been attracted to areas such as consumer products, logistics, training, consulting, and tourism. The hospitality industry is strong with many global leaders in the luxury hotel industry represented in Almaty and Astana, where business is centered and international conferences are plentiful. There are many other areas of the economy that could benefit from foreign investment and be of interest to investors in search of new markets.</p><h4>Which sectors are currently the most attractive for investors?</h4><p>The oil industry is always attractive, but is well established with a 25-year history behind it. The major oil companies from North America, Europe, and Asia and their supporting oilfield service providers have been in Kazakhstan for a long time. Given that the price of oil is currently volatile and under extreme pressure, now is not the right moment for oil companies or their related services to enter the market. Looking at other areas of the economy, Kazakhstan has an endless appetite for consumer goods of all types and the means to pursue a solid middle-class lifestyle, even a luxurious lifestyle for those who have benefitted from economic growth. The areas that traditionally have performed well are continuing to be the most attractive for foreign investment. Agriculture is an industry that Kazakhstan could excel in given its climate and vast, yet under-utilized, territory. Provided that agriculture receives a good balance of investment and planning, it will be critical to reducing the country's reliance on food imports and establishing a firm basis for self sufficiency and food security.</p><h4>Where can reforms be implemented to facilitate the country's economic growth?</h4><p>Kazakhstan has a strong reform agenda and is continuing to implement reforms in many areas that will be helpful not only to foreign investors, but also to local investors. However, there are some crucial areas that continue to be in need of fundamental reform. First and foremost this refers to the country's judicial system, which is still struggling to emerge from the post-Soviet mold; judges are not always well-qualified, nor independently appointed, and tend to issue judgments in support of the government, rather than recognizing the merits of investor cases. Many of these disputes relate to tax issues, where systemic reform is needed to remove legislative inconsistencies that repeatedly bring the same issues back to the courts again and again. Tax legislation changes frequently, yet these changes too often cause more difficulty and more uncertainty, rather than removing difficulties. Every business needs a reliable legal environment in which it can operate. Investors value stability—not just in taxes, but in everything relating to their business operations. One impending change in the country's tax legislation is of particular concern to foreign investors. Kazakhstan intends to abolish VAT and introduce a sales tax model on January 1, 2017, a fundamental change that most investors oppose. VAT is used throughout the EU and is recognized as a model for economically developed countries. AmCham, its members, and many other businesses in Kazakhstan are discussing the pros and cons of this change with the government, and are offering expert tax advice from international sources, including the OSCE, to ensure that whatever changes may be made conform to best international practices. One very significant change Kazakhstan has made this year is to float the national currency, the tenge, rather than continuing to artificially support the currency at a time of extreme international financial volatility. Although this has also made the national currency and the exchange rate vis-a-vis the US dollar highly volatile—and has reduced the value of the tenge by half since August when the currency was floated—most investors accept that this step by the National Bank was necessary and overdue. However, it has introduced an element of extreme unpredictability into financial operations in both the public and private sectors, particularly given the current plummeting price of oil. This scenario is still being played out, but will prove the best course of action in the long run. AmCham has always urged the government of Kazakhstan to carry out its reform agenda, even if this involves short-term pain. The result will be long-term gain as Kazakhstan joins the world's developed nations as an economic leader in Central Asia and the CIS.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the local economy in the short term?</h4><p>2016 has had a rocky start on the world's stock markets and with their effect on exchange rates vis-a-vis the US dollar. This has inevitably affected Kazakhstan, where the price of oil will remain a central factor in the country's economy for the foreseeable future. Kazakhstan's main trading partners—Russia, China, and the EU—are all experiencing economic difficulties. The US economy is in recovery mode and is a more stable trading partner at present. I would remind readers that AmCham is a broad-based international business association, representing investors from around the world, not just US investors, so we represent a very diversified business environment in which different regions of the world and different industries have different perspectives on economic development and on their trading relationships with Kazakhstan. Many of our members are therefore feeling the pain right now, but with an eye to the future. Some smaller companies have exited the market, while the larger, more stable investors are here for the long haul and believe in Kazakhstan as a good market for the future. Kazakhstan has ambitious plans and aspirations that will continue to be pursued in 2016. In our frequent meetings with the government of Kazakhstan,  and we are fortunate to meet with the Prime Minister and a panel of Cabinet Ministers responsible for the economy on a monthly basis, AmCham articulates its members' concerns and hopes, and offers its support for the government's long-term reform agenda. We will continue to work closely with the Prime Minister and the government to help Kazakhstan reach its goals as a vibrant, economically developed country attractive to foreign investors. Due to the devaluation of the tenge, the local economy is currently experiencing a difficult period. The price of oil is going to stay down for the foreseeable future, and next year is going to be difficult for Kazakhstan. The country, however, has a good economy in general, as it has been well grounded. Despite the tough environment, the public and private sectors are focused on the economy and they have a large reserve fund from oil surpluses over the past several years. They have reliable trading partners, and they are working to diversify their economy. In general, Kazakhstan has a promising future; however, it must weather these current financial hardships first.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How vital are the ports in Abu Dhabi with regard to diversifying the economy?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi Ports is a key enabler of the Emirate's economic diversification. As the master developer, manager, and operator of the Emirates' non-oil ports and Khalifa Industrial Zone, our growing YoY business volumes are a testimony to the efficacy of our role in stimulating the trade, logistics, and industrial sectors of Abu Dhabi. A study commissioned by Abu Dhabi Ports and verified by Statistics Centre Abu Dhabi (SCAD) revealed that our company contributed more than AED14 billion to Abu Dhabi's GDP and generated over 39,500 new direct and indirect job opportunities in 2014. As the maritime trade business enabler, the activities of Abu Dhabi Ports in its entirety accounted for 2.9% of the Emirate's non-oil GDP, which resulted in rise to nearly 2% of overall employment in Abu Dhabi's non-oil economy. Our contribution to the expansion of the Emirate's tourism sector, a major component of its economic diversification, was also significant. Growth in the cruise business generated an estimated value-added contribution to the Abu Dhabi economy of over AED71 million and resulted in the employment of more than 300 people. Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (Kizad), the integrated trade and industrial hub of Abu Dhabi, improved its value-added contribution to AED6.1 billion, and created over 3,600 employment opportunities in 2014. In 2015, a total of 21 Standard Musataha Agreements (SMAs) were signed with national and international investors, and three plot-extension SMAs with existing investors. When these agreements are materialized on the ground, we will see a larger impact on the GDP of Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>Can you talk about the integration within the industrial zone?</h4><p>Khalifa Industrial Zone's (Kizad) integrated design with Khalifa Port has the potential to meet future demands of industrial and logistic sectors in Abu Dhabi. Kizad has created clusters for certain industries together, whose offerings can be mutually beneficial to boost their business. As the products and services offered by an investor are being utilized by others within the cluster, it becomes a circle of value creation. The economies of proximity offer convenient and cost-effective business operations. The aluminum cluster with Emirates Aluminium (EMAL/EGA), our anchor tenant, is an example. EMAL will convey aluminum to other manufacturers in the zone in hot molten form through our innovative Hot Metal Road, transported by specially fitted trucks. This molten aluminum will also be directly used by other industries in the cluster, like TALEX, saving substantial energy and costs of re-melting the aluminum.</p><h4>In 2015, all RoRo operations were moved from Zayed Port to Khalifa Port, and RoRo has now grown exponentially. How has this developed business?</h4><p>The growing demand from the automotive sector in the UAE necessitated the relocation of RoRo operations to Khalifa Port from Zayed Port. An enhanced yard and terminal facilities opened the door to increased customer services and provided a strategic location and flexible capacity. This transition to Khalifa Port contributed to a 27% upswing in volumes with 134,272 vehicles in 2015 compared with 106,071 vehicles the previous year. Khalifa Port's current capacity of about 350,000 vehicles a year will help the port become a regional RoRo hub.</p><h4>Can you describe how the cruise sector is being enhanced after Zayed Port has been upgraded?</h4><p>The newly opened Abu Dhabi Cruise Terminal at Zayed Port, a premier cruise hub in the region, has been receiving unprecedented number of passengers. The state-of-the-art terminal's innovative and efficient mechanism has proved successful in handling a burgeoning number of cruisers, contributed by the homeporting of a global cruise liner, MSC Musica of MSC Cruises, the Switzerland-based global cruise line. This luxury cruise vessel alone will bring in 45,000 of the total 205,000 cruise passengers scheduled to visit Abu Dhabi during the current cruise season ending April. This rise in number of cruisers during this season will represent over 19% growth compared with the previous season, and a five-fold surge since the first cruise season in 2006-2007. This remarkable growth is projected to reach more than 300,000 passengers expected on 130 scheduled ship calls by the 2019-2020 season. As visiting cruise liners demanded more destinations, we started developing Sir Bani Yas Island Beach as the Arabian Gulf's first cruise beach stopover in Abu Dhabi. The island has been receiving cruise vessels since November 2015 and will be fully operational this year, enhancing Abu Dhabi's appeal as a leading winter-sun cruise destination.</p><h4>In 2014, Khalifa Port managed the status of third-fastest growing container port in the world, and fastest growing in the region. How was this achieved?</h4><p>Khalifa Port achieved 32% growth in container cargo volumes and a 27% upswing in RoRo traffic in 2015 compared with the previous year. Our strategic priority to achieve innovation, the deployment of advanced port technology, and well-planned expansion of infrastructure made this possible. The increased investments in Kizad and favorable economic factors also played a major role. Our significant investment in technology, world-class infrastructure—new ship-to-shore quay cranes, gantry cranes, and automatic stacking cranes—and services have enhanced our customer experience. The implementation of Maqta Gateway, a new purpose-built port community system and Jade's terminal operating system, the Master Terminal, are expected to further improve our productivity and efficiency. The new productivity records set by Abu Dhabi Terminals also contributed to the growth. Its operations team handled the vessel APL BOSTON with an average gross crane productivity of 39.81 berth moves per hour (BMPH), resulting in berth productivity of 135.18 BMPH during a 19-hour, 54-minute port stay. As part of our constant efforts for efficiency improvement, a 12-minute turnaround time for trucks has raised Khalifa Port's profile as an international maritime hub. We have introduced a range of new mobile applications and internal services, including an e-Pass service that helps customers submit all of their security details online in advance. Our YoY growth indicates that we have responded well, by enhancing our capacity, to the demands from rising import and export activities in the Emirate. This is a testimony to the strength Abu Dhabi's economy and plays a positive and vital role in our business. The trans-shipment at Khalifa Port, which has grown drastically thanks to our status as a regional hub, has also been an important driver of growth. High demand for strategic exports from the region, such as aluminum, and continuity in ongoing developmental projects, also catalyze the growth. Khalifa Port also meets the huge demand of services for major infrastructure projects in Abu Dhabi.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the many lines of business under UT Holdings develop?</h4><p>UT started as a unique financial services company and a finance house for lending to SMEs and the informal sector. Banks typically avoid serving this sector because it is risky and difficult to quantify due to a lack of data. Unfortunately, 78% of the economy falls into the informal sector, where companies need startup capital and funds to grow and expand. As we began to understand the SME market and its needs, we realized that we needed the support of other structures and institutions. We developed UT Logistics because we could not lend to importers safely unless the goods were first cleared, warehoused, and collateralized. The collateralization process requires a quick evaluation of properties, and we therefore expanded our capabilities further and established UT Properties. We later acquired UT Life to capitalize on synergies with our lending activity. UT Private Securities may ostensibly seem out of place with the rest of our business lines, but it integrates well with our group by supplying personnel and monitoring equipment for our clients, as one of our main concerns is ensuring clients' safety and respect. We had previously outsourced security services for our buildings and car parks, but this presented many difficulties so we decided to develop our own private security resources that fit better with our values.</p><h4>How receptive has the market been to UT Holding's expansion of financial services in Nigeria and South Africa?</h4><p>We have experienced a learning curve so far. We have had to review South Africa and start very small. The important lesson that we learned was that it is necessary to work with local partners for this kind of venture. In both Nigeria and South Africa we intend to establish relationships with local partners. Nigeria is interesting because when we entered that market we were being told that our operation would fail within its first year; that was over four years ago.</p><h4>How would you evaluate access to capital for SMEs in Ghana?</h4><p>We have been trailblazers in developing a capital market for SMEs in Ghana. We started with lending, but now provide a wide range of services to such an extent that the central bank even finds it difficult to replicate our model in some cases. Successfully providing capital support for SMEs is a matter of ensuring that any credit from the financial sector will be mutually beneficial to the client. We are keen to ensure that our loans are actually going to improve the life of the people receiving them.</p><h4>The first half of 2015 was difficult for UT Bank. How have you managed to turn things around?</h4><p>Ghana has had all sorts of economic hardships that culminated in the recent IMF bailout. Our problems of access to electricity, unstable currency, devaluation, high inflation, and high tariffs on utilities have all had a harsh impact on SMEs. Companies in the manufacturing sector recorded losses almost across the board because of the consequent reductions in their working capital. The currency depreciation damaged business in the services and trading sectors, which rely on imported goods. The government was not paying companies in the oil sector and recoveries were not being paid for offshore locations. The government was simply not paying its contractors and this affected us directly, unlike other banks that were not financing SMEs. We wanted to look at the problem from within because we cannot control the external economic environment. The issue became how to restructure our internal processes and systems to ensure that UT bank can survive these downturns. We changed our management structure and examined the whole market to refocus on the sectors we wanted to be involved in. We identified, in this reassessment, our shortcomings, retrained our staff, and introduced a system to evaluate our risk management function and changed the credit appraisal process. We aggressively mobilized deposits in order to reduced the impact of the excessive rise in interest rates. We built on our existing retail loans to expand our portfolio of cheaper deposits. We recorded losses of approximately $7.4 million and $690,000 in 1Q2015 and 2Q2015, respectively, totaling 1H2015 losses at just over $8 million. We drastically reduced our losses and were back on the right track by 3Q2015 with a quarterly profit of over $950,000. We have the right plan in place and so we have high confidence in the team we have put together.</p><h4>You have spoken openly in the press about the need for government to strengthen institutions and restore accountability. How can the private sector support that?</h4><p>The private sector is largely dependent on resolving these issues in order to flourish. There are a lot of businesses wanting to come to Africa, but only with solid fundamental conditions in place will they see Ghana as a safe economic environment in which to invest. It is in businesses' interest that the government fix the national institutions and economic systems. Moving toward optimum governance is currently held back by a lack of demographic data, which in turn complicates understanding of where individuals live, what they earn, and therefore what would be the most appropriate tax structure. That is a major deficiency that makes our current budget deficit no surprise. The business community has to actively engage government to address our current problems for the general good. We are reliant on our systems functioning better and improving infrastructure in order to create the conditions for economic prosperity.</p><h4>In your opinion what can be done to support entrepreneurs with capital in Ghana?</h4><p>Starting a business in Ghana certainly requires some capital. We created a unique trust with around $20,000 in financing. Most young entrepreneurs have visions of big offices with state-of-the-art technology, but that is not always necessary to get a business idea off the ground. UT Bank supports NGOs like Enablis, for which I have the honor of serving as Chairman and which trains entrepreneurs via peer mentoring. We also organize business launch events and competitions for business plans through which UT Bank has supported several new entrepreneurs via loans or by facilitating collateral.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Ikonosoft evolved over the past year?</h4><p>In 2015, Ikonosoft underwent a transformation process to respond to developments in this rapidly changing sector. We went from being focused on integrating well-known brands such as IBM with other producers to actually preparing our own products. We used to sell to the largest companies in Colombia, but many of these companies then began to deal directly with the larger IT service providers, which forced us to reorient our strategy toward SMEs. There is huge potential from these customers. Out of the 10,000 largest companies in Colombia, only 1,000 are considered to be large companies, with the rest designated as SMEs.</p><h4>Why did you decide to change your strategy?</h4><p>The main reason for the change was the impact of the cloud on customers in Colombia. Today, every single customer can access these services without having to go through to an intermediary. In Colombia there are more than 500 IT intermediary companies, which is a figure that is far higher than it should be. We needed to reassess our services and objectives, and understood that we could reach a larger audience by producing rather than being an intermediary.</p><h4>What products are you currently developing?</h4><p>As an SME, our turnover is around $5 million, and we create products for medium-sized companies. To manage my stock with software designed for a multinational company, I would need to spend some $300,000 on it every year, so we leverage our capabilities and base our strategy on signing partnerships with small producers. We provide our products and services with relevance and flexibility to adapt to the different needs of the different economic sectors, with a reasonable price and viability. We also base our strategy on developing a long-term strategy with our customers and partners.</p><h4>What economic sectors hold the greatest potential in the short term?</h4><p>Our main focus is on manufacturing companies, but at we also have different applications depending on the product. We launched IkonoCloud Asset Management, a tool for companies to manage their assets on a renting basis. Therefore, all industrial companies lending machinery or equipment offer a great potential for us, such as companies with large fleets. We also offer IkonoCloud Commerce, a tool for small and medium producers to reach their customers through e-commerce channels. In this context, we also focus on small and medium manufacturers selling regionally and nationally. We also have products and services in the Customer Relationship Management sphere.</p><h4>What are the main trends in the Colombian IT industry?</h4><p>We see the greatest opportunities in the SME segment, which has been overlooked up to this point. There are more than 8,000 SMEs in Colombia, yet nobody has made specific IT products and services available to them. I also think there has been a lack of technical and strategic innovation in Colombia. This has started to change, especially taking into account that today, 8,000 SMEs are driving innovation development due to the fact that they had to revise their cost strategy without negatively impacting their growth strategy to survive.</p><h4>What are your competitive advantages?</h4><p>We aim to make a difference by leveraging our capable and skilled workforce to provide our employees with the necessary tools for development. We have created a training and educational platform, Ikonoflex, on which we spend around $5,000 per quarter to provide learning opportunities to our staff. Since the creation of this educational service, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of people interested in working for Ikonosoft. We also distinguish ourselves from the competition through our management of social media channels. We started to do thing differently in the sector and aim at further strengthening these innovative activities.</p><h4>What are your main expansion plans for the future?</h4><p>Over the course of 2016, we will invest more than $500,000 in the acquisition of systems in the training and recruitment spheres in order to broaden our services and product portfolio. We also want to expand our body of staff to around 40 engineers. In the future, we also see strong potential for exporting our knowledge to other regional countries, starting with our neighbors Panama and Ecuador.</p><h4>What is your vision for Ikonosoft over the coming five years?</h4><p>We will continue to focus on offering our services, and I expect we will reach a turnover of $20 million by expanding our product portfolio. We also hope to reduce our dependence on the intermediary services we still offer, which represent around 50% of our overall business activity.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We expect to reach a turnover of more than $100,000 from cloud-based services. In terms of engineering products, we should reach turnover of $1.5 million. We aim increase our overall turnover from $5 million to approximately $7 million.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The NSE recently upgraded its equity-trading platform with NASDAQ technology. How has that affected operations at the exchange?</h4><p>To enhance the investor experience, the NSE launched its X-Gen trading platform in September 2013. X-Gen is based on a number of leading technologies, including the NASDAQ OMX's X-Stream matching engine. It also supports other 21st century technology previously implemented by the exchange, such as a new website equipped with a real-time feed to a ticker and an upgraded virtual private network 20 times faster than the previous offering. Since its launch, X-Gen has demonstrated its innovative trading capabilities and the Nigerian capital market has benefited immensely. We have achieved improved market order flow, increases in the number of trades, high availability, direct market access, remote trading, and income diversification. X-Gen has brought about the advent of mobile and online trading technologies to the Nigerian Capital Market, a feat that could revolutionize market dynamics. Riding on the new platform, most of our dealing member firms have tapped into the benefits to introduce online trading platforms to deepen their businesses.</p><h4>What is the significance of the recently announced plan to overhaul the NSE to make it easier for foreign investors to access the market?</h4><p>To achieve our ambitions for market growth and development, the NSE is working on defining industry initiatives that will positively impact the Nigerian capital market, one of which is the revamp of the current market structure. Recently, we launched the Premium Board for companies that adhere to international best practices for corporate governance and meet the Exchange's highest standards of capitalization and liquidity. In a few months, we also plan to institute a Growth Board that aims to support high growth potential companies. In 2014, we signed a contractual agreement with the London Stock Exchange (LSE) to encourage dual listings and promoting each other's markets in a manner that ensures that investors and issuers are fully aware of the investing/listing benefits in both markets. In June 2015, the NSE and LSE held a Dual Listing Conference in London. We also just recently returned from a technical tour of the LSE Group with the purpose of furthering discussions on increasing the depth of the Nigerian capital market.</p><h4>What progress has been made in recent years to strengthen corporate governance and transparency among Nigerian firms to attract investment?</h4><p>Diverse investment products, strong regulation, increased transparency, and easy access to the market have ensured increased participation by domestic investors. To be listed is to be in the public spotlight, which connotes transparency, accountability, and integrity—all of which are key elements of corporate governance, integral in attracting both foreign portfolio investment (FPI) and foreign direct investment (FDI). In 2014, we launched the Corporate Governance Rating System (CGRS), which provides assurance for investors by evaluating companies based on the quality of their corporate integrity, corporate compliance with governance rules, and understanding of fiduciary responsibilities by directors and corporate reputation. Currently, CGRS is a key requirement for companies to be admitted into the NSE Premium Board. To facilitate information disclosure, transparency, and accountability in the marketplace, the Exchange also introduced a secure platform, X-Issuer, which allows issuers to electronically submit financial and other relevant information to the market and the Exchange in a seamless fashion. The information provided through the X-Issuer provides a wealth of information that guides investors and intermediaries in investment decisions simultaneously.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you view YIACO's contribution to the healthcare industry in Kuwait and the region today?</h4><p>Since beginning operations in the 1950s as one of the first pharmaceutical companies in the entire region, YIACO today has achieved a strong market share and product diversification that is vast compared to other companies in the sector. Our product portfolio covers a wide range of pharmaceutical brands and medical equipment with partners and principles such as Pfizer, Sanofi, AstraZeneca, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. We play a major role in Kuwait's healthcare sector by supplying both retail and wholesale distribution to the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Defense, and to the private sector as well. We have the knowledge and the infrastructure necessary to continue meeting international standards, often achieving an even higher level than those required through our quality assurance programs and by applying international best practices. We continuously hold seminars and educational gatherings between doctors and industry professionals to ensure international best practices. These programs are aligned with our international principles to follow suit in worldwide trends and healthcare improvements. </p><h4>What is YIACO's role in supporting large government projects and the national needs of Kuwait's healthcare sector?</h4><p>YIACO has continuously supported the government in its projects from the very beginning, since Kuwait's healthcare sector is reliant on public health. We offer pharmaceuticals through our wholesale division by providing a full range of medication along with medical equipment for the government's needs. We also were part of the first governmental BOT project to build and operate Adan hospital's radiology, nuclear medicine, and laboratory as a fully operational medical center. We have managed this governmental project for the past 10 years offering medical services to patients who reside in that area of Kuwait. We are also part of governmental initiatives to introduce medication and services to those suffering from diseases such as diabetes. We also liaise between ministry officials and our partners and principles to streamline and align both parties for the benefit of better services and products in the healthcare sector. These initiatives with the government are all aligned with the compliance and quality standards and solidify YIACO as a leading influencer in the industry. </p><h4>What trends are you seeing in Kuwait in terms of healthcare sector demand today and moving forward?</h4><p>We are unfortunately seeing a lot of demand in the blood pressure, cardiac, and diabetic segments. These are currently the segments with the most focus and urgency in Kuwait. We rely on our principals to ensure that we have everything necessary to meet these needs. Looking to the future, we make sure that we are communicating further market needs to our principals when it comes to medical R&amp;D and innovation; we work alongside our principles to pursue products and services worldwide rather than just in Kuwait, which allows us to look beyond what is only available here. What we are seeing is that as the population continues to grow, the focus in the healthcare field will increasingly shift toward the elderly. YIACO is aware of this shift in the healthcare sector needs and along with our partners and the MOH we will be focusing on these needs. As part of this initiative we are looking into homecare and nursing care to expand in Kuwait. The Ministry is looking to put together health insurance for the elderly and we are working with it to ensure that we comply with that when the time comes.</p><h4>What areas would you highlight as opportunities for further investment in Kuwait's healthcare sector?</h4><p>There is a crucial need for building and expanding hospitals in Kuwait. With government support, investors can do a lot to close the capacity gaps remaining in our healthcare facility infrastructure. Notably, the Jaber Al Ahmad Al Jaber Al Sabah Hospital, the largest in Kuwait, is going to be delivered in 2016. With this new project serving the population, the healthcare companies will be able to participate and get more involved in investing toward Kuwait's healthcare sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Jotun's most significant achievements since it was established in Thailand in terms of production capacity and product portfolio?</h4><p>We have a long history here, with operations beginning in 1968. We started quite early in Thailand, and in our business we focus on four segments, namely decorative, marine, protective, and powder. All of these four segments make up our production here. Our revenue in Thailand is close to THB4 billion and we employ more than 400 people. In the past few years, however, we have seen a bit of a slowdown because of the economic and political situation. So far, the most in-demand segment is decorative. We see that in the long term because it points to solutions for the paint capital in this sector. The decorative capacity in this country is still growing because it is a developing country. Nonetheless, we are actually quite balanced, and within the company portfolio in Thailand it is divided into 44% sales in decorative, 24% in protective, 26% in powder, and the rest in marine coating.</p><h4>What does the recent integration of the AEC mean for Jotun and how can this single-market encourage new opportunities?</h4><p>The biggest benefit will be with the taxes, because we will have more conveniences with import and export duties. If you speed up the order for transportation as well that is related to human capital and people moving making it easier. It will not be a fast change because this region is complicated, politically speaking. Also there are different economic policies, taxation, and cultures that will affect us over a longer period. Nonetheless, Jotun enjoys a strong presence in ASEAN, where our product and client base typically varies depending on the market. Our marine operations, for example, are strongest in Singapore because there are many ship owners there. In Malaysia our strength is with the oil industry. Indonesia is the same way. Myanmar and Cambodia are just beginning to emerge, and in the Philippines, things are developing slowly and we are building a factory there.</p><h4>In which sector of the economy do you forecast the most growth in coming years?</h4><p>I do not foresee rapid growth, and as we look at the country's broader economic development, there has been stagnation over the past few years. Many have talked about 2% growth as being the number for Thailand, and I have seen that as well. The market is quite volatile at the moment, and the growth is not there. Our budget has been reduced as a result. In 2015, we actually dropped by 8%. Real estate is a sector in which we work with closely, however yet again it is quite difficult to forecast the trends there. There are still many projects that have been proposed but are not on the schedule. What we understand is that due to market volatility, interest, and exchange rates, it is difficult for financial institutions and developers to protect their return on investments. They are trying to predict low investment plans and not cancelling but rather delaying.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>This year we tried to revise our budget to some extent and be more cost conscious about production. Our expectations are to achieve 3-5% growth. This year, we will see better growth in decorative and powder. In terms of production, we are producing 22 million liters, and we are producing powder at close to 9,000 tons. Our growth has been fluctuating, but we have still grown so much since when basic operations began. We are established in both Thailand and the wider region. The foundations are quite good here, and we are looking at long-term solutions such as building a warehouse here. That is why we are spending a lot of money this year in this area.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What initiatives has Dubai Refreshments put forth to push the F&amp;B industry here in Dubai?</h4><p>Dubai Refreshments is one of the oldest manufacturing companies in the UAE, established in 1959. Certainly, we played a big role in establishing the beverage industry in general, being one of the first. The way we drink a beverage is different today than it was before in terms of the type of package, size of package, and range of flavors. Therefore, we developed our business accordingly. We've also introduced new beverages, such as Lipton Iced Tea and Frutz . We are constantly expanding our product portfolio to meet consumer needs. As consumers become more sophisticated, they want more variety. They want a beverage that addresses different occasions. There are functional drinks, drinks for treats, drinks for quenching thirst, and so on. People drink for different reasons and we are trying to address different consumer needs through our beverage portfolio.</p><h4>What does Dubai need to do to become an F&amp;B manufacturing hub?</h4><p>There are a lot of positives for Dubai to become a hub. It is already a hub for trading because it has great ports, great infrastructure, great communication, a business-friendly environment, places for conferences and meetings, and it is a great place for people to visit. It boasts great entertainment and solid services. All of these things have helped to turn Dubai into a hub for the Middle East and now it's expanding beyond. All of these are positives. As far as manufacturing, it's a little bit more challenging because the competitive advantages of Dubai are less visible. Normally people look for the lowest cost of production to set up a manufacturing facility. In Dubai that would be difficult because of energy costs and limited land space. However, there is an opportunity for Dubai to become a strong hub for high quality manufacturing with value added vs. commodities. Brands and products that have a certain premium image can be manufactured in Dubai. I don't see Dubai ever becoming a low-cost producer, although the costs can be lower than they are today. There has been a lot of research done to see how manufacturers can reduce their costs and become more competitive. I see Dubai potentially becoming a high-quality producer with great service and a great place to do business overall.</p><h4>What new technologies will you implement in your new manufacturing facilities?</h4><p>The new facilities will open at the beginning of 2016. There is a lot of technology that goes into beverage production. There is a new product range we can produce that we couldn't before. The speed of production is also increasing. Now we can have lines that require less labor because of the technology. We can have lines that have much better quality control because of technology. We can also use lines that require a lot less energy and have a much lower carbon footprint. Overall, we have invested in equipment that is more efficient, more environmentally friendly, and uses less energy.</p><h4>How much will you increase your capacity?</h4><p>The new factory can produce up to 120 million cases per year. In the initial stages it will be around 70 million, and then over the next 30 years we will gradually increase production to full capacity.</p><h4>What are the main markets that you export to?</h4><p>We export to over 25 countries. Most exports are to neighboring countries, like Qatar, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. We also export to many countries in Africa. I would say the biggest opportunity in general is in different countries in Africa. It is a big opportunity.</p><h4>What percentage of growth have you had YoY?</h4><p>We've been growing our revenue in general in the mid single digits. The export part of the business is very volatile and impacts the topline sometimes. We try to balance that out by having a very consistent local business. This has helped us maintain very steady growth in profitability despite some sales volatility. We are trying to reduce that volatility by expanding the countries we export to. Rather than relying on one or two countries with big volumes, we want to have 40 countries consistently buying from the US. We are also trying to expand the range of products and packages that we sell.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2016?</h4><p>For 2016, our biggest goal is to make the transition from this factory to the new factory smoothly, without interruption, leveraging the resources we have on hand to expand the business into new categories, as well as having more flexibility and capacity to satisfy both the local consumer needs, as well as our export needs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[doing-our-duty]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an introduction to your company's evolution in Mozambique?</h4><p>We have been in Mozambique for over 25 years as Opway Moçambique. The parent company is a Portuguese company called Opway Engenharia SA, which is almost 90 years old. A quarter of a century ago, they came to Mozambique to set up a company under the Mozambican law, and have remained here since that time, transferring experiences and knowledge from Portugal to Mozambique. The company has overcome enormous challenges. In October 2014 Opway Moçambique Engenharia Lda was acquired by Nadhari Lda, a company incorporated under Mozambican law. At the moment we are stable and 100% Mozambican. After this purchase we named the company Nadhari Opway. This change has led to considerable growth, development, and restructuring in the company, something which I have been spearheading for two years now.</p><h4>What are the projects planned for the next three to five years?</h4><p>We have a strategy to grow based on sustainability. More important than turnover, our target is profitability. We have some target projects, such as supporting the country's need to satisfy the demand for housing for the under privileged, infrastructure projects, water supply, sanitation, and road building. Our focus areas are in line with the development of the country.</p><h4>Who are Nadhari Opway's main clients?</h4><p>We work with both the government and private sector, in almost equal shares. Government projects are usually higher in terms of turnover figures, sometimes even 10 times larger than those of the private sector, so generally we focus on obtaining those contracts.</p><h4>In terms of sanitation and infrastructure, are you focusing solely on Maputo or on other provinces in the country, too?</h4><p>At this moment our projects are based in Maputo, Inhambane, Gaza, and Tete. We are also reactivating a site in Nacala, and have plans to move to the north of the country as well as to take advantage of the opportunities created by large FDI projects. For now these are the regions where we are working with greater intensity.</p><h4>What are the main differences between working in Maputo and the rest of the country?</h4><p>The main difference is logistics. Around 90% of companies are based in Maputo, so everything that happens outside is difficult to coordinate. We are in a restructuring process and are gradually solving these problems. Over the past couple of years, after the restructuring process that we undertook, the first project we won was in Tete. Currently, we have three ongoing projects in Tete. One has been completed—we completed a shopping center called Centro Shopping Tete—and we now have two additional, smaller projects with Vale.</p><h4>One of the main concerns we note when we interview managers is human resources. What is your experience of recruiting, training, and maintaining your staff?</h4><p>Mozambique already has skilled professionals, although the country faces some challenges related to education. As a Mozambican company, it is our duty to offer this support. We believe that our company's workforce should be Mozambican and, as a result, we provide training to those who want to expand their skill sets. To perform contracts outside of Maputo, we rarely take professionals from here, opting to always try to hire locally instead. One project for this year is to incorporate interns here at the company and give them an opportunity to work with us. Since I arrived, we have hired six interns and they have all stayed with us. In total we have a 160 staff members.</p><h4>Since last year we have seen an impressive amount of new buildings springing up around the city. Do you fear that there is a bubble?</h4><p>This could happen in Maputo with high-end apartments. We are focused on housing for the less privileged, and at that level the risk is smaller. We target mid- and low-level housing projects that have high potential in Maputo, but also in other provinces. A large project for the near future in Maputo is the development of the Katembe district, which is something that we would be interested in participating in.</p><h4>What sets you apart from your competitors?</h4><p>No other construction company has an African woman in the leading position, which also reflects the nature of Opway and Nadhari Opway's culture, regarding internal and external relations, including leadership, flexibility, delegation, and collective definition of objectives. We are 100% Mozambican, even though we have strong connections with Portugal. We want to help our country grow. We have all the know-how of an established Portuguese company, combined with local knowledge of the market.</p><h4>How would you describe the business environment in Mozambique?</h4><p>People usually think Mozambique is a simple place to do business, but it is not. It is easy to enter the market once you know the laws and rules. The market is very demanding and competitive, so it's important to be aware of the regulatory framework, to focus on business, and to work really hard to obtain results.</p><h4>Can you name some of the most significant projects carried out by Opway in the country?</h4><p>We have participated in the construction consortium of the Tete Bridge. We have also built the Mocolumba Bridge in Zambezia, as well as the Xai Xai Bridge. In terms of the education segment, we have completed a university school in Gaza, a secondary school in Moamba, and more than 20 rural schools in Niassa. Also, we recently finished the Centro Shopping Tete for Pylos and we expect to participate in the construction of more. In Tete, we finished the Moatize multisport facility for Vale. We are now working on the revitalization of the Inharrime Bridge, and in Maputo we are building a 16-floor, 20,000sqm building for the INSS. In terms of infrastructure we have worked on the rehabilitation of the EN221, Lots 1 and 3 of Namacurra/Nampevo and Alto Molócuí¨/Rio Ligonha, respectively, in Zambezia, and 114km of the EN1 Incoluane/Chicumbane project in Gaza and on urban sewage works in Mocuba in Zambezia.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our goal is to reach around approximately $30 million in sales turnover in 2016. We also aim to hire more people, and eventually reach 200 workers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did QNB Group manage to sustain and maintain its edge of profitability amid competition and world challenges?</h4><p>QNB's key strengths are buttressed by several core pillars: the strength of the QNB brand franchise, the quality of the senior management team, robust cost controls, market leading capital ratios, broad sectoral expertise, prudent risk management, and strong and growing relationships with the public and private sectors. The Bank's growth has been driven by two major engines: the favorable macroeconomic environment in Qatar, which is a growth driver for the banking sector, and QNB's international expansion in high-growth markets, where we believe we have a competitive advantage and are able to leverage trade and investment flows within and across those countries and the wider QNB network.</p><h4>QNB Group has many representative offices in the world's key emerging and established markets. How those offices will help bring in more international companies to do business in Qatar?</h4><p>Currently, QNB has established representative offices in several large and high-growth emerging markets, such as China, India, and Vietnam. Trade and investment flows between these countries and Qatar, as well across our footprint, have been growing over the past years. There are, for example, several Chinese and Indian companies operating in Qatar. Similarly, several Qatar-based multinational corporations have growing businesses with these countries. These offices act as a conduit, facilitating these flows to increase business potential for both Qatar/Middle Eastern companies planning to expand and grow their international business contribution and vice versa.</p><h4>With these challenges in mind, how would you summarize the keys to success for QNB to continue to thrive here in the domestic market?</h4><p>Domestically, QNB offers a universal banking model that provides a wide range of products and services to the public and private sector as well as individuals by leveraging its capabilities and in-depth expertise across all key sectors and segments. QNB intends to act as an incubator to nurture the growth of SMEs by assisting them enhance their businesses' competitiveness and sustainability, in line with the QNV2030, to nurture and further develop the private sector. On the retail banking front, QNB has a dominant market share in the Qatar. We offer individuals a diverse range of innovative products and services through an array of channels (physical and remote) for all segments (affluent/ mass affluent/ mass retail). QNB also offer a range of tailored investment solutions and bespoke wealth management services to serve the Qatar's high net-worth clientele, either onshore of offshore through our subsidiary QNB Banque Privee Suisse in Switzerland.</p><h4>How important is international diversification to QNB's overall growth strategy?</h4><p>International expansion is one of the cornerstones of QNB's strategy to achieve its vision of becoming a leading Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asian bank by 2020, and a global bank by 2030. In line with this vision, QNB will continue to expand its international network and footprint through strategic and opportunistic inorganic growth. Target markets are selected frontier and emerging markets that demonstrate favorable macroecnomic growth, coupled with a growing and healthy banking sector as well as a range of available targets. When looking at growth opportunities globally, we have identified a set of markets in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia as our focus areas for further expansion. Selected countries in those regions are fuelled by ongoing improvement in business conditions, favorable demographics, and increasing globalization. Furthermore, there are significant trade and investment flows within and across these regions, which QNB, as financial intermediary, could facilitate. Growth in these regions is key to achieving QNB's goals. We believe that a wider geographical presence gained through such expansion will reduce the QNB Group's exposure to certain economic risks in the event of any economic downturn and, in turn, provide stability to its financial position.</p><h4>Recently, QNB was the platinum sponsor of the Information Security Conference for the Financial Sector, at which major industry players from Qatar and the world discussed IT &amp; e-security challenges in today's global business environment. What are the most important first steps to be taken by both the private and public sector in order to safeguard the country from these attacks?</h4><p>Technology and the internet continue to evolve at an extraordinary speed and the benefits to organizations and customers worldwide have been revolutionary. However, cyber threats are the price we pay for this development. The information age has created new vulnerabilities and the opportunity to exploit them. It has become all the more important to protect the security and integrity of this information, the internet, and its supporting infrastructure. Today, we believe three layers of governance and security enforcement are critical to ensure and further enhance IT security as a response to cyber threats: technology, people, and policies. Those layers are equally valid and important for the public and the private sector. Investing in the right technologies and at the right levels are important, especially as the threats we are trying to detect and defeat are moving targets. It is equally important to recruit the right people and continue to keep their knowledge and awareness up to date with the evolving threats. Last but not least, appropriate policies and procedures need to be in place to effectively manage the risks and mitigate the impacts. All three layers need to be strong and continually strengthened to support and protect institutions, authorities, and corporations in the public and private sector as well as our society.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Although the global operating environment for banking and finance has been challenging, our strategic, regional focus is enabling us to capture exciting opportunities. Despite the global headwinds in 2015 that have impacted African and Southeast Asian markets, there are pockets of opportunities as they continue to require investment and trade flows to support economic development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[turn-up-the-volume]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the total size of the BVP and what are the most important sectors?</h4><p>Since its creation 25 years ago, the BVP has grown at a CAGR of 34.25% per year. Our volume as of December 2015 amounted to nearly $5.25 billion, which consists of $3.40 billion in the primary market and $1.85 billion in the secondary market and repurchases. The main sectors that make up the stock exchange are government debt issues and the financial industry, which amount to $1.5 billion and 1.06 billion, respectively, followed by industry and energy at $706.04 million and credit at $276.89 million.</p><h4>What features have allowed the BVP to remain resilient in light of global economic turbulence?</h4><p>One important factor is that the BVP is locally driven. Our issuers have little or no international influence on their business here. Being locally driven, there is little that can affect us dramatically. In addition, we are a dollarized economy, which helps us because we do not experience sizeable currency fluctuations. Our tax-free trading in the market obviously attracts regional and international players, and this has helped us remain resilient in our market.</p><h4>What roles do education and strategy play in developing the BVP?</h4><p>Education from every point of view is key for this market. It is a common misconception that the stock exchange is for only a few privileged or private investors. It is largely because there has not been enough education that many people still do not understand that the stock exchange is an alternative to investing savings in banks. Part of our strategic plan for the next year is to teach students from elementary school through college about how the stock market works. It is also important for us to educate investors so they can understand what a rating is, as well as the risks and purpose of investments. Also, it is important to educate them on who the key players are, their role, importance, and responsibilities. For example, we are constantly considered the local regulator when we are not and our role is not. We also want to use is social media in the coming year in order to reach the younger generations and the social media users. We believe it is key for information and education purposes. Our market is small compared to other countries, which makes it easier for us to communicate with the public.</p><h4>Panama was removed from the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) grey list in February 2016. To what extent will this impact foreign participation in the BVP?</h4><p>The impact on foreign investment will be huge. Along with Euroclear and Latinclear, we have been working on an important project that we launched in April 2014; the i-Link. Under the project, securities that are listed on our exchange go through this i-Link and, once authorized by Euroclear, are available to international investors through the Euroclear platform. Being on the grey list had paused this project, so now that we have been removed from the list we will be able to proceed with the second phase. That will have an important impact on the country; not only in the financial industry, but on the strategic planning at the exchange. Having Panama labeled as a high-risk country  obviously affected banks and possibly discouraged investors from coming to Panama. That said, the country took all the necessary measures in order be removed from this list and I am thrilled that it has happened.</p><h4>What explains the low number of upcoming IPOs?</h4><p>Our market is small and it is mainly focused on fixed income. However, one of the things that we will be working on is meeting with the market players and working with potential issuers to better understand their needs and why they are not coming to the stock market to issue. By doing this, we can understand what we need to include or exclude from a regulatory point of view in order to make it more appealing for them to list shares on the exchange. We have no information about any future IPOs coming to the market at this moment.</p><h4>Panama and El Salvador recently signed an agreement to integrate their stock exchanges. How will this benefit both countries?</h4><p>It is beneficial and something that has been in the making for many years. The fact that the Central Depositories of Panama and El Salvador have had a bilateral agreement for almost 12 years now made it easier. Due to regulatory issues, Costa Rica has been unable to join at this moment, but we will continue to work with them to include them in the integration. This integration will facilitate trading without having to separately list securities on each country's exchange and regulators. In a way, our integration has also attracted further potential issuers.</p><h4>You are a founding member of the Asociación de Mujeres Directoras Corporativas (WCD-Panama), which aims to promote the integration of women in executive positions. Can you tell us more about this?</h4><p>It is a global association that promotes the representation of women on corporate boards. We have held a series of activities throughout the year and hosted some important speakers at two important conferences here in Panama. Our aim was not to diffuse the information amongst women, but rather to give men all the information they would need in order to have women on a board. We launched a website this year that has information for any woman that is interested in being a part of our organization, and for any organization that is looking to add women as executives or as board members. We also keep record statistics of any country that has a regulatory minimum percentage of women that need to be on boards. We do not have that here in Panama, and actually I would not like to see an enforced quota for female composition of boards. I would rather have this happen naturally, as women have the potential to achieve this by merit.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>I have many expectations for the year ahead. Now that we have been excluded from the FATF's list we can continue with our i-Link project, which will help us attract more issuers to Panama. We are also analyzing important software providers in the region to replace our existing trading platform. Internally, we have an important consolidation that we are working on with our sister company, Central Latinoamericana de Valores, which will translate into more efficiency and we will be able to provide better service to our clients and to the market as a whole. Education will also remain an important component of our agenda for the upcoming year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How successful has the company been in establishing itself as one of the major holding groups in the country?</h4><p>When we began developing the company's strategy about 20 years ago, we worked with many consultants and chose an initial strategy that would allow us to work on low-competitive markets. We were unsure if our managers could compete in markets that were saturated. We chose markets such as the oil and gas sector, where we focus on production, especially in the energy market, i.e. electricity and heat supply, as well as real estate. For example, we now own a large industrial zone that we rent in order to avoid dealing with competitors in production release, promotion, and marketing. This strategy has been beneficial, as we carefully monitor trends in the oil market and have managed to sustain continual growth for 10-15 years up until last year. We operated similarly with energy markets, as we entered at a difficult time when many agents were on the verge of bankruptcy. Currently, energy is leading our portfolio, and we are standing firm. We have been operating in competitive markets for the last three or four years, entering the retail sector, where our pharmacy chain is now rated number one in Kazakhstan, as well as the banking sector—a competitive area as well, but one we are now able to compete in. We also have purchased ALMA-TV, which is in a challenging but promising market. We have been working with the Boston Consulting Group for six months now, and we will soon finish developing the strategy for the next five years.</p><h4>What opportunities will the purchase of ALMA-TV bring your company, and how does does media fit into your growth strategy?</h4><p>We are going to make ALMA-TV an internet-provider and compete with Kazakhtelecom. This will also create synergy with our bank, which will be more involved with connectivity in the future. Along with ALMA-TV, we have a share in the advertising market, which will create relationships with our other companies and help promote their products. Now we are in talks with Kcell, which should lead to an increase of our product values and to future partnerships. We bought ALMA-TV because we saw great potential in this field; we hold around 60% of Kazakhstan's cable TV market and we are present in every city with a population greater than 100,000. If we join efforts with Kcell, we will be present in every household, even in the rural areas. Providers all across the globe agree that fiber-optical cables ensure much better connectivity than satellites.</p><h4>Economic diversification is a very strong feature for Ordabasy Group. How important it this trend on a national level?</h4><p>It is crucial for Kazakhstan to have a diversified economy, not only to sell raw materials, but to process them into end products as well. We try to diversify our business by entering the fields where our management is strong, but if we cannot rely on our own skills, we prefer to hold our shares and delegate the management to third parties. For example, we do not interfere with the banking management as the other shareholders have it under control. This is also applied for pharmacies, as we entrust the management to the original shareholders, who continue to hold 51% of the shares. In the oil and gas and energy sectors, however, we feel confident, and act as the controlling and managing company. As the country's resources represent the entire periodic table, it is important that we develop the mining of gold, copper, and other metals. We recently entered this market by buying a gold and copper company and we will soon start to produce those metals. Of course, selling them for foreign currency eliminates the devaluation risks, but the most important business for Kazakhstan is logistics and transit. While we do not have access to large bodies of water, we have both China and Russia as neighbors, which will help us maximize our transit potential. Agriculture is the other important sector: we have vast tracts of land suitable for farming and animal husbandry, and we can export organic products. For example, while China exports its apples worldwide, it imports organic apples from Kazakhstan for domestic consumption.</p><h4>We have seen government initiatives trying to boost potential for agriculture. How does Ordabasy Group intend to get involved?</h4><p>We have a small milk farm in Shymkent Region with Canadian cows. Currently, we are also planting 500ha in Zharkent city, near the border with China, and starting next year we hope to start exporting apples to China. We have a joint venture with the Abu Dhabi Falah Fund, an egg farm near Almaty, which we have been working with for almost nine years and have learned how to properly manage and structure an agriculture business in management and structure.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>In general, budget revenues have decreased and oil and gas prices have dropped throughout the entire country. There are many positives as well, however, as the government is implementing a structural reform through wide-scale privatization. Next year will be busy: privatization will be massive, and foreign companies will be encouraged to enter the market. That will give great momentum to Kazakhstan's development, especially in terms of the energy sector, as we plan to participate in privatization of the powers plants and of the Almaty power supply system. With the governmental and the business aspirations in accord, the next year will be favorable for investors and businesses alike, and not just within Kazakhstan. We are now in talks with two Russian companies regarding the purchase of a cable operator in Russia, and we have ambitious plans of expanding our Europharma pharmacy chain to China. It is a difficult task, but we are working hard for it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your Ministry was formed in a bid to help solve an electricity crisis that has been hampering economic growth for the last three years. What were the factors that led to the crisis and what are your priorities for dealing with it?</h4><p>Ghana's first major hydroelectric power plant on the Volta River, the Akosombo Hydroelectric Plant, was commissioned in 1965 with an installed generating capacity of 609MW that later increased to 1020MW after expansion works. In 1982, the second major  hydroelectric power plant, the 160MW Kpong Hydroelectric Power Plant, was commissioned downstream from the Akosombo Dam. The third hydroelectric power plant was commissioned in 2013, with an installed capacity of 400MW at Bui in the Brong Ahafo Region on the Black Volta River. The country's electricity needs have, over the years, largely been catered to by these hydroelectric dams until water levels began decreasing. The Akosombo, Kpong, and Bui Dams are now operating at 50% or less capacity. There is therefore a need to augment electricity production by looking at other sources of electricity such as thermal, solar, and coal. In the short term, the government is considering a number of generation projects to help mitigate the shortfalls in power generation capacity. These projects will commence operation in 2016 and include the 220MW Kpone Thermal Power Project (KTPP), the 110MW TICO Expansion Project in Takoradi, the first half of the 360MW Sunon Asogli Phase 2 Project, and the 38MW VRA TT2PP expansion project. Additionally, the other alternatives that the government has toward the same goal of mitigating generation capacity shortfalls and providing adequate redundancy or capacity reserve include fast-tracked energy projects such as the 225MW Powership in Tema, another 250MW emergency AMERI Project in Takoradi, and a 300MW GE Early Power Project in Tema. In the medium term, projects slated for delivery between 2016 and 2018 include the 360MW Asogli Phase 2 Project, 350MW CenPower Project, where ground has already been broken and civil works commenced, and parliamentary approval has been obtained for Government Consent and Support Agreements (GCSA) authorizing both a 360MW Jacobsen Power Project and the 240MW Amandi Project. The government is also considering adding 1,000MW of “clean" coal into the generation mix.</p><h4>Gas has been highlighted as one of the key cornerstones powering Ghana's industrial and economic growth. How is your Ministry prioritizing gas development in the country?</h4><p>In order to address the erratic nature of gas supply from Nigeria through the West African Gas Pipeline, the government is currently considering fuel supply projects such as an emergency LNG project to be delivered at Tema by West African Gas Limited, which has already commenced, while another regular LNG project to be delivered by Quantum Power Ghana Gas Limited in the second quarter of 2016 is progressing steadily. The government has also agreed through the cabinet to make available the reverse flow of gas through the West Africa Gas Pipeline from Ghana National Gas Company in the Western Region to the Tema power enclave in the event of gas shortages from Nigeria.</p><h4>Finance for the energy sector has been a problem in the past. How do you forecast the capital markets' support of Ghana's energy challenges?</h4><p>In 2014, the government of Ghana signed a compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) under which the MCC will support the power sector in Ghana to provide adequate and reliable supply of power and also help ECG maintain a clean balance sheet. One area that the MCC prioritized was the restructuring of the Electricity Company of Ghana in order to bring in private participation to the electricity distribution sector. Its role is to look at what form private-sector participation (PSP) should take. It is its responsibility to strategize and find a solution to employ and strengthen strategy to employ the ECG's finances. Its studies conducted thus far for the MCC recommended the implementation of either partial privatization or concessions. Under partial privatization, part of the shares of the government in ECG, not less than 51%, would be sold to a private entity, which would then manage and operate the ECG distribution system. Under the concession option, the operations of ECG would be handed over to a single concessionaire, which would control and operate the ECG network for a period of 20-30 years. At the end of the concession period, the operations would return to ECG. The assets would remain at all times during the concession period the bona-fide property of ECG. </p><h4>What are the Ministry's priorities for 2016? </h4><p>The Ministry is vigorously pursuing the restructuring of some of the sector agencies to bring about a much-needed increase in efficiency. Under this, the Volta River Authority (VRA) is to be split into hydro and thermal entities. An advisory committee has been assembled by the Ministry, and given definitive aims and timelines to submit a report on the consultation processes. The Ministry will also implement the government's decision to adopt the single concession option as the preferred option for private sector participation in the electricity distribution sector in line with the MCC Compact II, and will implement the six projects outlined under the compact. These six projects are the ECG Financial and Operational Turnaround Project, the NEDCo Financial and Operational Turnaround Project, the Access to Electricity Project, the Regulatory Strengthening Project, the Capacity Building Project, the Power Generation Sector Improvement Project, and the Demand Side Management and Energy Efficiency Project.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the keys to success of Behbehani Group over the past few years?</h4><p>We have achieved so much in the last few years. We have officially partnered with many luxury brands, expanded boutiques, opened new boutiques to enhance the customer experience, and have maintained our sales by investing and organizing events that strengthen the relationship with our customers. It was my grandfather Morad Yousuf Behbehani's vision to bring the most luxurious brands to Kuwait, and my father followed the same path by expanding the portfolio of the Group. At this stage we are focusing on enhancing customer experience and providing the highest level of service and after service. It is the trust we maintain with our brands and the strong relationship that we maintain that has kept us in this position in the industry. We know our brands. This has worked for us so far and we intend on working with the same goals and hope that it strengthens our position further.</p><h4>What trends are you seeing in the luxury brand market in Kuwait?</h4><p>Customers have become more attentive to details, hence, we realized that luxury brands in Kuwait should provide the same service and experience that customers are getting in Europe or USA. Moreover, customers in Kuwait are following international luxury trends and they are up to date with all the events and activities that are taking place internationally. Kuwaitis are always accepting new trends and they are always eager to try new things and see what fits them best, be it bohemian, artsy, chic, classic or other styles; they are constantly changing with the world, but as always, staying connected with their roots—never straying from their authentic culture.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We have high expectations for 2016. We intend to expand our business further, but it is difficult to predict exact growth levels and maintain the same profits, which fluctuate. At the moment, we see a slight set back in the Kuwaiti economy but it is still firm. According to Alpen capital, it is and despite any short-term factors, the retail sector is predicted to remain robust in the long term. I also see long-term potential in the Kuwaiti consumer market, particularly for non-essential items and aspirational purchasing by younger consumers whose incomes are rising. I cannot predict the same for the other GCC countries, but I do wish the same for them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Most GCC nations face the challenge of balancing cultural heritage with rapid globalization. What are the foundations of Kuwaiti culture, both historically and today?</h4><p>Families have traditionally been the focus of Kuwaiti culture and that remains the case today. Multi-generational families share homes, celebrations, and the responsibility to continue Kuwait's history, traditions, and stories. What is interesting today is the growing role of grandparents outside the home. It is not unusual for grandparents to bring their grandchildren to participate in DAI cultural and educational programs held during working hours. This is an example of how Kuwaitis are adapting to fast-paced modernity without sacrificing the important role of the family or social and cultural heritage.</p><h4>What is the aim of the new children's library, and what are some other leading educational programs that you are focused on in Kuwait?</h4><p>The primary focus of all our education programs is cultural awareness, although it takes various forms depending on the audience. DAI programs strive to give participants the information and experiences they need to truly be a part of an increasingly global civilization. In addition to attending the evening lectures, educational opportunities cannot be underestimated. Adults completing the docent training course and working as a docent have an opportunity to be intimately involved in nearly all aspects of DAI. They host guests in the museums, participate in special lectures and training sessions, and generally support the organization as needed. In effect, the docents are students and teachers, constantly learning more about the arts and culture of the region and sharing their knowledge with others. The children's libraries, which will open in both the ACC and YCC in January 2016, and all of the children's programs, are based on the “Four Cs“ of collaboration, communication, creativity, and critical thinking, which are built into activities designed to promote cultural understanding and awareness. These programs are for children from 18 months through high school and, because of the multi-national backgrounds of the participants and the incorporation of the Four Cs in the programming, the children expand their knowledge not just of Islamic art and culture, but also the diverse arts and cultures of their classmates. </p><h4>DAI launched its 21st Annual Cultural Season in September 2015. What growth have you seen in DAI's Cultural Season over the years, and what are the main objectives and highlights of the 21st season?</h4><p>The primary objective of the Cultural Season programming has not changed since our first cultural season launched more than 20 years ago. Our purpose, then and now, is to provide individuals of all ages  with opportunities to discover more about the art and culture that surrounds them. What has changed is the volume and diversity of the participants and the activities included in our cultural seasons. This year's program includes 32 lectures, 16 classic films, 33 concerts, two theatrical weekends, eight Family Days, and five exhibitions. There will also be at least three book launches, two festivals, 124 children's education opportunities, five training sessions for volunteer docents, and many extra events that will be added during the season. There are always many surprises in our lectures and events, so predicting the highlights in advance is a guessing game. Highlights, like beauty, are in the eyes of the beholder. For some it will be a particular performance, for others a lecture, and for others an exhibition or children's program. This is one of the keys to our success. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is at the forefront of the Ministry of State for Youth Affairs' strategy to develop the youth in Kuwait?</h4><p>At the forefront of the Ministry of Youth Affairs (MYA) mission is the youth themselves. Essentially, the Ministry has arisen from the youth themselves, and is run by and for the youth. At its core, MYA is a facilitating, enabling, and empowering incubator that promotes positive youth development and provides services, opportunities, and a supportive environment for youth engagement across a myriad of different fields. With departments specializing in leadership development, capacity building, volunteerism, entrepreneurship, research and development, and creative content creation, the Ministry's very structure has been developed according to the needs of its community. Since its formation, it has supported the development of upward of 250 youth initiatives in the fields of science, education, art, health, leisure, and business. It has also partnered with key stakeholders in the public, private, and civil sectors on a number of youth-driven capacity-building projects. It has also worked with the country's top universities on educational programs and campaigns to address a number of societal issues affecting both the youth community and the country at large.</p><h4>Kuwait has a population of nearly 4 million, of which over 70-80% are expatriates. Of Kuwaitis, more than half of citizens are under the age of 25. In this demographic context, what key role do you see the Kuwaiti youth playing in Kuwait's economic future?</h4><p>I see the Kuwaiti youth playing a significant role in Kuwait's economic future. In fact, I will go so far as to say that, given the sharp decline of oil prices worldwide, without the youth, there is no long-term sustainable economic future for Kuwait. You see, Kuwait's economic future depends heavily on the creation of new industries. And no one is better positioned to do more with less and to take that risk than the youth themselves. In fact, one of the key roles that I see the Kuwaiti youth playing is that of problem-solvers. Young entrepreneurs have the imagination and necessary innovative skills to solve many of the socio-economic and infrastructural issues we face today.</p><h4>What are the main issues concerning youth in Kuwait? What hurdles do you see impeding their development and full potential?</h4><p>A crippled educational system, labor market restrictions, business regulation controls, poor administrative infrastructures, and the lack of viable incubators and venture capital injection are the major issues that stand in the way of youth development today. In addition, Kuwait has a low level of new industry creation due to the lack of a proper ecosystem that would in turn be able to manage and interweave all entrepreneurial aspirations. In order to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit in Kuwait, the Ministry continues to support and deliver a multitude of enabling projects in the SME creation and incubation fields.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the Ministry of Youth, and the Kuwaiti economy, in 2016?</h4><p>I have many expectations for 2016 and beyond. The Kuwait Development Plan for 2035 aims at transforming Kuwait into a financial and international hub. But in order to do so, we must first fix the nation's existing educational system and overall human development plan. With today's dynamic global economy centered on the development and exchange of knowledge and information, the state must invest in capacity building and knowledge transference. Individuals and human capital need to develop multifaceted expertise. Skills must be fostered and nurtured to meet both the demanding needs of modern-day life as well as the innovation-driven global arena. We must recognize the importance of knowledge in value creation, enable a society of life-long learners, and encourage out-of-the-box thinkers and innovators to hold key decision-making positions in government. We must also invest in R&amp;D across all sectors and highlight the importance of a comprehensive educational backbone when re-structuring our much-neglected and dated public educational system. In addition, we must build platforms for creativity and expression; areas where new ideas and possibilities may be freely challenged and explored. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Education Consortium is an award-winning non-profit based in Kuwait, but with a reach across the GCC. What are your main aims in developing the education sector?</h4><p>We market ourselves as an education management consultancy that provides advice on best practices in Kuwait and throughout the GCC. There is an inherent prescriptive nature in what people want here, but true education is about recognizing individual potential. However, the prescriptive system of education here is what caps that potential, and an individual can rarely grow in that environment. We aim to break the mold by providing individualized education platforms that will bring the state of play of education up to speed. </p><h4>What are some of your local activities in Kuwait?</h4><p>We regularly consult to companies all over the world that wish to establish themselves in the region. Furthermore, we have recently built and launched our very own Royal Britannia Kindergarten (RBK) along with Royal Britannia Academy (RBA), and are preparing to launch the Royal Britannia School (RBS) in Kuwait through our ties with British curriculum. In Kuwait, basic vocational skills, i.e. the “learning by doing“ method is not incorporated into standard curriculum. We continuously work to flip the learning model. Although we have obvious and assessable pedagogical imperatives, our students lead the teaching and learning. </p><h4>Is most effective method to advance your educational philosophy through the private sector or influencing national public policy? </h4><p>It is impressive that the public sector has everything available to them; i.e. the resources, funds, and an unfortunate stranglehold on accessible space available for development. Kuwait has everything at its behest, but the prevailing issue is that with public sector education policy, the teachers rule. With the help of the National Center for Educational Development (NCED), we try to implement change at the policy level, but if the teachers do not want it, it just does not move forward. This is where we work hard to continue to flip the model leading the way in the private sector and influencing policy at the county level where students lead the learning journey. </p><h4>What is the investment environment like in Kuwait's education sector?</h4><p>In the private education sector, there are a handful of players, and it is an extremely tight-knit community. Businesses are being sold from one owner to another, and it depends solely on who has the biggest piece of the pie. This is both a fortunate and unfortunate event, because the culture dictates the level of influence we have. Education can sometimes become a transactional business here. The education sector is 90% government-owned, however they closely follow the 10% of the private sector players hoping to influence that 90%, because they want the results that we are getting in the private sector to flow into the public sector. Although investment in education makes sense, it is often viewed as a long-term strategy that does not yield a healthy profit quickly enough, therefore making it unattractive to most investors who commonly have short-term outlooks in this region.</p><h4>What do you hope to see in terms of Education Consortium's future impact on the education sector?</h4><p>No two educational institutions will be the same. There will be a shifting focus on creativity, innovation, technology, the arts and sports, and we will continue to challenge and change the pedagogies, epistemology, and paradigms that exist here. It is crucial we break the mold. The level of conformity is high, and we are seriously missing the respect for individualization. Young people have these incredible aspirations of doing things that do not exist in Kuwait and we are teaching these children skills for jobs that do not yet exist. We have to break the conformance cycle and begin to inculcate new attitudes into our culture through embodiment, engagement, and empowerment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What synergies exist between your roles at the Supreme Council and the Education Consortium?</h4><p>The Education Consortium (EC) works closely with the Ministry of Education (MoE), the SEC, and NCED. We at EC, being a private non-profit organization, are in a unique position as we are usually invited to consult with the Kuwait government on a broad range of educational imperatives. This relationship was established with the previous Minister of Education and Higher Education in 2012, because the MoE wanted to develop new strategies in developing national standards thereby creating synergies by integrating roles thus receiving the same benefits as the private schools and universities as is the norm around the world. The MoE nominated private sector leaders from different industries, and, as a result, I was hand picked to consult on educational issues that would impact the future impetus of Kuwait.</p><h4>What are the challenges facing private-sector education in Kuwait?</h4><p>One issue the private sector is facing is a small smattering of unfounded doctrines that are enforced on the education system by the various Ministries. One example is the capping of school fees. This is the only revenue that schools in the private sector can depend on. When a stakeholder such as the MoE determines the fees, it puts unjustified pressure on the private sector. Fees should be meritocratic and based on quality. Schools that aim to provide the best quality hit a wall because they cannot legally command fees over the capped limit. The private sector has been given the freedom to bring in quality teachers depending on the taught curriculum. Owners should be in charge of managing their own respective businesses thereby fuelling Kuwait's economy creating wonderful new opportunities. Another restraint on the private education system comes from the limit of certain nationalities of quality accredited staff we can bring in. For example, private-sector schools from the UK, the US, or Europe do not have an issue recruiting teachers to run their own curriculum, however other Asian-centric schools occasionally have issues recruiting as politics and discrimination mix with the delivery of quality education clouding objectivity and clear rational judgments.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Currently, the committee is set on finishing its five-year plan. One issue all industries are facing is what transpires when a Minister leaves their position. We obtain the required signatures when a Minister approves a plan, but if the Minster gets removed, however, we have to go back and start from the very beginning. The idea is for plans to stay in place, with or without a Minister. It is our hope that Kuwait will be in a fantastic position to move forward from 2015 to 2035 with a new educational constitution that has solid development in curriculum, teachers, students' welfare, and moving our current highly traditional mode of teaching into the 21st century with the introduction of smart schools and playgrounds across Kuwait. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main focus areas of the KLSC investment strategy?</h4><p>KLSC was started back in 2010 as the Life Sciences Operational arm of the National Technology Enterprises Company (NTEC), which was formed in 2002 and is fully owned by the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA). With NTEC's capital of roughly $350 million, it created three operational companies, each with $50 million in capital and each catered toward a specific sector of technology. KLSC is focused on the life sciences sector, which includes healthcare as well as pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. As a company owned by the government, it is important for us to be a catalyst for the life sciences industry not only for Kuwait but for also the region. Our strategy is based on a combination of understanding the local context and bringing in international best practices. Therefore, we like to partner with the private sector when we can and help private-sector companies grow. Healthcare and the life sciences industry is a large part of the economy worldwide. It is important for us to decide where within the sector we would like to invest. We developed a strategy back in 2010 to focus on five key areas. First is knowledge transfer. Second is improving clinical research. Third is developing intellectual property here in the region. Fourth is supplying the pharmaceutical industry. And fifth is bringing in new medical technologies. In each of these five strategic clusters, we have developed platforms, whether by investing in companies or by building a company from scratch.</p><h4>How do the KLSC's investments support knowledge transfer and development of the local and regional healthcare sector?</h4><p>We started by establishing and investing in NewBridge Pharmaceuticals, which deals with intellectual property and distribution in the pharmaceutical space and is currently based in Dubai. NewBridge licenses international pharmaceutical companies and then helps them distribute their products in the region. The second company we have invested in since 2011 is Clinart MENA, which is a clinical research organization (CRO) that provides a one-stop shop service for running clinical trials for governments and pharmaceutical companies in the region. There is a global trend whereby multinationals pharmaceutical companies are developing targeted therapies on regional genomes, for example for the Middle East, and to achieve this level of specificity, these companies need to do trials on people from this region. Innomedics is the third company we have incubated and is focused on bringing in the latest medical technology, and has differentiated itself in the market also by importing and distributing products in consumer health, i.e. products that actually impact the consumer directly.<br>We have also incubated a fourth company called the Life Sciences Academy (LSA), the first training academy in the entire Middle East focused on the life sciences industry. Our fifth platform investment is a company called Ecore, which commercializes the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that go into the drug manufacturing process. Our vision for Ecore is to expand its services to be a combiner and manufacturer of APIs.</p><h4>What role can the private sector play in ensuring the sustainable development of Kuwait's healthcare sector?</h4><p>At KLSC we are always looking for ways in which to stimulate the private sector to invest and co-invest in the healthcare industry, particularly in niche healthcare plays and platforms. I encourage private-sector investors in healthcare to invest earlier within the healthcare industry life cycle and to also maintain a broader and longer investment horizon to support increased innovation and improved quality in the healthcare sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kind of activity have you seen in the Kuwaiti healthcare system in terms of construction of new hospitals and the expansion of existing ones?</h4><p>Three years ago, the Kuwaiti government realized the need for new hospitals and new facilities, as the last hospital built in Kuwait was about 40 years ago. Lately, demand has also risen. The bed capacity in the hospitals under the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Kuwait is around 7,000, but considering the demographic trends in citizens and expats, the government saw an urgent need to double that number. Out of eight tenders awarded so far, we have been able to form partnerships with a significant number of awardees. In September 2015, the MOH inaugurated a hospital expansion project of 240 beds in the shape of Al Razi Hospital. Al Razi Hospital has a physiotherapy and rehabilitation center, dealing mainly with orthopedic surgery. The majority of the rooms are private and semi-private, meaning there are one or two beds in each room and no wardrooms with four or more beds, providing privacy to patients. The hospital also has rooms specially designed for obese patients. The hospital has infrastructure designed to carry it well into the future, to where it could even become a paperless hospital.</p><h4>What are you seeing on the cutting-edge of medical technology?</h4><p>Integration is rapidly evolving. People are looking for paper-free hospitals and automation, whether in the lab, radiology, or elsewhere, so that they can get their results as quickly and as efficiently as possible, ensuring faster and more reliable transfer of data between the various departments of the hospital or even amongst various clinics and hospitals in the country. This is possible through innovation and technology, and is how you can achieve total integration at healthcare facilities around the country. To be able to provide this integration, you must have a diverse portfolio and expertise within your own organization in order to be able to implement this properly and fully, and that's what puts us a step ahead of the competition. We partner with all the big names in both the public and private healthcare industry, and we do not only act as a distributor, but as a partner. We have long-term relationships both with our customers and with the international suppliers we represent.</p><h4>What is your outlook on healthcare expansion in Kuwait and what are your expectations for future demand?</h4><p>Adding new facilities and expanding or renovating existing facilities has gone a long way to helping meet current demands in Kuwait's healthcare system. Many of the shortcomings in the healthcare facilities of the country are taken care of by the new facilities. The government's new facilities, the doubling of bed capacity, the introduction of new technologies, the sourcing of experts from abroad, continuous government-run education programs, affiliations with international bodies, and the exchange of data all help to take care of future demands as they are forecast to arise. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Peru is ranked among the top three fishing industries in the world. How would you assess the latest trends characterizing the fishing industry in the country?</h4><p>Peru's fishing industry is successful because of our geography. We benefit from both El Niño and the Humboldt Current, which provide the environment required to grow a wide variety of species. Our most important species is the anchovy—Peru has an abundance of anchovies that contributes to the country's status as a leading exporter of fish protein. Our other main commodities are giant squid, mahi-mahi, and scallops.</p><h4>How have you taken advantage of the growth in fish exports experienced since 2014?</h4><p>The fishmeal sector exports around $2 billion per year, and the frozen market exports around $1.3 billion. The sector is relatively young in terms of the private investment because, as in most Latin American countries, industry has historically been owned by the public sector. Privatization began in 1991, and we were the first company that invested after investment laws changed in favor of the private sector. When Peru became more open, credible, and reliable, markets opened for all companies operating in the sector and most investments came in during 2000. Most of the companies that came in were Norwegian, Chinese, and Brazilian.</p><h4>How do you maintain your leading status in a sector characterized by increasing competition?</h4><p>Our company adapts to the opportunities available. In 2007, we opened up to private equity investment, and after that we launched an IPO on the international capital markets. In 2013 we offered bonds and made syndicates around the world with international banks. We met with capital markets and financial markets in Peru. Financial structure is crucial in this sector. During El Niño, production ceases and it is only possible to survive as a healthy company with a strong financial structure. When El Niño passes we recover quickly.</p><h4>How did the company perform in 2015?</h4><p>It was a very slow year. El Niño is our strength but is also a weakness. When El Niño is hotter—as it was in 2015—the biomass of anchovy does not disappear or migrate, it just disperses or moves deeper, and it is therefore very difficult to catch the fish. El Niño does not kill the fish. The biomass is comprised of non-migrating fish; it is a stationary form along our coast that survives a certain temperature. When El Niño brings hot water, the fish go deeper looking for colder water. The current only comes in specific areas of the sea, which is why the fish disperse and are very hard to catch, although they do not disappear.</p><h4>How much are you investing in your processing facility to add value and quality to your products?</h4><p>We have the wild catch species that provides a great opportunity to add value. Most companies in Peru began with frozen young squid, but we are currently introducing higher value products like seafood mix that we export to Italy, the US, and Spain. We are currently developing hamburgers from young squid to sell in Peru. We promote health and good protein in many of our products. We have invested $50 million in frozen processing plants. We have six plants for fishmeal, two frozen plants, and 22 vessels in operation. We are the third-biggest producer and exporter of fishmeal and fish oil with a 13% share in the market.</p><h4>You have recently launched the brand Captain of the Seas. What are your expectations and what markets are you targeting?</h4><p>We have been present in the fishmeal and fish oil sector for many years, which is why all of our efforts are currently in the frozen sector. We export the raw material to China, but needed to improve our products to export to the US. We are making all possible efforts to increase our participation in US export market, which is why we are promoting this new brand. The US and Europe are our targets. Last year, 65% of our exports went to China and now we want to diversify. We made our incursion in the US market in Boston, and in Europe it is France, Spain, and Italy. We are trying to go to Dubai by sending samples of our products, and we want to sell directly to the markets there.</p><h4>What is the potential introduced by the recently signed FTAs to expand into new markets?</h4><p>These agreements facilitate our business in Asia—Vietnam and Thailand are our natural clients and right now we are doing business with Thailand through Tesco. In Japan we are opening markets for frozen, and we are already open in fishmeal.</p><h4>What are your main targets, goals, and ambitions for 2016?</h4><p>The main goal is to recover our level of production in fishmeal and fish oil. Last season was a very good season and makes 2016 look promising. We recovered our level of production and we increased our exports of frozen fish internationally and locally. To add value is also our constant target.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	How do you view YIACO's contribution to the healthcare industry in Kuwait and the region today?
</h4><p>
	Since beginning operations in the 1950s as one of the first pharmaceutical companies in the entire region, YIACO today has achieved a strong market share and product diversification that is vast compared to other companies in the sector. Our product portfolio covers a wide range of pharmaceutical brands and medical equipment with partners and principles such as Pfizer, Sanofi, AstraZeneca, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. We play a major role in Kuwait's healthcare sector by supplying both retail and wholesale distribution to the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Defense, and to the private sector as well. We have the knowledge and the infrastructure necessary to continue meeting international standards, often achieving an even higher level than those required through our quality assurance programs and by applying international best practices. We continuously hold seminars and educational gatherings between doctors and industry professionals to ensure international best practices. These programs are aligned with our international principles to follow suit in worldwide trends and healthcare improvements.</p><h4>What is YIACO's role in supporting large government projects and the national needs of Kuwait's healthcare sector?</h4><p>
	YIACO has continuously supported the government in its projects from the very beginning, since Kuwait's healthcare sector is reliant on public health. We offer pharmaceuticals through our wholesale division by providing a full range of medication along with medical equipment for the government's needs. We also were part of the first governmental BOT project to build and operate Adan hospital's radiology, nuclear medicine, and laboratory as a fully operational medical center. We have managed this governmental project for the past 10 years offering medical services to patients who reside in that area of Kuwait. We are also part of governmental initiatives to introduce medication and services to those suffering from diseases such as diabetes. We also liaise between ministry officials and our partners and principles to streamline and align both parties for the benefit of better services and products in the healthcare sector. These initiatives with the government are all aligned with the compliance and quality standards and solidify YIACO as a leading influencer in the industry.</p><h4>What trends are you seeing in Kuwait in terms of healthcare sector demand today and moving forward?</h4><p>
	We are unfortunately seeing a lot of demand in the blood pressure, cardiac, and diabetic segments. These are currently the segments with the most focus and urgency in Kuwait. We rely on our principals to ensure that we have everything necessary to meet these needs. Looking to the future, we make sure that we are communicating further market needs to our principals when it comes to medical R&amp;D and innovation; we work alongside our principles to pursue products and services worldwide rather than just in Kuwait, which allows us to look beyond what is only available here. What we are seeing is that as the population continues to grow, the focus in the healthcare field will increasingly shift toward the elderly. YIACO is aware of this shift in the healthcare sector needs and along with our partners and the MOH we will be focusing on these needs. As part of this initiative we are looking into homecare and nursing care to expand in Kuwait. The Ministry is looking to put together health insurance for the elderly and we are working with it to ensure that we comply with that when the time comes.</p><h4>What areas would you highlight as opportunities for further investment in Kuwait's healthcare sector?</h4><p>
	There is a crucial need for building and expanding hospitals in Kuwait. With government support, investors can do a lot to close the capacity gaps remaining in our healthcare facility infrastructure. Notably, the Jaber Al Ahmad Al Jaber Al Sabah Hospital, the largest in Kuwait, is going to be delivered in 2016. With this new project serving the population, the healthcare companies will be able to participate and get more involved in investing toward Kuwait's healthcare sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has characterized Latco's developments since its inception in 1998?</h4><p>Latco is a family-owned business that builds in a variety of sectors including universities, schools, hospitals, and commercial centers. We have done a lot of work in hospitals and social housing; however, our main projects have been in the industrial area. In early 2015, we were awarded the bid for construction of the international terminal for the airport in Cali, and we started construction in July. Our goal is to complete the project in October 2016. The project has an investment of COP104 billion. We are leading in a consortium with 70% of the participation, along with a Portuguese firm.</p><h4>How important is this new terminal for the development of Cali and the economy?</h4><p>Since the current airport infrastructure was built in 1971, the only renovations made were structural reinforcements, because the terminal is in a zone with strong seismic activity. There have been electrical improvements, but in general little infrastructural work has been done. They have been working on the international terminal for about 10 years, mainly because the airport is operating through a concession. This new terminal will also be instrumental in attracting investment for the city. Generally speaking, Cali has an enormous need to improve its infrastructure to solve the circulation and mobility issues.</p><h4>Latco's vision is to strengthen the footprint of the company in the national market by 2016. Do you think you will be able to achieve this?</h4><p>We are in the process. For example, we have undertaken many projects in areas near to Cali. We currently have a construction project in Buenaventura, which is a port on the Pacific. We also have another job in Bucaramanga, which is in the north east of Colombia.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the economy of Cali?</h4><p>The connection with Buenaventura is important for Cali. Many businesses are established in Cali, because of the import and export that goes through Buentaventura. My expectations for Cali are very high. Cali and its surroundings have been able to attract investment; for example, the Marriott was built in Cali, which we built. Unilever started operating a new plant close to Cali, which we also built. The pharmaceutical business is growing especially through Tecnoquimicas, and we are involved in building its plants and offices. Not only is Tecnoquimicas a local firm, it is also exporting to different countries. There is a lot to be done in Cali but the economy is in a good position to accomplish it.</p><h4>Are you planning on expanding to other markets outside of Colombia?</h4><p>We are excited about expanding into international operations. For example, last year we were invited to bid on a cement plant in Peru. We are also considering partnerships with different firms. The correct thing to do is first consolidate our work here in Colombia, and then we will start thinking about going abroad.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Latco in the year ahead?</h4><p>The airport is a challenging job for us, and we have to finish in it October 2016. Latco is investing a lot of its resources to make that happen. We are also considering undertaking our own projects in the commercial and social housing segments, and housing in general. We are positive about 2016, because we anticipate that the city is going to be building more infrastructure. Overall, the economy is doing well in Cali and the construction sector is going to do well, too.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies have you set for INATUR for the next two to three years to promote tourism in Mozambique?</h4><p>Mozambique has huge potential in the tourism industry. We have about 2,700km of coastline with all kinds of beaches, marine life, and wildlife. It is up to us to develop and realize this potential to generate employment and revenue. The National Tourism Authority has defined certain key strategies to develop tourism in Mozambique, so we want to target the major source markets such as the UK, Germany, Portugal, and South Africa, and we also want to focus more on Asia. We can do more in the Asian market, and see huge potential there going forward. We understand that our tourism services are facing a challenge at present, and that we need to reach high standards of service to meet the expectations of visitors and tourists coming to the country. The government has set training in hospitality and tourism as a priority, and we have initiated a number of training programs in line with the tourism strategy. We are looking for a partnership to develop a vocational tourism training center for hospitality and tourism, having in mind that we need excellence in training if we are to attain overall excellence in the tourism industry. The training center will have to go a long way to achieving that and consolidating what we have done so far before moving forward. We are now in the process of training the instructors. Our hotels have classifications and standards that are out of date. We need to bring them up-to-date and make sure that all of the services meet expectations. If you are staying in a three- or four-star hotel, you should experience the respective service quality. We are training experts who will do that grading. The third area on which we are focusing is promoting investment. We want to attract international hotel chains. The government has selected certain areas where we will develop integrated tourism projects, like Crusse and Jamali in Nacala, Metangula in Niassa, Quirimbas in Cabo Delgado, and Inhassoro in Inhambane. We want to take advantage of the new international airport in Nacala, linking with the Ilha de Mozambique, which is a recognized UNESCO World Heritage site, to develop a cultural tourism destination. In addition, Vilankulo is also an area where we would like to develop further. Here, we are looking for a partner that we will together develop the site with along the marginal facing Bazaruto Archipelago, which belongs to IGEPE, the Management of State Holdings and INATUR. In Vilankulo, the idea is to develop the waterfront and link it with the Bazaruto Archipelago. In Inhassoro, just north of Vilankulo, there is another zone that was reserved as a special tourism area. We designed a conceptual project for that area as well. Those are the key activities that we have selected.</p><h4>What areas have the most potential for luxury tourism in Mozambique, and which projects will be coming online soon?</h4><p>Starting from the south, Milibangalala is a concession that was given to one of our companies, Mozaico do Ündico, which then entered into a partnership with the private sector to develop a luxury lodge in a conservation area. It would be a top service lodge for high-spending customers, and for that project work is due to begin soon. The project is expected to be complete by the end of 2016 or beginning of 2017. In 2017 we expect to see the first guests. In the north we have similar luxury lodges in Quirimbas already opened. And the Bazaruto Archipelago is also a destination where you can find luxury lodges and is known as a honeymoon destination. Specifically for Crusse and Jamali, since this is within the special economic zone, we are now working with Mozambique's Office for Economic Areas with Accelerated Development (Gazeda) to attract investors to develop integrated coastal tourism villages across 1,750 hectares  with hotel, retail, commercial, housing, recreational amenities, and land subdivision.</p><h4>In 2014, most billionaires visiting Africa went to Mozambique's neighbor South Africa. How are you working to develop the luxury tourism market here?</h4><p>The main challenge now is how to attract tourists and visitors to Mozambique, especially for the luxury and high-end segment. The issue of visas is under consideration by the government and in due course this will be addressed appropriately. There is feeling that trying to make it less expensive to get a visa, and also easing visa policies, will attract more visitors, which means more business. That was the feeling we got in a quick survey with the business operators in the industry. Tour operators have expressed concerns about bureaucratic obstacles such as obtaining visas because, according to them, this is hindering development. Another recurring issue is transportation. The airports at Vilankulo and Nacala make connectivity to the various destinations in the country easier, while the new international airport in Nacala will reduce flight time to Europe by two hours. Working from Nacala, it would be easy to get to Vamizi and to other 32 islands at Quirimbas. We are also working on marketing and promotion, especially for luxury resorts, and we are collaborating with travel agencies by developing brochures and related materials.</p><h4>What is the tourism sector's total contribution to GDP, and where would you like to see that in the future?</h4><p>Tourism contributes about 5-6% to GDP, but we believe we have the potential for that to reach 10%. Our aim is to realize the potential of the sector, and to bring this industry to the level it should be at in Mozambique.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>I have high expectations for the year, and I believe we can make great gains compared to last year. We get about one million visitors to Mozambique annually, but in 2016 we want to increase that number to 1.5 million. We will continue growing, increasing revenues, and developing more projects, while increasing overall employment in the sector. From 2010-14, 20,000 new beds were added to the system. Occupancy is only high in Maputo, with the rest of the country still lagging behind. We want to increase the overall number of available beds and improve occupancy rates at the same time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your objectives to take Nestlé in Kuwait to the next level?</h4><p>Our global mission is to enhance quality of life with good food and beverages everywhere. In the Middle East, we strive to do that by offering an array of tasty and healthy products that meet local needs for quality, taste and pleasure—while addressing specific nutritional requirements to help achieve healthy and balanced diets across all life stages and at all times of the day. </p><h4>What trends do you identify in the Kuwaiti market?</h4><p>Kuwaiti consumers have been enjoying their Nestlé brands such as Nestlé NIDO, Nescafé Coffee, and confectionery brands since the 1950s. Sales of coffee products have been the main contributor to growth. The latest additions of the innovative Nescafé Arabiana, launched locally in 2014 and Nescafé Dolce Gusto, are also fast becoming local favorites. Nescafé Arabiana is the first instant soluble Arabic Coffee, which reduces the long process of preparing of the traditional Arabic Coffee to seconds, which is popular with GCC consumers. Another product is Nescafé Dolce Gusto, is a multi-beverage system, for a variety of coffees from cappuccinos to espressos to macchiato. When it comes to confectionery, we also introduced the Kit Kat Mini Moments.</p><h4>What is your understanding of the local taste profile in the Gulf, and how is Nestlé catering to that?</h4><p>Nestlé's heritage in the Middle East goes back over 80 years. We have our 60/40+ Program that constantly re-challenges our products to ensure they are preferred by at least 60% of local consumers of a large panel. We continuously renovate our product portfolio to meet the taste and pleasure needs of consumers, in addition to meeting the strict Nestlé Nutritional Foundation criteria. </p><h4>How is Nestlé promoting nutrition, health, and wellness in the Gulf?</h4><p>Nestlé understands the health challenges of the region and ensures our products cater to the latest nutrition recommendations for healthy living. In June this year, Nestlé was the first multinational company to publish forward-looking commitments to society in the Middle East, with the unveiling of the first regional “Nestlé in Society - Creating Shared Value“ (CSV) report. It also covers 20 commitments published with specific objectives, which Nestlé aims to fulfill by 2017 or earlier, in the areas of nutrition, responsible sourcing, water, environmental sustainability, people, and compliance. In the Middle East, where under-nutrition and obesity exist side by side, the regional report's commitments focus on leading the industry in nutrition and health research, and providing nutritionally sound products designed for children to nurture healthier generations. Out of the 20 commitments, 11 focus on nutrition. Specific commitments promote healthy diets and lifestyles, mainly through the Nestlé Healthy Kids Programme — Ajyal Salima, developed by the American University of Beirut and now in three countries in the region (UAE, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Jordan) where it has reached over 16,000 children to date, further provide nutritionally sound products designed for children, with three new products set to be launched by the end of 2015; help reduce the risk of under-nutrition through micronutrient fortification, by providing 8.6 billion fortified food servings in the Middle East by the end of 2015, compared to 8 billion in 2014; promote healthy hydration; and ensure responsible marketing communication to children. More recently, in October 2015, Nestlé Middle East, MBC Al Amal, and the Arabian Radio Network joined forces to launch United for Healthier Kids (U4HK), with an invitation to everyone to join the movement and contribute towards healthier children. U4HK aims to help parents establish healthier eating, drinking and lifestyle habits for children aged four to 12, and offers game-changing education and fun ideas to inspire action and influence behavior. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Bubiyan Fisheries Co. invested in the development of fish farming in Kuwait?</h4><p>Bubiyan Fisheries Co. started the first fish farm in Kuwait in 1985 as a joint venture with the government. We are still the only licensed fish farm in the country. Previously we only produced two types of local fish, bream and grouper. We brought in fish from Greece, Spain, and Bahrain, in particular sea bass, which does very well in Kuwait, as does the sea bream. We continued to grow and created a solid fish reserve for Kuwait, which is important for the country's food reserves and food security. Every day we take 3 to 5 tons of fish to the market. Fish prices here are actually quite cheap compared to the production costs, but this is balanced out by the government providing the land and paying for the fish feed. In return, our job is to support the people by providing a fixed price, and low cost fish supply.</p><h4>What challenges have you seen in the farming of fish in Kuwait over the years?</h4><p>In 1997 and 2001 there was a marine crisis in Kuwait with the red spot disease, which destroyed our reserves. We sought help from Kuwait University, the Ministry of Health, and other Kuwaiti ministries. They also brought experts in from overseas to determine the origin of the disease because this was the first time it had hit Kuwait. We brought in fresh supplies of grouper and local sea bream from Bahrain and began re-growing the operation. The government is not protecting our waters from pollution caused by domestic and industrial waste, which goes straight into the sea. Another critical factor is that two power stations have been built in Kuwait Bay and these are damaging the marine environment. Kuwait Bay is the second largest hatchery in the world after the Gulf of Mexico. There should not be any power plants on Kuwait Bay because they use the seawater for cooling and then discharge warm water back into the sea, disrupting the ecological balance. It is still very important that the two electric power stations on Kuwait Bay are decommissioned and that the sewerage and other untreated waste water that is currently being discharged into the sea here is stopped. One positive change in the industry is the new law that has been put in place prohibiting fishing across the bay. This applies to both fishing from the shore and from boats. Unfortunately it is too late, although this has helped with overfishing.</p><h4>Around 80% of fish in Kuwait are imported from Bahrain, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey. Do you have plans to increase local production of fish in Kuwait?</h4><p>The country as a whole needs to increase the number of companies in the fish farming industry. We are happy to provide our expertise to grow local production. </p><h4>How important is fish farming to Kuwait? Do you think there is room for more investment and growth in the industry?</h4><p>It is very important. Fish farming should be the future, not just for Kuwait but worldwide. For example, fish farming has been significant for the economies of the Philippines, Thailand, Greece, and Turkey. The demand for fish is high with growing populations, but the marine stocks are not increasing. Globally, there are many people catching fish with no government controls. The future should be farming in order to protect our important fish reserves. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kind of growth have you seen in your production over the past few years?</h4><p>Growth in the food sector is dependent on population growth, public attitudes, and trends. For instance, there was a growing trend for the more wholesome bran bread, therefore we decreased production in white bread. Our growth is at 4%, and this figure is the ballpark for the bread industry globally. The market for fast food buns is a key factor in our profit sustenance. We have been exporting our produce for more than 25 years. We mainly focus on the GCC, but we also export to Jordan, Egypt, and Iraq. Exports have been growing fast, and our key exports are flour, pasta, and biscuits. Demand for our high-quality products is growing both internationally and domestically. However, diets differentiate according to locality. Food culture is varied across the Middle East, some populations consume more rice, others more bread.</p><h4>How would you describe your role in securing a stable supply of food to the people of Kuwait?</h4><p>Kuwait is not an agricultural country. We cannot produce our own food, so it is very important to concentrate on food security, mainly in regards to storage. Food security in our part of the world is an important issue and we take the matter seriously. We store our products  in silos which are close to the sea maneuver. When ships dock, we are responsible for loading and unloading. We do this through in taking from the ship to the silo, then to the packing area and finally onto further transportation by road or air. This procedure ensures minimal human contact, and enables strict control of bacteria and pesticides.</p><h4>What are your plans to meet the rising food demands of Kuwait's growing population?</h4><p>Kuwait's population is rising rapidly; the population is currently at about 3.2 million and 1.3 million are Kuwaiti, the rest are expatriates. In cooperation with the government, we have been acquiring more land to increase our storage space. The key pillars of food security are ease of access (affordability and reachability) and quality. In the past, there has been a number of destabilizing crises in Kuwait, where the operations of Kuwait Flour Mills and Bakeries Co. have aided in crisis management.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for investors to inject innovation and product development in the Kuwaiti food sector?</h4><p>There is a wealth of opportunities in the Kuwaiti food sector for investors—95% of food in Kuwait is imported from abroad. However, Kuwaiti SMEs are thirsty for capital injection. In particular, the dairy industry is fertile ground for expansion.</p><h4>What do you predict will be the major trends and primary revenue drivers for KFMB in the next five years?</h4><p>Global trends are moving towards gluten-free products for celiacs and those with sensitivity to flour. We will be setting up our first gluten-free bakery after Ramadan 2015. We have been working on this project for more than four years and are MENA pioneers for gluten-free produce.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Internationally, the agricultural industry is doing well. We hope that there will not be any dramatic weather fluctuations that will impact the world agricultural market. Drought or heavy rains can impact on harvesting. However, our expectation is that the global wheat harvest will be stable. Kuwait is not as pliable to food prices as developing countries, thanks to our high average income. In 2016, we plan to invest in healthier products, centered on our gluten-free bakery concept. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[well-take-it-from-here]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us how ADS has developed since it was founded?</h4><p>We built our company from scratch, and we grew parallel to Abu Dhabi. In fact, Abu Dhabi was one of the reasons for our growth, enabling us to build a financial institution upon the solid foundations that Abu Dhabi provides. The political stability, infrastructure, financial credibility, and informed laws and regulations allow a company like ADS to thrive. Abu Dhabi has created a fertile environment from which ADS Securities was able to develop one of the world's largest independent brokerages and then expand our services into capital markets, wealth management, asset management, and investment banking. In a short time we have created fully fledged financial services institution, but we have always been selective about who we work with. It is not about how many people we work with; it is about who we work with and how we can deliver to them.</p><h4>You now offer a wide range of financial services. What was your growth and diversification strategy away from forex brokerage?</h4><p>The backbone of ADS Securities is our trading ability; our knowledge of the business flows across markets. We had always planned to build the brokerage side of our work, which gives us the insight and feel for trading. This has flourished both internationally and locally. Last year was a very good year for us. We survived a strong move on the Swiss National Bank (SNB), we quadrupled our client base to reach the tens of thousands, starting from zero clients, all organically grown; we opened up in Asia working with many sophisticated and professional clients and we have increased our product offerings. As we developed this area of work, we were also putting together the right people and products to provide a range of very high-quality financial services products. Our growth is linked to Abu Dhabi's growth and we are integrated fully into the country's potential and prospects. As the number of major international firms, banks, and people coming to Abu Dhabi increases, so does our business.</p><h4>To what extent is your organic growth due to the effort and finances you've put into your own technology?</h4><p>In 2014 we launched the first multi-asset trading platform designed and built in this region. This now trades billions of dollars daily. In 2015 we launched a mobile trading app that is creating fantastic reviews—so yes, technology will always be a driver for growth. But as an institution, ADS is not just about making money. It is about achieving something that was never possible before. Abu Dhabi was always focused on the buying side, now we are on the selling of business. People used to come and land in Abu Dhabi with a briefcase and take money away. However, now people come here to give us money for us to manage for them. To make this work you have to have people with a high level of motivation. The brand of the country is high, and the Abu Dhabi name is strong and it is a proven financial platform. Hence, the overall organic growth comes from technology, the people, and the regulations. Keep in mind that we rose and succeeded during a period of economic crisis where we saw currency wars, central banks still in the middle of their QE, not to mention all the political turmoil that's been going on, and is still going on.</p><h4>Can you describe the success of the $700 million debut bond for Etihad Airways?</h4><p>Etihad has a very successful business model, but the airline business is a tough environment. The Etihad management has acted quickly and wisely to raise additional funds so that they can invest money in areas that will make more and more sense in the coming years. It has a long-term strategy, and it acted decisively and aggressively to set it in motion. The success of the bond in raising the money validates the Etihad strategy and approach. It was a clever move. We should also consider that the bond was raised in under 10 hours, and was extended to raise an additional $200 million, taking the full amount to $700 million.</p><h4>How will that Etihad project affect other future projects with state-owned companies and other large internationals?</h4><p>That project definitely tells people we are in the market. We have been slowly building contacts and an understanding of our approach, and a deal like this means that we now have clients coming to knock at our door. We also understand the needs and priorities of the country. Clients want to talk to us because we are a local institution with the knowledge insight and intuition they need. They know they can save money by working with us rather than investing in terms of economists and financial advisers to study and try to understand what we deal with on a daily basis. We have 39 different nationalities represented on our staff, which shows the international extent and connectivity of our operation.</p><h4>What are your expectations and objectives for 2016?</h4><p>Every year is a consolidation of the previous years. For 2016 we have put in place a strategy that is built on the knowledge of what clients need from us and how the markets have reacted, but is designed to anticipate the opportunities and challenges ahead of us. In financial services we are surrounded by risk, but still need to provide the best returns. To do this we focus on understanding and managing risk to maximize profits. The start of 2016 will be challenging but we will be looking for the markets to post better and better results leading to a very positive year end, which continues into 2017.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What benefits would Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) membership bring to the Thai economy and US firms operating here?</h4><p>The TPP is more than just a free trade agreement; it includes many important elements such as requirements over labor rights, human rights, the environment, and other social issues. Assuming the ratification process of the various countries sail through, Thailand stands to lose considerably by not signing up—a significant volume of Thailand's exports go to TPP-member countries. If Thailand were on the outside of such an agreement, it could put local manufacturers and Thai companies at a potential disadvantage in trading compared to others in TPP member states. AMCHAM certainly believes that it would be beneficial for Thailand if it joined the TPP, and it would also be beneficial for US companies investing here. US businesses have invested significant amounts of money in Thailand—we estimate about $50 billion, creating approximately a quarter of a million jobs locally.</p><h4>How has AMCHAM helped facilitate American investment into Thailand?</h4><p>AMCHAM provides comprehensive advice and guidance to US businesses that express an interest in Thailand. We also provide connectivity between the Thai and US governments, as well as a network of established US businesses here. In 2015, AMCHAM held over 330 events for our members. Many of these events were organized by AMCHAM's over 25 Committees, which cover various business sectors such as auto, energy, healthcare, travel and tourism, food and agriculture, and ICT, as well as special interest areas ranging from legal to marketing and community engagement. Companies can sign up to learn more and use these events as a way to build their network, seek assistance, share opinions, and try to lobby the Thai or US governments for greater support. There are many issues that are common among all foreign investors in Thailand, and AMCHAM coordinates with the JFCCT and other Chambers on these issues, too. Examples of such issues on which we collaborate include things like intellectual property rights, customs, data privacy, and visas/work permits. AMCHAM is strongly supported by its over 800 member companies and is a well-funded chamber. It uses its resources to contribute to the local community and to try to find ways to improve the Thai economy, and in so doing the investment prospects for US businesses.</p><h4>How important is the corporate segment of Citibank's services in Thailand?</h4><p>Our business is pretty evenly split between our institutional and consumer businesses. In terms of our institutional business, we support government and quasi government entities, top-tier local corporates, and local multinationals. Citi's competitive advantage is the fact that we can support our clients directly across 160 countries around the world. We are physically present with on-shore banking resources in 101 countries, so we can connect our clients seamlessly on a global basis in a way other banks cannot, even those deemed to be “global." It would be impossible in today's regulatory environment to build the type of network that Citi has. Naturally, that leads us to the types of clients that will have operations in multiple countries. We are unlikely to be the best bank for you if you only operate in one country. For instance, we are the global cash management bank for Thai Airways; we support it across over 40 countries in which it has a presence. We support a number of top local Thai companies with their business around the world with advisory services, funding and liquidity, foreign exchange, hedging, and other services. We do the same for global multinationals that are based here in Thailand. But our institutional business has synergies with our consumer business, too. The key decision makers at our corporate clients also tend to be globally minded, high net-worth individuals who benefit from our wealth management and premium card services, as well as our ability to connect retail clients through our online and mobile technology to Citi accounts around the world. And if you're with one of our multinational clients moving to Thailand, we can set you up seamlessly with consumer banking services here and avoid the hassle of sorting out personal financial affairs when moving to a new country.</p><h4>What products and services will you be targeting with the launch of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2016?</h4><p>We have been operating in ASEAN since 1902. Globally, Citi has been around for 204 years and we are probably one of the most pan-ASEAN banks here. The AEC coming into effect will not change much for Citi because we are already well established here. Hopefully we will see more clients within ASEAN countries sign up to expand their business across borders, which Citi is naturally well suited to help them with. We have a small commercial banking business as well. We got into commercial banking because we wanted to support companies that are an important part of the supply chain for our big, corporate clients. We are also looking to support companies with potential to become the next global champions.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We are going to continue expanding. Citi's success is based on the success of our clients; the more success they enjoy, the more business they conduct through us. If they are manufacturing, selling, and exporting more, they generate more cash flow, trade volume, and FX and funding needs which is all incremental flow business for Citi. We also support clients strategically through our capital markets and M&amp;A activities. The consumer side is dependent on domestic consumption and investment sentiment. If markets perform well, clients will invest more through our investment products, so our wealth management business grows. With stronger consumer confidence, domestic consumption will drive growth in credit card spending and consumer loans. The Thai economy is facing some challenges, both internally and externally. The agricultural sector is being affected by drought conditions and lower commodity prices. Also, overall Thai exports have dropped year on year, partly related to the slowdown in China. But on the flip side, the tourism sector has been performing well, and growth to 32 million visitors in 2016 is presently projected. Could Thailand itself do more? On some fronts, you could argue that it has. The Bank of Thailand has done as much as it can, but fiscal policy actions have only recently been accelerated since the appointment of DPM Somkid and his team last September. The infrastructure project plans are great, but the pace at which contracts are processed, projects are started, and the investment flows could be quicker. Thankfully, they are well-thought-out infrastructure plans and if they can get built and successfully run, that would be very positive. Some of the programs that are being put in on a local basis will also help drive growth and put money back into the local economy. All of these things are designed by the current economics team of the government to put more stimulus into the economy. GDP growth is forecast at about 2.5% to 2.7% in 2015. People say Thailand should grow at 5% a year but we are not there yet. We are being held back by household debt, consumer sentiment, and low private investment. Until these things improve, it is hard to see the Thai economy getting above 3%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has ALARGAN in Kuwait grown to its current position today?</h4><p>The company was established simply to serve the purpose of providing young Kuwaitis with suitable homes. We started out as a construction company with a small amount of capital; however, over a period of about three years, we were able to increase our capital and form new partnerships. Our first project began in 1996, providing 18 homes below $330,000. When we first started, the least expensive house in the private sector was about $826,000, which most people could not afford. We provided all the specifications and architecture of our homes to our buyers, as well as warranties; a service which had not been offered before. There was a high demand in the market for affordable homes and we allocated prices based on what the buyer could potentially afford after receiving subsidized government loans. We maintained this service up until 2003, when land prices skyrocketed, at which point ALARGAN looked into other markets. We established ourselves in Oman in 2003, ultimately transitioning from a family-owned company to a shareholder company, upon which we were able to increase our capital to KWD10 million. In 2005 we further increased it to KWD25 million and managed to expand into Bahrain in the following year, then lastly in Saudi Arabia in 2007. We keep our capital small, although our assets are incessantly growing.</p><h4>What are the fundamentals of the mid-market segment that make it a good investment?</h4><p>We invest in secure properties that generate consistent revenues. The mid-market has been underserved for a long time, and it is the largest. After the crash, many companies realized the focus should not be solely on the high-end market. The Middle East has the highest growth per capital in the world, so there will continue to be an influx of buyers. We have been focused on the mid-market segment for 20 years and know it quite well. Over this time ALARGAN has built up on experience, aligned itself with the right partners, and added value to markets in new territories. In every market we enter, we raise the bar in terms of service, and we lower prices. We are in an advantageous position and claim to be the leader in a niche market. </p><h4>What qualities do you look for in choosing local partners?</h4><p>We unlock land value through strategic partnerships. Local partners are a must to have, because we cannot assume we know everything when we enter a market. They not only show us a map and explain the way locals are thinking, but help us logistically with the government sector. We look for partners that share our mentality i.e. they must be straightforward and interested in serving the community before making a profit. Our partners should not be developers or contractors, or competitors in the same field; they should be in banking or other industries of interest. We should add a new dimension, so that we add value to their portfolio rather than matching it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What differentiates Posta Plus from its competitors?</h4><p>Posta Plus is not just a traditional logistics firm; we are different. Our approach is selling ideas that make an impact on the customer experience. Today, we provide customized services that complement a company's quality and consumer targets. We help our customers with exactly what they need. We are currently educating the market and creating a new demand for a project called Mailroom Management. The idea came about when we started this project KUFPEC during 2013 and it was a success. Eventually, we took over their facility for the purpose of full mailroom management, managing all external and even internal correspondences for the company. Another idea called domestic delivery operation was derived from a previous big project we had called EZ Post with Jebel Ali Authority, which involved handling all their mail for three years. Their response to the project was fantastic—they loved it. If one employee wants to get in contact with another, they can send a message that will go to a dispatcher in the mailroom. Then, the dispatcher can send out a messenger, making the process more efficient.</p><h4>What are some challenges that you encountered at Posta Plus as a relatively new logistics company? </h4><p>Having presence in several countries made us conclude that understanding a country's geography is quite essential. Around 80% of our resources are navigating forces on the ground, which reflects a high cause and effect relationship between delivery, customer experience, and operating costs. Secondly, human capital in our industry is quite essential. While hiring, it is crucial to bring on board qualified, dynamic, and compassionate people that have a relationship with the goods being delivered to the customers' doorstep. Being present in developing countries and one of the fastest moving and evolving industries, finding the right qualified people is challenging. Finally, industry and government regulations impose high operational risk on the logistics industry. Unless the company enjoys a strong financial position, it will suffer from barriers to entry that exist into the courier space.</p><h4>How does Posta Plus use technology as a competitive advantage when focusing on specific industries?</h4><p>We develop our software in-house and we have well dedicated team with the IT department for three elements: software, hardware, and developers. Our website, the coming mobile application, and all the operational and accounting systems were developed in-house and these have been a huge contribution to our success. These have given us a competitive advantage because we can customize solutions without third parties and depending solely on our internal resources. Posta Plus is focusing on the e-commerce industry. As a time-sensitive service, the main obstacle for these companies is logistics. We work to cut down the time. MarkaVIP is one of our biggest customers when it comes to e-commerce. We are serving them in Dubai, Kuwait, and soon in other countries. Also we have a company called “Student Center,“ which is completely owned by Posta Plus. It is a business concept similar to FedEx Kinkos. We are trying to have more efficient integration between the three. If a company can provide a one-stop shop, the customer will choose you. </p><h4>How has Kuwait's logistics infrastructure contributed to your success?</h4><p>The Public Authority for Civil Information (PACI) has invested great efforts in building a logistics infrastructure. All facilities have designated codes within Kuwait making the delivery value chain effective. We integrated our systems with PACI's systems and linked them to a GPD network that assists in speedy delivery and tracking shipments. We are able to plan appropriately. We understand the regulations of the GCC and the market demands in Kuwait. We have a clear vision and understanding of the customers' needs. We provide our customers with customized services, we understand the country's geography, and we know how to use our resources. We partnered with the right people at the right time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the key to taking NAS from one airline client in Kuwait to its current position in emerging markets across the MENA region?</h4><p>To build a company you have to focus on delivering value to your customer. We did that by providing a high quality of service and being disciplined in regards to our costs. We have been able to meet our clients' targets at reasonable prices. In 2003 we started business in Kuwait with one customer, KLM. We were focused initially on passenger services, and then expanded into route services with cargo, lounges, meet and assist, an aviation training center, aviation security, and finally, terminal management. Geographically, Kuwait was our base, and in 2008, we expanded to India with a ground handling company and eight airports. In 2009 we launched operations in Bombay, at one of the largest airports in Asia, in partnership with Celebi, a Turkish ground handling company. In 2009, we started in Kigali. In 2012, we added Sharm El Sheikh and expanded to Abu Dhabi, and in 2013 we started managing the Sheikh Saad terminal. In 2014 we won a tender in Afghanistan, and also opened a VIP terminal in Abu Dhabi. This year we are hoping to launch operations in Cí´te d'Ivoire. We have been aggressive in our approach to expansion to meet a fast-growing demand.</p><h4>What role does NAS play in facilitating business and economic development in emerging economies?</h4><p>Aviation plays a crucial role in the economy, and there are two sides to what we do; the passenger side and the cargo side. The passenger side is designed for airlines that need services based on safety, security, and cost effectiveness. Business travel supports local businesses expand and locate overseas customers or suppliers. The reverse is also true with international companies that want to do business in emerging markets. On the cargo side we are supporting emerging markets, farmers, and producers by providing efficient importing and exporting.</p><h4>NAS was named Best Ground Handler in emerging markets three times. How did you achieve this, and what is the significance of this recognition for the company?</h4><p>Quality is key. Airlines know NAS to be a reliable partner whom they can trust to provide the best quality of service in the country. The award has boosted morale in the company over the years because it recognizes the hard, and often repetitive work that people do within their defined, specific areas of expertise. It is rare that people appreciate the job that these people do, and our employees appreciate the positive reinforcement. </p><h4>What new heights are you aiming to reach in the future, and what are your targets for 2016 specifically?</h4><p>Our vision is to become the aviation service provider of choice in emerging markets. We will continue our aggressive growth primarily in Africa, and to a large extent in the Middle East and Central Asia as well. We aspire to have one to two big wins and three to four small wins every year. In 2016 we will continue our focus on quality, safety, and security. We will continue our investment growth and continue to hire qualified individuals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the rapid development of the aviation sector regionally impacted Kuwait Airways, as one of the first local airlines established in the Gulf?</h4><p>Kuwait Airways was established in 1956 as a private company, and has since become a fully government-owned company. The Iraqi invasion destroyed the airline's infrastructure, as the aircraft and hangars were all either abandoned or destroyed. We had to rebuild everything and start from scratch, and the airline's rebirth became a source of pride for Kuwait. Looking back at the history of the region, oil became the defining commodity in the GCC countries, and with the oil boom came a focus on new strategies by those GCC countries, very much around leisure and also aviation, which is a key platform in places like Qatar. This all happened at the expense of Kuwait Airways. However, Kuwait Airways has always remained the favored and preferred airline of the Kuwaiti people.</p><h4>What has been your strategy to bring Kuwait Airways back to the leading market position it once held in Kuwait?</h4><p>When I became chairperson and managing director, my first priority was to sign contracts for new aircraft with either Airbus or Boeing. In line with that strategy, we are in the process of receiving 25 new aircraft from Airbus, ten of them wide body and 15 of them narrow body, in addition to 12 leased aircraft. We also purchased 10 Boeing 777 aircraft. This was essential for us to be able to regain a share in what has become a competitive airline market in the GCC and beyond. The Kuwaiti people fly all over the world, and we wanted to reclaim our place as their airline of choice so that they would prefer us to the likes of Qatar Airways, Emirates, or Etihad. We introduced our new fleet far faster than most airlines could, ensuring that customer experience is consistently outstanding. Our other priority was to achieve a financial transformation of the company so that it could be self-sufficient. </p><h4>How were you able to streamline the workforce and ensure that your employees were also an efficient part of the company's transformation?</h4><p>According to the Kuwaiti privatization law, people can opt for either redundancy or early retirement. Some people were also transferred to government services. We ensured that the company was efficient from a company perspective, while at the same time recognizing the loyalty and service of people who had in many cases worked here for 15 years or longer. Nevertheless, we are still over-staffed, so the process of streamlining continues. One thing we take great pride in is that Kuwait Airways is truly a Kuwaiti company, in that it is run, managed, operated, maintained, and staffed by Kuwaitis, which distinguishes us significantly from other airlines in the region, including Qatar, Etihad, or Emirates. </p><h4>What do you expect will be the most important factor in making Kuwait Airways a top airline in the Gulf region?</h4><p>The airport is the most important factor. It does not matter how many aircraft you have if you do not have the facilities to operate them and cater to the increased flows. Kuwait has much more competition, partially due to the fact that people see Kuwait as being a more attractive market in itself. Qatar and Emirates are about providing connectivity, but it is a different situation in Kuwait. Carriers come to Kuwait to take the business of Kuwait.</p><h4>As the national flagship carrier of Kuwait, what vision you would like to see achieved at Kuwait Airways moving forward?</h4><p>The world first gets to know about your country through your airline, so it is an important part of any country's economy. We want to become a boutique airline that is growing healthily, serving Kuwaitis and those who live in Kuwait. We want to provide a service that gets them where they want to go at the frequencies and with the quality of service that they desire, and we want them to prefer us simply for the pleasure of flying Kuwait Airways. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the air transport industry developed in Kuwait over the past few years?</h4><p>The local air transport industry has grown significantly. Since we adopted an open skies policy at Kuwait International Airport, we have seen a great increase in the volume of passenger aircraft and cargo traffic. In 2014, around 10.3 million passengers used Kuwait International Airport, an increase of 10% from 2013. There are 85,000 aircraft using the airport, a 9% increase from 2013. Revenues of the Kuwaiti air transport market reached around $1.9 billion last year. Most of that revenue was from direct ticket sales through travel agencies or airline offices in Kuwait, not including tickets sold on the internet. We also saw a cargo increase of about 7% in 2014 compared to 2013, reaching 189 million kg of cargo. This has also brought challenges with it, because we now need to upgrade Kuwait International Airport so it can sustain these kinds of figures. Various expansion projects are underway for our airport facilities. One of the biggest projects involves a new passenger terminal, to be undertaken by the Ministry of Public Works. The project is still in the tendering process. Once completed, it will accommodate up to 25 million passengers in the first stage. We at the DGCA are taking on another project that involves renewing the two existing runways and constructing a third, as well as a new air control tower. There will be new taxiways as well, and even a new cargo city at the airport. These are huge and highly anticipated projects.</p><h4>Where do you see room for improvement within Kuwait's civil aviation sector, and what are your priorities at the Directorate?</h4><p>Over the next 10 years, our task is to deal with this anticipated growth. Air transport and traffic are forecast to grow at least 6% annually. One of our priorities is to create a company that will be charged with the management and operation of Kuwait International Airport. This is based on the premise that an independent company can act in a more flexible and commercially viable manner under the supervision of the DGCA.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for further investment from the private sector to meet these growing demands?</h4><p>The private sector has ample opportunities to participate in these development projects, and also in offering services at Kuwait International Airport, such as handling and passenger services. The company we will create to manage Kuwait International Airport will be able to sign and make contracts and agreements with other airport operators and service providers, so they will have access to international expertise in terms of managing the airport.</p><h4>How do cooperation agreements like the open skies policy contribute to Kuwait's economic growth and enhance cooperation in the region and internationally?</h4><p>The open skies policy is a base for us to expand our bilateral air transport relationships with other countries. We have witnessed an increase in the number of airlines serving our airport, around 45 international carriers in all. Also, Kuwait International Airport is linked to an expanded network of expanded networks, and that brings more choices for passengers to select suitable air transport carriers. It also brings reduced airfares due to increased competition, which is to the advantage of the passenger. When airlines increase their operations at any airport, it contributes to the national economy, as airlines pay charges and fees to the airport, they buy catering for flights, they buy fuel, and they pay for office rental and services at the airport.</p><h4>What message would you give the business community in terms of how the DGCA is supporting air traffic growth?</h4><p>We are supporting that growth, and we think there will be more opportunities for business investors to come here and utilize these opportunities in the construction and navigational equipment projects we have at hand, as well as services projects that we will also be offered at Kuwait International Airport. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led you to focus Lulua Publishing on the themes of personal growth and empowerment?</h4><p>I have been reading self-help for years, since before it became fashionable, and it helped me transform my life for the better. Looking at what was available to the Arab world, I started Lulua Publishing solely with a magazine. A lot of what is available in Arabic is not credible, and sometimes a little frivolous and superficial when it attempts to touch on self-help issues. It is not fair that people who cannot read in English don't have access to the best information, and I asked what I could do. I wanted to be able to give people credible information in their mother language because, though many people can speak English in this region, to read and comprehend something is different, especially content related to psychology and well-being. It is important sometimes to have your mother tongue to digest this information, and that is what we do. We only publish in Arabic because our target market is the Arabic readers. We had our first stand at the Kuwait Book Fair in 2015. We are actually the first publishing house in the Arab world that only publishes self-help, personal growth, and physical and emotional well-being content, and we are the only one that concentrates on inspirational publications.</p><h4>What trends are you seeing in publishing in this region?</h4><p>We predominantly work within the GCC, and we are seeing more and more inspirational publications coming into the market. The Kuwait and Saudi Arabia book fairs are the two largest in the region in terms of sales and attendance. The 2015 Kuwait Book Fair was bigger than in 2014, which is promising. Therefore, there is a growing trend. I disagree with anyone who says people do not read; they do, however their focus has changed. People still want to know what other people do, so biographies are still widely read, as well as novels. Content is moving toward triggering people's imagination, or their core being, whereas content about things such as history have slowed down. Poetry that invokes pleasure and self-help content is growing. Before the digital era, there were not as many opportunities to read; hence, people just devoured books and magazines, but now we have access to the internet to read online. People have become more selective about what they read. Audiences have also changed the focus of what they read. We all want to grow in one way or another, and so we either grow your heart, your soul, or both.</p><h4>Regarding Kuwait, what does the future hold for original content creation?</h4><p>We have many trainers, coaches, and people giving seminars and workshops, and they are able to make an excellent living out of it. We need to give them a little bit more time to be sure that what they are teaching has a long-term effect before we start using their content. Again, a lot of the content that they use was learned from the West; therefore, they have to adapt before we can say that it is really their content. In Lebanon, there is a more established track record. It is just at the beginning, and so there is still a lot of filtration. In three to five years, we will have many excellent writers coming out of this region. Right now, we have a 60:40 ratio of Western to local content. We started with a higher percentage of Western, which we were translating. We are seeing more and more local content and that is working well. We are able to find people now and are aiming for a 70:30 ratio in the near future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is EQUATE's “Partners in Success“ motto reflected in your business operations?</h4><p>Our slogan came from the clearly strong belief that the partnership between our shareholders is mutually beneficial, and we would like all parties to profit from the agreements we enter into. Our customers are also a key part of our business model, and we share their success, too. We are trying to create the feeling among our staff that each of us is a partner, and by creating this sense of ownership within the organization we are improving our productivity. We also treat our suppliers and contractors as our partners, because we know that if they do not deliver, then we do not succeed. We work with them, and that sustainable partnership is built into our model. In addition, our workforce represents the most important “Partners in Success“ in all elements relevant to EQUATE.</p><h4>What kind of growth have you seen in the Kuwaiti petrochemicals industry, and what have been some of the major developments in recent years?</h4><p>Locally, there is limited growth in the petrochemical industry at present, and we are not growing at the same pace as other countries in this region. In fact, we are falling behind. This is one of the challenges in Kuwait. We know the field is limited, but that should encourage us to be more innovative in finding ways to create partnerships. At the same time, while growth is limited, there are still opportunities, and media outlets have been highlighting plans by Kuwait Petroleum Corporation &amp; Subsidiaries for large ventures both locally and globally. These include the integrated refinery-petrochemical projects of Olefins III and Aromatics II in Kuwait. We, as EQUATE, want to and definitely can contribute an overall added value into the whole industry in Kuwait and beyond.</p><h4>What are some of your key projects that you expect to be of high impact?</h4><p>We are pursuing the ongoing debottlenecking project at our polyethylene (PE) plant, which hopefully will be completed during 2016. Our current capacity of polyethylene is 825,000 tpy, and we are working to reach nearly 1 million tpy once the project is completed. The project will give us an additional capability of over 150 bpd, depending upon available feed. At the very least we are hoping for at least half of this. We will be in a good position by the middle of next year to deliver the products. We are also focused on environmental projects that target the reduction of carbon emissions in our industrial operations by re-using Co2. Protecting the environment is one of our strategic objectives and part of our goal to achieve further sustainability within and outside of Kuwait. More than ever, we see companies moving away from using Co2-derived fossil fuel, and instead moving toward more environmentally friendly Co2 produced from capturing off-gas that would otherwise go into the atmosphere. As we are focused on making environmentally sound business decisions, we have launched two Co2 recovery projects, which are the first of their kind in Kuwait. In addition, we have also launched the Middle East's first plant water recycling project.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the company and for Kuwait's petrochemicals industry in 2016?</h4><p>For the petrochemical industry, 2016 will be a year of gradual recovery from the dip it experienced earlier, which started toward the end of 2014, although certain challenges still need to be addressed. We positioned EQUATE to be resilient and to maintain the ability to work in different environments and pursue opportunities in the face of prevailing challenges. The petrochemical industry will be in a better position in 2016, and the market will be more attractive. Our productivity will increase, as we will hopefully finalize our PE debottlenecking project and increase our overall production. All of this, however, is contingent on having a sufficient volume of feedstock for our operations. We are seeking to bring extra value to the market at the latest by 2H2016. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does PIC play in Kuwait's oil and gas sector, and  the overall economy?</h4><p>We are the petrochemical industry arm of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), one of eight subsidiary companies of the corporation. The subsidiary companies operate both in upstream exploration and the production of oil and gas, as well as further downstream petrochemical refinement all the way to direct sales of gasoline to consumers. PIC makes significant contributions to Kuwait's economy, through our own operations and through the operations of our nine joint ventures. Currently, 70% of the petrochemical products in the PIC portfolio are produced in Kuwait. The main chemical products include fertilizers, olefins, and aromatics. As one of KPC's downstream subsidiaries, we use feedstocks such as ethane and naphtha to make olefins and aromatics. These petrochemical products are used even further downstream in markets as diverse as agriculture, textiles, plastics, paints, cosmetics, transportation, and many other areas. Including our joint ventures, we have operations in five countries, and we are looking to expand to India, China, and the US. These joint ventures are key to our growth strategy, enabling us to diversify our product offers and leading to expansion into global markets. PIC now has a marketing presence in nearly every region of the world. EQUATE is an example of the scale and reach of our joint ventures. EQUATE is a joint venture with PIC, The Dow Chemical Company, Boubyan Petrochemical Company, and Qurain Petrochemical Industries Company. Its world-scale manufacturing facility produces annually almost 5 million tons of petrochemicals such as polyethylene, ethylene, and ethylene glycol, which are sold throughout the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Europe. </p><h4>In what way is PIC investing in Kuwait, and which areas show the highest potential for returns?</h4><p>PIC primarily engages in R&amp;D through our joint ventures. When developing a new business or plant, we favor joint ventures with companies that have considerable R&amp;D experience. It is important that when we enter into agreements with companies, we include clauses about possible future collaboration on R&amp;D innovation. We also participate in KPC-sponsored R&amp;D activities. We sit on the KPC Solar Energy committee. We hope to contribute to the Kuwaiti objective of having 15% of domestic energy consumption come from renewable energy. Part of the mission of KPC and PIC is to add value to hydrocarbons in Kuwait. Gas or naphthalene as a feedstock may be worth $800 per ton. If we convert those feedstocks into petrochemicals, their worth can increase nearly threefold. Our Kuwaiti operations specialize in olefins, aromatics, and fertilizer. We are investing in two major projects: Olefins III and Aromatics II. Integrating these facilities with the Al-Zour refinery is in a prefeasibility study stage. This is a collaborative effort with KNPC. We anticipate this operation will add approximately 2 million tons a year to our output.</p><h4>What is the outlook for the long-term demand of petrochemical products?</h4><p>Over the coming decades, petrochemicals will continue to play a significant role in meeting the demand for consumer products among a growing middle class. The majority of this demand growth will be in the developing world, and our location in the Middle East positions us well to serve fast-growing markets in Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe. More and more, we are also seeing petrochemicals play a vital role in achieving sustainability goals. Plastics are being used to replace components in cars that traditionally were made from steel. Plastics make cars lighter, and lighter cars tend to require less fuel. PIC is on a journey to become a global player in petrochemicals. We will continue to invest in petrochemical growth, as we also continue to seek ways to make our operations more environmentally sound. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does KPI play in the international strategy for Kuwait's oil?</h4><p>Within the K-companies under the umbrella of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), KPI is classified as the international arm for KPC for downstream business. KPC's structure contains both local and international downstream and upstream operations. The downstream business in Kuwait is under the charge of Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC), which takes care of the refining business in Kuwait, as well as gas operations, and also domestic marketing. In the upstream, we have Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) and Kuwait Gulf Oil Company (KGOC). Outside Kuwait, we have two companies, KPI and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (KUFPEC). KUFPEC mainly deals with the upstream production side, gas operations, and production, and KPI deals with the downstream business, mainly refining and marketing operations. We also have Petrochemicals Industries Company (PIC), which deals with petrochemicals inside and outside of Kuwait, but PIC will join KPI to do an integrated project among the refineries. Historically, we were mainly a European operation, with KPC doing its own business development, but recently all the business development departments joined KPI, and now we are no longer a European company, but a global downstream company. </p><h4>What investments in R&amp;D are going to be of high impact for the sector, and what are your own R&amp;D investments?</h4><p>We have Q8Research, our own R&amp;D center in Rotterdam, and we are trying to improve and widen our activities, especially relating to refining fuel and lube operations. Our R&amp;D center in Rotterdam is one of the most important centers in Europe, especially in the lube industry. They handle more than 1,000 specialty products, concentrating more and more in lube. We are now present in more than 60 countries as Q8Oils, and we are trying to reach new markets with support from our R&amp;D center. The center does not just provide support for KPI but for all K-companies, especially in downstream. We have programs with our sister companies for training and also for collaborative research and other R&amp;D activities.</p><h4>How can the R&amp;D environment in Kuwait become more prominent and effective?</h4><p>We would like to create a major R&amp;D center in Kuwait. In addition to the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research Petroleum Research Center (KPRC), we will have our own, supported by KPI. It will be mainly in downstream, but with complete upstream and downstream petrochemicals activity. We feel that increasing operations here and in the region will need a major research center like this behind it. It is no longer as simple as it used to be. It is time for heavy crude and other difficult types of crude in the upstream side, handling water activities in the upstream, and also about things becoming more complicated in the downstream, especially with the complex refining system we have here in Kuwait, which requires a large R&amp;D and support center to maintain it. </p><h4>Looking at the next three years, what are the main objectives for Q8 and what would you like to achieve moving forward?</h4><p>We have a 2030 Strategy that has been approved by KPC, and we are working in accordance with that strategy, which involves strengthening our position in the world. We have a solid presence throughout the world. In Europe, we have over 5,000 stations and about 70 airports in 20 countries. On the lube side, we are present in almost every part of Europe. Therefore, we seek to ensure that our operations remain efficient and that we maintain a competitive position in Europe. In Asia, we are growing in refining and petrochemicals, and we are also planning to grow in terms of retail stations, jet fuel supplies, and lube operations, in addition to the megaprojects in refining and petrochemicals. We hope to complete our project in Vietnam and then look into similar projects in other Asian countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the primary objectives of Kuwait Energy and how would you describe its investment strategy in the region?</h4><p>Kuwait Energy aims to become the preeminent Middle East-based independent oil and gas company. It hopes to develop and manage oil and gas assets in the interest of our stakeholders. Our strategy is simple: to leverage our technical expertise, local knowledge, and solid relationships to enhance our operations in the region and always ensuring that we have a win-win relationship with the host government. When it comes to operations, we actively manage and operate our assets while prudently managing financial risk through a conservative capital structure.  Our knowledge of the Middle East, and operational experience in the region, enable us to have an advantage in terms of operational planning, project execution and risk management.</p><h4>Could you talk about the unique access Kuwait Energy has through its strong relations with national oil and gas companies and local governments in the region?</h4><p>We provide valuable technical expertise, advice, and assistance to the national oil and gas companies and local governments on oil and gas projects that are important to these countries' economic development. In Yemen, we have been working closely with the Yemen Ministry of Oil and Minerals, studying the potential development of natural gas reserves in Yemen and the optimization of the country's natural gas resources for the benefit of its people, while developing a long-term Yemen Gas Master Plan. We advise the Ministry on the most suitable uses and applications for the country's gas resources in order to ensure production sustainability and maximize revenue generation and job creation. As for Egypt, we acted as the catalyst behind the recent agreement with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) from which it gained a 10% participating interest in Block 9, Iraq. This is EGPC's first international investment and contributed to building an economic relationship between Iraq and Egypt. We go beyond business and operations when it comes to our relationships with local governments, and become their support in difficult times. For example in Egypt, during the revolution in 2011, we were more understanding of the country's tough financial circumstances, and ensured that we support the country during those tough times. This was received favorably by the EGPC, as we proved that one of our main goals as a company is to become true partners in the economic development of the countries where we work. In Iraq, we support the local government by providing relief aid to the internally displaced people (IDP) that have moved to the Basra region. In December 2014, we provided complete relief aid to the IDPs in Basra and during Ramadan we provided food bags to 2,500 families.</p><h4>What growth opportunities do you see for oil and gas development in the MENA region?</h4><p>Currently, we have large-scale projects in Iraq: the Siba gas project and Block 9, located in Southern Iraq. In accordance with our plans, we are allocating great effort and finances to fast-track the projects and bring them to existing infrastructure to ramp up and accelerate our production in Iraq in the near term. Once we bring more production on stream, the time will be right to go and target our next growth opportunity to create further value for stakeholders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some important transactions and acquisitions by KUFPEC in recent years and how would you describe the company's current position?</h4><p>KUFPEC is firmly heading toward its 2030 strategy of reaching 200,000 bpd compared to its current 70,000 bpd production, increasing its reserve base to 650 million barrels, and increasing its operatorship to 20% by 2030.  KUFPEC is confident that it is a valuable subsidiary to Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), providing its sister companies, such as Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) and Kuwait Gulf Oil Company (KGOC), a significant role in upstream technology transfer, best practice initiatives, and exploration and production know-how. KUFPEC entered two promising and large projects in 2014 as part of achieving the 2030 strategy. The first was doubling our equity stake in the Wheatstone LNG project in Australia. This transaction will further add to our material production that expects to receive its first gas in 2017.  Furthermore, the Wheatstone project is a strategic element not only for KUFPEC, but also its parent company, KPC, providing priority to KPC to be supplied with Wheatstone LNG if required, meeting at least 10% of KPC's energy needs in the long term.  KUFPEC's second large transaction in 2014 was entering a joint venture with Chevron in the Kaybob region of the Duvernay shale play in Alberta, Canada. This large transaction provides KUFPEC with substantial material production for decades to come, adding an estimated 25% of our overall production by 2030, thereby securing the future of KUFPEC.  </p><h4>How has the drop in oil prices impacted your operations?</h4><p>The price collapse we witnessed at the end of 2014 caused serious repercussions for KUFPEC's balance sheet. Having said that, it is with pride that we achieved a net profit of $40 million, surpassing our entire peer group who had all shown losses for 2014 due to oil prices remaining low. We are seeing the new norm in price terms for the foreseeable future, and a quick snap back to higher prices such as the $100 we saw in 2014 is unexpected for the time being. With the price of oil down, costs have also deflated, creating an opportunity to execute our strategy by entering new acquisitions and core business opportunities in the coming years.</p><h4>What is your approach to investing in human capital, and particularly to attracting Kuwaiti employees to KUFPEC?</h4><p>KUFPEC's most valuable investment is its people and its employees.  Our successful investment is due to our competent, qualified, and successful team. KUFPEC invests heavily in developing professional career paths for our younger employees, and encourages its people to spend time working for KUFPEC in our offices and operations. The opportunity to develop and grow our human capital is necessary, since KUFPEC will ultimately be running more and more projects that we will operate in the near future.  The Kuwait oil sector has always been an attractive employer and the industry of choice for young Kuwaitis, not only for petroleum related engineers but also for financial and legal backgrounds as well.  Such employees are driven to work internationally and are bilingual.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>2016 will be an extremely busy year for KUFPEC, with the final progress for completion of the Wheatstone project leading the way.  We expect also to increase our production level, with more operatorship activities.  We will do all of this by first developing and empowering our employees to solidify KUFPEC as a partner of choice in the International E&amp;P business. </p>]]></richbody0content>
